Institution The University of Kentucky was founded in 1865 as the \"Kentucky State Agricultural and Mechanical College\" a part of Kentu cky University (now Transylvania University, Lexington, Kentucky). In 1878, the College was separated from Kentucky University under the land grant provision of the federal Morrill Land-Grant College Act of 1862 and established on a 50-acre site donated by the city of Lexington. In 1908, the College was renamed the State University, Lexington, Kentucky, and in 1916, it became the University of Kentucky. The Albert B. Chandler Medical Center was created in 1956, and the Colleges of Medicine, Dentis try, and Nursing were established. The Colleges of Allied Health Professions and Pharmacy were added in 1966 and a School of Public Health was added in 2000. In 1964, development of a statewide community college system was initiated as part of the University. In 1982, the University was organized into three chancellor -lead sectors, the Medical Center, the Lexington Campus, and the Community Colleges, together with a Central Administration. On July 1, 2011, Eli Capilouto DMD, ScD became the 12th president of the University of Kentucky (UK). President Capilouto has led the process to enrich UK's academic experience by investing in priorities that maintain affordability and access; support the institution's talented faculty and staff; and revitalize the living, learning and research facilities across campus. Even during a pandemic, UK has been able to continue efforts for a significant physical transformation of its academic, research, residential, health care and community spaces. Through partnership, increased philanthropy and effective financial management, UK is self -financing the vast majority of its more than $2 billion infrastructure development. Under President Capilouto's leadership, the $3.7 billion flagship and land grant research University has gained significant momentum in fulfilling its multi -faceted mission of teaching, research, service, and health care. UK developed a new strategic plan with input from the entire c ampus for the years 2020-2025. Today, the University of Kentucky supports more than 30,000 students in over 200 academic programs integrated in 16 degree- granting colleges, the Lewis Honors College, the Graduate School, and the UK Library system. The Univ ersity offers 88 bachelor's level, 93 master's level and more than 60 doctoral, specialist and professional degree programs. Students may select from programs in Agriculture, Allied Health Professions, Architecture, Arts and Sciences, Business and Economic s, Communications and Information Studies, Education, Engineering, Fine Arts, Human Environmental Sciences and Social Work. In addition, many students may select from professional programs in Dentistry, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy and Public Health. On a national level, UK has consistently ranked among the top 60 to 70 institutions based on total federal obligations, and currently ranks 30th in the country in National Institutes of Health research funding among public institutions. In 1987 and 1994, the University of Kentucky was classified as a Research I institution by the Carnegie Foundation; it is currently ranked 32nd among public research institutions in the nation. To date, the University has received nearly 100 national rankings for excellence in academics, research, health care, and economic development. U.S. News and World Report ranks several of UK's graduate programs among the nation's best, including Business Administration, Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Economics, Nursing, Pharm acy, Physical Therapy and Public Policy. Academic Medical Center and UK Healthcare Responding to warnings that the state would face a serious shortage of medical caregivers in the near future, Kentucky legislators authorized the construction of a medical center at the University of Kentucky in 1956. The new facility would provide state- of-the-art care to all Kentucky residents, regardless of their ability to pay. Progressive Kentuckians who had lobbied for a new hospital and medical school for several deca des saw the legislators' decision to fund the project as a great victory for the state. When dignitaries convened on a farm bordering the University campus for the groundbreaking ceremony in December 1957, then University President Frank Dickey acknowledged the significance of the event, declaring it a \"never to be forgotten day\" in Kentucky's history. ii The UK Healthcare (UKHC) clinical enterprise is the umbrella organization for the UK Medical Center (UKMC), with over 9,000 employees serving the most critically injured and ill patients in the Commonwealth and beyond in over 1,000 beds at Albert B. Chandler Hospital, the UK Children's Hospital, UK Samaritan Hospital, Eastern State Hospital, and multiple ambulatory clinics. With nearly 4 0,000 discharges in 2019, Albert B. Chandler Hospital includes the only Level 1 Trauma Center for both adult and pediatric patients in Central and Eastern Kentucky. UKMC also includes the Colleges of Nursing, Medicine, Dentistry, Health Sciences, Pharmacy, Public Health and Social Work. In addition, UKHC is closely affiliated with the Veteran's Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). The VAMC has two locations: the Cooper Drive division, which is physically linked to the Albert B. Chandler Hospital, houses the acute medical, psychiatric, surgical and neurological units, intensive care units and numerous specialty clinics; and the Leestown division, which houses the long -term units. UKMC and VAMC share resources such as medical equipment, and many physicians hold join t appointments at both institutions. The College of Nursing Dr. Marcia Dake, the first Dean of the College of Nursing (1960- 1971), came to the University of Kentucky with a vision to inspire faculty to create innovative programs that would serve as a model for higher education in nursing. Enrollment for BSN education more than doubled from 35 in 1960 to 74 in 1962, and in 1970 an MSN program was opened. Deans that followed continued to prepare thousands of nurses; men and women to lead as caregivers, educators, researchers, policymakers, community transformers and executive leaders. Dr. Marion A. McKenna (1971 to 1984) and Dr. Carolyn A. Williams (1984 to 2006) established doctoral programs (PhD in 1987; the first DNP in the country in 2001) and Dr. Jane Kirschling (2006 to 2012) established the first interprofessional health education programming for the University of Kentucky. In 2014, Janie Heath, PhD, APRN -BC, FAAN, FNAP, FAANP, was appointed the sixth Dean of the College of Nursing (CON), and continues to build on hallmarks of academic excellence through education, practice, service and research. She is actively engaged with UKHC, the UK Center for Interprofessional Health Education (CIHE) and numerous academic clinical partners in the Commonwealth and beyond to assure that the CON meets the needs of those it serves. In Dean Heath's first three years, the CON developed a new s trategic plan in conjunction with the new UK strategic plan, as well as reviewed and revised the mission, vision, and values statements. She also reorganized the CON administrative academic structure by adding developmental leadership roles, securing funding to expand and renovate research space, and increasing undergraduate and graduate enrollment, academic clinical partnerships, faculty practice agreements and program outreach initiatives. In 2020, the CON became designated as one of the Na tional League of Nursing (NLN) Centers for Nursing Education Excellence for initiatives that impact four -degree programs (BSN, MSN, DNP and PhD) and post - graduate APRN certificate. The baccalaureate program has been accredited by CCNE since 1999, the DNP since 2009 and the MSN and post -master's certificates are under review for 2021. The CON received recognition of \"distinction\" as a provider of continuing nursing education by the American Nurses Credentialing Center's Commission on Accreditation 2015- 2020. The CON has a current enrollment of 813 BSN students, 483 Pre-Nursing students, 15 MSN students, 28 PhD students, 157 DNP students and 16 Post -Graduate APRN Certificate students. Currently, 68 full- time faculty and/or faculty administrators are employed in the CON, of whom 85% (58) have an earned doctorate, 29% (20) serve in an active faculty practice and 37% (25) are honored as fellows in various societies/organizations. Administrative Organization The Dean of the College reports to the Provost of the University. The CON's administrative structure includes the Dean, Senior Associate Dean, Associate Dean of Undergraduate Faculty and Interprofessional HealthCare Education (IPE) Affairs, Associate Dean for the MSN, DNP and Post-Graduate APRN Certif icate Faculty and Practice Affairs, Associate Dean of Research and PhD Faculty Affairs, Associate Dean of Executive Administrative Operations and Finance and six assistant deans as reflected in Table 1 College of Nursing Organizational Chart. Each degree- offering program has an Assistant Dean to help support the respective Associate Dean's responsibilities in selected areas such as program growth, curricular innovation, student learning, clinical affairs, and faculty scholarly affairs. All full -time faculty are evaluated by an Associate Dean and are assigned to work closely with an Assistant Dean based on the program of study in which they have their primary teaching assignment. iii Table 1: College of Nursing Organizational Chart As illustrated in Table 1: CON Organizational Chart shows the integration of executive- level management with UKHC. There are congruent lines of communication between the CON Dean and the UKHC Chief Nurse Executive, and the UKHC Executive Vice President for Health affairs. Likewise, the CON Dean is included in the organizational chart for UK Health care Nursing as a top -level administrator. UKHC Nursing Organizational Chart available in the Virtual Resource Room . The UKHC Chief Nurse Executive regularly attends the CON Faculty Organization meetings to provide updates that could impact the CON. Self-Study Process All full-time faculty, professional staff, administrators, and key clinical/community partners participated in the self -study process. Undergraduate and graduate students were engaged in the self -study process through representation on academic program committees and/or student governance committees/advisory boards. The process began in 2018, with an official launch in August 2019 with the Dean, Associate and Assistant Deans' retreat to review the intent of the self -study process, as a part of the College's approach to on -going and continuous quality improvement. Monthly meetings have continued to assure completion of the self-study. Data presented in the self -study relate to academic years 2017 -2018, 2018 -2019, 2019- 2020, and fall, 2020. Data for spring 2021 are available upon request as appropriate. 1 Standard I Program Quality: Mission and Governance The mission, goals, and expected program outcomes are congruent with those of the parent institution, reflect professional nursing standards and guidelines, and consider the needs and expectations of the community of interest. Policies of the parent institution and nursing program clearly support the program' s mission, goals, and expected outcomes. The faculty and students of the program are involved in the governance of the program and in the ongoing efforts to improve program quality. I-A. The mission, goals, and expected program outcomes are: congruent wit h those of the parent institution; and reviewed periodically and revised as appropriate Elaboration: The program's mission, goals, and expected program outcomes are written and accessible to current and prospective students, faculty, and other constituents. Program outcomes include student outcomes, faculty outcomes, and other outcomes identified by the program. The mission may relate to all nursing programs offered by the nursing unit, or specific programs may have separate missions. Program goals are clearly differentiated by level when multiple degree/certificate programs exist. Expected program outcomes may be expressed as competencies, objectives, benchmarks, or other terminology congruent with institutional and program norms. There is a defined process for periodic review and revision of program mission, goals, and expected program outcomes that has been implemented, as appropriate. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element The mission, goals and expected program outcomes of the College of Nursing (CON) are congruent with those of the parent institution, University of Kentucky (UK), as reflected in Table IA -1: Congruency between the Missions of UK and the CON. The CON mission and values are reviewed every five years or as needed to be consistent with UK. The faculty organization reviews and approves any indicated changes. The Mission of UK is a public land-grant university dedicated to improving peoples' lives through excellence in education, research and creative work, service and health care. As Kentucky's flagship institution, the University plays a critical leadership role by promoting diversity, inclusion, economic development, and human well-being. The CON Mission is to promote health and well -being through excellence in nursing e ducation, research, practice and service while fostering diversity and inclusion. The CON values statement is to promote a healthy learning and working environment to ensure a high l evel of professionalism, civility, and caring among students, staff, and faculty. Table 1A -1: Congruency between the Mission of UK and CON UK UK CON The University of Kentucky is a public, land grant University dedicated to improving peoples' lives through excellence in education, research and creative work, service, and health care. As Kentucky's flagship institution, the University plays a critical leadership role by promoting diversity, inclusion, economic development, and human well -being. The U niversity of Kentucky: Facilitates learning, informed by scholarship and research. Expands knowledge through research, The mission of the University of Kentucky College of Nursing is to p romote health and well -being through excellence in nursing education, research, practice, and service while fostering diversity and inclusion. The College of Nursing will be one of the nation's top nursing programs in education, research, practice, and service. 2 scholarship, and creative activity; and Serves a global community by disseminating, sharing, and applying knowledge. The University contributes to the economic development and quality of life within Kentucky's borders and beyond, nurturing a diverse community characterized by fairness and equal opportunity. U Unique and innovative contributions to healthcare K Knowledge and evidence- based practice C Collaborative and diverse learning environments O Open and respectful relationships N Nursing leadership and recognition The mission and expected program learning outcomes of the nursing programs are related to the mission and goals of UK and the CON. Development of student outcomes has been guided by the mission and goals of UK and the CON, as well as nationally -recognized competencies. The goals and expected student outcomes are published annually in the CON's Student Handbooks and are available on the CON website. The professional standards, guidelines, and competencies that guide the educational programs of the CON were chosen because they reflect the best and most contemporary thinking and represen t the views of an increasingly diverse practice discipline and public; these are listed in Table IB-1: Selected Standards, Guidelines and Competencies. The mission, goals and expected student outcomes of the CON are reviewed according to the timeline outlined in the CON Systematic Process for Program Effectiveness (SPPE) . The SPPE was developed as an assessment guide for administrators, program directors, course coordinators and faculty as they periodically conduct formative and summative systematic program evaluations. The plan was designed in a format that would assure compliance with CCNE standards, Kentucky Board of Nursing requirements, and the Strategic Plan goals. It also identifies who is responsible, where the data can be found and the timeline for evaluation. The CON mission, goals, and expected student outcomes are reviewed as each new UK strategic plan is proposed and at other times as needed to improve educational preparation for graduates. For example, reviews were implemented when professional nursing standards changed so that the AACN -revised Essentials were incorporated into the curricula. Also, the mission, goals, and expected student outcomes are reviewed when there is a major change in UK requirements, such as the recent UK Core (General Education) changes. The mission and goals were approved in 2015. The mission and goals were reaffirmed by the faculty prior to beginning the work on the CON strategic plan in 2018. I-B. The mission, goals, and expected program outcomes are consis tent with relevant professional nursing standards and guidelines for the preparation of nursing professionals. Elaboration: The program identifies the professional nursing standards and guidelines it uses. CCNE requires, as appropriate, the following professional nursing standards and guidelines: The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice [American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), 2008]; The Essentials of Master's Education in Nursing (AACN, 2011); The Essentials of Doctoral Education for Advanced Nursing Practice (AACN, 2006); and Criteria for Evaluation of Nurse Practitioner Programs [National Task Force on Quality Nurse Practitioner Edu cation (NTF), 2016]. A program may select additional standards and guidelines that are current and relevant to program offerings. A program preparing students for certification incorporates professional standards and guidelines appropriate to the role/area of education. An APRN education program (degree or certificate) prepares students for one of the four APRN roles and in at least one population focus, in accordance with the Consensus Model for APRN Regulation: 3 Licensure, Accreditation, Certification and Education (July 2008). Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. The CON has incorporated Professional Nursing Standards and Guidelines (PNSG) into the BSN, MSN, and DNP programs. Table IB -1: Selected Standards, Guidelines and Competencies , lists selected key professional nursing standards and guidelines the CON follows for the preparation of nursing professionals. The commitment to professional standards is evident in the mission, values, and program outcomes of the CON. The CON works to instill the importan ce of the professional standards across all programs. The BSN program comprises three BSN tracks, including: (1) four -year Traditional; (2) Accelerated Second Degree (ABSN); and (3) RN -BSN Online. The MSN program is organized into one area of concentration (Healthcare Systems Leadership). The DNP (BSN- to-DNP or MSN- to-DNP) program comprises seven including: (1) Adult Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner; (2) Family Nurse Practitioner; (3) Pediatric Acute Care Nurse Practitioner; (4) Pediatric Primary Care Nurse Practitioner; (5) Psychiatric -Mental Health Nurse Practitioner; (6) Executive Leadership in Health Care; and (7) Clinical Leadership in Health Care. Our Post -Graduate APRN Certificate program comprises six areas, including: (1) Adult Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner; (2) Family Nurse Practitioner; (3) Pediatric Acute Care Nurse Practitioner; (4) Pediatric Primary Care Nurse Practitioner; (5) Psychiatric -Mental Health Nurse Practitioner; and (6) Executive Leadership in Healthcare Certificate. Evidence includes the requirement for DNP students being asked to include exemplars that address each of the program outcomes on their portfolios.

(Crosswalk Available in the Virtual Resource Room) I-C. The mission, goals, and expected program outcomes reflect the needs and expectations of the community of interest. Elaboration: The community of interest is defined by the nursing unit. The needs and expectations of the community of interest are considered in the periodic review of the mission, goals, and expected program outcomes. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. The CON Community of Interest (COI) is defined as both internal and external entities which directly or indirectly interface with the CON. The COI includes students, staff, faculty of the CON, alumni, Emeriti faculty and staff, Dean's Advisory Board, Dean's Diversity and Inclusivity Advisory Board, College of Nursing Alumni Association, benefactors, and supporters. The Dean's Advisory Board meets biannually with the stated purpose of providing counsel to the D ean on critical matters as well as long -range planning and philanthropic endeavors. As illustrated in Table 1C -1: Dean's Advisory Board , membership is comprised of alumni, supporters and students who collectively represent a diverse and comprehensive expertise and will serve as an advocacy network and as ambassadors for the College of Nursing, increasing awareness of the College in Kentucky and across the nation. In addition, the CON Dean works closely with University administration and UK Healthcare administration to align institutional goals, budget expectations and academic clinical agreements. Faculty provide feedback through surveys and participation in the CON Faculty Organization, CON standing committees, and Dean task force meetings. Input from the student community of interest is ascertained through several venues, which include representation on CON standing committees, graduating students' CON End-of-Program Survey and Dean's Advisory Board. Alumni provide feedback to the CON through a variety of ways: (1) the CON Alumni Association meetings; (2) the CON and UK HealthCare Academic Practice Quarterly Committee Meetings to respond to their level satisfaction or concerns related to educational preparation; and 5 (3) Dean's Advisory Boards, speak on industry topics, and have opportunities to gather at regional alumni events. These activities allow alumni to stay connected to the school, provide feedback on the types of program they are interested in, inform current students o n industry changes, and have a sense of community with fellow nursing alumni.

As reflected in Table 1C- 2: Dean's Diversity and Inclusivity Advisory Board , membership includes faculty , students, UK employees outside the CON, and community members, both nurses and non -nurses, as selected by the Dean. The Board meets biannually and as needed. 6 Table 1C -2: Dean's Diversity and Inclusivity Advisory Board Name Title Agency Mr. Terry Allen UK alumni and Associate VP for Institutional Equity University of Kentucky Ms. Lajava Chenault CON alumni and VP of Nursing - Retired Saint Joseph Hospital Ms. Danielle Duncan BSN Student CON Ms. Brittany Fiero Co-Chair, Diversity, and Inclusivity Ambassadors Council and CON Recruitment Coordinator CON Ms. Corinna Hughes CON alumni and DNP Student CON Mr. Trummell Ikard Staff Nurse Baptist Health Lexington Dr. Ana Maria Linares CON Associate Professor CON Mr. Carlos Marin UK Assistant Dean for Community and Cultural Engagement UK Healthcare College of Medicine Ms. Rosa Martin CON Research Program Director Heart of the Family Project CON Dr. Evelyn Parrish CON alumni, Associate Professor and Chair, Diversity, and Inclusivity Ambassadors Council CON Mr. Ruben Perez Worksite Wellness Coordinator Lexington -Fayette County Health Department Dr. Lance Poston UK Executive Director of Inclusive Health and Campus Partnerships and LGBTQ Resources University of Kentucky Dr. Michael Rowland UK Associate Dean Faculty Affairs UK College of Medicine Dr. Tukea Talbert CON alumni and Chief Diversity Officer UK Healthcare The purposes of the Alumni Association Board are to promote the best interests and welfare of the CON, to inform the membership of the progress and needs of their Alma Mater as well as the work and services of the University and the CON to the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the nation, and to encourage loyalty to the Universi ty and the CON through closer bonds of fellowship among its alumni. The Board of Directors meets biannually in addition to annually during the University's Homecoming weekend with the membership. I-D. The nursing unit's expectations for faculty are written and communicated to the faculty and are congruent with institutional expectations Elaboration : Expectations for faculty are congruent with those of the parent institution. The nursing unit's expectations for faculty, whether in teaching, scholarship, service, practice, or other areas, may vary for different groups of faculty (full -time, part -time, adjunct, tenured, non-tenured, or other). Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key El ement. Faculty members are defined in the UK Administrative Regulations according to title series of appointment. Expected faculty outcomes within these definitions are consistent with the expectations of UK. Faculty members' expectations regarding teaching, scholarship, service, or practice vary according to their title 7 series. The CON follows the University's administrative rules and uses the following title series: Lecture Title Series (non -tenure; faculty outcomes primarily focused on meeting UK goals and student outcomes related to teaching); Clinical Title Series (non -tenure; faculty outcomes primarily focused on meeting UK goals related to practice and student outcomes related to teaching); Research Title Series (non -tenure; faculty outcomes primarily focused on meeting UK goals related to scholarship and research); Special Title Series (tenure; faculty outcomes primarily focused on meeting UK goals related to practice, scholarship and service, and student outcomes related to teaching); and Regular Title Series (tenure; faculty outcomes primarily focused on meeting UK goals related to teaching, scholarship, research and service, and student outcomes related to teaching) (See CON Faculty Workload and CON Faculty Evaluation and Workload .) Currently, the CON criteria for appointment, promotion, and tenure remains in alignment for respective title series that are congruent with UK's and are provided in the UK Administrative Regulations . New facult y members participate in both UK and CON new faculty orientation throughout their first year to ensure that faculty member outcomes are congruent with the mission, goals and expected outcomes. Non -tenured faculty members are reviewed annually and tenured faculty and senior lecturers biannually with \"mini -reviews for progress on goals\" on alternating years, by their reporting supervisor. The review includes a requirement by faculty members to provide evidence that they are meeting the expectations o f their respective roles in the CON. Tenure- track faculty undergo a two - and four -year review that includes feedback from tenured faculty. Annually, faculty members negotiate their Distribution of Effort (DOE) in the areas of teaching, scholarship, service, and practice, as appropriate to their title series. The DOE process is University -driven, and the CON DOE process was revised in fall 2016 to ensure its major purpose accurately reflects the time faculty members spend meeting the mission and goals of UK and the CON (faculty exemplar available in the Virtual Resource Room) (See CON Facult y Workload and CON Faculty Evaluation and Workload .) The CON workload assignment for courses and student advising recognizes the time involved in supporting students to achieve the expected student learning and program outcomes. Periodic review and revision of academic programs, research and practice goals with expected student outcomes is the res ponsibility of each program -specific committee, and is guided by the CON Strategic Plan. I-E. Faculty and students participate in program governance. Elaboration: Roles of the faculty and students in the governance of the program, including those involved in distance education, are clearly defined, and promote participation. Nursing faculty are involved in the development, review, and revision of academic program policies. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. The CON faculty members and students participate in the mission and governance of the College and University in a manner that serves to maintain and improve the quality of progra ms of nursing. The CON has structured activities that provide dialogue that leads to continuous evaluation and revision of the nursing programs. The faculty and staff retreats have been successful in providing input into structural, programmatic, and informatics needs within the College. For example, opportunities for input were given to faculty and staff during the development of the 2015- 2020 CON strategic plan and the 2020- 2025 CON strategic plan. The UK Faculty Senate, as the UK-wide faculty organization, is authorized to issue rules implementing the responsibilities delegated to it and authorized by the Governing Regulations. The faculty, administrators and students of the CON participate in the governance of UK, UKHC and CON in accordance with Kentucky state law and the UK Governing Regulations. UK Senate Rules provide for the election of three faculty members from the CON to the UK Senate. In addition, each of the CON's faculty senators serve on a standing UK Senate subcommittee. In addition to informing faculty about Senate activities in faculty organizational meetings, faculty senators obtain input from the CON faculty through open forums or via email as a more timely way to disseminate information to faculty and receive input from faculty on matters for the Senate. Faculty also may participate in UK governance through appointment or election to UK Administrative Committees, other Senate Committees, and Senate Advisory Committees. Currently, faculty serve on multiple UK, UKHC and CON committees . The CON Dean meets with the UK President and Provost, along with the other Deans, at least quarterly 8 and the Provost meets with all Deans bimonthly. During the pandemic, it has been weekly. The purpose of these meetings is general communication regarding the academic aspects at UK. Since 1984, the Dean has participated in UK governance as an ex-officio member of the UK Senate with voting privileges every other year. The Associate Deans also serve various roles in University Governance. For example, the Associate Dean of Research is a member of the UK Research Management Group with the VP of Research, which meets monthly; the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Faculty and IPE Affairs is a member of the UK Center for Interprofess ional Health Education Committee; the Associate Dean for MSN and DNP Faculty and Practice Affairs is a member of the UK Press Committee, and the Executive Associate Dean for the Norton Healthcare Partnership is a member of the Norton Healthcare Nursing Leadership Institute. Faculty members participate in the governance of the CON as provided in the Faculty Bylaws and the Administrative Bylaws . Of the 68 full- time faculty, 85% participated on CON committees in 2020- 2021. The committees constituted by the Faculty Bylaws ensure faculty responsibility for curricular matters as well as admission, progression, and graduation of stu dents. The committees constituted by the Administrative Bylaws provide for faculty input into administrative decision -making in the areas of faculty appointment, promotion and tenure, college development, professional development, and student activities. The faculty as a whole meet at least three times each semester to act on matters affecting education, service, practice, and research. Faculty Organization meetings are led by the chair of the CON Faculty Council. The chair of Faculty Council, along with the Associate Deans, is a key member of the Dean's administrative leadership team. The Dean has provided an open forum to discuss various CON initiatives or challenges, including the impact of the decreased University budget on the CON, reviewing stra tegies to meet the CON's contribution to the University's cost savings plan and the mix of tenure- track and non-tenure track future hires. Since March 2020, the Dean has provided regularly -scheduled Zoom information sessions to disseminate the most recent COVID -19 information from the University as well as the CON's plan to maintain the safety and wellness of students, staff and faculty. Students have an opportunity to participate in the governance of the CON as outlined in the CON Administrative Bylaws and Faculty Bylaws . Undergraduate and graduate student activities and Advisory Committees are elected by their respective student bodies and provide formal feedback to administrators as well as faculty. Students of the CON have the same opportunities to participate in the governance of UK as do students in other units of the University. The primary vehicle for student participation is through each College's Student Government Associations, such as the Undergraduate Nursing Academic Advisory Council ( UNAAC ) and Graduate Nursing Academic Advisory Council (GNAAC ). Each year one student is elected from and by the CON's student body to the Student Government Association and by virtue of this position is also the student representative from the CON to the UK Senate . In addition, students serve on CON academic program committees and leadership from UNAAC and GNAAC serve on the Dean's advisory boards/councils. Students are elected by the CON undergraduate or graduate student body. Leadership for UNAAC includes representation on BSN program committees. Similarly, leadership for GNAAC includes representation on the MSN, DNP and PhD program committees. Undergraduate students also participate in scheduled course meetings throughout the academic year. Student representatives are elected by their classmates to be their representatives at course meetings. The representatives serve as a mechanism to communicate student concerns to faculty, and faculty responses to the students. In addition, the Dean invites randomly selected students to quarterly \"Teas with the Dean.\" These primarily focus on the student experience at UK, diversity and inclusivity, and wellness and belonging. I-F. Academic policies of the parent institution and the nursing program are congruent and support achievement of the mission, go als, and expected program outcomes. These policies are: fair and equitable; published and accessible; and reviewed and revised as necessary to foster program improvement. Elaboration: Academic policies include, but are not limited to, those related to student recruitment, admission, retention, and progression. Policies are written and communicated to relevant constituencies. Policies are implemented consistently. Differences between the nursing program policies and those of the parent institution are identified and support achievement of the program's mission, goals, and expected outcomes. A defined process exists by which policies are regularly reviewed. Policy review occurs, and revisions are made 9 as needed. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. CON academic policies are reviewed and revised as necessary to foster ongoing program improvement. The CON Bylaws and CON policies are available on the CON website and are congruent with UK policies and regulatory bodies such as CCNE and the Kentucky Board of Nursing. CON faculty are involved in the development, review, revision, and approval of academic program policies. Differences between the nursing program policies and those of the parent institution are in support of achievement of the program's mission, goals, and expected outcomes. The CON uses UK policies as a framework for developing specific CON policies; however, standards can be greater than the policies of the parent institution. Policies for the undergraduate students can be found in the Undergraduate Student Handbook and polices for the graduate s tudents can be found in the Graduate Student Handboo k. Policies are written and communicated to relevant constituencies via the website, email, and in- class announcements. Policies are implemented consistently by faculty and administrators in the CON. Policy review occurs and revisions are made as needed and on an annual basis. Student rights and responsibilities are published in the UK Student Rights and Responsibilities Handbook on the UK website. I-G. The program defines and reviews formal complaints according to established policies. Elaboration: The program defines what constitutes a formal complaint and maintains a record of formal complaints received. The program's definition of formal complaints includes, at a minimum, student complaints. The program's definition of formal complaints and the procedures for filing a complaint are communicated to relevant constituencies. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. The CON follows the policies and procedures of the University regarding resolving student complaints. The CON defines a formal complaint as one which cannot be resolved within the academic unit and CON. Between Fall 2017-2020, there have been two formal complaints by undergraduate students and no formal complaints by graduate students. Within the CON, student issues are directed to the involved party. For example, if students have a concern about a grade in a course or an assignment, they are directed to the course instructor and then to the course coordinator, if applicable. If the issue is not resolved, the student can appeal to the Associate Dean and Assistant Dean of the program in which they are enrolled. If the issue remains unresolved, the student has the option of meeting with the Dean. In addition, all BSN clinical courses have a course representative that can speak about issues on behalf of other students in the course. All students are given access to the online UK Students Rights and Responsibilities and the CON Undergraduate and Graduate Student Handbooks , which contain the necessary policies and procedures for filing a complaint. Formal complaints that cannot be resolved in the CON are directed to the UK Office of Academic Ombudsman Services, which is designated within UK to investigate individual complaints, problems, and conflicts. The Ombud is responsible for assisting students and faculty to work through and resolve academic problems and conflicts. As stated on the website, the primary focus of the academic Ombud services is the process by which decisions are made, and the primary task of the Ombud is to assure fair policies, processes, and procedures that are equitably implemented. Over the past three and half years, the UK Ombud was instrumental in assisting four CON students in resolutions that did not involve a formal UK appeals process, as shown in Table IG -1: Academic Appeals to Ombudsman. (See RR for UK Appeals Process and UK Appeals Board Report . One student complaint, in fall 2019, went through the formal UK appeals process (evidence only available through UK legal). There are currently no CON complaints pending in the UK Office of the Academic Ombud. Non-academic issues are handled according to the appropriate UK policy (e.g., sexual harassment, discrimination ). 10 Table IG -1 Academic Appeals to Ombudsman Semester Complaint Outcome Fall 2017 . Student appealed dismissal from program due to 3 course failures . Student reinstated in program with use of Repeat Option for one course Fall 2018 Student contested academic integrity charge .

Testing time changed to benefit student I-H. Documents and publications are accurate. A process is used to notify constituents about changes in documents and publications. Elaboration: References to the program's offerings, outcomes, accreditation/approval status, academic calendar, recruitment and admission policies, grading policies, degree/certificate completion requirements, tuition, and fees are accurate. Information regarding licensure and/or certification examinations for which graduates will be eligible is accurate. For APRN education programs, transcripts or other official documentation specify the APRN role and population focus of the graduate. 1,2 If a program chooses to publicly disclose its CCNE accreditation status, the program uses either of the following statements: \"The (baccalaureate degree program in nursing/master's degree program in nursing/Doctor of Nursing Practice program and/or post -graduate APRN certificate program) at (institution) is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education ( http://www.ccneaccreditation.org) .\" \"The (baccalaureate degree program in nursing/master's degree program in nursing/Doctor of Nursing Practice program and/or post -graduate APRN certificate program) at (institut ion) is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, 655 K Street NW, Suite 750, Washington, DC 20001, 202- 887-6791.\" Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. The CON's website, student handbooks, recruitment materials, and general descriptive documents are updated annually and as needed during the school year. Each year, Assistant Deans/track coordinators and the Student Services staff for the undergraduate and graduate programs review and update the Undergraduate and Graduate Student Handbooks . The Director of Communications and program administrative assistants make corresponding changes to the CON's website . Announcements regarding new/changed information and policies are communicated to students via their required University email and informational forums designed to receive and give information from/to students regarding updates and programmatic and policy changes. The web page is regularly updated to reflect CON programmatic and policy changes. The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate program curriculum plans, outcome objectives, admission requirements and degree requirements are found on the CON's website . The graduate student handbooks as well as the website has information about the MSN, BSN-DNP track, MSN-DNP track, Post -Graduate APRN Certificate program and the certifications for which our graduate students are eligible following completion of specific programs. 11 The academic calendar and tuition fees are found on UK's website under the Registrar's Office . Transfer of both undergraduate and graduate credits is clearly outlined by UK and the CON. This information is available on both the CON and the UK Registrar's websites. Evaluation criteria and grading policies are published in the syllabus for each course and determined by the faculty teaching the course. Examples available in the Virtual Resource Room. 1 Consensus Model for APRN Regulation: Licensure, Accreditation, Certification and Education (July 2008). 2 Criteria for Evaluation of Nurse Practitioner Programs (National Task Force on Quality Nurse Practitioner Education, 2016). 12 STANDARD I Summary: Mission and Governance Levels of Strength of Quality Strong Strength of Quality The University of Kentucky has over 156 years of experience as a land -grant, R1 institution with an academic health center and 18 colleges of which 7 are health pro fessions that are located on one campus. The College of Nursing has over 65 years of experience aligned with the mission, vision and strategic initiatives for the University and UK HealthCare . The College of Nursing mission, values, goals, and program outc omes are closely aligned with those of the University of Kentucky. The College of Nursing has a strong academic environment to advance nursing education, faculty practice, collaborative research, and service. The College of Nursing has a strong community o f interest that include internal and external advisory boards composed of members with diverse backgrounds to provide guidance and recommendations on strategic initiatives . Moderate to High Strength of Quality The College of Nursing has a strong faculty and student governance infrastructure with standing committees that provide input on policy development and/or program effectiveness evaluation. The College of Nursing has strong policies and procedures established to address faculty affairs includ ing recruitment, retention, and advancement. The College of Nursing has strong policies and policies established to address student affairs including admission, progression, and retention. Low to Moderate Strength of Quality The College of Nursing recognizes the current capacity of faculty serving on standing committees is stretched and requires on -going efforts to monitor and support. The College of Nursing recognizes the current distribution of effort (DOE) guidelines are not in alignment with the reality of increased demands on teaching/mentoring and transition of faculty for other opportunities (administration/retirement etc.) that r equires on -going efforts to improve. The College of Nursing recognizes the challenges of separate polices for student conduct from the University and the Health Profession Colleges that requires on -going efforts for clarity and better alignment. The Colleg e of Nursing recognizes the faculty governance standing committees composite for tenure- track members will require senior administration efforts for UG faculty to pursue tenure- track position opportunities. The College of Nursing recognizes the ever- changi ng healthcare environment and University demands (mission to serve during pandemic) will require more intentional efforts to obtain alumni input . 13 Standard II Program Quality: Institutional Commitment and Resources The parent institution demonstrates ongoing commitment to and support for the nursing program. The institution makes resources available to enable the program to achieve its mission, goals, and expected outcomes. The faculty and staff, as resources of the program, enable the ach ievement of the mission, goals, and expected program outcomes. II-A. Fiscal resources are sufficient to enable the program to fulfill its mission, goals, and expected outcomes. Adequacy of fiscal resources is reviewed periodically, and resources are modified as needed. Elaboration: The budget enables achievement of the program's mission, goals, and expected outcomes. The budget supports the development, implementation, and evaluation of the program. Compensation of nursing unit personnel supports recruitm ent and retention of faculty and staff. A defined process is used for regular review of the adequacy of the program's fiscal resources. Review of fiscal resources occurs, and modifications are made as appropriate. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. The CON ' s fiscal resources come from several sources, with the majority (62.59%) in 2017- 2018 from the general fund of UK, as shown in Table IIA -1: CON Fiscal Resources . Through 2019- 2020, the College of Nursing had growth in the state allocation; however, the percent of the consolidated budget reflected a decrease of 11.4% to 51.1% (state funding) as other areas, mostly grants, grew. Although fiscal resources at UK supp ort the CON, the continued decline in state support is not a sustainable model and has required the University to implement different funding strategies. The consolidated budget of the University of Kentucky in 2017- 2018 was $3.6B, with steady growth to a (pending) 2020- 2021 $4.4B. The change in the University's operating budget over the last nine years reflects significant efforts to support increased patient care delivery services, increased extramurally -funded research grants and contracts, and a shift in funding from the state to UK students. A balanced, consolidated budget is established prior to the beginning of each fiscal year (July 1 to June 30) and amended during the year as plans change and unanticipated events occur. The University's consolidat ed budget is primarily comprised of four types of current funds: General, Auxiliary, Restricted and Fund Balance. The first three types are recurring funds that are generally received or earned every year, such as state appropriations and tuition and fees revenue. Support from the UK general fund is appropriated annually by the Provost based on the Dean's budget request. The second largest component is from grants and contracts awarded to faculty of the CON for research, training, and capital improvement efforts. The use of these resources is restricted to fulfilling the purpose for which they were awarded. Support from UK HealthCare (UKHC) represents the third largest source of funding. These funds are used to cover the cost of CON faculty and staff who provide the services to complete their work. This source also reflects commitments to the CON from UKHC, which funds a variety of initiatives such as the Post-Baccalaureate Nurse Residency Program (jointly operated with UKHC), several individuals who hold faculty appointments for programmatic n eeds, participate in the College's educational activities, and engage in practice and/or research roles in UKHC. Beginning in 2014- 2015, the College entered a partnership/collaboration with Norton Healthcare to provide DNP education to their BSN -prepared nurses in Louisville, Kentucky. Through this initiative, the general fund budget has grown due to the generation of additional tuition through increased enrollment. For 2020- 2021, the budget for the Norton Partnership is $589,550. In January 2016, the CON began an academic partnership with Select Medical Corporation to provide RN- BSN online classes for up to 50 Select employed, associate degree staff nurses per semester. To date, the Select students are non- residents and University finance modeling doe s not support budget allocation for this 14 partnership. The UK College of Nursing Phyllis D. Corbitt Community Health Center in Wilmore, Kentucky was established on September 14, 2015. The clinic was named for Dr. Corbitt, a family physician who had practiced in Wilmore for over 40 years. The CON Assistant Dean of Faculty Practice, a nurse practitioner with extensive experience, serves as the clinic director. The clinic began as a limited services clinic and evolved to a full, primary care clinic in J une 2019. To date, over 7,500 patient encounters have occurred. The clinic offers an opportunity for primary care APRN faculty to practice and provides a clinical site for BSN and DNP APRN students to earn part of their required 900 clinical hours. The cli nic provides primary care services to patients from infants to elderly. The clinic is an approved site to participate in the federally funded Vaccines for Children's Program. The clinic continues to treat patients with common illnesses such as upper respiratory infections, allergy symptoms, sore throats, and skin infections, in addition to giving immunizations, providing patient education, and counseling as well as school and sports physicals. In April 2020, a full- time RN with a master's in social work was hired. In September 2020, the clinic began offering behavioral health services which have proven to be very beneficial to both patients and staff. Six CON APRN faculty are currently credentialed as clinic providers through the UKHC Medical Staff Affairs Office. At this time, the revenues generated through the clinic cover the costs of personnel and overhead. Beginning in March 2013, a four-year grant from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services supported a CON women's health nurse practitioner faculty member to implement \"Innovation to Care for Perinatal Outcomes in Women at Risk\" in the UKHC OB -GYN clinic. New mothers with newborns identified at risk for substance abuse were offered skills to actively manage their recovery, properly parent, and engage in continuing education/job training. In addition, the program offered skills to improve psychosocial health, each critical to long-term recovery. The program later moved from the UKHC OB -GYN Clinic to the UKHC Polk Dalton Clinic, a free-standing clinic located in north Lexington, Kentucky. The program grew with increased grant support until the CON, in collaboration with UKHC, opened the UK Beyond Birth Comprehensive Recovery Clinic on November 8, 2018, a clinic for women with substance use disorders who have recently given birth. This is a comprehensive treatment partnership between UK, UK College of Nursing, UKHC and the State Cabinet for Health and Family Services. The program incorporates education groups, individual counseling, group counseling, peer support and medical treatment of substance use and mental health disorders. Although the clinic is revenue- generating, 95% of services provided are supported by grants. In fall 2020, the clinic was transitioned to UKHC to advance services and strengthen operations under the \"umbrella\" of UKHC's Behavioral Health Initiative. Gifts to the CON and interest generated by endowments (market value of $6,368,907) are used primarily to support student scholarships. In addition, two endowed chairs and five endowed professorships are supported by donors. Another source of revenue is the Office of Professional Development for continuing education operated within the CON. The program, which is fiscally self-sustaining and nationally accredited with distinction, provides an important service to the Commonwealth and beyond. Another source of support for College is through the University of Kentucky 21 st Century \"Kentucky Can\" Cap ital Campaign that was launched in 2018 with a $2.1 billion fund-raising effort. The College of Nursing goal to raise $12 million is currently at $10 million for addressing priority areas to support student scholarships, endowed professorships, research, and academic programming. Although the pandemic has slowed fund -raising efforts significantly, top funded areas are currently for student scholarships and programm ing such as building a Culture of Practices for Resiliency (CPR) to address mental health and wellness for students, faculty, and staff. Each spring, the UK general fund and UKHC budget requests are developed by the Dean and the Associate Dean of Executive Administrative Affairs and Finance and presented to the Provost, the UK Executive Vice President for Finance and Administration and the UK Executive Vice President for Health Affairs (EVPHA). The budget process includes justific ation for current funding as well as requests for new initiatives, including one - time expenses such as building renovations and major equipment purchases. If the CON has general funds remaining at the end of the fiscal year, a request is submitted to the Provost to carry forward a portion of the funds into the next fiscal year, a process which supports the CON's need to fund one- time initiatives. In Fall of 2017, the Provost engaged with UKHC EVPHA for increased funding support for the CON through an at -risk funding performance agreement. Annually, goals are reviewed and/or updated with UKHC nursing leadership and the CON Dean to determine mutually agreed upon metrics and funding amounts. Currently the performance measures evaluated focus on BSN (tradition al and accelerated) outcomes and include: (1) number of Kentucky residents admitted; (2) number of CON graduates hired at UKHC; (3) diversity of students admitted; 15 and (4) UKHC workforce readiness projects such as implementing holistic admissions and expanding SNAP (student nursing academic practicum) for year -round experiences. Table IIA -1: CON Fiscal Resources College of Nursing Revenues 2017- 2018 2018- 2019 2019- **The final amount to the CON is pending When the budget process is complete, the Provost submits a consolidated budget proposal to the President of UK, who presents the entire budget to the Board of Trustees. Once approved by the Board of Trustees, the budget is sent to the Kentucky Council for Post -Secondary Education (K CPE). The Council is responsible for submitting the proposal for all post -secondary programs to the Governor. The Kentucky Legislature determines state appropriations during their annual session. Faculty provide input to the budget process through a variet y of mechanisms, including Faculty Council (elected faculty for Faculty Organization leadership), the Associate Dean to whom faculty report needs specific to their programmatic responsibilities and activities, and faculty forums organized by the Dean's off ice to address specific budget issues. The CON faces the same challenges as other programs of nursing in competing with higher salaries offered in the clinical arena. CON faculty salaries compare favorably to AACN benchmarks for Schools of Nursing in Academic Health Science Centers and are reviewed annually for possible adjustments. Table IIA-2: CON Means Salaries for Faculty 2019- 2020, shows mean salaries for full -time CON faculty by rank and academic year appointment (10 months) or calendar year appointment (12 months). Also displayed in Table IIA -2 are national data on the mean salaries for academic year appointments and calendar year appointments. A review of the data in the table shows that for most categories, salaries in the CON are higher than the mean salaries reported by AACN. The exception is for the academic year salary at the instructor level for those with a doctorate. This may be reflective of salary compression, as many have been at UK for several years. All base salaries of CON faculty are reviewed annually and adjusted as state funding supports with the exception of high merit and promotions. After adjustments in 2019 -2020, 45% of the CON faculty salaries meet or exceed the 60th percentiles of the AACN benchmark. 16 Table IIA -2 CON Mean Salaries for Faculty 2019- 2020 Instructor/ Lecturer Assistant Professor Associate Professor Professor UK/CON Academic Yr.

Adequacy of physical resources and clinical sites is reviewed periodically, and resources are modified as needed. Elaboration: Physical space and facilities (e.g., faculty and staff work space, classrooms, meeting areas) are sufficient and configured in ways that enable the program to achieve its mission, goals, and expected outcomes. Equipment and supplies (e.g., com puting, laboratory, and teaching -learning materials) are sufficient to achieve the program's mission, goals, and expected outcomes. The program is responsible for ensuring adequate physical resources and clinical sites. Clinical sites are sufficient, appropriate, and available to achieve the program's mission, goals, and expected outcomes. A defined process is used to determine currency, availability, accessibility, and adequacy of resources (e.g., clinical simulation, laboratory, computing, supplies, and clinical sites), and modifications are made as appropriate. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. Physical resources are adequate and reviewed as needed. Built in 1974, the CON building is approximately 121,000 square feet over six floors. The space occupied by the CON includes faculty and staff offices, teaching laboratories for clinical courses including the Clinical Simulation and Learning Center, the Center for Nursing Research, lounges for faculty, staff and students, and several conference rooms. Clinical sites are sufficient and appropriate to meet the expected outcomes of each program. The CON has available sites at local hospitals, schools, clinics, and public health agencies, among others. The programs are utilizing simulated learning to augment some of the scenario's students may not be exposed to in the clinical setting. Office Space and Common Areas Considerable strategic investments have been made by the CON and the University for refurbishing and renovations over the past 15 years. Specifically, over the past seven years, faculty and staff offices have been renovated, which included painting and the addition of ergonomically designed furniture. The public areas of the CON have been painted and floor tile has been replaced as needed. Other investments include replacing all stair 17 treads and signage in the stairwells, relocating two large research teams due to limited space in the CON and to accommodate the rapid growth in funded programs. Both teams (the BREATHE team was relocated to a 5,704 square feet location and the RICH Heart team was relocated to a 3,910 square feet location) are located within six miles of the CON in spaces that are leased through the University and meet University guidelines. The offices were furnished, and faculty members and their research staff were moved to the off-site locations. relocating two research teams off campus . Updating the Hall of Fame lobby area, replac ing tile floors on the first floor, replacing lighting on each floor and completing a major renovation for the Office of Nursing Research (4,165 square feet on the 5th floor). This area now has more efficient space for research assistants, research staff, research pre- and post -support, and the Associate Dean for Research. There is a deli and coffee shop adjacent to the CON. Key cards are required for entry into the student lounges and the CON building after hours. The bathrooms on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th floors have all been renovated. Both 3rd floor bathrooms are designated with signage as gender inclusive. During the 2016- 17 academic year, the CON participated in the larger, campus -wide strategic goal to develop \"Work -Life Balance.\" One of the most tangible results of our efforts was the creation of the Cultivating Practices for Resilience (CPR) room, which opened October 2017. This space is located on the 6th floor with approximately 400 square feet of space. Located in a corner of the building with full -length windows that overlook the campus, the CPR room is dedicated to helping alleviate stress and anxiety in faculty, staff, and students. The College provided supplies for the practice of yoga, a large monitor, rocking chairs, a massage chair, and a cascading water fountain for creation of a relaxing ambiance. This was partially supported through private donors with interest in building healthy working and learning environments. A healthy workplace is critical to our well-being as well as those we serve. There have been continuous improvements in the CON building as funding allowed. During summer 2018, UK Facilities upgraded the large Auditorium 201, which seats 295 students. This renovation included lighting, ceiling, painting, new flooring, and an upgrade of the sound system. The hallway on first floor was also tiled and new lighting ceiling grid s were installed. In fall 2019, the fourth and fifth floor corridors where faculty offices are located were painted, and ceiling tiles and grids were replaced. Lighting on each floor (1, 2, 4 and 5) was updated to LED. Conference Rooms The CON has four co nference rooms, one on the third floor, one in the Center for Nursing Research on the 5th floor, and two on the second floor, which are available for meetings. The conference rooms can be used by CON faculty as well as those outside of the CON and are distance -learning capable. The conference rooms are scheduled by the Dean's administrative staff. Additional meeting rooms may be scheduled through Central Scheduling in any of the adjacent buildings for both small and large meetings. Classrooms Classrooms include space assigned to the CON within the CON building as well as access to centrally managed classrooms and lecture halls, technology, and other equipment. Each classroom is equipped with audiovisual equipment and computers for internet access. Additionally, there are eight centrally supported classrooms at the University that are distance -learning capable and located on campus. UK Facilities manages improvements to the classrooms and most major renovations are done on a rotating basis. The College of Nursing has a mid-size lecture hall (135 seats) and a large- size lecture hall (295 seats) that was renovated during summer 2018. Clinical Simulation and Learning Center The Clinical Simulation and Learning Center (CSLC) consists of 10,000 s quare feet of space designated for experiential learning. Contained in the CSLC are simulated hospital rooms, exam rooms, and other treatment areas that incorporate audiovisual equipment that help both undergraduate and graduate students receive hands - on feedback through video recordings. These areas are designed to provide students with a realistic learning environment to maintain environmental fidelity. In the CSLC, there are high-fidelity simulators and task trainers that are specifically designed to assist students and learners in applying skills and knowledge needed by healthcare professionals. The CSLC is provisionally accredited by the Society for Simulation in Healthcare. The CSLC self -study has been subm itted for review to become fully accredited. In spring of 2017, the CON Clinical Simulation and Learning Center (CSLC) was renovated to include a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Through a 18 partnership with UKHC, and as part of the design process for a new Neo natal Intensive Care Unit, the Kentucky Children's Hospital completed a replica of a neonatal intensive care hospital room in the CSLC. Conveniently located (4th floor of the CON), healthcare providers as well as nursing students are now able to experience care of the neonate more fully. Computer Resources All full- time faculty and staff are provided computers. Faculty members are given a choice of a desktop or laptop computer. Wireless access is available throughout the CON building and across campus. The CON has five servers housed at UKHC's server farm and one server in-house. UK provides site licenses for Microsoft Office, Microsoft Operating System, Adobe products, and Forefront antivirus, among many others. The University invested in additional comput er space on the 6 th floor of the CON. This renovation created a 42- seat computer classroom and upgraded the data technology infrastructure to optimize the use of the computer classroom for undergraduate and graduate students. For online course management, Canvas\u00ae by Instructure is used. UK holds a site license for SAS and SPSS that is available for faculty, staff, and students. Individual or group licenses are purchased for other software as needed by faculty, staff, and students. Students have access to computers in the UK computer lab located on the 6th floor of the CON building. In addition, five computers and a printer are available to graduate students in the 5th floor graduate study area. Clinical Facilities The CON has access and contracts to use all of the hospitals in Fayette County, including Albert B. Chandler, UK Good Samaritan, Eastern State Hospital, CHI Saint Joseph Health, CHI Saint Joseph East, and Baptist Health Lexington, the Phyllis D. Corbitt Community Health Center f or student clinical placements, to name a few. Clinical space is competitive as there are several nursing programs in the area. The Assistant Dean for the Undergraduate Program participates in Bluegrass Planning, which consists of representatives from the area nursing programs, to negotiate the type and number of clinical sites needed each semester. The Advanced Practice Registered Nurse students are placed with a preceptor for each of the clinical courses. Obtaining a preceptor for each student is a very competitive process, as there are several nurse practitioner programs in the area as well as students attending online programs. The DNP track coordinators are responsible for finding clinical placements for their students. While this is a laborious process, the CON has been able to assure clinical placements for all students each semester. Norton- Healthcare Facilities During 2014 and 2015, the CON -Norton Health Care (NHC) academic -practice partnership was offered in the NHC Institute for Nursing dedicated space located in an office tower adjacent to the NHC Audubon Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky. Space was more than adequate for the first two CON -NHC DNP student cohort groups, each with an enrollment of 20 students. The space was equipped with three large classrooms, a computer room with approximately 15 computers, and six examination rooms (some set up as office examination rooms and others with hospital equipment). Class rooms were configured with audio and video capabilities, laptop connections and Internet access. Faculty and staff offices with computer set -up were available as well as an open area with a printer and supplies. During 2016, NHC began renovation of a four -story office building to include a Learning Center and NHC office space. In January 2017, the NHC Learning Center opened for student, faculty, and staff occupancy. Among the three NHC levels, the new office space added 15,300 square feet of classroom and employee learning space, approximately doubling the previous amount of space NHC had devoted to education. The second floor NHC Learning Center, located at 9500 Ormsby Station Road, Louisville, is equipped with eight classrooms with seating capacity from 20 to 126 people. All the classrooms have wireless Internet access and availability for personal laptop connections. Some have flat screen monitors, and some have large screen projection for video conferencing. One classroom serves as a computer lab with 24 personal computers, along with a speaker lectern and flat screen monitor. The CON -NHC nursing hub includes a reception area and office space for faculty and staff. 19 II-C. Academic support services are sufficient to meet program an d student needs and are evaluated on a regular basis. Elaboration: Academic support services, which may include library, technology, distance education support, research support, and admission and advising services, foster achievement of program outcomes. A defined process is used for regular review of academic support services, and improvements are made as appropriate. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. Noted for top academic rankings (consistent 97% NCLEX average, largest number of BSN graduates in Kentucky, NLN Center for Nursing Education Excellence, DNP ranked #26 in U.S. News and World Report, top 10 NIH Nursing Research among publics, and top 10 PhD programs by U.S. National Research Council) the CON has sufficient academic support services for students and faculty to achieve the mission, goals and expected program outcomes. Library Support There are more than one dozen facilities that comprise the UK Libraries. With the largest book endowment of all public universities in the United States, UK libraries are among the world's leading research libraries. The libraries' broad scope of advanced technology offers students, faculty, and staff access to cu rrent information online in addition to printed resources. UK's main library, the William T. Young University Library, houses 1.2 million volumes for the social sciences, humanities, and life sciences. The library includes 57 group study and conference rooms as well as study areas that seat 350. There are 350 personal computers available for patrons and staff and 3,000 network ports throughout the library to support faculty and student computing needs. The library system contains 5,432,663 volumes; of those, 2,165,118 are e -books. The total UK library system subscribes to 885,019 journals/serial subscriptions including 148,639 e-journals. Faculty, staff, and students have access to 435 licensed databases. Free interlibrary loan and document delivery services as well as online literature searches, reference staff consultations and library instruction sessions are available to faculty, staff, and students. UK Libraries uses the SpringShare suite of programs to produce LibGuides on a variety of topics. The Medical Center Library is conveniently located across the street from the CON. There are 16 computers in the Medical Center Library teaching/learning center and 20 computers in the library proper, available for patron use. The lower level of the library was renovated and opened in the fall of 2018. It was designed to provide open, collaborative space and quiet study areas. Endnote X5 for Windows is available via the Medical Center website for downloading by all students, faculty, and staff. Some of the many other resources available to students and faculty include: CINAHL, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, BoardVitals N CLEX-RN test bank, PsycINFO, and Health and Psychosocial Instruments (HaPI). Research workshops and individual trainings on the use of these and other resources are offered throughout each semester. The Medical Center Library designated a Research and Edu cation librarian as the liaison for the CON faculty and students. She is the first point of contact for information about library policies, procedures, and services, and provides specialized research consultations, teaches classes to support research using library resources, and provides collection management assistance. She maintains a College of Nursing Library Resources guide which provides quick access to resources and services. Her office is conveniently located on the 6th floor of the CON building. On an annual basis during budget planning for the next fiscal year, the librarian polls the faculty to determine if new library resources are needed. Faculty can request resources during other times of the year, budget permitting. The CON librarian provides informational support as an embedded librarian in two Canvas\u00ae courses: NUR 200 (Foundations for Professional Nursing) and NUR 453 (Nursing Capstone). An introductory message with links to resources and services is provided. Students can ask questions within the Canvas\u00ae site. Research informational support is given via email, phone, face to face or via video conferencing software. The CON librarian provides instructional support for three undergraduate courses: NUR 310 (Evidence Based Nursing Practice), NUR 328 (Research for Evidence Based Nursing Practice), and NUR 450 (Impact of 20 Evidence Based Practice in Nursing). Search strategy lectures demonstrating multiple databases are recorded and made available to the students in Canvas\u00ae. In NUR 310 (Evidence Based Nursing Practice) , the students view the recording as a pre-assignment and then a follow -up, hands -on class is scheduled with the librarian. The students are given a post assignment during the hands -on class and the librarian gives personalized assistance to the students while they search for literature. In NUR 328 (Research for Evidence Based Nursing Practice), and NUR 450 Impac t of Evidence Based Practice in Nursing) , the course instructors have embedded quizzes at different portions during the searching lecture to reinforce student learning. For example, in the DNP program she is included as an instructor in NUR 916 (Program Pl anning & Evaluation for Improvement in Practice and Health Outcomes) and in NUR 909 (Proposal Development), where she assists students refine the search terms to obtain the best evidence related to their DNP Project. At the beginning of each semester, the course instructor and the CON librarian discuss the content and format of the classes. Updates to the assignment and content of the recorded lectures are made based on student feedback and course instructor/librarian observations. UK Libraries evaluate service quality by administering the national Association of Research Libraries (ARL) LibQUAL+\u00ae survey every four years and benchmarks with the ARL mean scores. In 2020, UK Libraries' scores were equal to or above the ARL service quality mean and have increased over our 2017 scores for both undergraduate and graduate students, for library collections, electronic resources, and facilities. A locally - developed Library User Satisfaction S urvey, conducted every four years, measures user satisfaction in individual campus libraries and will next be implemented in 2021. Improvements made as a result of these evaluations included the following: library resources were made more accessible by pur chasing additional resources in electronic form; hours of service were extended to 24/5 in the Young Library; a graduate student study space was created in the Young Library; and more quiet study space was designated within the Young Library. The Education, Medical Center and Law Libraries have each been extensively renovated within the past two years. The CON has used classroom management software since its introduction at UK and advocated for its purchase and adoption. In the Undergraduate program, utili zation of Canvas\u00ae (learning management software) is on an individual course basis. Undergraduate faculty use technologies such as Turning Point's \u00ae audience response system and Echo 360 lecture capture to aid students in learning course material. Canvas\u00ae is utilized in all of the courses in the MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate programs as well as Echo 360 lecture capture and zoom. The CON Information Technology group (CONIT) consists of one Director, one server administrator, and one desktop support technician. The CONIT Director works closely with the Dean and Associate Dean for Executive Administrative Operations & Finance in the CON. The CONIT Director helps with the development of IT policy and ensures service level agreements with in the CON are met as well as directing the priorities of the group. The Director also works as the CON liaison with the Campus IT group, and the Medical Center IT group. The south campus office of Audio Visual (AV) Services, a part of UK Instructional Technology, is located in the CON. Its mission is to provide support for the use of multimedia technology to meet the education, research, and service missions of UK. AV supports audio taping from single digital audio recording to multiple microphones set up for round table discussions. Voice recording for video or presentation narration is also provided. AV equipment is available for check out free of charge to all colleges. The following is a brief summary of computer resources within the C ollege of Nursing: CON IT Staff support of all full -time faculty and staff within the CON regarding computer issues; Faculty members are given a choice of a desktop computer or a laptop; The CON has two servers housed at the Medical Center's data center; Wireless and ethernet access is available throughout the building and across campus; and UK provides licensed Microsoft Office, Operating System, Adobe, and Forefront antivirus software, among many others, to all faculty, staff, and students All computer resources being utilized by the CON are to be compliant with the University of Kentucky Enterprise and Medical Center Administrative Regulation 10:1 through 10:5 . The policy applies to users of University information technology resources irrespective of whether those resources are accessed from on - 21 campus or off -campus location. The policy applies to all University information technology resources including: Data and other files, including electronic mail and voice mail, stored in individual computer accounts on University -owned centrally maintained systems; Data and other files, including electronic mail or voice mail stored on departmentally maintained systems; Data and other files, including electronic mail and voice mail, stored in individual computer accounts on systems managed by the University on behalf of affiliated organizations; Data and other files, including electronic mail or voice mail, stored on perso nally-owned devices on University property (e.g., residence hall rooms); Data and other files, including electronic mail or voice mail stored on University -owned systems assigned to a specific individual for use in support of job functions; and Telecommuni cations (voice or data) traffic from, to, or between any devices described above. Distance Learning In spring 2015, the CON completed an external review on the operations of the Office of Instructional Technology. It was recommended to restructure staffing so that the instructional technologist/designer works more closely with faculty on the use of technology in instruction as well as online course design. The instructional design team now reports to the Assistant Dean of Academic Operations to predominantly support all distance learning modalities. The technologist also aids with all aspects of Canvas\u00ae\u00ae management and other online technologies such as: Echo 360\u00ae personal and lecture capture software, Camtasia\u00ae, instructional videos and PowerPoint voiceovers, the use of Skype\u00ae, Zoom\u00ae for classroom conferencing, the use of Turning Point's\u00ae audience response system, Examsoft\u00ae testing software, and websites or Share Point\u00ae sites developed for academic use, as well as Digication for ePortfolio\u00ae creation in the DNP program. The instructional technologist/designer works closely with eLearning, CELT, College of Nursing IT, ITS, AV Services, so faculty receive the support they need for optimizing student learning. In fall 2016, the CON converted its RN-BSN program to a 100% online program. Undergraduate faculty are in the process of identifying BSN (traditional and ABSN) courses that may be converted for online lea rning as well. An immersion delivery model for the DNP Program was implemented in 2019. DNP students attend classes on campus at the beginning and end of each semester to complete course requirements, which are outside the online courses. The immersion mod el students meet for three blocked days at the beginning of the semester, and two blocked days at the end of the semester. The CON benefits from several faculty members who are certified online educators including one that is designated as Director of Onl ine Innovation. Currently there are 19 full -time and seven part -time faculty who are certified as online educators. Detailed online support for students in the use of Canvas\u00ae\u00ae is available at http://www.uky.edu/Canvas\u00ae/ . This includes information on such topics as: how to get started, how to get online training, logging in, system requirements, completing graded work, grades, tools, and troubleshooting, among others. Online information/support for instructors is available at the same link, http://www.uky.edu/Canvas\u00ae/ . Faculty members also obtain support for the use of Canvas\u00ae\u00ae from the staff of the Center for Enh ancement of Learning and Teaching (CELT), which is discussed in a section below. Integrated faculty and student support services for distance learning include Distance Learning Library Services , information about online programs and resources, is available at http://www.uky.edu/ukonline/ . The UK Online office has developed an Online Teaching Toolkit , avail able to help design, develop and support learning for online teaching. There is an Information Technology Services Grant Program for faculty to apply for funding to develop Distance Learning courses or programs. In addition, since its inception in 2015 several faculty members have benefitted from CELT grants to advance online innovation. Documentation available in the Virtual Resource Room. Clinical Simulation and Learning Center The Assistant Dean of Academic Operations provides administrative oversight o f the CSLC function, including overall evaluation of the faculty and staff. The CSLC Director is a certified healthcare simulation educator and has a 1.0 FTE faculty Lecturer position. The CSLC Director maintains oversight of both the daily academic activi ties and operations. This includes personnel assignments, simulators, rooms, equipment, manikins, and supplies. The CSLC Director is responsible for determining the simulation schedule for the 22 Undergraduate program along with the simulation instructional support specialist. The scheduling for simulation used in the Graduate program is based on the needs of the individual courses following the Policy and Procedure for Scheduling. The simulation instructional support specialist (1.0 FTE) is responsible for managing the daily simulation schedule, assisting the students in arranging group times that do not conflict with their schedule, and overall business operations of the CSLC. The simulation lab coordinator senior (1.0 FTE) is responsible for maintenance and inventory of the equipment, manikins, and supplies. They ensure that all supplies, equipment, paperwork and moulage (the art of applying moc k injuries for the purpose of training medical and military personnel) are available and ready to use in each simulation room. They maintain and troubleshoot all technology, including hardware and software; assist with the facilitation of simulation throug h the use of technology; and ensure that simulation specialists and other faculty using the CSLC have what they need and that it is operational. In addition, the simulation lab coordinator senior assists the simulation instructional support specialist with operation of the CSLC as needed. All courses with simulation are held to the International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation & Learning (INACSL) Standards of Best Practice: Simulation. The CSLC Director ensures that the appropria te simulation modality is chosen to best meet the objectives of the SCE. All simulation activities need final approval by the CSLC Director, who is a Certified Healthcare Simulation Educator (CHSE), two weeks prior to the event to ensure alignment with simulation standards and the training mission of the CSLC. Objectives need to be sent when scheduled. The simulations are evaluated in several ways and are under constant revision based on student and faculty feedback. Students complete an evaluation following each simulated clinical experience (SCE). The design of the SCE, facilitator, and perceived challenges are included in the evaluation using modified versions of the National League for Nursing Educational Practices Questionnaire, Student Satisfaction and Self -Confidence in Learning, and Simulation Design Scale. Table II C-1: CLSC Student Satisfaction: Spring 2020 reflects the results of the 2020 Student Satisfaction survey. Table IIC -1 CSLC Student Satisfaction: Spring 2020 Mean Scores (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree) Score Description Mean 1 The teaching methods used in this simulation were helpful and effective 4.89 2 The simulation provided me with a variety of learning materials and activities to promote my learning the course curriculum 4.87 3 I enjoyed how my instructor taught the simulation 4.88 4 The teaching materials used in this simulation were motivating and helped me learn 4.88 5 The way my instructor(s) taught the simulation was suitable to the way I learn 4.88 In addition to student feedback following each SCE, undergraduate students are evaluated using the Simulation Rubric that is based on the program student learning outcomes. The students will receive \"meets expectation,\" \"needs improvement,\" or \"unsatisfactory\" based on their performance during the SCE. The students also receive written formative feedback, in addition to debriefing, based on any areas where they need improvement or are unsatisfactory. This information is found on the cohort simulation Canvas\u00ae site. Corresponding course coordinators and clinical faculty have access to the student performance to remediate areas as needed. Twenty -one students in the spring 2020 second semester senior cohort received \"needs improvement\" following the first SCE. Twenty -nine students received \"needs improvement\" following the final SCE. Most of the \"needs improvement\" for the final SCE were in the category of prioritizat ion. All students were successful in their clinical experience. Research Support The Office of Nursing Research (ONR) offers support services for research and scholarly activities for faculty and students in the recently renovated 4,165 square feet space on the 5th floor of the CON. A recent reorganization of CON leadership expanded the responsibilities of the Associate Dean of Research to include PhD Faculty Affairs and added an Assistant Dean of PhD Program and Scholarly Affairs as well as a Counci l for the Advancement of Student Scholarly Affairs. 23 Available ONR resources and services include assistance in locating funding sources; preparing research proposals; statistical, research design and sampling design; survey development; psychometric consultation; and manuscript and poster preparation and editing. The Associate Dean for Research oversees the ONR's staff, which includes the following full- time staff members: an administrative coordinator, a grants facilitator, a CON grants officer, an epidemiologist/survey research specialist/data manager and analyst and two doctorally -prepared statisticians. A PhD-prepared statistician, who is a tenured faculty member, also provides statistical consultation and expertise in research and sampling designs. Space is also allocated in this area for funded researchers and undergraduate research interns to work with their mentors . The ONR has a computer in each of the 25 workstations, and all are linked to two printers in that area. Computers are equipped with Microsoft Office\u00ae and statistical packages. Atlas.ti\u00ae is available for faculty and students conducting qualitative research. The CON uses incentive funds received from indirect costs on extramural grants to support the research productivity of faculty and students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Support for travel to present at state, regional, national, and international conferences is available from the Office of Nursing Research. Poster printing is also paid for from incentive funds. Two other recent examples of incentive funds support included hosting two internationally renowned nurse scientists to consult with faculty on their individual research areas and with faculty research teams, and 18 faculty members who attended an all -day workshop offered on campus by a company called Grantwriters' Seminars and Workshops, LLC to support faculty and student research. UK's Office of the Vice President for Research recently changed its fun ding model to allocate funds directly to Colleges. Although special RFPs may be called, colleges are expected to manage a variety of faculty research support mechanisms, such as start -up funds for new Regular Title Series faculty, bridge funding and facult y research support grants. The Vice President encourages interdisciplinary collaboration by allocating a larger proportion of the indirect costs (16% vs. 10%) for incentive funds when interdisciplinary extramural proposals are funded. To incentivize facult y, the Wethington Awards have been offered to CON faculty who bring in part of their salary on grants. For the past five years, individual faculty with grant salary support received 10% of the amount of salary they personally covered by grants as an incent ive award in May of each year. Admission and Advising Services The CON Office of Student Services (Student Services) facilitates the recruitment, application, and matriculation of undergraduate and graduate nursing students. Six FTE provide support to the students and programs, including: one FTE Assistant Dean of Stu dents, one FTE recruitment coordinator, three FTE undergraduate advisors, one FTE graduate student services officer and one FTE admissions coordinator. In collaboration with faculty and the Associate Deans, members of Student Services develop recruitment plans for all academic programs, provide information to prospective applicants, represent the CON at recruitment/career opportunity events, provide pre-admission counseling, support the admissions process for all academic programs, facilitate student registration and credentials verification, coordinate health and safety compliance, support student organizations, career plan development, and pinning and hooding ceremonies, provide support for enrolled students, plan commenc ement activities, administer the school's scholarship distribution, and maintain all student -related data. Pre-nursing students are admitted to the CON and are advised by professional academic advisors. Support procedures are in place for early intervention for students who are below a passing grade in any nursing course. A collaborative process involving the student, the student's advisor, and course faculty is in place. At the graduate level, students a re assigned a faculty advisor as they enter the program. The average number of advisees per academic advisor in the undergraduate program in 2020 was 255:1. The ratio of advisees per faculty in the MSN program is 5:1. The DNP and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate students and faculty are combined as the same faculty advise both groups and advisees per faculty range from 1 -20. The variability is due to the demands on faculty resources, DOE, and faculty responsibilities througho ut the year. The University academic alert system was created to ensure that students have the academic assistance they need, right when they need it. Faculty and staff can submit an alert about academic concerns for example if a student has missed classes or is performing poorly. The alert is sent to their academic advisor and the student will receive notification that an alert has been submitted. Other Support Services and Enrichment Opportunities for Students The CON has a writing specialist, who conducts a diagnostic writing assessment on all DNP students during the first or second semester of enrollment. The writing specialist provides students with information on such 24 topics as critical thinking, paragraph development, writing a literature review, and writing for publication. Working closely with the UK Medical Center Library liaison to schedule classes in EndNote, a software program designed to help writers manage their reference citations, is also provided. Other services provided include on - site consultation with undergraduate and graduate students as well as via virtual meetings, faculty assistance with improving writing and presentation skills and online video tutorials for writing guidance for students, UKHC nurses and faculty. Support for Undergraduate Students The University's Living Learning Community/Living Learning Program (LLP) established in collaboration with Residence Life Staff, the Interprofessional Residential Healthcare College (IHRC) student dormitory which opened in 2014 to serve undergraduate students participating in the program. Interprofessional Residential Healthcare College is a high -impact, living- learning program designed for students who have a passion for healthcare and interdisciplinary learning. It is an active collaboration among nine colleges on campus and op en to any major. IHRC members can expect to be immersed in a living- learning experience that combines a host of curricular and co -curricular initiatives with a network of faculty and staff dedicated to interprofessional healthcare and student success. Nine IHRC UK partner colleges include: College of Dentistry, College of Health Sciences, College of Medicine, College of Nursing, College of Pharmacy, College of Public Health, College of Social Work, College of Communication & Information, and the College of Agriculture, Food & Environment (Department of Dietetics and Nutrition). Peer tutoring is offered four times each semester for Anatomy and Physiology and Chemistry through this program. NUR 101(Academic Orientation and Introduction to Nursing) provides a University orientation for nursing students. It also teaches study skills and provides students with an introduction to the profession. 2019- 2020 IHRC LLP Academic Year in Review cumulative GPA: 3.53 2020 retention rate: 95.8% Nursing Students: 41 students registered as Pre- nursing or Nursing students Co-Curricular Programming: The IHRC executed 21 of our signature \"iRock\" co-curricular programs during Fall 2019 and 18 during Spring 2020. Program Satisfaction: o 97% (N = 164) of IHRC students agreed or strongly agreed: \"My experience a UK this semester has been positive.\" o 96% (N = 164) of IHRC students agreed or strongly agreed: \"I feel like I belong within my LLP.\" o 92% (N = 164) of IHRC students agreed or strongly agreed: \"My IHRC Peer Mentor has had a positive impact on my experience.\" o 93% (N = 164) of IHRC students agreed or strongly agreed: \"My LLP has had a positive impact on my academics at UK.\" o 93% (N = 164) of IHRC students agreed or strongly agreed: \"If I could start the semester over, I would still choose to be in my LLP.\" iCATS Student Satisfaction - AY 2016/2017 to 2019/2020 Approximately 250 undergraduate nursing students (Traditional BSN and Accelerated BSN) engage annually in a required UK Center for Interprofessional Health Education (CIHE) core interprofessional curriculum entitled iCATS (Interprofessional Collaboration and Team Skills) for all first/second year students (approximately 1000) . Students focus on foundational patient and team communication skills. Small interprofessional (IP) teams (10-12 students) facilitated by health profession faculty meet to learn with, from, and about one another. Two half- day sessions occur early in the spring semester and include a variety of team activities to practice new skills, including a simulation with a standardized patient about disclosure of a medical error. Evaluation of the iCATS curriculum occurs each spring seme ster by the CIHE Academic Leadership Team (academic deans from each health profession college), CIHE fellows/associates, individual college councils for IPE and the CIHE advisory board. As reflected in the below table, previous to the current curriculum of two half -day sessions, there were six sessions that were deemed to be too long (student feedback) and taxing (faculty feedback) and resulted in outcomes in the 2 -3 range on a 1 -5 scale. The new curriculum gives students an opportunity to work in small IP faculty facilitated interprofessional teams to understand and practice the PEEER (Plain Language, Engagement, Empathy, Empowerment, Respect) communication model and develop a transition of care plan for a simulated patient (day one). On day two, these same teams solidify these skills, en vivo, by participating in a team -based 25 simulation with a standardized patent. As a result, student satisfaction increased significantly without compromising student learning outcomes as reflected in Table II B -2 Selected iC ATS Outcomes. Table IIC -2 Selected iCATS Outcomes Question Year CSD PAS PT COD COM CON COP CPH CSW Overall Overall, the iCATS experience I was successfully able to interact with other students outside my own profession. class meetings was appropriate. 2016/17 iCATS experience has provided me with a foundational understanding of interprofessional education and team - based collaboration in health 4.47 There was an appropriate variety of learning formats for the activities (pre-work reading, class discussion, partner/small group work, videos, online discussion board, Science & Disorders; PAS = Physician Assistant Studies; PT = Physical Therapy: COD= Dentistry; - Public Health; CSW = Social Work First-Aid Friday Peer Study Groups (FAF) is a study hall resource for undergraduate nursing students, offered Fridays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., to provide tutoring and skills practice opportunities outside lab/classroom times. Upper- class student tutors are available to assist study groups with nursing content questions. Graduate nursing students provide skill support. Nursing students who fail any NUR course are at risk and are referred to FAF as part of their plan for success. Attendance is monitored and in some cases the correlation can be made between participation at FAF and a successful outcome the second time through a course. Data indicate that students in the first two semesters of the sophomore year continue to be the most frequent users of FAF. Qualitative reports highlight these students find this experience to be a relaxed and inviting where they can work in focused study groups, practice NCLEX- type questions on the computer software, and practice nursing skills. They further describe becoming competent in performing many nursing skills specific to the nursing lab (e.g., sterile dressing changes, medication injections, vital signs). The Dose, published three times/semester, is an emailed newsletter managed by the academic program specialist that focuses on information specifically for undergraduate nursing students. It continues to be a 26 consistent way to communicate with undergraduate students and includes scholarship and job opportunities, community service, and CON student and faculty updates, while also highlighting student's successes. Qualitative assessments of both students and faculty alike describe the Dose as a we lcoming and informative student - centered CON publication. II-D. The chief nurse administrator of the nursing unit: is a registered nurse (RN); holds a graduate degree in nursing; holds a doctoral degree if the nursing unit offers a graduate program in nursing; is vested with the administrative authority to accomplish the mission, goals, and expected program outcomes; and provides effective leadership to the nursing unit in achieving its mission, goals, and expected program outcomes. Elaboration: The administrative authority of the chief nurse administrator is comparable to that of chief administrators of similar units in the institution. He or she consults, as appropriate, with faculty and other communities of interest to make decisions to accomplish the mission, goals, and expected program outcomes. The chief nurse administrator is an effective leader of the nursing unit. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Janie Heath, PhD, appointed Dean and Warwick Professor of Nursing for the UK College of Nursing in August of 2014 (Dr. Patricia Howard served as Interim Dean from December 2012 until August 2014) and has demonstrated to be well qualified to lead the College in its pursuit of its mission and strategic goals. Dr. Heath was previously the Chief Academic Officer for the University of Virginia School of Nursing. She also held aca demic nursing leadership positions and taught at the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta, Georgia, Georgetown University in Washington, DC and the University of South Carolina in Columbia, South Carolina. Dr. Heath has been awarded over $12 million for academic and/or research initiatives, generated over 160 publications and presentations, and provided leadership for numerous national and regional organizations to build a culture of health and strengthen the nursing workforce, including Board of Directors for the American Association of Critical Care Nurses. Dr. Heath earned her associate and bachelor's degree in nursing from Cameron University in Lawton, Oklahoma, an MS in nursing from the University of Oklahoma, a post-masters Adult Nurse Practitioner certificate from the University of South Carolina, a PhD from George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia and a Management and Leadership in Education Program certificate from Harvard Graduate Institute of Higher Education. Dr. Heath has served in a faculty role since 1994 and has a sustained program of funded research in tobacco control. She was inducted as a Fellow of the American Academy of Nursing in 2007, a Fellow of the National Academies of Practice in 2014 and a Fellow of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners in 2017. The University of Oklahoma recently honored her as the inaugural Distinguished College of Nursing Alumni. Dr. Heath is also recognized for her national leadership with the American Association of Co lleges of Nursing, the American Academy of Nursing and her board service on the Friends of National Institute for Nursing Research as well as her state service as President of the Kentucky Nursing Action Coalition. Dr. Heath's teaching and scholarship at UK have focused on tobacco control, nursing professionalism, care of acute and critically care populations and academic clinical partnerships. She is actively engaged in teaching and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students specifically addressing topics/lectures related to executive and clinical leadership, cultivating practices for resilience, and student mental health and wellness. She is the senior health profession college dean at the University and is known for her high level of engagement and co nnection with students. As Chair of the Board of Directors for the UK Center for Interprofessional Health Education (CIHE) she has also influenced learning experiences for 1,600 students across 10 colleges at the University through 12 CIHE program offerings facilitated by 275 faculty participants. The colleges at the University of Kentucky function with a high degree of autonomy and Dr. Heath has the same budgetary, decision -making and evaluation authority as other deans. She reports directly to the provost 27 of the University and has a dotted line to the Executive Vice President of Health Affairs at UK HealthCare. As CON Dean, Dr. Heath consults with faculty and students routinely to make decisions about strategic initiatives/goals/challenges. She convenes bi- weekly meetings of her Dea ns Council, Faculty Council, and monthly Faculty Organization meetings. She also seeks input from individual tenured/non- tenured faculty, on teaching, scholarship/research, practice, and service innovations. In addition, she meets twice a year with the Dean's Advisory Board and the Dean's Diversity Board, a group of donors, business and healthcare executives, community partners, alumni, and faculty, to seek guidance for advancing CON initiatives. Recently the faculty surprised Dr. Heath with an award for her leadership during a triple crisis with state budget cuts, pandemic, and social/racial injustice. Dean Heath recognizes the many challenges facing academic nurse leaders today and has enthusiastically embraced opportunities to advocate for and garner resources to advance CON strategic initiatives to advance academic programming, research, practice, and service. She has been recognized by the University for her active engagement with the UK Capital Campaign, advancement, and retention of black faculty, increased financial support from UKHC, support of military students, rural health outreach and University wide collaborative research. Dr. Heath's signature mark for effective leadership ov er the past 7 years is building a culture that promotes healthy working and learning environments for students, faculty, and staff to reach their full potential. II-E. Faculty are: sufficient in number to accomplish the mission, goals, and expected program outcomes; academically prepared for the areas in which they teach; and experientially prepared for the areas in which they teach. Elaboration: The faculty (full- time, part -time, adjunct, tenured, non -tenured, or other) for each degree and post -graduate APRN certificate program are sufficient in number and qualifications to achieve the mission, goals, and expected program outcomes. The program defines faculty workloads. Faculty -to- student ratios provide adequate supervision and evaluation and meet or exceed the requirements of regulatory agencies and professional nursing standards and guidelines. Faculty are academically prepared for the areas in which they teach. Academic preparation of faculty includes degree specialization, sp ecialty coursework, or other preparation sufficient to address the major concepts included in courses they teach. Faculty teaching in the nursing program have a graduate degree. The program provides a justification for the use of any faculty who do not hav e a graduate degree. Faculty who are nurses hold current RN licensure. Faculty teaching in clinical/practicum courses are experienced in the clinical area of the course and maintain clinical expertise. Clinical expertise may be maintained through clinical practice or other avenues. Faculty teaching in advanced practice clinical courses meet certification and practice requirements as specified by the relevant regulatory and specialty bodies. Advanced practice nursing tracks are directly overseen by faculty who are nationally certified in that same population -focused area of practice in roles for which national certification is available. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. Although stretched with recent rapid growth in undergraduate and graduate nursing programs, faculty are accomplishing the mission, goals, and expected student and faculty outcomes and are academically and experientially prepared for the areas in which they teach (Table IIE- 1: Faculty Qualifications). The CON continues to recruit and retain qualified faculty members and as of December 2020 there are four vacant, approved, tenure- track, full- time position s posted. A testament to the overall quality of faculty are 39 faculty/faculty emeriti are Fellows in national societies/organizations and three have been designated as Living Legends by the American Academy of Nursing. Faculty Academic Preparation Of the 68 full- time faculty, 58 (85%) are doctorally -prepared and the remainder hold the MSN degree, 28 except for the writing specialist who holds an MFA. The Associate and Assistant Deans for the respective programs assign faculty members to teach specified courses based on their academic preparation as well as their clinical and/or research expertise. The numbers and percentage of full-time faculty by rank are: 14 (21%) tenured professors; track research assistant professor; 13 (19%) non -tenure track clinical associate and assistant professors; 2 (3%) instructors; 5 (7%) senior lecturers; and 10 (15%) lecturers. In addition, the CON also draws on the expertise of 75 part -time faculty members, 21 adjunct faculty, and four faculty with joint appointments in the CON - two from the College of Medicine, one from the Colleg e of Public Health, and one from the College of Education. Faculty FTE The FTE faculty required by each program is determined by the Associate Deans based on the number and type of courses and clinical sections needed and the number of students enrolled or anticipated to enroll in the various courses/programs. Some faculty members teach and/or advise across programs. The Faculty Workload Policy Statement for UK is available in the Administrative Regulations . Distribution of Effort (DOE)/workload continues to be the responsibility of the Senior Administrator (Senior Associate Dean, Associate Dean of Undergraduate Faculty & Interprofession al Education Affairs, Associate Dean of MSN and DNP Faculty & Practice Affairs, and Associate Dean for Research) with careful consideration of each faculty member's interests, engagement and responsibilities in the areas of teaching, service/practice, research and scholarship. In general, the process used for assigning DOE includes expecting tenure -track/tenured faculty to teach two courses each semester in addition to meeting service/practice and scholarship commitments. Tenure -track faculty, in their first two years, are allocated lighter teaching loads to support their research trajectory. Full -time, non -tenure track faculty are commonly expected to teach a combination of didactic, clinical and/or laboratory classes each week. Clinical title series faculty are expected to integrate faculty practice (direct care services or indirect care services) one day a week or as negotiated with their Associate Dean. Administrative responsibilities for Assistant Deans and track coordinators are also allocated in the DOE document. Faculty Experiential Preparation All CON faculty, where appropriate, that are nurses hold an unencumbered Registered Nurse (RN) licensure in Kentucky. This is verified online at the Kentucky Board of Nursing (KBN) website each fall semester by staff in the offices of the Dean and Associate Deans for their group of direct reports. Faculty who teach advanced practice clinical courses meet relevant certification and practice requirements of regulatory and specialty bodies. Thirty (44%) of the full- time, graduate faculty hold certifications in their specialt y areas. Of the 68 full- time faculty members, 15 teach in the DNP/Certificate Programs and 36 faculty members teach in the Undergraduate Program (excludes faculty teaching in PhD program). In the DNP/Certificate Programs, 15 (100%) of the full- time faculty hold a doctoral degree. In the Undergraduate Program, 20 (61%) of the full- time faculty hold a doctoral degree. Of the full - and part-time faculty teaching in the Undergraduate Program, 10 are certified in their area of specialty. Two of the master's prepared faculty members are pursuing doctoral degrees. Clinical instructor faculty are selected based on their expertis e. Currently, seven (93%) hold an MSN or higher and five (0.06%) hold a BSN degree. Graduate faculty members teaching in clinical courses are encouraged to maintain an active clinical practice as part of their DOE. This is considered important not only to maintain individual expertise but also to ensure effective role models, update and enrich teaching, and develop quality clinical teaching sites. Clinical practice also provides opportunities to demonst rate innovative nursing practice and serves as a basis for scholarship. Faculty have been encouraged and provided with administrative support to develop innovative relationships with practice settings. Currently, 20 faculty members (29% of full- time faculty) participate in various faculty practice venues (direct billing services and/or indirect care services) as part of their assigned workload, including community clinics, mobile/telemedicine clinics, and acute care settings. In 2016, UKHC established a new process for non -tenure track faculty who are doctorally -prepared to be selected for a Clinical Scholar Appointment to help facilitate nursing scholarship and research. Faculty/Student Ratios Faculty -to-student ratios ensure adequate supervision and evalu ation; they also meet regulatory 29 requirements and professional nursing standards and guidelines. The ratio of undergraduate students to faculty in the clinical setting is no more than 10 students to one faculty member, which is consistent with the guidelin es set forth by the KBN. A 1:8 ratio is maintained in the high acuity clinical areas to promote patient safety and enhance quality learning opportunities for students. During NUR 413 - Synthesis of Clinical Knowledge for Nursing Practice, each student is placed with a preceptor (1:1 ratio). Documentation available in the Virtual Resource Room. The criteria for the ratio of faculty to graduate student clinical supervision was derived from the NONPF NTF criteria and delineated in the CON's Workload policy for faculty DOE. Faculty workload is typically 1:6 ratio for a three- credit course with additional time given if more than six graduate students are assigned. Preceptors are based on a 1:1 ratio. Documentation available in the Virtual Resource Room. II-F. Preceptors (e.g., mentors, guides, coaches), if used by the program as an extension of faculty, are academically and experientially qualified for their role. This key element is not applicable to a degree or certificate program that does not use preceptors. Elaboration: The roles and performance expectations for preceptors with respect to teaching, supervision, and student evaluation are: clearly defined and communicated to preceptors; congruent with the mission, goals, and expected student outcomes; congruent with relevant professional nursing standards and guidelines; and reviewed periodically and revised as appropriate. Preceptors have the expertise to support student achievement of expected outcomes. The program ensures that preceptor performance meets expectations. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. Students in the BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate programs all participate in clinical experiences with preceptors in practice settings. The goal of the CON is to provide clinical experiences that prepare the student for practice in a variet y of settings based on both the requirements of the program and student needs. The CON track coordinators facilitate this process, ensuring students are assigned knowledgeable and experienced clinicians as preceptors and that meet the criteria of the CON for precepting students. Once the faculty member identifies an agency and preceptor, they complete a Clinical Education Request Form which is submitted to the CON's practice & clinical engagement contract administrator. The contract administrator negotiates the specifics of the contractual agreement in collaboration with the UKHC legal department. This includes defining the goals and responsibilities of both the clinical site and the CON in addition to providing proof of licensure, malpractice, and HIPAA compliance. This agreement is in place prior to the student's experience. Databases of preceptors and clinical facilities are maintained electronically by the CON and the UK Legal Office and are updated every five years as needed. Documentation available in the Virtual Resource Room . BSN students are assigned to a preceptor during the Synthesis course. Students are placed wit h a preceptor at a 1:1 ratio. The Synthesis course was designed to provide opportunities to develop independence and competence in applying principles of care management and leadership to nursing practice in a variety of clinical settings. Synthesis students are paired with nurse preceptors for a 175-hour clinical practicum during the last semester of their senior year (KBN requires 120 hours). The students also devote 25 clinical hours developing a formal clinical reflection paper and presentation, which is a requirement of the University. CON clinical faculty oversee the student clinical experience and are responsible for evaluating student success. Nurse preceptors provide personal guidance and direct supervision as students deliver bedside clinical care or engage in public health nursing. Preceptors submit formal, written evaluation comments about student performance to clinical faculty at the mid-point and at the end of the rotation. Documentation available in the Virtual Resource Room. Clinical preceptors are oriented to their role by the clinical course coordinator. The Undergraduate preceptor handbook, available in the Virtual Resource Room , contains information regarding the role and responsibility of the student, preceptor and faculty and is reviewed with the preceptor prior to beginning the 30 semester. Faculty review preceptor and clinical site evaluations to determine if specific preceptor s and sites are conducive to the achievement of the student learning outcomes. If during the student's clinical rotation, they are not meeting the student learning outcomes and is related to either concerns with the preceptor or clinical site, the student clinical assignment is changed. Lastly, if issues with either the preceptor or clinical site cannot be resolved, they are not used in future semesters. Clinical assignments for the specialty courses of the DNP and Post-Graduate APRN Certificate options are also assigned at a 1:1 student to preceptor ratio, and on average a faculty to student ratio of 1:6. Preceptors are recruited by the track coordinators; sometimes the requests of individual students may be taken into consideration. The minimum educational requirements for preceptors are advanced practice preparation, experience in the specialty area in which the stu dent will practice (e.g., NP) verification of unencumbered and unrestricted licensure, and certification, if applicable. The minimum practice experience for preceptors is one - year practicing in their current role, but most of the advanced practice precept ors have been in practice for several years. Both students and faculty evaluate the preceptor and clinical site after each experience. Documents available in the Virtual Resource Room. Clinical preceptors are oriented to their role by the specialty track coordinators and faculty assigned for clinical supervision of students. They receive a Preceptor Handbook, available in the Virtual Resource Room, with details regarding their role, the student's role and faculty's role, and a signed form is returned indic ating their understanding. They are provided with a course syllabus and with ongoing opportunities for dialogue with course faculty via site visits. Ongoing evaluation by the faculty consists of phone or email contact with the preceptor in addition to week ly patient encounter logs, in Typhon, by each student during their clinical experience, which is reviewed by the faculty. The MSN students and those in the executive leadership in healthcare and clinical leadership in healthcare tracks of the DNP program work with a preceptor as approved by the student's advisor, who has expertise in the student's area of interest for their project. The preceptor may consult with the student throughout the program and may participate in the student's committee. It is preferred that preceptors are prepared at the doctoral level. The preceptors are oriented to their role by the track coordinator and faculty assigned for clinical supervision of students. They receive a Preceptor Handbook, available in the Virtual Resource Room, with details regarding their role, the student's role and faculty's role, and a signed form is returned indicating their understanding. They are provided with a course syllabus and with ongoing opportunities for dialogue with course faculty via site visits. Ongoing evaluation by the faculty consists of phone or email contact with the preceptor in addition to weekly logs, in Canvas\u00ae, by each student during their clinical experience, which is reviewed by the course faculty. II-G. The parent institution and program provide and support an environment that encourages faculty teaching, scholarship, service, and practice in keeping with the mission, goals, and expected faculty outcomes. Elaboration: Institutional support is available to promote faculty outcomes congruent with defined expectations of the faculty role (full- time, part -time, adjunct, tenured, non -tenured, or other) and in support of the mission, goals, and expected faculty outcomes. Faculty have opportunities for ongoing development in teaching. If scholarship is an expected faculty outcome, the institution provides resources to support faculty scholarship. If service is an expected faculty outcome, expected service is clearly defined and supported. If practice is an expected faculty outcome, opportunities are provided for faculty to maintain practice competence. Institutional support ensures that currency in clinical practice is maintained for faculty in roles that require it. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in co mpliance with this Key Element. The University supports and encourages faculty in the roles of teaching, scholarship, service, and practice. The University provides a wealth of opportunities for nursing faculty to engage in the multi- dimensional mission 31 of teaching, scholarship, service, and practice. While each of these types of activities is valued and encouraged, CON structures and processes allow for role assignments and progressions that accentuate individual strengths and interests. For example, the CON follows UK's five different types of faculty appointments: Regular Title Series - a traditional tenure- track with emphasis on re search and teaching; Clinical Title Series - non-tenure eligible with an emphasis on practice and teaching; Special Title Series - a tenure -track hybrid combination with the teaching, scholarship, service and practice expectations, as appropriate and individualized to the role; Research Title Series - non-tenure eligible with an emphasis on research; and Lecture Title Series - non-tenure eligible with an emphasis on t eaching. The DOE percentage is illustrated in Table IIG -1: Faculty Distribution of Effort by Title Series . Additionally, the CON engages several experts from nursing and other health -related disciplines as part-time, adjunct, and voluntary faculty members. Table IIG -1 Faculty Distribution of Effort by Title Series Teaching Research/ Scholarship Practice Service Regular Title 5-10% Teaching Support Faculty members have opportunities for ongoing development in teaching and pedagogy, research and scholarship, specialty practice, and service. Newly hired faculty members are paired with a senior faculty mentor to assist them with tasks such as syllabus preparation, content development, and classroom management. For example, new faculty in the undergraduate program, in conjunction with the program Associate Dean, develop a comprehensive educational and mentoring plan to support them in their new role. This is a requirement of the Kentucky Board of Nursing and exemplars can be found in the Virtual Resource Room . New faculty in the graduate programs attend a CON orientation, develop an informal plan for success and are paired with a mentor to support them in their new role. Documentation available in the Virtual Resource Room . In both programs, initially faculty mentors work closely with their mentees to assist them in acclimating to the teaching role. The Center for the Enhancement of Learning and Teaching (CELT) also offers ongoing faculty development opportunities. This department employs several instructional designers and experts in web- based delivery and technological modalities to support teaching. The mission of the CELT is to promote and support excellence in teaching and learning at UK by working collaboratively with all instructors to create engaging, innovative, and inclusive learning environments in which diverse students can excel. The Faculty Media Depot offers ongoing faculty support with the creation and conversion of audio and video materials to transition to online and alternative formats for course delivery. The services are offered primarily by appointment either in person or virtually. In addition, they have audio and video recording studios that faculty can utilize to develop professional presentations. The services are offered primarily by appointment either in person or virtually. The CON supports faculty to attend conferences at local, regional, national, and international venues through travel funds. In addition, the funds can also be used for nursing faculty to attend and present at regional, national, and international conferences. Research and Scholarship Support Ranked #14 among colleges of nursing among public universities for NIH research funding, the CON and UK offer extensive support services to assist faculty with their research and scholarship endeavors. New Regular Title Series faculty have 10- to 12-month appointments and are given 50% release time and start-up funding (e.g., $25,000 - $50,000/year x 3 years) to develop their programs of research. The Associate Dean for Research meets individually with new tenure -track faculty to develop a detailed plan for their research or scholarship trajectory and provides mentorship and individual consultations over time. The CON commits to a Distribution of Effort (DOE) /protected time for scholarship/research for n ewly-hired, Regular Title Series tenure- track faculty for a range of 30% to 55% with the expectation of funding support within three years of appointment. 32 The CON Office for Nursing Research employs two statisticians, an expert in survey development and administration, and two grants managers who provide research support to faculty members. Faculty also have access to the services of an editor and a health librarian to support their research. This office also manages the indirect funds the College receives from extramural grants. The CON houses several research groups, including the Bridging Research Efforts and A dvocacy Toward Health Environments (BREATHE) Team, the Research and Interventions for C ardiovascular Health (RICH) H eart Research Team, the P erinatal Research and Wellness Center, the Behavior Health and W ellness Environments for L iving and L earning (BH WELL) Team and the Community Health Advocacy i Nterventions Generating Equity (CHANGE) Team, which offer junior faculty the opportunity to engage with large interprofessional research teams and senior researchers. These teams have also provided small scale seed grants to support faculty research. Additionally, UK provides a variety of small scale start up grants which have helpe d to support several of our nurse investigators. Support for Practice and Service In the CON, faculty practice is one of the most prominent means of community engagement. Faculty practice serves as a basis for scholarship, and provides opportunities to maintain clinical competence and credentials, supervise and mentor students in practi ce settings, and demonstrate innovative practice models. During the past year, 20 nursing faculty members have participated in practice activities. As discussed earlier, the Phyllis D. Corbitt Center had been closed for two years due to her retirement when the CON reopened the facility. The Center serves as a practice site for several faculty members as well as a clinical site for FNP students. The Faculty Practice Council continues to foster communication among faculty practitioners, administrators, and community partners. Participants benefit from the opportunity to share information related to the College Practice Plan, as well as new developments in the work of individual faculty practitioners, and changes in advanced practice nursing across the local region and the nation. A current project of this council is to review survey results related to the landscape for faculty practice (trends and benchmark s) and make recommendations for Faculty Bylaws changes to ensure relevance of the council's purpose and core function. The CON consistently works closely with UKHC to strengthen integration of academic nursing operations. The Dean's revised organizational leadership structure assures alignment for nursing leaders to actively engage in joint strategic planning and operational management for education, practice and research. These relationships help facilitate opportunities for shared resources and practice contracts. The shared faculty positions, post -BSN Nurse Residency Program, and the annual Nursing Research Papers Day are some of the most prominent examples of these collaborative partnerships. CON faculty are also encouraged and supported to engage in a wide range of other service and engagement activities. Service time is incorporated into all faculty workload plans. All faculty members are encouraged to serve on at least two committees, including committees within the CON and those representing the larger University. Nursing faculty are active participants in UK governance, participating on the Faculty Senate, the Hea lth Care Colleges Advisory Council, the Institutional Review Boards, CIHERP, and many others. Several of the CON faculty hold leadership positions on health -related committees, boards, or offices external to the CON. When faculty are involved in key leade rship positions at the state, national, and international levels, additional workload release/distribution of effort (DOE) adjustments and financial support for participation are provided. The University and the CON have also encouraged and supported faculty to develop and expand international collaborative partnerships. For example, the University has a long -standing partnership with a community and clinic in Ecuador, referred to as Shoulder -to-Shoulder Global. Over the past five years, 20 CON students and faculty have travelled to Ecuador annually with interprofessional teams for short -term visits to provide primary care, promote public health, participate in and initiate research, and prov ide health education and health promotion to this Ecuadorian community. From 2017- 2020, active international partnerships and scholarship involving CON faculty have increased, including new activities in Ecuador, Ghana, Sweden, Peru, China, and Korea. Our global learning and engagement extended to Education Abroad programs in Costa Rica, Sweden, and the Netherlands, where 12 CON students were engaged with learning about longevity, health systems and sexual health. When the students returned from these experiences, they provided forums to educate and enrich the local population to improve health in central Kentucky. 33 In terms of cross -cultural community engagement experiences in Appalachia, the CON has continued to expand opportunities for students in eastern Kentucky. We have maintained our partnership with the College of Dentistry and the UK Center for Interprofessional Health Education to promote oral health and wellness through a program known as hCATS (health colleges advancing team skills) to Appalachia. This engagement included over 60 nursing students in 2018 and 2019, who worked with dental and other health professional students, in five elementary schools to deliver oral health care, health screening and wellness education. Since 2018, a HRSA - funded program has supported 10 CON undergraduate and graduate students to provide primary care services for Appalachians. Twenty undergraduate and graduate students and faculty participate in the Remote Area Medical (RAM) U.S.A. program providing primary care services, health screenings and wellness programs in Hazard, Kentucky. In addition to providing support and resources for teaching, research, practice and service, the CON and UK provide several awards each year to recognize exemplary performance in each of these categories. The CON hosts a year -end celebration each May where those faculty and staff members who demonstrated ex emplary accomplishments in teaching, scholarship and practice are recognized. CON award recipients are annually updated and displayed in the 3rd floor corridor \"hall of recognition.\" 34 STANDARD II Summary: Institutional Commitment and Resources Levels of Strength of Quality Strong Strength of Quality The University of Kentucky and UK Healthcare have supported the College of Nursing's mission to advance excellence with academic programming, research, clinical practice, and service through fiscal and physical resources.

The College of Nursing recognizes the challenge of rebuilding program growth by expanding academic clinical partnerships beyond UK HealthCare and Select M edical to advance nursing education. The College of Nursing recognizes the challenges of meeting and/or exceeding the UK Capital Campaign goals during a pandemic. The College of Nursing recognizes the challenges of state- budget constraints salary advances, new hires, facility upgrades and/or new building projects. The College of Nursing recognizes the challenges to rebuild faculty workforce will require intentional efforts to fill the teaching/mentoring gaps. 35 Standard III Program Quality: Curriculum and Teaching- Learning Practices The curriculum is developed in accordance with the program's mission, goals, and expected student outcomes. The curriculum reflects professional nursing standards and guidelines and the needs and expectations of t he community of interest. Teaching -learning practices are congruent with expected student outcomes. The environment for teaching -learning fosters achievement of expected student outcomes. III-A. The curriculum is developed, implemented, and revised to ref lect clear statements of expected student outcomes that: are congruent with the program's mission and goals; are congruent with the roles for which the program is preparing its graduates; and consider the needs of the program -identified community of intere st. Elaboration: Curricular objectives (e.g., course, unit, and/or level objectives or competencies as identified by the program) provide clear statements of expected learning that relate to student outcomes. Expected outcomes relate to the roles for whic h students are being prepared. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. The BSN, MSN, DNP Post -Graduate APRN Certificate programs' curricula are based on and are congruent with the mission and goals of the CON. All programs undergo formative and summative evaluations each semester and no less than every three years as outlined in the CON Systematic Process of Program Evaluation (CON SPPE) . The course syllabi for the BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate programs include clear, expected student learning outcomes (SLOs) as well as student activities to assure the course SLOs are met. The faculty developed a curriculum crosswalk for each track of the respective programs. The respective program committees evaluate all courses using a designated format and timeline and outcomes are reviewed with the course faculty. Curricula are revised based on the course review, student evaluations, faculty expertise, information from employers and the nursing standards to assure success in the program and beyond. The BSN program has undergone significant curricular revisions, specifically transitioning the second - degree track to an Accelerated BSN (ABSN) track which will include Med- Vet, second degree and Licensed Practical Nurse to Bachelor of Science in Nursing (LPN -to-BSN) students. In addition, the undergraduate faculty have made curricular revisions to the traditional and RN -BSN tr acks to improve overall efficiencies and effectiveness of teaching as well as improve retention and time to degree rates. The Program SLOs for the BSN program apply to all baccalaureate nursing students. Crosswalks have been developed for each track in the BSN program. (Appendix IIIA-1) The expected outcomes at the completion of the program are that the graduate will: Integrate knowledge, skills, and values from the arts and sciences to provide humanistic, safe, quality care (AACN Essential I: Liberal Education for Baccalaureate Generalist Nursing Practice). Demonstrate clinical reasoning in making independent and collaborative decisions in a complex health care system (AACN Essential II: Basic Organizational and Systems Leadership for Quality Care and Patient Safety) Apply a systematic process consistent with professional standards and evidence- based practice to prevent illness and injury; promote, maintain, and restore client health; or support clients toward a peaceful death (AACN Essential I II: Scholarship for Evidence- Based Practice). Demonstrate skills in using patient care technologies, information systems, and communication devices that support safe and effective care (AACN Essential IV: Information Management and Application of Patient Care Technology). Demonstrate leadership, responsibility, and accountability in addressing health care issues (AACN Essential V: Healthcare Policy, Finance, and Regulatory Environments). Employ oral and written communication and inter -professional collaboration in providing safe, high quality care to improve client health outcomes (AACN Essential VI: Interprofessional Communication and Collaboration for Improving Patient Health Outcomes). 36 Demonstrate caring, professionalism, and respect in providing nursing care to diverse populations in a variety of settings (AACN Essential VII: Clinical Prevention and Population Health). Demonstrate the professional standards of moral, ethical, and legal conduct (Essential VIII: Professionalism and Profess ional Values). Understand the scope of generalist nursing practice and apply its principles in clinical practice (Essential IX: Baccalaureate Generalist Nursing Practice). The MSN curriculum, focusing on Healthcare Systems Leadership, was developed in 201 8 and implemented in 2019. The MSN/DNP program committee reviews the curriculum to assure compliance with professional standards. The course syllabi include clear, expected SLOs as well as student activities to assure the course SLOs are met. Faculty reviewed the curriculum and developed a crosswalk for the MSN Program. (Appendix IIIA-2) The Program Student Learning Outcomes are based on the Essentials of Master's Education in Nursing for the MSN Program and are applicable to all MSN students. The expected outcomes at the completion of the program are that the graduate will: Lead change to improve quality outcomes. Advance a culture of excellence through lifelong learning. Build and lead collaborative inter- professional care teams. Navigate and integrate care services across the healthcare system. Design innovative nursing practices. Translate evidence into practice. The DNP curriculum was revised in 2015 to assure better alignment with the DNP Essentials with the SLOs in preparation for the implementation of the DNP Portfolio. The MSN/DNP program committee reviews the curriculum to assure compliance with professional nursing standards. The faculty reviewed the curriculum and developed a crosswalk for each track in the DNP program. (Appendix IIIA -3) The Program Student Learning Outcomes for the DNP Program apply to all DNP students. The expected outcomes at the completion of the program are that the graduate will: Integrate nursing science and theory with knowledge from ethics, the biophysical, psychosocial, analytical, and organizational sciences as the basis for nursing practice (AACN Essential I: Scientific Underpinnings for Practice). Demonstrate advanced organi zational and systems leadership that emphasizes practice and the ongoing improvement of health outcomes (AACN Essential II: Organizational and Systems Leadership for Quality Improvement and Systems Thinking). Generate, translates, applies, and evaluates new science/evidence to guide improvements in practice and outcomes of care (AACN Essential III: Clinical Scholarship and Analytical Methods for Evidence Based Practice). Demonstrate proficient use of information systems/ technology resources to implement quality improvement initiatives and support practice and administrative decision -making (AACN Essential IV: Information Systems/Technology and Patient Care Technology for the Improvement and Transformation of Health Care). Engage proactively in the analysis, development, and implementation of health policy at the institutional, local, state, regional, federal, or international level (AACN Essential V: Health Care Policy for Advocacy in Health Care). Employ consultative and l eadership skills with intra - and inter- professional teams to create change in health care and complex healthcare delivery systems (AACN Essential VI: Inter- professional Collaboration for Improving Patient and Population Health Outcomes). Analyze, synthesiz es, and evaluates scientific data and concepts related to clinical prevention and population health, and gaps in care of individuals, aggregates, or populations (AACN Essential VII: Clinical Prevention and Population Health for Improving the Nation's Health). Demonstrate foundational practice competencies that cut across specialties (AACN Essential VIII: Advanced Nursing Practice specialties). The MSN/DNP program committee reviews curriculum of the program to assure compliance with professional standards. The Post-Graduate APRN Certificate program curriculum is identical to the specialty core 37 of the respective tracks in the DNP program. The purpose of the Post-Graduate APRN Certificate program is intended for nurses who currently have an advanced practice graduate degree in nursing (MSN, DNP, PhD) who wish to specialize in a different population foci other than that obtained/certified in the degree program. The program is designed to broaden the cl inical knowledge in the new role change. The program student learning outcomes for the Post -Graduate APRN Certificate program apply to all APRN students and Executive Leadership students. The expected outcomes at the completion of the program are that the graduate will: Integrate nursing science and theory with knowledge from ethics, the biophysical, psychosocial, analytical, and organizational sciences as the basis for nursing practice. Translate, apply, and evaluate new science/evidence to guide improvements in practice and outcomes of care. Employ consultative and leadership skills with intra - and inter -professional teams to create change in health care and complex healthcare delivery systems. III-B. Baccalaureate curricula are developed, implemented, and revised to reflect relevant professional nursing standards and guidelines, which are clearly evident within the curriculum and within the expected student outcomes (individual and aggregate). Baccalau reate program curricula incorporate The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice (AACN, 2008). This key element is not applicable if the baccalaureate degree program is not under review for accreditation. Elaboration: The b accalaureate degree program incorporates professional nursing standards and guidelines relevant to that program and each track offered. The program clearly demonstrates where and how content, knowledge, and skills required by identified sets of standards are incorporated into the curriculum. Program Response: The BSN Program is in compliance with this Key Element. The BSN degree program is based on The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice (BSN Essentials) (AACN 2008) and the six core Quality & Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) Competencies. The BSN Essentials and QSEN Competencies (AACN, 2008) form the foundation f or the undergraduate curriculum in the CON. The core concepts of the nursing program curriculum are: Patient - Centered Care; Communication and Interprofessional Collaboration; Clinical Reasoning; Professionalism; ems and Policy; Evidence- Based Practice; Quality Improvement and Patient Safety; Information Management/Informatics; and Health Promotion and Disease and Injury Prevention. The expected student learning outcomes are consistent with the roles for which the program is preparing its graduates. The BSN Program has three entry points: Traditional BSN, ABSN (second degree, Med Vet BSN, and LPN-BSN) and RN-BSN. The curricula consist of a series of didactic courses and clinical experiences that facilitate the achievement of the program SLOs through the course content as reflected in the crosswalk documents for each track. (Appendix IIIA-1) The courses and content progress from the simple to complex as the students advance in the curriculum. In the freshman year, students complete pre- nursing requirements which provide core knowledge that prepares them for learning nursing concepts. In the sophomore year, students learn and practice fundamental nursing knowledge and skills that will be used throug hout the curriculum, with the major emphasis on health promotion and health maintenance. During this year, students spend much of their clinical time in community and skills laboratory settings. In the junior year, the focus shifts to care of the patient a nd family in several health care settings (medical -surgical, obstetrics and pediatrics), with a focus on care of patients with predictable outcomes. In the first semester of the senior year, students must bring their previous learning forward to work in the areas of psychiatric/mental health and public health. In the second semester, the curriculum begins with the care of patients with complex, unpredictable outcomes (critical care), and ends with a synthesis immersion clinical experience that facilitates students' ability to apply what they have learned while working one- to-one with a nurse preceptor. 38 These teaching learning practices facilitate the achievement of the program SLOs and the BSN Essentials (AACN, 2008). For example, a focus on critical thinking, clinical reasoning and clinical judgement can be found in all courses within the curricula. All examinations and clinical experiences require students to apply knowledge gained to enhance their ability to make sound clinical decisions. The curricular plans for each track listed below can be found on the UK CON website. Traditional BSN RN-BSN Accelerated BSN Second Degree BSN MedVet -BSN LPN-BSN Changes to the respective curriculum plans can be found in the virtual resource room. III-C. Master's curricula are developed, implemented, and revised to reflect relevant professional nursing standards and guidelines, which are clearly evident within the curriculum and within the expected student outcomes (individual and aggregate). Master's program curricula incorporate professional standards and guidelines as appropriate. a. All master's degree programs incorporate The Essentials of Master's Education in Nursing (AACN, 2011) and additional relevant professio nal standards and guidelines as identified by the program. b. All master's degree programs that prepare nurse practitioners incorporate Criteria for Evaluation of Nurse Practitioner Programs (NTF, 2016). Graduate -entry master's program curricula incorporate T he Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice (AACN, 2008) and appropriate graduate program standards and guidelines. This key element is not applicable if the master's degree program is not under review for accreditation. Elaboration: The master's degree program incorporates professional nursing standards and guidelines relevant to that program and each track offered. The program clearly demonstrates where and how content, knowledge, and skills required by i dentified sets of standards are incorporated into the curricula. Master's degree APRN education programs (i.e., clinical nurse specialist, nurse anesthesia, nurse midwife, and nurse practitioner) incorporate separate comprehensive graduate- level courses t o address the APRN core, defined as follows: Advanced physiology/pathophysiology, including general principles that apply across the lifespan; Advanced health assessment, which includes assessment of all human systems, advanced assessment techniques, concepts, and approaches; and Advanced pharmacology, which includes pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacotherapeutics of all broad categories of agents. Additional APRN core content specific to the role and population is integrated throughout the other role and population -focused didactic and clinical courses. Master's degree programs that have a direct care focus but are not APRN education programs (e.g., nurse educator and clinical nurse leader) incorporate graduate- level content addressing the APRN core. These programs are not required to offer this content as three separate courses. Program Response: The MSN Program is in compliance with this Key Element. The MSN program is based on The Essentials of Master's Education in Nursing ( MSN Essentials) (AACN , 2011). The MSN program builds on the student's undergraduate degree, and current knowledge and expertise. 39 Graduates that complete this program will have a fuller understanding of the discipline of nursing in order to engage in higher- level practice and leadership in a variety of settings and to commit to lifelong learning. The curriculum consists of a series of didactic courses and clinical experiences that facilitate the achievement of the program SLOs through the course content as reflected in the crosswalk document for the MSN program. (Appendix IIIA-2). The program prepares students to function as change agents in multi -dimensional roles in the organization and community. Research utilization, evidence- based practice, and leadership are emphasized throughout the program. The program is delivered in an online format using Zoom and the learning management system Canvas\u00ae. Teaching -learning practices are incorporated throughout the program to facilitate the achievement of the MSN Essentials (AACN, 2011) and the program SLOs for example leadership theory and its application is threaded through the didactic courses and clinical experiences which culminates in the MSN capstone practicum. The full-time and part-time curricular plans for the MSN program can be found on CON website. III-D. DNP curr icula are developed, implemented, and revised to reflect relevant professional nursing standards and guidelines, which are clearly evident within the curriculum and within the expected student outcomes (individual and aggregate). DNP program curricula incorporate professional standards and guidelines as appropriate. a. All DNP programs incorporate The Essentials of Doctoral Education for Advanced Nursing Practice (AACN, 2006) and additional relevant professional standards and guidelines if identified by the program . b. All DNP programs that prepare nurse practitioners incorporate Criteria for Evaluation of Nurse Practitioner Programs (NTF, 2016). Graduate -entry DNP program curricula incorporate The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice (AACN, 2008) and appropriate graduate program standards and guidelines. This key element is not applicable if the DNP program is not under review for accreditation. Elaboration: The DNP program incorporates professional nursing standards and guidelines relevant to that program and each track offered. The program clearly demonstrates where and how content, knowledge, and skills required by identified sets of standards are incorporated into the curricula. DNP APRN education programs (i.e., clinical nurse specialist, nurse anesthesia, nurse midwife, and nurse practitioner) incorporate separate comprehensive graduate- level c ourses to address the APRN core, defined as follows: Advanced physiology/pathophysiology, including general principles that apply across the lifespan; Advanced health assessment, which includes assessment of all human systems, advanced assessment techniques, concepts, and approaches; and Advanced pharmacology, which includes pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacotherapeutics of all broad categories of agents. Additional APRN core content specific to the role and population is integrated throughou t the other role and population -focused didactic and clinical courses. Separate courses in advanced physiology/pathophysiology, advanced health assessment, and advanced pharmacology are not required for students enrolled in post -master's DNP programs who hold current national certification as advanced practice nurses, unless the program deems this necessary. Program Response: The DNP Program is in compliance with this Key Element. The DNP Program is based on: The Essentials of Doctoral Education for Advanced Nursing Practice (DNP Essentials (AACN,2006); Criteria for Evaluation of Nurse Practitioner Programs (NONPF, 2016); Nurse Practitioner Core Competencies (NONPF, 2017); Population Focused NP Competencies (NONPF, 2013); Nurse Executive Comp etencies (AONE, 2015), and Core Practice Doctorate Clinical Nurse Specialist Competencies (NACNS, 2009) 40 for the respective foci. The DNP Program offers two entry points, BSN -DNP and MSN- DNP. The BSN -DNP entry is comprised of two advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) roles, Nurse Practitioner and Clinical Nurse Specialist, which was closed to admissions in 2019 and the two remaining students are on track to graduate in 2021. Teach out plans available in the Virtual Resource Room . The decision to close th e track was based on declining enrollment concerns and COI feedback. The six population foci areas available include: Adult - Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner (AGACNP) ; Pediatric Acute Care Nurse Practitioner (PACNP) ; Pediatric Primary Care Nurse Practitioner (PPCNP) ; Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) ; Psychiatric -Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) ; and Executive Leadership in Health Care. The MSN -DNP entry is comprised of the Clinical Leadership in Health Care in addition to the six popu lation foci previously listed. Separate courses in advanced health assessment, pathophysiology, and advanced pharmacology for advanced practice nurses are included for the APRN Roles. Based on feedback from our COI, the program transitioned from a traditio nal face -to-face delivery model to an online delivery model with an immersion component. The students attend on -campus classes twice during the semester for immersion sessions to accommodate for the components of the program which are difficult to achieve in an online environment. For example, during the first immersion, NP students enrolled in their first clinical course except for PMHNP are taught skills/techniques in suturing, ultrasound, punch biopsy, incision and draining of wounds and debridement of w ounds. The track coordinators work collaboratively to teach the skills as well as offer the opportunity for the students to experience their first collaboration with other NPs. All students in the DNP program have content related to nursing leadership, and during each immersion all DNP students are required to attend the Nursing Leadership Lecture Series, which is co-sponsored by the UK CON and UK Healthcare. Students can hear from nationally and internationally recognized nurse leaders, of which the vast majority are alumni (See Appendix IIID-1). In 2014 the University of Kentucky College of Nursing established a new off -campus instructional site, the University of Kentucky College of Nursing - Norton Healthcare Partnership (UKCON -NHC), located at 9500 Ormsby Station Road, Louisville, Kentucky 40223, and began enrolling students into the three -year, full -time DNP program. The UKCON -NHC Partnership, which ceased admissions in 2018, was not independent; it provided the same SLOs, curricular content and experiences, and assessments as the UK CON Lexington campus, and was under the authority of UK CON. The students in the partnership were enrolled in the same courses as the non - partnership students. The partnership students attended classes at the Norton Hea lth Care site while the others attend on the UK campus. The tracks offered in the DNP program at the CON-NHC site included Adult Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner, Primary Care Nurse Practitioner (Adult -Gerontology and Family), Executive Nurse Leadership, Population and Organizational Systems Leadership, and Psychiatric Mental -Health Nurse Practitioner. The didactic portion of the curriculum was delivered through a variety of hybrid modalities including face- to- face and online classes. At both sites (Lexington and Louisville), the courses met 4 -5 times per semester face- to-face, with the r emaining content accessed online through Canvas\u00ae, the University of Kentucky's learning management system. The last of the partnership students graduated in May 2020. The curricular plans are available in the Virtual Resource Room. The curricular plans fo r each track in the BSN -DNP entry and MSN -DNP entry listed below can be found on the UK CON website. BSN-DNP Adult Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner Family Nurse Practitioner Pediatric Acute Care Nurse Practitioner Pediatric Primary Care Nurse Practitioner Psychiatric -Mental Health Nurse Practitioner Executive Leadership in Health Care o Full-Time Plan of Study o Part-Time Plan of Study MSN-DNP Adult Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner Family Nurse Practitioner Pediatric Acute Care Nurse Practitioner Pediatric Primary Care Nurse Practitioner Psychiatric -Mental Health Nurse Practitioner Executive Leadership in Health Care o Full-Time Plan of Study o Part-Time Plan of Study III-E. Post-graduate APRN certificate program curricula are developed, implemented, and revised to reflect relevant professional nursing standards and guidelines, which are clearly evident within the curriculum and within the expected student outcomes (individual and aggregate). Post -graduate 41 APRN certificate programs that prepare nurse practitioners incorporate Criteria for Evaluation of Nurse Practitioner Programs (NTF, 2016). This key element is not applicable if the post -graduate APRN certificate program is not under review for accreditation. Elaboration: The post -graduate APRN certificate program incorporates professional nursing standards and guidelines relevant to that program and each track offered. The program clearly demonstrates where and how content, k nowledge, and skills required by identified sets of standards are incorporated into the curricula. APRN education programs (i.e., clinical nurse specialist, nurse anesthesia, nurse midwife, and nurse practitioner) incorporate separate comprehensive graduate -level courses to address the APRN core, defined as follows: Advanced physiology/pathophysiology, including general principles that apply across the lifespan; Advanced health assessment, which includes assessment of all human systems, advanced assessment techniques, concepts, and approaches; and Advanced pharmacology, which includes pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacotherapeutics of all broad categories of agents. Additional APRN core content specific to the role and population is integrated throughout the other role- and population -focused didactic and clinical courses. Separate courses in advanced physiology/pathophysiology, advanced health assessment, and advanced pharmacology are not required for certificate students who have already completed such courses, unless the program deems this necessary. Program Response: The Post -Graduate Certificate Program is in compliance with this Key Element. The Post-Graduate APRN Certificate program is based on components of the MSN Essentials (AACN, 2011); DNP Essentials (AACN, 2006); Criteria for Evaluation of Nurse Practitioner Programs (NONPF, 2016); and Nurse Practitioner Core Competencies (NONPF, 2017) for the respective population foci. A Gap Analysis is completed on the student transcripts to determine which courses can be transferred in and those that will need to be taken as part of the Post-Graduate APRN Certificate program. Examples available in the Virtual Resource Room . If the student has not completed advanced health assessment, advance d pharmacology, and advanced pathophysiology as three separate courses they will complete those as a component of the program. The curriculum for the Post- Graduate APRN Certificate Program consists of the specialty courses in the DNP program. The students are integrated with the DNP students to attend on -campus classes twice during the semester for immersion sessions to accommodate for the components of the program that are difficult to achieve in an online environment. During immersion, the Post -Graduate APRN Certificate students participate in the same planned activities as the DNP students in the respective population foci. For example, during immersion II, students in the PMHNP track conduct a simulated diagnostic interview to develop a treatment plan. Graduates of the Post -Graduate APRN Certificate program (Adult Gerontology Acute Care NP, Family NP, Psychiatric Mental Health NP, Pediatric Acu te Care NP, and Pediatric Primary Care NP) are educated to make application to take the national certification examination in the selected population foci. The curricular plans for each track in the Post-Graduate APRN Certificate program can be found in the Virtual Resource Room and are posted on the following UK CON website . III-F. The curriculum is logically structured to achieve expected student outcomes. Baccalaureate curricula build on a foundation of the arts, sciences, and humanities. Master's curricula build on a foundation comparable to baccalaureate -level nursing knowledge. DNP curricula build on a baccalaureate and/or master's foundation, depending on the level of entry of the student. Post-graduate APRN certificate programs build on graduate -level nursing competencies and knowledge base. 42 Elaboration: Baccalaureate degree programs demonstrate that knowledge from courses in the arts, sciences, and humanities is incorporated into nursing practice. Graduate- entry programs in nursing incorporate the generalist knowledge common to baccalaureate nursing education as delineated in The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice (AACN, 2008) as well as advanced nursing knowledge. Graduate programs are clearly based on a foundation comparable to a baccalaureate degree in nursing. Graduate programs delineate how students who do not have a baccalaureate degree in nursing acquire the knowledge and competencies comparable to baccalaureate education in nursing as a foundation for advanced nursing education. Programs that move students from basic nursing preparation (e.g., associate degree or diploma education) to a graduate degree demonstrate how these students acquire the baccalaureate- level knowledge and competencies delineated in The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice (AACN, 2008), even if they do not award a baccalaureate degree in nursing in addition to the graduate degree. DNP programs, whether post -baccalaureate or post -master's, demonstrate how students acquire the doctoral- level know ledge and competencies delineated in The Essentials of Doctoral Education for Advanced Nursing Practice (AACN, 2006). If the program awards the master's degree as part of the DNP program, the program demonstrates how students acquire the master's- level knowledge and competencies delineated in The Essentials of Master's Education in Nursing (AACN, 2011) and, if applicable, Criteria for Evaluation of Nurse Practitioner Programs (NTF, 2016) . The program provides a rationale for the sequence of the curriculum for each program. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. Baccalaureate Program The BSN Program is built upon a foundation of arts, sciences, and humanities through the required UK Core curriculum plan and support coursework. The 30 -credit hour UK Core curriculum is based on a set of SLOs that all students are expected to be able to demonstrate upon completion of a baccalaureate degree. The UK Core SLOs with the course areas are reflected in Table IIIF -1: UK Core Student Learning Outcome by Course Area. Nursing students are required to fulfill 10 credit hours of UK Core that support th eir educational foundations including psychology, biology, and statistics. In addition, they take Anatomy and Physiology I & II, Chemistry for Health Professionals, Microbiology, and Introductory Nutrition. Learning is viewed as being cumulative, with each level in the curriculum building on the previous levels. The foundation is laid in the UK Core courses and is critical to the development of the professional nurse and aligns with the UK CON Mission, Vision and Values statement . The UK College of Nursing provides three entry options for students to attain a Baccalaure ate of Science in Nursing: Traditional BSN, ABSN, and RN-BSN. The curriculum for each track has been revised and is delivered in a block format as reflected in the descriptions for each track. The curriculum for each track contains both didactic and clinical courses to assist students in the achievement of the BSN Essentials and the BSN program outcomes. Through these courses, students gain the needed knowledge and skills to provide direct and indirect care using the nursing process, integrating evidence -based practice, clinical judgement, and quality improvement activities. Table IIIF -1: UK Core Student Learning Outcome by Course Area UK Core SLO Course Area Credit Hour I. Students will demonstrate an understanding of 1. The Nature of Inquiry in Arts and Creativity 2.

Students will demonstrate and understanding of the complexities of citizenship and the process for making informed choices as engaged citizens in a diverse, multilingual world. 1. Community, Cultural and Citizenship in the USA 2. Global Dynamics 3 3 The traditional BSN curriculum is a full -time, four -year degree comprised of 120 credit hours, which includes the 30 -credit hour UK Core as reflected on the UK Registrar's websit e. During their first year, students complete most of the UK Core requirements and the pre-major courses. Students complete the pre-major courses (25 credits) with a minimum of a C grade and include: ANA 109 Anatomy and Physiology for Nursing I and ANA 110 Anatomy and Physiology for Nursing II (8 credits); BIO 103 Basic Ideas of Biology (3 credits); CHE 103 Chemistry for Health Professionals (4 credits); CIS/WRD I Composition and Communication I and CIS/WRD II Composition and Communication II (6 credits); and PSY 100 Introduction to Psychology (4 credits). Students also complete the UK required Graduation Composition and Communication Requirement (11 credits). This requirement is embedded in NUR 200 Foundations for Professional Nursing (2 credits) ; NUR 310 Research for Evidence- Based Nursing Practice (3 credits); and NUR 413 Synthesis of Clinical Knowledge for Nursing Practice (6 credits). Beginning in their second year students complete additional courses in BIO 208 Principles of Microbiology (3 credits); DHN 212 Introduction to Nutrition (3 credits); and STA 210 Introduction to Statistical Reasoning or BST 230 Statistical Thinking in Public Health (3 credits). These courses provide the foundational knowledge of the arts, sciences, and humanities on which the program is built. The nursing courses comprise 68 credit hours (57%) of the total credits required for graduation and 47 credit hours (69%) are upper -division level. UK Core requirements account for 30 credit hours (26%) of the total credit hours. A sample plan of study of the nursing courses can be found on the UK CON website and course syllabi are available in the Virtual Resource Room . The ABSN track curriculum is a full -time, consecutive 24 -month curriculum comprised of 66 credit hours in nursing for a total of 120 credit hours, which includes meeting the 30- credit hour UK Core requirements. All applicants who have completed a bachelor's degree in another field meet the requirement by virtue of their first degree as reflected on the UK Registrar's website . As a component of the admission requirements, students must meet the UK Core and pre-major requirements. The pre-major courses include: ANA 109 Anatomy and Physiology for Nursing I and ANA 110 Anatomy and Physiology for Nursing II (8 credits); or ANA 209 Principles of Human Anatomy (3 credits); BIO 103 Basic Ideas of Biology (3 credits); or BIO 148 Introductory Biology I (3 credits); CHE 103 Chemistry for Hea lth Professionals (4 credits); or CHE 104 Introductory General Chemistry (3 credits) and CHE 108 Introduction to Inorganic, Organic and Biochemistry without laboratory (3 credits); or CHE 105 General College Chemistry I (4 credits) and Che 107 General College Chemistry II (3 credits); and PSY 100 Introduction to Psychology (4 credits). Students also complete the UK -required Graduation Composition and Communication Requirement (8-10 credits). This requirement is embedded in NUR 321 Introduction to Health Promotion for ABSN Students (2 credits); NUR 328 Research for Evidence Based Nursing Practice for the ABSN (3 credits); and NUR 426 Synthesis of Clinical Nursing Knowledge for the ABSN Track (3- 5 credits). Students complete additional courses in BIO 208 Principles of Microbiology (3 credits); DHN 212 Introduction to Nutrition (3 credits); and STA 210 An Introduction to Statistical Reasoning or BST 230 Statistical Thinking in Public Health or STA 296 Statistical Methods and Motivations (3 credits). Th e curriculum culminates in NUR 426 - Synthesis of Clinical Nursing Knowledge for the ABSN Track where students integrate knowledge from previous courses to develop independence and competence in applying principles of care management and leadership to nurs ing practice in a variety of settings. The course syllabi are available in the Virtual Resource Room and a sample plan of study of the nursing courses can be found on the UK CON website . The RN -BSN track may be completed in either a two -year, consecutive part -time option or a one -year, consecutive full -time option. The tr ack is comprised of 30 -33 credits hours in nursing, for a total of 120 credits which includes meeting the 30 -hour UK Core requirements. The UK Core curriculum requirement for RN -BSN students is as follows: Per the General Education Transfer Agreement (GETA ), students who earn an Associate of Arts or an Associate of Science degree are considered to have met the general education requirements of the UK 44 CORE. Students who earn an Associate of Applied Science (which includes most students from Kentucky Community and Technical College System [KCTCS] schools) must complete general education requirements of the UK Core. If they have not met the UK Core with their previous degree, then they will complete those courses in addition to the nursing courses as reflected on the UK Registrar's website . Students also complete the UK -required Graduation Composition and Communication Requirement (8 credits). This requirement is embedded in NUR 350 Concepts in Professional Nursing (5 credits) and NUR 453 Nursing Practice Capstone for Registered Nurses for the RN -BSN Track (3 credits). The curriculum culminates in NUR 453 - Nursing Clinical Practice Capstone for the RN-BSN Track where students apply principles of patient safety, quality improvement, interprofessional teamwork, informatics, leadership and evidence- based research to nursing practice in a variety of clinical settings. For example, students complete an as signment assessing safety, quality, and high reliability characteristics of the organization. Based on their assessment, they identify attributes that are excellent with rationale and attributes that require improvement with rationale. From their assessmen t and evidence- based literature review they develop a plan with measurable outcomes to evaluate the plan. Other examples available in the Virtual Resource Room . A sample plan of study can be found on the UK CON website . Master's Program The MSN curriculum builds on the knowledge, skills and experience gained at the baccalaureate level. Students complete either the five- semester, full -time plan of study or the eight -semester, part -time plan of study. The curriculum has 38 credits hours whi ch build in complexity as the student progresses through the program. The curriculum consists of both didactic and practicum courses to assist in the achievement of the MSN Essentials and the MSN program outcomes. The core of the curriculum includes theory , research, leadership, and evidence- based practice. The students complete nine credit hours of practicum focusing on leading change, healthy work environments, and completing their capstone project. The curriculum culminates in NUR 660 - MSN Capstone Course where the student applies theory, principles, and processes learned during the program, which leads to a written proposal and oral presentation on an identified practice issue and the evidence- based innovation to address the issue. Since we have not a student enrolled in this an example is not available to include. The sample plans of study are available on the UK CON website . DNP Program The DNP curriculum is logically structured and builds on the knowledge, skills and experience gained at the previous level as well as the NTF criteria, NONPF Core & Specialty Core and AONE guidelines to achieve the expected outcomes. Students in the BSN -DNP bu ild on the baccalaureate level and complete either the eight - semester, full-time plan of study or a 14- or 11-semester, part-time plan of study. Students in the BSN-DNP entry have six population foci from which to choose. These include: Adult Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner ; Family Nurse Practitioner ; Pediatric Acute Care Nurse Practitioner; Pediatric P rimary Care Nurse Practitioner ; Psychiatric -Mental Health Nurse Practitioner ; and Executive Leadership in Health Care. The BSN -DNP curriculum for the nurse practitioner tracks consists of both didactic (core and specialty) and clinical (specialty) courses (74 credit hours) to assist in the achievement of the DNP Essentials, NOPF Core & Specialty Core and the DNP program outcomes. For example, BSN-DNP students are expected to have coursework in research/evidence- based practice, theory, health assessment, pathophysiology, and pharmacology in their baccalaureate program. That coursework provides the foundation for NUR 915 (Evaluating Evidence for Research and Evidence -Based Practice), NUR 924 (Concepts, Theories, and Models for Advanced Practice Nursing), NUR 923 (Applications of Advanced Health Assessment), NUR 921 (Pathophysiology) and NUR 922 (Advanced Pharmacology for Advanced Practice Nurses) courses in the BSN -DNP option. The concepts learned in those courses are reinforced in the specialty courses. For example, in the PMHNP courses students evaluate the evidence to identify best practices for the treatment of selected mental health disorders. The BSN -DNP curricul um for the executive leadership track consists of both didactic (core and specialty) and clinical (specialty) courses (67 credit hours) to assist in the achievement of the DNP Essentials, AONE guidelines and DNP program outcomes. The curriculum culminates in NUR 910 - DNP Project where the student applies knowledge from the program to identify a practi ce issue and intervention, which they implement at a selected site and then they evaluate the outcome of the intervention. The student completes a written paper and oral presentation of their project. Rubrics for the paper and presentation available in the Virtual Resource Room . The MSN -DNP curriculum builds on the knowledge, skills and experience gained at the master's level. 45 Students in the MSN-DNP program complete either the six-semester, full-time plan of study or the eight -semester, part-time plan of study. The curriculum has 38-44 credit hours depending on the track. Students in the MSN-DNP entry have seven population foci to choose. These include: Adult Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner ; Family Nurse Practitioner ; Pediatric Acute Care Nurse Practitioner; Pediatric Primary Care Nurse Practitioner ; Psychiatric -Mental Health Nurse Practitioner ; Executive Leadership in Health Care and Clinical Leadership in Health Care . Students take the same didactic and clinical course s as do the BSN -DNP students. The curriculum culminates in NUR 910 - DNP Project, where the student applies knowledge from the program to identify a practice issue and intervention, which they implement at a selected site and then evaluate the outcome of t he intervention. The student completes a written paper and oral presentation of their project. Rubrics for the paper and presentation available in the Virtual Resource Room . Post-Graduate APRN Certificate Program The Post-Graduate APRN Certificate curriculum builds on the knowledge, skills, and experiences at either the master's or doctoral level. The curriculum consists of both specialty didactic and clinical courses (19- 22 credit hours). Students are integrated into the specialty cours es with the DNP students for the respective population foci. Students choose one of the following nurse practitioner tracks: Acute Care Nurse Practitioner; Family Nurse Practitioner ; Pediatric Acute Care Nurse Practitioner ; Pediatric Primary Care Nurse Practitioner; and Psychiatric - Mental Health Nurse Practitioner , or Executive Leadership . Students complete the Post-Graduate APRN Certificate program in either four semesters, including the Advanced Pathophysiology, Advanced Pharmacology for Advanced Practice Nurses and Applications of Advanced Health Assessment, or three semesters if they have previously taken these courses. Students in the Executive Leadership track complete the program in three semesters. III-G. Teaching -learning practices: support the achievement of expected student outcomes; consider the needs and expectations of the identified community of interest; and expose students to individuals with diverse life experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds. Elaboration: Teaching -learning practices (e.g., simulation, lecture, flipped classroom, case studies) in all environments (e.g., virtual, classroom, clinical experiences, distance education, laboratory) support achievement of expected student outcomes identified in course, unit, and/or level objectives. Teaching -learning practices are appropriate to the student population (e.g., adult learners, second - language students, students in a post -graduate APRN certificate program), consider the needs of the program -identified community of interest, and broaden student perspectives. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. The BSN, MSN, DNP, and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate curricula and teaching learning practices are appropriate to the student population and the needs of the identified community of interest (COI). The CON has defined the COI as students, faculty, consumers, supporters, partners (agency personnel ), and alumni. Baccalaureate Program To meet the diverse leaning styles of our students, faculty use a variety of teaching -learning activities to facilitate mastery of nursing content and psychomotor skills. These include the use of face- to-face lecture, flipped classroom, case studies, clinical experiences, and simulated patient experiences. Face-to-face classroom lecture experiences allow the student to directly interact with the instructor in real time, which facilitates clarification of concepts and prompt answering of student questions. Utilizing the flipped classroom allows students to listen to the l ecture prior to class to prepare for the classroom activity. Classroom activities are intended to provide opportunities for the student to gain a deeper understanding of what is being taught, apply concepts to clinical situations, and/or problem -solve usin g a systemic scientific process. In addition, it provides the classroom instructor with a means to evaluate student learning. For example, traditional and ABSN students in NUR 301 - (Family Centered Care of Adults with Common Health Problems), are required to listen to narrated PowerPoint presentations (voice- overs) prior to classroom activities. The purpose of this activity is to prepare students for interactive, application work during class time such as discussions of unfolding case studies, critical thinking, and clinical reasoning activities. An audience response system is used for real -time assessments of knowledge and content reinforcement. Another example is NUR 413 (Synthesis of Clinical Knowledge for Nursing 46 Practice) where nursing concepts from th e completed curriculum are put into practice in this capstone course. Students are paired with a nurse preceptor as they complete 225 hours of direct patient care in a nursing specialty area of interest to them. University writing and presentation requirements for graduation are finished in the Synthesis course. Clinical Environment Consistent with Kentucky Board of Nursing guidelines, undergraduate nursing students are guided through their clinical experiences by clinical instructors. Undergraduate clinical group sizes vary from eight students per instructor to no more than 10. Clinical group size is based on the total number of students in the course, the level and complexity of the course in the curriculum, and clinical s ite factors. The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post-Graduate APRN Certificate programs have access to a wide variety of inpatient and community -based clinical sites within the immediate area. The CON has extensive clinical site agreements with high quality clinical facilities for student clinical placements throughout the area. Examples available in the Virtual Resource Room . Clinical sites are evaluated annually and are reviewed by the Associate and Assistant Deans for the respective programs, the undergrad uate program committee, MSN & DNP program committee, and track coordinators. Examples available in the Virtual Resource Room . Computer Lab Computer labs are available throughout the UK campus. A large onsite computer laboratory is available for all students on weekdays. In addition, the CON building is a wireless environment, allowing students to connect to the Internet using personal electronic devices from anywhere in the building. The computer laboratory on the 6th floor of the CON building was expanded to provide increased seating and computers for classroom and testing purposes. The web- based Canvas\u00ae Learning Platform is widely used throughout UK and at the CON at all program levels. This platform facilitates synchronous and asynchronous inform ation sharing between faculty -to- students and student -to-student. Distance Education The RN -BSN option is delivered in an online format of distance education to meet the needs of the working adult learner. The flexibility inherent in distance education m akes it an attractive educational option for the adult learner who has family and work responsibilities. Distance education is consistent with adult learning theory, which is based on the view that adults are mature, motivated, self -directed, independent, and responsible learners who are learner -centered rather than teacher- centered (Knowles, Andragogical Model). For example, students complete NUR 453 (Nursing Practice Capstone for Registered Nurses) and collaborate with faculty to identify clinical practicum sites and specific learning activities. During the practicum, students complete content modules and create an APA -style paper and presentation on topics related to their practicum experience. Activities for the assignment may include analys is/revision/preparation of patient teaching or documentation materials, involvement in nursing education programs for staff development, assessing/revising management functions, changing a policy, quality improvement projects, or a proposal for a pilot research study. Students in the RN -BSN, DNP and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate programs, including those attending the UKCON- NHC off -campus site, have access to the same resources onsite and through their University of Kentucky -assigned \"LinkBlue\" account as well. For example, students have electronic access to the UK Library system, which includes the full array of electronic textbooks and journals, Cochrane Databases, Ebsco Host, PubMed search engine for peer- reviewed literature, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), UptoDate, to name a few . Students have access to the CON librarian who is available to assist and coach the students either in groups or individually on literature searches. The librarian is also available for onsite and online tutorials, or appointments can be scheduled for more in -depth sessions and assistance with curriculum/course specific literature/resource searches. Specific activities that the librarian has assisted students with include: formulating literature sea rch strategies; providing fast interlibrary loans; helping set up Search Alerts, an automated process of checking for new results that drop into the students' email boxes; and encouraging nurses to subscribe to eTOCs, whereby the tables of contents of new issues of targeted journals drop into the students' email boxes, and Access Medicine. MSN, DNP & Post -Graduate APRN Certificate Programs Teaching -learning practices in the MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate programs have been developed to meet the specific needs of the adult learner. Flexibility of scheduling, access to faculty and online 47 resources are important components of the programs. The faculty use a variety of teaching -learning methods, which are used in each track and course to acc ommodate different learning styles. These activities include narrated lectures, faculty -designed modules, invited speakers, small group work, exams, presentations, case studies, threaded discussion, and writing assignments. The MSN program is delivered in an online format. The teaching -learning activities used by the faculty in the MSN program include narrated lectures, small group work, invited speakers, presentations, exams, writing assignments and faculty designed modules. For example, in NUR 919 Quality and Safety in Nursing and Healthcare, students complete a discussion board assignment to evaluate quality improvement tools and resources from professional organizations, government agencies, and accrediting bodies. Another example is in NUR 660 (M SN Capstone Course) where the student applies theory, principles, and processes learned during the program which leads to a written proposal and oral presentation on an identified practice issue and the evidence- based innovation to address the issue. The DNP and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate programs are delivered through an online- immersion format. Students attend on -campus sessions twice a semester to complete course requirements that are better suited for face- to-face instruction. For example, in N UR 923 Applications of Advanced Health Assessment, students are evaluated on their performance of a head-to-toe assessment. Another example, in NUR 966 Diagnosis and Management of Psychiatric Illnesses in Adults and Elderly, students are evaluated on completing a diagnostic interview on a simulated patient and developing a plan of care and evaluation plan based on the results. Students have the opportunity to hear from UKHC experts and other health profession colleges both internal and external to UK. In addition, more than one teaching -learning method is often used to assist students grasp complex concepts. For example, in NUR 941 and NUR 942 (Acute -Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner Seminar I and II), the content on suturing, lumbar puncture, central line placement, and respiratory failure is presented as a lecture and then students complete a lab and simulation experience for each. In addition, significant attention is paid to scholarly writing throughout the program, as reflected by its emphasis in multiple courses throughout the program and the DNP project. The ePortfolio and assessment management system - Digication - is another resource used by all DNP students throughout the course of their studies for storing their scholarly products, examples of clinical accomplishments and updated curriculum vitae. Digication remains accessible to students ' post-graduation and serves as an example of their scholarly work during the job interviewing process. Students have the opportu nity to formally evaluate their courses and instructors every semester to provide feedback on the usefulness of teaching -learning strategies. Given that students do not meet on a weekly basis, an in -depth orientation has been developed for incoming students. This is designed to keep students informed about the program and the CON, obtain feedback from them, and nurture faculty -student relationships, thereby enhancing learning. Students receive information about several CON student resources during orientation, including library resources, IT CON consultants, the writing specialist, the UK Writing Center, Graduate Student Services, and the variety of software and platforms that will be used in the program. Community of Interest Teaching -learning practices take into consideration the needs of the COI. The curriculum and teaching - learning practices within the BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate programs are designed and revised to meet the expectations of local, regional, and national nursing administrators regarding their need for competent graduates. An example that illustrates the teaching -learning practices consider the needs of the COI is the request the CON received in 2018 to su pport Licensed Practical Nurses (LPN) currently employed in the UKHC system obtain their BSN. The CON held focus groups with the LPNs to determine their interest in completing their BSN. Overwhelmingly, nurses responded that they were interested, and needed an online delivery model to advance their education while working. The ABSN track, which is delivered in a hybrid format, was developed to include the LPN -BSN students. The first ten LPN -BSN students began their course work in fall 2 020. Another example is the request the CON received from several hospital administrators to support their BSN -prepared nurse managers in earning their MSN degree. Based on their feedback and interest, the CON developed the MSN program in Healthcare System s Leadership. The program is delivered in an online format to accommodate the working professionals. The first ten MSN students began their course work in fall 2019. III-H. The curriculum includes planned clinical practice experiences that: enable students to integrate new knowledge and demonstrate attainment of program outcomes; foster interprofessional collaborative practice; and 48 are evaluated by faculty. Elaboration: To prepare students for a practice profession, each track in each degree program and each track in the post -graduate APRN certificate program affords students the opportunity to develop professional competencies and to integrate new knowledge in practice settings aligned to the educational preparation. Clinical practice experie nces include opportunities for interprofessional collaboration. Clinical practice experiences are provided for students in all programs, including those with distance education offerings. Clinical practice experiences align with student and program outcome s. These experiences are planned, implemented, and evaluated to ensure students are competent to function as members of interprofessional teams at the level for which they are being prepared. Programs that have a direct care focus (including, but not limi ted to, post -licensure baccalaureate and nurse educator tracks) provide direct care experiences designed to advance the knowledge and expertise of students in a clinical area of practice. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. The curricula for the BSN, MSN, DNP and Post-Graduate APRN Certificate programs have planned clinical practice experiences that enable students to integrate knowledge and demonstrate attainment of program outcomes. Students in the Traditional and ABSN tracks have clinical experiences in adult health, obstetrics, pediatrics, psychiatric -mental, and public health, which culminates in the last semester with the synthesis clinical. The students are evaluated by the faculty in each clinical experience. Mid-rotation and final evaluations are used to assess student performance with remediation activities for poor performance at any point in time. In the traditional and ABSN track, for example, a nine- item clinical evaluation form is used to assess student performance at mid-rotation and at the end of the course. Clinical faculty and nurse preceptors send performance data to the faculty course coordinator for evaluation and assignment of a final course grade. In clinical courses, faculty provide a description of clinical expectations in course syllabi, provide students and preceptors with specific clinical learning objectives and evaluation criteria, engage in mid-rotation and final clinical performance evaluation, and share clinical performance outcomes with students as they are assessed. Selected examples of clinical practice experiences for the BSN and ABSN tracks are illustrated in Table IIIH -1: Traditional BSN and ABSN Planned Clinical Activities. Further instruction or additional assignments are included as needed to improve student performance. Table IIIH -1: Selected Traditional BSN and ABSN Planned Clinical Activities Course Number and Title Objective Planned Clinical Experience NUR 403- Public Health Nursing Use clinical judgement to apply the public health nursing process using evidence and population centered values Community Assessment NUR 401- Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing Utilize cue recognition to analyze client conditions and develop hypothesis to prioritize patient needs, concerns or problems and take appropriate action Patient Assessment The students in the RN-BSN option have clinical experiences in their state of residence. The course faculty assign the final grade for the clinical experience with input from the preceptor. These experiences provide opportunities to apply theoretical concepts in clinical practice. Selected examples of clinical practice experiences for the RN -BSN track ar e illustrated in Table IIIH-2: RN Planned Clinical Activities. Table IIIH -2: Selected RN -BSN Planned Clinical Activities Course Number and Title Objective Planned Clinical Experience NUR 453 - Clinical Practice Capstone Employ oral and written communication and interprofessional collaboration in Evidence -Based Practice Project 49 Course Number and Title Objective Planned Clinical Experience providing safe, high quality care to improve client health outcomes throughout transitions in care. NUR 453 - Clinical Practice Capstone Design an d evidence -based practice presentation for an audience of peers that synthesizes the application of theoretical knowledge and experiential practice. Prepare an oral presentation relating specifics of the application of theoretical content to the practicum experience. Presentation will be presented to their class peers. Students in the MSN program complete indirect clinical hours. Each student works with a clinical preceptor who provides input regarding their clinical performance to the course faculty who is responsible for assigning the final grade. The clinical experiences provide the m an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge into the clinical setting. Selected examples of clinical practice experiences for the MSN program are illustrated in Table IIIH -3: MSN Planned Clinical Activities. Table IIIH -3: Selected MSN Planned Clinical Activities Course Number and Title Objective Planned Clinical Experience NUR 731 - Leading Change Practicum Evaluate the effectiveness of a new change initiative within the organization Implementation of a change initiative NUR 737 - Relationship - Based Leadership in Healthy Working Environments Practicum Identify and apply evidence -based practice principles that result in equitable and just systems of health care delivery and workforce leadership Application of evidence -based leadership principles to promote a healthy practice environment and address the diverse challenges in the work environment. Students in the BSN- DNP, MSN -DNP and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate programs have required clinical experiences in their respective population foci. In conjunction with their faculty they identify the clinical site and the preceptor for their clinical experience. Typhon Nurse Practitioner Student Tracking System is used to document their experiential learning activities and hours spent in the clinical setting. These are evaluated by faculty in the specialty tracks on a regular basis. The students receive written feedback from the faculty related to the alignment and meeting of the student, clinical and program outcomes with the DNP Essentials. The students have an opportunity to respond to the feedback and submit any missing information to complete the documentation. The clinical experiences provided apply theoretical knowledge into the clinical setting. Selected examples of clinical practice experiences for the MSN program are illustrated in Table IIIH -4: DNP and Post - Graduate APRN Certificate Planned Clinical Activities. Table IIIH -4: Selected DNP and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate Planned Clinical Activities Course Number and Title Objective Planned Clinical Experience NUR 968 - Clinical Management of Psychiatric Disorders in Adults and Elderly Integrate pathophysiological, pharmacologic, and psychosocial theories with assessment data in the development, implementation, and evaluation of treatment strategies in the care of adults and elderly with psychiatric illnesses Conduct a simulated diagnostic interview NUR 930 - Problems in Advanced Practice Nursing Identify clinical problems for systematic inquiry using theoretical and evidence- based practice strategies for solving clinical problems. Evidence -based clinical assignment for patient encounters III-I. Individual student performance is evaluated by the faculty and reflects achievement of expected student outcomes. Evaluation policies and procedures for individual student performance are defined and consistently applied. 50 Elaboration: Evaluation of student performance is consistent with expected student outcomes. Grading criteria are clearly defined for each course, communicated to students, and applied consistently. Processes exist by which the evaluation of individual student performance is communicated to students. In instances where preceptors facilitate students' clinical learning experiences, faculty may seek input from preceptors regarding student performance, but ultimately faculty are responsible for evaluation of indivi dual student outcomes. The requirement for evaluation of student clinical performance by qualified faculty applies to all students in all programs. Faculty evaluation of student clinical performance may be accomplished through a variety of mechanisms. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. Faculty utilize a variety of assessment strategies to evaluate student performance at the course level for achievement of the student learning outcomes (SLO). Each course syllabus identifies the specific course and clinical SLOs expected to be mastered for successful completion of the course, evaluation components and methodology, contribution of each compo nent to the course grade, the criteria used to evaluate student performance, grading scale and clinical evaluation instrument needed. Course syllabi available in the Virtual Resource Room. The academic performance of students in the BSN programs of study are consistently evaluated in every course in the CON based on the course's objectives that reflect individual student learning outcomes for that course. The faculty use a variety of evaluation methods throughout the curriculum, including written examinati ons, written papers, group, and individual presentations. Using a variety of evaluation methods allows faculty to assess various aspects of student learning, such as comprehension of relevant content, ability to apply knowledge, and analytic and problem -solving abilities. The course syllabus is the contract between the course faculty and students for establishing expected outcomes. All syllabi include course student learning outcomes, a summary description of the compon ents that contribute to the course grade, the numerical scale to be used in grading and its relationship to letter grades, and an explicit statement of the weight for each component of the grade. Students are oriented to the syllabus on the first day of class, and the syllabus is made available to them at that time, either by hard copy and/or on the course Canvas\u00ae platform. By UK policy, all undergraduate students receive a formal midterm grade and a final grade, both of which are uploaded into the campus g rade database, allowing students to view their grades. The midterm grade serves to alert students to marginal or failing grades. Students who are failing at midterm are informed by the course instructor. The student's academic advisor and the CON's student success advisor are also alerted through the myUK Grading Portal. The BSN program grading scale was vetted and approved by the Undergraduate Program Committee and the Undergraduate Faculty group. All courses are required to use the approved grading scale. Students must earn a minimum exam average of 76/100 (changed to 73/100 summer 2020) to pass courses that use examinations in the evaluation process. If a written assignment or project increases the overall course grade to 76% (chang ed to 73/100 summer 2020) or higher, but the examination mean remains less than the passing standard, the rule applies, and the student does not pass the course. The University of Kentucky mandates composition and oral presentation skill development for un dergraduates. To meet the Graduate Composition and Communication Requirement (GCCR) mandate, students must pass any GCCR assignment imbedded into a course. Additionally, all students must pass medication mathematics testing with 100% mastery to pass clinic al courses that assign this work. These grading procedures are outlined in course syllabi and in the Undergraduate Student Handbook outlined in the Undergraduate Student Handbook 2020 -2021 (pp. 38). The BSN program grading policy is as follows: A = 90 -100 B = 80 - < 90 C = 73 - < 80 D = 68 - < 73 E - < 68 All BSN clinical courses have student clinical performance evaluation forms that vary in design and focus based on the type of clinical course; however, all are consistent with the course objectives. The student clinical performance evaluation forms are made available to students at the beginning of the semester to ensure that students have a clear understanding of performance expectations. Clinical course syllabi contain clinical policies and procedures related to student performance, such as clinical attendance and professional role expectations, dress code, clinical evaluatio n and grading process, consequences for cheating and plagiarism, and CPR and immunization requirements. Clinical instructors teach, observe, and evaluate the clinical performance of each 51 student and provide a clinical evaluation at the end of each clinical rotation in each course. Clinical course coordinators may seek input from the clinical faculty or preceptors for student evaluation and serve as resources for clinical faculty to assure consistent application of the grading criteria. The course coordinators are responsible for collation of all grading criteria and determination of the final grades based on the course criteria. Students are formally evaluated by CON clinical instructors at two points during the semester -- midterm (formative evalu ation) and the end of the semester (summative evaluation). Students in the MSN, DNP, and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate programs are consistently evaluated in each individual course by the faculty member who teaches the course. Grading policies adhered to in the CON are those of UK as outlined in the DNP/Certificate Graduate Student Handbook and the MSN/PhD Graduate Student Handbook . The MSN, DNP, and Post -Graduate Certificate programs grading policy uses the standard University grading scale: A = 90 - 100; B = 80 - 89; C = 73 - 79. Grading expectations for courses are clearly stated in the syllabus and are based on assignments that facilitate achievement of course SLOs. Students are evaluated using a variety of methods including written papers, class participation, presentations, group projects, computer -based assignments, course examinations, and case study analyses. Students in specialty courses with clinical components follows the NONPF- NTF criteria for faculty regarding student assignment ratio and preceptor qualifications. Alt hough preceptors have input into the students' performance, faculty retain responsibility for assigning a grade for students' clinical performance. For example, a minimum of once a semester, faculty in the Nurse Practitioner tracks evaluate students in the clinical setting. Evidence of formative evaluation about individual student performance and progression in the program include individual student electronic transcript information that shows course grade assignments and in the plans of study found in individual student records located in the Graduate Student Affairs office. Examples of summative evaluation of individual student learning include published papers by students enrolled in the program, IRB applications, and final DNP Project reports that all students are required to complete as part of their degree requirements.

The curriculum and teaching -learning practices are evaluated at regularly scheduled intervals, and evaluation data are used to foster ongoing improvement. Elaboration: Faculty use data from faculty and student evaluation of teaching -learning practices to inform decisions that facilitate the achievement of student outcomes. Such evaluation activities may be formal or informal, formative, or summative. The curriculum is regularly evaluated by faculty and 52 revised as appropriate. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. Curriculum and teaching learning practices in the BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate programs are evaluated at regularly scheduled intervals to foster ongoing improvement as per the CON Systematic Process for Program Evaluation . Faculty, preceptors, clinical sites, courses, and the curriculum are regularl y evaluated by faculty, with feedback solicited from other communities of interest as appropriate. Students evaluate the faculty at the end of each semester. The online surveys are anonymous, and data are collected electronically. Student evaluations are a lso submitted as part of faculty performance evaluations. Clinical sites and clinical preceptors are evaluated by the student at the completion of the rotation via a computer- based survey or paper survey. Examples available in the Virtual Resource Room . The data are reviewed by the track coordinators, and the Associate and Assistant Dean for Undergraduate and DNP programs to make informed decisions on whether to use in the future. In addition, key stakeholders (executive leadership) for academic clinical pa rtnerships (UKHC, NHC and Select Medical ) are engaged annually with curricular and teaching -learning practices. Curriculum changes in the BSN, ABSN and RN -BSN tracks occur for a variety of reasons including, for example, to address current trends and needs of our clinical partners, evaluations, and revisions in the professional standards and guidelines used by the program. Faculty receive course and teaching evaluation data from information submitted by students through the University's Teacher Course Eval uation (TCE) system each semester. Course changes are made when student suggestions are feasible and advisable. For example, when students recommended payment for clinical work in a practicum course, the suggestion was not feasible and was not acted upon. In another instance, students requested changes to an assignment that improved the learning experience and increased assignment clarity; therefore, the changes were made. The Undergraduate Program Committee evaluates all BSN courses on a three- year cycle. Members of the committee and course faculty engage in the formal process using standardized evaluation forms. Recommendations for improvement are shared with the course faculty and are incorporated into future courses when warranted. Data from course reviews are stored in the undergraduate administrative office and in UK Shares (virtual storage) . Curriculum evaluation plans are formal and are approved at College and University levels. Evaluations of Program Student Learning Outcomes (PSLO) occur on a three -to-five-year cycle and are updated as required by the University. For example, the PSLO evaluation plan for the 2020- 2025 cycle was submitted to UK's Strategic Planning and Institutional Effectiveness office in July 2020. The MSN program has not undergone a curriculum revision since it is new. The curriculum will be reviewed and revised as is the standard for the BSN, DNP and Post-Graduate APRN Certificate programs. The data obtained from the evaluations will be used to inform changes in the curriculum. Curriculum changes in the DNP program occur to meet the needs of the Community of Interest as well as changes to the professional standards and guidelines. All tracks adhere to the NONPF core competences which were revised in 2017. As a result, the curriculum was reviewed to assure congruence with the revised competences. Another example is in NUR 909 (Proposal Development), which has been revised to better align the DN P Project Guidelines and to assist the students in completing their written proposal in a more timely manner. Another example is UKHC and NHC leadership requesting to reduce the length of time for onsite didactic. Faculty implemented an immersion model of meeting three blocked days at the beginning of semester and two blocked days at the end of the semester starting summer 2018. Although still under review, the UKHC Nurse Residency Program (NRP) Advisory Board has recommended two strategic efforts to strengthen efforts for integration of scholarly activities and professional advancement through higher education. A model to bridge UK College of Nursing BSN student research projects to NRP projects and then transition to UK College of Nursing DNP project s continues to be under discussion. The other recommendation is to obtain University approval to award academic credit for the UKHC Nurse Residency Program. Dr. Jessica Wilson, co- chair of the NRP and track coordinator of the RN to BSN program, is actively engaged with curricular changes to build confidence and solidify a foundation for a RN -BSN program of study at UK College of Nursing (at UKHC any new hire Associate Degree RN must complete a RN -BSN program of study 53 within 5 years). Selected NRP minutes av ailable In the Virtual Resource Room . STANDARD III Summary: Curriculum and Teaching -Learning Practices Levels of Strength of Quality Strong Strength of Quality The University of Kentucky (state/senate approval) and UK Healthcare (clinical placement) have supported the College of Nursing's mission to advance innovative curricular initiatives for undergraduate and graduate education. The College of Nursing has an impressive academic portfolio of student outcome excellence including NCLEX boar d rates, APRN certification rates, and graduation rates. The College of Nursing has established highly collaborative learning environments to advance simulated learning (the Clinical Simulations and Learning Center is under review for full accreditation) a nd interprofessional health education (Center for Interprofessional Health Education programming benefits from long -standing nursing faculty leadership). The College of Nursing provides resources and fully supports faculty for curricular innovation for undergraduate (such as MED -VET BSN track) and graduate education (such as the only Acute Care Pediatric NP track in Kentucky). Moderate to High Strength of Quality The College of Nursing has fully engaged and committed community of interest partners to advise and recommend strategies to advance undergraduate (such as the 100% online LPN to BSN track) and graduate curricular innovation (such as returning the MSN degree option). The College of Nursing has a strong commitment and resources to su pport professional development to advance curricular and learning practice excellence such as certified online teachers, instructional design teams, writing specialists and faculty with expertise with student mental health and wellness. The College of Nurs ing has a strong commitment from faculty to ensure undergraduate and graduate curricular initiatives are congruent with the College mission, professional standards of practice and needs/expectations of the community of interest. The College of Nursing re cognizes the significant impact of the global pandemic on the mental health and wellness of students will require on -going efforts to adjust curricular efforts and learning practices (extending program of study /honoring hours for COVID vaccine distributio n campaign). Low to Moderate Strength of Quality The College of Nursing recognizes the upcoming release of the new AACN Essentials and new DNP study will require on - going efforts to adjust curricular efforts and learning practices (crosswalk curricula for gaps to address for undergraduate and graduate education). The College of Nursing recognizes to increase engagement with graduate students with the Center of Interprofessional Health Education programming and Clinical Simulation and Learning Center will require on -going efforts to support. 54 Standard IV Program Effectiveness: Assessment and Achievement of Program Outcomes The program is effective in fulfilling its mission and goals as evidenced by achieving expected program outcomes. Program outcomes include student outcomes, faculty outcomes, and other outcomes identified by the program. Data on program effectiveness are used to foster ongoing program improvement. IV-A. A systematic process is used to determine program effe ctiveness. Elaboration: The program (baccalaureate, master's, DNP, and/or post -graduate APRN certificate) uses a systematic process to obtain relevant data to determine program effectiveness. The process: is written, is ongoing, and exists to determine ac hievement of program outcomes; is comprehensive (i.e., includes completion, licensure, certification, and employment rates, as required by the U.S. Department of Education; faculty outcomes; and other program outcomes); identifies which quantitative and/or qualitative data are collected to assess achievement of the program outcomes; includes timelines for data collection, review of expected and actual outcomes, and analysis; and is periodically reviewed and revised as appropriate. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. The CON utilizes a systematic plan for determining program effectiveness. The CON Systematic Process for Program Evaluation (SPPE) is the overarching document that outlines the process of evaluation used to facilitate the attainment of the BSN, MSN, DNP and Post-Graduate APRN Certificate program outcomes. The SPPE was revised by the Director of Accreditation and Strategic Outcomes in 2019 to align with CCNE Accreditation Standards. It was approved by the Dean's Council in February 2020, and the Faculty Organization in 2019. Minutes available in the Virtual Resource Room . The SPPE is organized by the CCNE Standards and Key Elements and the UK CON Strategic Plan indicates the responsible party, evidence collected, analysis, and purpose. The SPPE identifies regular data collection activi ties and sources including individual and aggregate student outcomes as reflected in Table IVA -1: Selected SPPE Data Collection Activities. The MSN and Post - Graduate APRN Certificate programs will continue to collect the same metrics that have been routinely collected in the BSN and DNP programs. This includes quantitative data such as completion rates, employment rates and certification rates as indicated and program satisfaction. The evaluation plan includes a timeframe for data collection. The Dir ector of Accreditation and Strategic Outcomes collects, aggregates, and analyzes the information and provides a report to the CON Dean and respective Associate and Assistant Dean. They review the data to determine if the identified benchmark is met. If the benchmark is not met the data are further reviewed by the CON Dean, respective Associate and Assistant Dean and program faculty to determine next steps. Evidence that the SPPE process is implemented to determine program effectiveness is illustrated in the CON Dean Calendar meetings, program committee minutes, and the Dean's Council minutes.

Program completion rates demonstrate program effectiveness. This key element is not applicable to a degree or certificate program that does not yet have individuals who have completed the program. Elaboration: The program (baccalaureate, master's, DNP, and/or post -graduate APRN certificate) demonstrates achievement of required program outcomes regarding completion in any one of the following ways: the completion rate for the most recent calendar year (January 1 through December 31) is 70% or higher; the completion rate is 70% or higher over the three most recent calendar years; the completion rate is 70% or higher for the most recent calendar year when excluding students who have identifi ed factors such as family obligations, relocation, financial barriers, and decisions to change major or to transfer to another institution of higher education; or the completion rate is 70% or higher over the three most recent calendar years when excluding students who have identified factors such as family obligations, relocation, financial barriers, and decisions to change major or to transfer to another institution of higher education. The program identifies the cohort(s), specifies the entry point, and defines the time period to completion, each of which may vary by track; however, the program provides the completion rate for the overall degree/certificate program. The program describes the formula it uses to calculate the completion rate. The program identifies the factors used and the number of students excluded if some 56 students are excluded from the calculation. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. Graduation rates are used by the BSN, MSN, DNP and Post-Graduate APRN Certificate programs as a means of evaluating program effectiveness. Graduation rates are defined by the CON as the percentage of students who graduated from a program within the designated timeframe. Full -time BSN students are expected to complete the program within three calendar years of beginning their first clinical. Full-time RN-BSN students are expected to complete the program within five calendar years from the time of admission. Full -time MSN students are expected to complete the program within three calendar years from time of admission. Full -time BSN -DNP students are expected to complete the program within five calendar years from time of admission. Full -time MSN-DNP students are expected to complete the program within five calendar years from time of admission. Students in the Post -Graduate APRN Certifi cate program students are expected to complete the program within two calendar years from time of admission. The graduation rates for the most recent last three calendar years and the three- year average are represented in Table IVB -1: Graduation Rates . Table IVB -1: Graduation Rates Program/Option 2017 2018 2019 Last 3 RN- BSN, BSN- DNP, MSN -DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate tracks exceed the CCNE benchmark of 70% on a yearly basis as well as the three -year average. The MSN program has not graduated any students at this time but is on target to graduate in May 2021 and graduation rates will be monitored and evaluated appropriately as is our standard. IV-C. Licensure pass rates demonstrate program effectiveness. This key element is not applicable to a program that does not prepare individuals for licensure examinations or does not yet have individuals who have taken licensure examinations. Elaboration: Programs with a pre- licensure track demonstrate achievement of required program outcomes regarding licensure. The program demonstrates that it meets the licensure pass rate of 80% in any one of the following ways: the NCLEX -RN\u00ae pass rate for each campus/site and track is 80% or higher for first-time takers for the most recent calendar year (January 1 through December 31); the pass rate for each campus/site and track is 80% or higher for all takers (first -time and repeaters who pass) for the most recent calendar year; the pass rate for each campus/site and track is 80% or higher for all first -time takers over the three most recent calendar years; or the pass rate for each campus/site and track is 80% or higher for all takers (first -time and repeaters who pass) over the three most recent calendar years. 57 For each campus/site and track, identify which of the above options was used to calculate the pass rate. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. The CON takes pride in consistently exceeding state and national benchmarks with our NCLEX -RN\u00ae pass rates. The first -time pass rates for all BSN graduates for years 2017 -2020 (range 98- 100%) exceeded the Rates. Calendar Year Number Graduating Number to Take Exam Number Passed First Time Percentage Passed First Time Percentage Passed CCNE Benchmark 80% Met 2017 183 183 2018 209 209 98% 100% Yes 2019 218 218 215 98% 100% Yes 2020 (May Grads Only) 116 116 116 100% 100% Yes IV-D. Certification pass rates demonstrate program effectiveness. This key element is not applicable to a degree or certificate program that does not prepare individuals for certification examinations or does not yet have individuals who have taken certification examinations. Elaboration: The master's, DNP, and post -graduate APRN certificate programs demonstrate achievement of required program outcomes regarding certification. For programs that prepare students for certification, certification pass rates are obtained and reported for those completers taking each examination, even when national certification is not required to practice in a particular state. For programs that prepare students for certification, data are provided regarding the number of completers taking each certification examination and the number that passed. A program is required to provide these data regardless of the number of test takers. A program that prepares students for certification demonstrates that it meets the certificati on pass rate of 80%, for each examination, in any one of the following ways: the pass rate for each certification examination is 80% or higher for first -time takers for the most recent calendar year (January 1 through December 31); the pass rate for each c ertification examination is 80% or higher for all takers (first -time and repeaters who pass) for the most recent calendar year; the pass rate for each certification examination is 80% or higher for all first -time takers over the three most recent calendar years; or the pass rate for each certification examination is 80% or higher for all takers (first -time and repeaters who pass) over the three most recent calendar years. The program identifies which of the above options was used to calculate the pass rate. The program provides certification pass rate data for each examination but, when calculating the pass rate described above, may combine certification pass rate data for multiple examinations relating to the same role and population. Program Response : The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. 58 The Post -Graduate APRN Certification pass rates are reflected in Table IVC -2: NP Certification Pass Rates . The first -time in -AC and PNP -PC for those who have taken the certification exam for the most recent calendar year met the CCNE 80% benchmark.

Employment rates demonstrate program effectiveness. This key element is not applicable to a degree or certificate program that does not yet have individuals who have completed the program. Elaboration: The program demonstrates achievement of required outcomes regarding employment rates. The employment rate is provided separately for each degree program (baccalaureate, master's, and DNP) and the post -graduate APRN certificate program. Data are collected within 12 months of program completion. Specifically, employment data are collected at the time of program completion or at any time within 12 months of program completion. The employment rate is 70% or higher. However, if the employment rate is less than 70%, the employment rate is 70% or higher when excluding graduates who have elected not to be employed. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. The programs demonstrate achievement of required outcomes regarding employment rates. Students in the BSN program provide employment information on the Skyfactor\u00ae End -of-Program Assessment as well as the University Senior Survey. The BSN Program employmen t rate for the past 3 years - total number of students invited to complete the survey = 693; Responded to survey= 304; of those who responded 135 answered the employment question; of those who answered the employment question= 129 indicated they had employ ment after graduation. The employment rate of those who responded was 96% which exceeds the CCNE benchmark of 70%. During the Quarterly Academic Nurse Practice Collaborative meetings, areas of opportunity were discussed for recruitment of graduates to UKHC . The MSN program has not graduated any students at this time but are on target to graduate in May 2021 and employment rates will be monitored and evaluated appropriately as is our standard. Students in the DNP program provide employment information on t he Skyfactor\u00ae End -of-Program Assessment as well as the CON post -graduation survey. The DNP Program employment rate for the past 3 years - total number of students invited to complete the survey = 216; the number who responded to the survey = 100; of those w ho responded 100 answered the employment question; of those who answered the employment question = 100 indicated they had employment after graduation. The employment rate of those who responded was 100% which exceeds the CCNE benchmark of 70%. To increase the response rate, students receive three email reminders to complete the end- of-program assessment and two reminders for the post -graduation survey. The most notable example of achieving successful employment rates in the DNP program occurred during the 7 -year partnership between Norton Healthcare (NHC) in Louisville, Kentucky, and the CON. This academic -clinical partnership was designed to prepare approximately 100 BSN prepared staff nurses as DNP graduates for APRN board eligibility. An underlining comm itment by NHC nursing leadership was to retain the DNP graduates in the organization and utilize them according to their certified specialty area. The innovation of this partnership and the DNP student outcomes have been widely distributed during key stake holder meetings such as the UKHC -CON workforce meetings, the Dean's Advisory Board meetings, as well as through faculty national presentations and publications. Stakeholder minutes and CON faculty publications related to the UKCON -NHC partnership are available in the Virtual Resource Room. IV-F. Data regarding completion, licensure, cer tification, and employment rates are used, as appropriate, to foster ongoing program improvement. This key element is applicable if one or more of the following key elements is applicable: Key Element IV- B (completion), Key Element IV -C (licensure), Key Element IV -D (certification), and Key Element IV - E (employment). Elaboration: The program uses outcome data (completion, licensure, certification, and employment) 60 for improvement. Discrepancies between actual and CCNE expected outcomes (p rogram completion rates 70%, licensure pass rates 80%, certification pass rates 80%, employment rates 70%) inform areas for improvement. Changes to the program to foster improvement and achievement of program outcomes, as appropriate, are deliberate, ongoi ng, and analyzed for effectiveness. Faculty are engaged in the program improvement process. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. The pass rates for licensure exams are shared with faculty by the Assistant Dean of the BSN program and the track coordinators. Given the positive outcomes of exceeding the CCNE benchmark of 80%, no changes have been deemed needed. The certification pass rates are shared with the faculty by the track coordinators and the Assistant Dean of the DNP and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate program. Overall, the certification pass rates meet or exceed the CCNE benchmark of 80%. The first -time pass rate for a single year in the AGACNP track was below the CCNE benchmark for 2018 at 75% for those who took the exam. First-time pass rates In the PMHNP and PNP-AC tracks met the CCNE benchmarks, 80% and 83% respectively, in 2017. We will continue to monitor first - time pass rates in all tracks closely and ad dress immediately if they fall below the 80% CCNE benchmark. The completion rates for the traditional BSN, ABSN, RN -BSN, DNP, and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate Programs are shared with the faculty by the Associate/Assistant Dean of the respective programs in faculty meetings. Given the positive outcomes of those who responded, no changes have been deemed needed. The MSN program has not had anyone complete the program, but the students are on target to graduate in May 2021 and will be monitored and evaluated appropriately as is our standard. The employment rates for the BSN, ABSN, DNP, and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate Programs are shared with the faculty by the Assistant Dean of the respective programs. Even though the outcomes were positive for those who responded, it was deemed necessary for faculty to email reminders to their students to complete the assessment to increase the response rate. The MSN program will have th eir first graduates in May 2021 and will be monitored and evaluated appropriately as is our standard. All data are shared with the CON Dean and the Associate Dean of the respective program. The data are reviewed in the Deans Council, which provides input if any changes are deemed needed. IV-G. Aggregate faculty outcomes demonstrate program effectiveness. Elaboration : The program demonstrates achievement of expected faculty outcomes. In order to demonstrate program effectiveness, outcomes are consistent w ith and contribute to achievement of the program's mission and goals and are congruent with institution and program expectations. Expected faculty outcomes: are identified for the faculty as a group; specify expected levels of achievement for the faculty as a group; and 1.reflect expectations of faculty in their roles. Actual faculty outcomes are compared to expected levels of achievement. Actual faculty outcomes are presented in the aggregate. If expected faculty outcomes vary for different groups of faculty (full- time, part -time, adjunct, tenured, non -tenured, or other), actual faculty outcomes may be presented separately for each different group of faculty. Program Response: The BS N, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. Faculty outcomes are associated with the expectation of the faculty appointment (title series, rank, educational degree) as well as teaching effectiveness, scholar ship (research and/or scholarly activities), practice and/or service. Expected faculty outcomes reflect the CON mission and are congruent with the overall mission of UK. Faculty outcomes, individually and in the aggregate, demonstrate program effectiveness and are 61 presented in the four major categories that represent the CON \" statements of evidence \" for appointment and advancement . Although part -time and adjunct faculty support program effectiveness, they are only included in teaching effectiveness outcomes and not in the scholarly activities or practice/service outcomes. Faculty outcomes/expectations are integrated as part of the Annual Performance Evaluation with the appropriate Associate Dean for individualized strategies discussed f or professional growth and faculty advancement. Teaching Effectiveness Outcomes: The CON benchmark for teaching is that 100% of the faculty will be evaluated by the students in each course per semester. For the past three years the benchmark has been met for all courses with five or more students enrolled. The aggregate data related to teaching effectiveness is illustrated in Table IVG -1: CON Aggregate Faculty Teaching Effectiveness , for the past three years with 100% of the faculty being evaluated with a range 4.1- 4.6 on a 5 -point scale. Table IVG -1: CON Aggregate Faculty Teaching Effectiveness BSN Faculty Teaching Effectiveness Academic Year Percent of Faculty Evaluated Number of Students Invited Number of Students Responded/ Percent 4.5 MSN Faculty Teaching Effectiveness Academic Year Percent of Faculty Evaluated Number of Students Invited Number of Students Responded/ Percent Responded Academic Year Percent of Faculty Evaluated Number of Students Invited Number of Students Responded/ Percent a faculty member receives less than a 4.0 on their TCE for the same course (relates to both the overall course evaluation and the instructor evaluation) for two consecutive evaluations, the faculty will meet with their Associate Dean to review the evalu ations and develop an action plan. An action plan example includes: Course name and number, semester/year, teacher/instructor scores, course scores, areas identified for improvement, and goals/action. Selected faculty files available upon request in the Virtual Resource Room. The individual faculty member reviews their student evaluations, personal goals, accomplishments, and contributions to the CON over the past academic year. The faculty member then writes a summative statement reflecting those criter ia and the goals for the following academic year. The Associate Dean of the respective program reviews the faculty member's documents, writes comments, and then schedules an appointment to discuss the evaluation. The documents are formalized with signature s and faculty comments between the faculty member and the Associate Dean and then submitted to the Dean for final approval. A faculty member who wishes to be considered for high merit (recognition over and above merit with monetary compensation as budget allows) must provide additional documentation to the reporting Associate Dean summarizing academic achievements exceeding expectation designated by their title series and rank. If a faculty member appeals the decision for high merit then the information is sent to the Promotion, Appointment and Tenure Advisory (PATA) Committee to review and make a recommendation to the Dean. The Dean makes the final decision as to whether the applicant meets the requirement for high merit and informs the faculty member. 62 Scholarly Outcomes: The expectations for scholarly productivity outcomes are based on the respective title series, rank, and amount of time allocated for scholarship on faculty DOE as outlined in Table IVG -2: Scholarship (Presentations/Publications) Expectations for Promotion by Title Series and Rank. Scholarship outcomes are differentiated per title series and rank as delineated in the CON Statemen ts of Evidence for Faculty Appointment and Promotion. For example, faculty in the clinical title series, if applicable, are expected to have a publication or presentation every two years. Faculty in the special title series and regular title series are expected to have a publication and/or presentation every year. Collectively, faculty members of the College of Nursing fulfill the college's missions related to teaching, scholarship, practice, and service. Individual faculty, however, are not expected t o fulfill all roles related to the college's missions. The expected roles of individual faculty are determined by the amount of time on their DOEs allocated to a role. The expectation of scholarship is defined by time allocated on their DOEs for scholarshi p of 10% for CTS, 15% for STS, and 20% for RTS. As reflected in Table IVG-3: CON Faculty Table Scholarship (Presentations and Publications) the percentage of faculty members who met the benchmarks for their title series and rank, except those who did not have scholarship as an expectation of their role. The aggregate information for faculty presentations and publications for the past three y ears are reflected in Table IVG -5: CON Aggregate Faculty Scholarship (Presentations/Publications), reflecting an average of six data- based publications and presentations per year.

Faculty members in the CON are recognized locally, nationally, and internationally for their leadership and level of expertise in the following funding programs of research: substance use disorders, environmental health policy, cardiovas cular disease, tobacco control policy, diabetes, cancer, agricultural health, health disparities, maternal -child health, chronic pain, and mental health. Over the past three years, the College has $4,344,534 average research expenditures with tenured/tenur e-track faculty averaging 2.73 extramural grant submissions per year and $271,533 average expenditure per regular title series ( Table IVG -6: CON Faculty Research ). For the past 10 years, the College has been ranked among the top NIH nursing research progra ms for public universities.

While we have had some difficulty, we did meet the expectation of faculty submitting their name for two standing committees. In addition to standing committees, full-time faculty are encouraged to volunteer to serve on task forces at the College and University level. Part-time faculty service is based on time allocated according to individual work assignments. Overall, the CON faculty serve on 88 committees at the college and university level including faculty council, PATA, academic program committees, faculty senate, university assessment council, distance learning and others. Faculty members are actively involved in a variety of professional organizations. There are 44 faculty members currently serving externally on multiple regional, national, or international boards, panels, task forces, committees, or commissions. Practice Outcomes: As a practice- based discipline, the CON supports active faculty practice with 29% of full-time faculty (20 out of 68) engaged in primary/community care or acute care faculty practice settings as reflected in Table IVG -7 Current Faculty Practice . All faculty who hold national certification as an APRN and teach in the respective population foci maintain a 20% to 50% effort for clinical practice. Several faculty are engaged in the CON first NP-led faculty practice clinic in Wilmore, Kentucky and the first UK College of Dentistry collaborative wellness clinic. Over 10,241 UK HealthCare patients received direct care from APRN faculty providers in 2017- 18. 64 Table IVG -7: Current Faculty Practice Full Time Faculty UKHC Outside UKHC Anthony Carney, DNP, APRN, CCRN, FNP- C UK College of Nursing Phyllis D.

This designation specifically acknowledging the program effectiveness of three academic - clinical partnerships with UK HealthCare, Norton Healthcare and Select Medical. Another mark of significant excellence with faculty expectation is national and international recognition as educators, scholars, researchers, and clinicians (Table IVG-8: CON Faculty Recognition at National International Level) . Overall, as of fall 2019, there are 68 cumulative distinctive marks of national and/or international excellence bestowed on CON full-time and part -time faculty. This includes induction as Fellows in six different specialty professional organizations, such as Fellow of the American Academy of Nu rsing, Fellow of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, Fellow of the National Academies of Practice, Fellow of the American Heart Association, Fellow of the American Academy of Occupational Health Nurses, and Fellow of Critical Care Medicine. Faculty have also been recognized with the highest honor for exemplary research/leadership from Sigma Theta Tau International Research Hall of Fame, President's Award for Research from Friends of National Institute for Nursing Research, the Ameri can Academy of Nursing Living Legend Award and the American Academy of Nursing Edge Runner Award. Another marker of CON Distinguished outcomes includes the achievements of our Alumni as reflected in Table IVG -9 Selected Examples of Alumni with Executive/Hi gh Level Impact Positions and/or Recognitions and Awards.

Aggregate faculty outcome data are analyzed and used, as appropriate, to foster ongoing program improvement. Elaboration: The program uses faculty outcome data for improvement. 2.Faculty outcome data are used to promote ongoing program improvement. Discrepancies between actual and expected outcomes inform areas for improvement. Changes to foster ach ievement of faculty outcomes, as appropriate, are deliberate, ongoing, and analyzed for effectiveness. Faculty are engaged in the program improvement process. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance wit h this Key Element. The CON's annual evaluation plan (SPPE) includes overall faculty effectiveness outcomes and is reviewed annually for faculty approval. Quality improvement plans or curriculum recommendations for changes, based on benchmarks identified by faculty, are developed annually during program committee work in the areas of teaching effectiveness (predominant ly data from TCE and End-of-Program surveys). Individual faculty outcomes, as appropriate, are managed during the Annual Performance Evaluation process with the Associate Dean to promote improvement/advancement with teaching effectiveness, scholarly activi ties, research, practice, and service. Similar to teaching effectiveness outcomes, discrepancies between actual and expected faculty outcomes are managed individually and collectively for scholarly activities, research, practice, and service. For example, tenure- track faculty are expected, and non- tenure track faculty are encouraged to submit poster presentations and from those develop manuscripts. Senior faculty have successfully worked with junior faculty on the development of research proposals for grants, manuscripts, chapters, and presentat ions. The RICH Heart Research Team hosts a week -long summer writing workshop to assist faculty with writing a manuscript for publication. The Office of Nursing Research (ONR) started covering the registration expenses for the writing workshop to advance sc holarship productivity with faculty. In addition, the ONR provides significant assistance with facilitating collaborative research initiatives and guiding the grant writing process both internal and external to the University. 67 All full- time faculty are expected to be engaged in service and all APRN -prepared faculty are supported for faculty practice placement and distribution of effort (DOE)/workload protection. As a function of the Senior Associate Dean's role leading faculty a dvancement initiatives, faculty are kept well informed about faculty service opportunities. Associate Deans work closely with faculty to help strategize best service opportunities that match workload capacity, as faculty service is a component of the perfo rmance review and includes service on committees both internal and external to the CON. The Dean's Council annually discusses faculty plans for service advancement opportunities including representation on national and international committees and boards of professional organizations. IV-I. Program outcomes demonstrate program effectiveness. Elaboration: The program demonstrates achievement of outcomes other than those related to completion rates (Key Element IV -B), licensure pass rates (Key Element IV -C), certification pass rates (Key Element IV -D), employment rates (Key Element IV -E), and faculty (Key Element IV -G). Program outcomes are defined by the program and incorporate expected levels of achievement. The program describes how outcomes are measured. Actual levels of achievement, when compared to expected levels of achievement, demonstrate that the program, overall, is achieving its outcomes. Program outcomes are appropriate and relevant to the degree and certificate programs offered. Progra m Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate Programs demonstrate effectiveness through a variety of ways. In addition to the student program completion rates, licensure/certification pass rates, and employment rates, the CON assesses program student satisfaction, teaching effectiveness, and employer feedback. Students complete an end of program survey which includes evaluating their satisfaction with the program. The BSN program uses Skyfactor for the end of program evaluation. For the past two years the BSN program students were very satisfied with the quality of instruction and overall program effectiveness as illustrated in Table IV-I-1 DNP and BSN Program Satisfaction. The DNP program also uses Skyfactor for the end of program evaluation. For the past three years the DNP students were very satisfied with the quality of instruction, quality of clinical experience and overall program effectiveness as illustrated in table IV -I-1 BSN and DNP Program Satisfaction. The Post Graduate APRN Certificate program uses RedCap for the end of program evaluation however we do not have any completed surveys. It is believed that low enrollment in the program contributes to the survey incompletion rate. The MSN program has not ha d any student complete the program but will be monitored and evaluated appropriately as is our standard. Table IVI -1 BSN and DNP Program Satisfaction BSN End of Program Survey AY 2017 -2018 AY 2018 -2019 AY 2019 -2020 Total Overall Program Effectiveness N/A 6.0 6.0 6.0 Quality of Faculty and Instruction N/A 6.0 6.0 6.0 DNP End of Program Survey Overall Program Effectiveness 5.0 5.0 6.0 5.3 Quality of Faculty and Instruction 5.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 Based on Survey Responses where (1) = not at all satisfied; (4) = moderately satisfied; (7) = extremely satisfied The benchmark for program satisfaction for all programs is 6.0 or greater on the quality of faculty and instruction and overall program effectiveness. The CON was met the benchmark in the BSN program for the past 68 two years. The CON benchmark in the DNP program was met in 2018 -2019 for quality of faculty and instruction and 2019- 2020 in overall program effect iveness. The benchmark in the DNP program was not met in 2017 -2018 in for overall program effectiveness and quality of faculty and instruction, 2018 -2019 was not met for overall program effectiveness, and in 2019 -2020 was not met for quality of faculty and instruction. Students in the BSN, MSN, DNP and Post -Graduate APRN Certificate Programs evaluate each course at the end of the semester. The CON uses the university system eXplorance Blue for student course and faculty evaluations. Faculty receive aggreg ate data for both the students' rating of the course and the faculty. The students have the opportunity to answer scaled questions based on a Likert scale with 1=disagree to strongly agree=5 as well as open-ended questions on what was most helpful and need ed improvement for both the course and the faculty. The aggregate information is shared with the individual faculty and the Associate Dean of the respective programs. The information is reviewed to determine if any programmatic revisions are needed. The information is also reviewed with the faculty in the annual performance appraisal and is considered when monies for merit or salary increases are available and is a part of the faculty record. The Dean of the CON meets with the Associate and Assistant Deans of the respective programs each semester to review the programs' teaching effectiveness to assist in identifying areas for improvement. Evidence will be available in th e Virtual Resource Room. The benchmark is that all courses and faculty will be evaluated and the achievement of 4.0 or greater on the course evaluation and the teacher evaluation each semester. The CON has met the benchmark that 100% of the courses have been evaluated each semester. The CON did not meet the benchmark of faculty and course evaluations being 4.0 or greater in the BSN, MSN, and DNP/Post -Graduate APRN Certificate programs as illustrated in Table IVI -2: Teacher Course Evaluations Less than 4.0. Table IVI -2: Teacher Course Evaluations Less than 4.0 BSN Program Academic Year Number of Courses Evaluated Courses with Mean <4/Percent Number of Faculty Evaluated Faculty with Mean <4/ Percent 27/30% 200 39/15% 255 17/66% MSN Program Academic Year Courses with Mean <4 Faculty with Mean Certificate Programs Academic Year Courses with Mean <4 No. of Faculty with Mean <4 2019-2020 46 21/46% The CON obtains feedback from employers in several ways including the Dean's Advisory Board, Dean's Diversity, and Inclusivity Advisory Council, CON-UKHC Workforce Committee, and informally. The Dean's Advisory Board meets twice a year and members include representatives of Nursing from area hospitals. They provide feedback, both formally and informally, regarding their satisfaction with the graduates of the CON and suggestions for programmatic revisions . The Dean's Diversity and Inclusivity Advisory Board meets twice a year and members Include representatives from both Internal and external to the University. They provide recommendations for advancing equity, diversity, and inclusivity efforts for the Co llege as well as other areas of relevance to enhance program effectiveness. Other key stakeholders for College input related student learning outcomes and program effectiveness include the annual CON-UKHC Workforce meeting quarterly UKHC Nurse Residency Ad visory Board meetings, monthly UKHC Strategic Nursing Directors meetings, and the UKHC CNE and 69 Dean weekly meetings. Selected minutes and calendar notifications available In the Virtual Resource Room . Other areas identified that will help foster achievement of a broader impact for program effectiveness are being discussed with faculty to update/revise the 2021- 2022 annual evaluation plan (SPPE). Although the following initiatives are in place, a formal evaluation process to foster ongoing program improvement will be integrated: (1) students who continue for graduate education/additional certificate recognition as illustrated in Table IVI -3: New Admissions of Alumni in Graduate Programs ; (2) graduating st udents' perception of their confidence on each AACN Essential (new initiative); (3) students in Study Abroad/Service Learning/Global Health initiatives Table IV -I-4 Students in Study Abroad/Service Learning/ Global Health Initiatives ; (4) BSN students in mentored \"enrichment programs\" for research, education and practice as illustrated in Table IVI -4 BSN Students Completing Enrichment Programs ; (5) students with presentations or publications as illustrated in Table IVI -5 Student Presentations and Publicati ons; (6) alumni satisfaction with the program (new initiative) and (7) alumni with notable achievements (new initiative).

Program outcome data are used, as appropriate, to foster ongoing program improvement Elaboration: For program outcomes defined by the program: Actual program outcomes are used to promote program improvement. Discrepancies between actual and expected outcomes inform areas for improvement. Changes to the program to foster improvement and achievement of program outcomes, as 70 appropriate, are deliberate, ongoing, and analyzed for effectiveness. Faculty are engaged in the program improvement process. Program Response: The BSN, MSN, DNP and Post Graduate Certificate Programs are in compliance with this Key Element. The CON uses data sources such as the graduating senior survey, completion rates, NCLEX\u00ae pass rates, certification pass rates, en d of program evaluations, employment rates, Teacher Course Evaluations among others to foster ongoing program improvement. The actual program outcomes are compared to the expected program outcomes to foster ongoing program improvement. Aggregate data are disseminated to the Dean, Associate and Assistant Deans for review. The BSN, MSN, DNP program committees review the outcome data for the respective programs. Discrepancies between actual outcomes and expected outcomes are discussed and strategies for progra m improvement are identified. The information is also shared with the faculty in the respective programs to foster ongoing assessment and overall effectiveness of the identified improvement strategies. Program Satisfaction Although the benchmarks were met for the BSN programs and partially met for the DNP program, efforts will continue to collect the data as it will be different with each graduating class. Due to incomplete surveys in the Post -Graduate APRN Certificate program we were unable to identify discrepancies between the actual and expected outcomes. The MSN program has not had anyone complete the prog ram and efforts will continue to monitor and evaluate as per our standard. For the past 2 -3 years the response rates have been low to moderate for all the programs despite the students receiving four email reminders. The issue has been discussed with progr am faculty who are involved in problem solving it. The end of program surveys contains written feedback that are also used to improve the programs. Examples of strengths the BSN students identified include quality of education, faculty invested in our success, well prepared to be a nurse, structure of program, and availability of faculty to name a few. Examples of opportunities the BSN students identified include need more space in the college, more time in clinical, and more clear communication for incoming students to name a few. Examples of DNP program strengths identified by students included clinical experiences were well organized, program was very structured, program led to personal and professional growth, and collaboration with peers to name a few. Examples of DNP program improvement areas identified by students included more information regarding uploading work to UKnowledge, more focus on clinical experiences, more focus on advanced practice than project, and more education on palliative care to name a few. Teaching Effectiveness The benchmark of all courses and faculty being evaluated each semester was met. The benchmark of a 4.0 or greater on the course evaluation and the teacher evaluation was not met in the BSN, MSN, and DNP/Post - Graduate APRN Certificate programs. The faculty lead in those courses with less than a 4.0 and the faculty with less than a 4.0 for teaching effectiveness meet with the respective Associate Dean. The conversation includes reviewing quantitative and qualitative data to understand the concerns and determine any strategies that may be needed for enhancing outcomes. Specific areas of focus during a teaching effectiveness review by the Associate Deans may include questioning 1) whether changes had been made to the course prior to the semester being evaluated, 2) had the faculty taught the course before, and 3) was this the second consecutive evaluation that the faculty member received a less than 4.0 for the course and/or teaching effectiveness. For example, as reflected in Table IVI-2, it was determined many courses during 2019- 2020 review period had undergone changes in either the delivery and/or the content from the previous semester being taught. Further review revealed the faculty members with less than 4.0 were recommended for a teaching effectiveness/course development plan for su ccess. Selected files available upon request in the Virtual Resource Room . Employer Feedback The benchmark of receiving feedback from employers was met and the CON will continue to monitor for ongoing program improvement opportunities. The feedback was received through a variety of meetings including the previously mentioned key stakeholders: CON -UKHC Workforce meeting, UKHC Nurse Residency Advisory Board meetings, UKHC Strategic Nursing Directo rs meetings, and the UKHC CNE and Dean meetings.
