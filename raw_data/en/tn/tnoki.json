Report 2014-2016Preface 7 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016 The Department of Biomedicine (DBM) unites the lab - oratory-based research of the faculty of medicine of the University of Basel. In the DBM, the laboratories of the former \"pre-clinical institutes\" as well as the clin - ical divisions of the University Hospitals are brought together under a common leadership with the goal to focus their efforts and to strive for excellence in bio - medical research. In the 16 years since the depart - ment was founded, we enjoyed continuous growth and flourishing of our research. By providing a bridge between basic science and clinical medicine, the DBM is an important component in the University of Basel's strategic plan for the Life Sciences and a key player in the national \"Swiss Personalized Health Ini - tative\" (SPHN). The DBM concentrates on research in four Immunology, Neurobiolo - gy, and Stem Cells/Regenerative Medicine. DBM's research groups obtain a large proportion of their research funds from competitive grants by na - tional foundations, the EU and other countries. More than 50 % of the positions are funded by third par - ties. The DBM has attracted individual grants as well as synergy grants from the European Research Coun - cil (ERC), the Swiss Initiative in Systems Biology (Sys - temsX.ch) and the Swiss National Science Founda - tion (SNSF). This report summarizes the activities of over 60 DBM research groups during the period of 2014-2016. The reports are grouped thematically according to the four focal areas. Each research group has selected their most relevant publications from this period. A com - plete list of all publications can be found in the annex of this report. The DBM and our research groups are regularly evaluated by the Scientific Advisory Board that consists of eight internationally recognized ex - perts. During their yearly visits, the Advisory Board members evaluate and make recommendations on how to improve the organization of the department. They also provide an important basis for decisions, in - cluding promotions and changes in future directions. Key to the success of the DBM has been the enthu - siasm of our scientists and clinicians from over 40 countries to communicate and to perform inter- and trans-disciplinary work resulting in benchmark bio - medical research. The research is supported by a growing number of Core Facilities. While some Core Facilities are for the DBM only, others are joint ven - tures between our department with the Biozentrum (Faculty of Natural Sciences) and also the D-BSSE In - stitute of the ETH Z\u00fcrich in Basel. The access to these key technologies is of immeasurable value to us. Since January 2014, the DBM obtained new labo - ratories on the 2nd floor of the DBM-Hebelstrasse, where the former medical library has been convert - ed to lab space. This much-needed expansion has al - lowed recruitment of additional junior faculty support - ed by SNF. A major milestone is the project for a new DBM building, which will replace the old Biozentrum located at Klingelbergstrasse 70. The new DBM build - ing is scheduled to be inaugurated in 2023 and will unite all DBM research groups in a single location sit - uated in close vicinity of the new Biozentrum and the new D-BSSE of the ETH. This new campus will pro - vide an excellent basis for expanding collaborative re - search between clinical and basic science at the high - est competitive level. The DBM is committed to the highest quality and in - novation in research. This report portraits the scientif - ic excellence and enthusiasm of our research groups. I wish you pleasant reading. Prof. Dr. Radek Skoda Head of the Department of Biomedicine 8 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016As of 2015 all PhD students of the DBM are part of the International PhD program in Biomedicine. Within this interdisciplinary environment more than 120 PhD students from 28 countries are trained on the post - graduate level aiming the PhD degree from the Fac - ulty of Science. Our program provides in-depth ex - perimental competences and scientific knowledge in a wide range of disciplines of basic and clinical re - search. Our interdisciplinary PhD Program is associ - ated with the PhD Program in Molecular and Cellular Biology offered by the Biozentrum. Every PhD student at the DBM receive theoretical and practical training, and conduct a research project under the supervision of a DBM research group leader recognized by the Faculty of Science, and monitored by a PhD thesis ad - visory committee. A rich program of courses, lectures, workshops and conferences organized by the Depart - ment of Biomedicine and the Biozentrum are offered to the PhD students. PhD fellows attend yearly scien - tific meetings (DBM PhD scientific retreat) and have the opportunity to organize seminar series and career guidance events. The DBM PhD Club creates a department-wide stu - dent's club organizing various activities for the PhD students at the DBM with the aim to establish a ba - sis for enhanced scientific networking and exchang - es between students of the DBM. They organized the DBM PhD Scientific Retreat which takes place in gen - eral in the spring semester as it did in Hasliberg (2014), Schwarzsee (2015) and Emmeten (2016), and is an ex - cellent platform to form new collaborations in form of knowledge, methodological and technical transfer. In the fall semester they organize the Career Day invit - ing speakers talking about future career development. This can be either for a scientific track - what kind of financial funding of early and late postdoc stipendium are provided by the Swiss National Science Founda - tion - or opportunities in Private Industry. The PhD Program of the DBM aims to provide a sci - entific as well as an educational platform for PhD stu - dents allowing them to shape on one side their individ - ual scientific career but on the other side to establish their first scientific network.Group Bernhard Bettler Lisa Adelfinger (2014)Modulation of GABAB receptor signaling proteins and phosphorylation David Berner (2016) GABAB receptor-associated KCTD proteins as molecular linkers to down - stream signaling complexes Group Josef Bischofberger Stefanie Heigele (2015) Bidirectional GABAergic control of AP firing in newly-generated young granule cells of the adult hippocampus Group Daniel Bodmer Marijana Sekulic (2015) Characterization of the excitation- contraction coupling in extraocular muscles Group Claudia Cavelti-Weder Angela Bosch (2014) The role of the transcription factor Foxn1 in Thymus organogenesis and maintenance Group Gerhard Christofori Ruben Bill (2015) Mechanisms of action and resistance to novel targeted therapies in preclinical Maren Diepenbruck (2015) Transcriptional and posttranscription - al control of epithelial-mesenchymal transition Laura Estelle Pisarsky (2016) Angiogenesis: from tumor initiation to therapeutic resistance Dana Ronen (2016) Lose Cancer - Gain Fat: Forced Differentiation of EMT-derived Cancer Cells to Inhibit Cancer Metastasis International PhD Program in Biomedicine Dissertations 2014-20169 Department of Biomedicine .

Report 2014-2016Mission Statement The mission of the Department of Biomedicine (DBM) at the University of Basel is to promote integrated research excellence in biomedical science. We emphasize research in neurobiology, infection and immunity, cancer, and stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. The DBM provides a stimulating environment with state-of-the-art facilities, enabling biomedical research of the highest quality, while also training the next generation of leaders in basic and clinical research. Central to our mission, non-clinical and clinical scientists work side by side to foster a translational environment across all of our disease-relevant scientific themes, benefiting the lives of patients in areas of unmet need. 13 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016 14 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016New DBM Building Modell: \u00a9 Joseph Riegger To further grow together as one department, all re - search groups, core facilities and staff of today's five locations will move under the same roof. The new DBM will complete the ongoing developments on the Sch\u00e4llem\u00e4tteli Campus by joining the new buildings of the Biozentrum (2020) and the ETH Department of Biosystems Sciences and Engineering (2021) - creat - ing a magnet for life science research in the Basel area with international reach. It will allow DBM research - ers to interact more closely within the department but also with researchers of the neighbouring institutions. These interactions are further strengthened by jointly operated research core facilities, providing access to key technologies. By 2024, all DBM researchers will work in a new building on the Sch\u00e4llem\u00e4tteli Life Sciences Campus. 15 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016 Visualisation: Caruso St John Architects Foremost, the proximity of the DBM research labs to the University Clinics of the USB and UKBB will facil - itate exchange and collaborations between scientists and physicians working on different disease areas, using complementary approaches and methodolo - gies. This interdisciplinary exchange is the basis for a quick translation form bench to bedside in order for newly generated knowledge to be rapidly used in the development of new diagnostics or therapies for the benefit of patients. The new DBM building will create synergies that lead to professionalization of technical and research ser - vices and a more efficient operation. These are the key for creating a competitive environment, where re - searchers can work more efficiently in state of the art laboratories, core facilities and infrastructures.The project MCDLIX by Caruso St. John architects (Z\u00fcrich and London) is the winning proposal of an anonymous competition for the new DBM build - ing (2015). It convinced the jury with regard to urban planning, architectural character and the effective and flexible integration of the user requirements. The 7-floor building will have an effective area of 17'500 m2 and will be the new home for over 800 DBM em - ployees. It will be owned and built by the University of Basel on a budget of 241 Mio CHF. The planning phase will last until 2019, realization until 2023 and the planned handover to the DBM is in 2023.

Report 2014-2016Core Facilities of the Department of Biomedicine Scientific core facilities are an integral part of the DBM research landscape. They enable cutting-edge research by helping to economically and efficiently take ad - vantage of state-of-the-art technology and collaborate with expert staff. The highly trained facility members serve the evolving needs of the DBM research groups by following up with the latest technological advances, giving compre - hensive trainings to the users or by coordinating grant applications to purchase new equipment. DBM core facilities are providing their service at no or very lit - tle costs, minimizing the administrative burden and leveraging resources to sup - port investigator-driven science. Dedicated steering committees evaluate the ser - vices and provide guidance to the core facility heads in order to improve the core facility infrastructure, technology and management for the benefit of the DBM re - search groups. While DBM members have access to in-house core facilities for bioinformatics, flow cytometry & cell sorting, light microscopy and for the production of medicinal products according to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), the DBM joins forc - es with other life sciences institutions in Basel to run core facilities for next gener - ation sequencing technologies and genomics research, design and generation of custom transgenic rodent models, preclinical nuclear molecular imaging, electron microscopy, and high-performance computing. The DBM has a long history in sharing and centralizing common equipment to le - verage resources. In the absence of dedicated core facility personnel, these fa - cilities are maintained by members of DBM research groups or by technical staff. Such technologies that are available to all researchers include facilities for histolo - gy, robotics, tissue culture, biobanking and other high-end applications. Together, these core facilities play a central role in creating a competitive research environment and contribute significantly to the scientific success of the Depart - ment of Biomedicine.

Report 2014-2016 Good Manufacturing (GMP) PD Dr. Werner Krenger werner.krenger @unibas.ch DBM HebelstrasseIntroduction Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) is a system to ensure that medicinal prod - ucts intended for human use are consistently produced and controlled accord - ing to appropriate quality standards. Swiss manufacturers of medicinal products must comply with international GMP standards set forth by the European Union (EU). These GMP standards are built on three pillars: 1) Pharmaceutical substanc - es and products intended for human use are to be manufactured in sites that are adequately equipped, 2) the producer has to demonstrate appropriate profession - al and technical knowledge that is provided by qualified staff, and 3) a pharma - ceutical Quality Assurance system needs to be established by the manufacturer. Service The DBM has obtained an permit from Swissmedic in March 2015 to operate such a manufacturing laboratory. Headed by Werner Krenger, PhD, the \"GMP core facili - ty\" is located on the 4th floor of the ZLF and offers as \"Provider\" central services to individual DBM research groups (\"Users) that permit the manufacture of investiga - tional medicinal products (IMPs) to be used in clinical trials. A delimitation agree - ment between Provider and User regulates activities and responsibilities. The final product is released for clinical use by the the head of the core facility. Affiliation and Staff Both the core facility provider and the DBM research group users are required to contribute to the implementation of a fully functional Quality Assurance (QA)-sys - tem necessary for the release of GMP-compliant medicinal products: A QA-team is provided by the GMP core facility DBM and includes the \"Qualified Person\" (W. Krenger) with the \"QA manager\" Anke Wixmerten; and an external quality assurance consulting firm \"Quality Assurance Consulting AG; QAC). The second team needs to be provided by the DBM research groups and includes at minimum a \"Quality Control Manager\" (QC), a Manager\" (PM; which is usually the principal investiga - tor of a research group). Together, the teams establish the relevant documenta - tion required for implementation of an appropriate production process. Training of all staff (both core facility staff and research group staff) is organized by the core facility staff. Equipment The laboratory, including its supporting utilities (computerized GMP monitoring system) and the equipment (incubators, fridges, freezers, centrifuges, air sampler) have been qualified in accordance with the requirements of GMP. Outlook Since its inception in March 2015, two DBM research groups have used the core facility services to produce different IMPs (cartilage tissue and genetically engi - neered vaccinia virus; Fig. 2) to be used in two clinical trials. The facility offers, however, the capacity for including additional teams. The DBM hopes that the availability of this core facility will further stimulate the transition of preclinical re - search into the study of exciting new investigational medicinal products.Core Facilities33 Department of Biomedicine .

Bioinformatics Dr. Robert Ivanek robert.ivanek @unibas.ch Bioinformatics Facility provides a centralized resource of expertise in computational biology and statistics, available to all researchers at the DBM. It of - fers support for the analysis and visualization of large-scale biological data, mainly produced by high-throughput genomics experiments. The platform also provides training in bioinformatics and facilitates access to high-performance computa - tional resources. Design and analysis of the high-throughput biological data sets The aim of the Bioinformatics Core Facility is to implement solutions for analysis, interactive visualization, management and interpretation of large-scale genomic data generated by high-throughput techniques derived from human or model or - ganisms. Over the past four years, the Bioinformatics Core Facility analyzed data of more than 100 studies from 43 research groups on gene expression, DNA-pro - tein binding (ChIP-, CLIP-seq), DNA methylation, DNA accessibility, mapping of physical contacts between genomic elements (4C-seq), identification of sequence variants or high-throughput screens. Beside supporting standardized approaches, the platform also develops customized solutions tailored towards the needs of in - dividual research projects. Bioinformatics training The Bioinformatics Core Facility is individually training and advising researchers at the DBM. Furthermore, Robert Ivanek as group leader of the Swiss Institute of Bio - informatics (SIB) is regularly mentoring the bioinformaticians that are embedded within the DBM research groups. The facility also organizes bioinformatics trainings in collaboration with compu - tational biologists from the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research. These trainings comprise two full semester lecture series and exercises: 1. \"Introduction to R \", a hands-on course on the basic usage of R software with a focus on data exploration and visualization, and basic statistics. 2. Advanced course \"Analysis of genomics data in R and Bioconductor\" gives stu - dents an overview of typical Bioconductor based analysis pipelines including: NGS data processing, differential gene expression analysis, DNA binding anal - ysis, working with sequence and annotation packages and visualization of ge - nomic data. Infrastructure The platform's mission is to build and maintain an infrastructure that enables appli - cation of strong bioinformatics analysis to enhance and empower the biomedical research at the DBM. To keep track of the rapid technological advances and the growing number of bioinformatics approaches and tools, the Bioinformatics Core Facility closely interacts with other bioinformatics units in the Basel area (e. g. the group of Dr. Michael Stadler, Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research and the group of Prof. Torsten Schwede and the center for scientific computing - sciCORE at the University of Basel).Core Facilities35 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016 Project discussion at the Bioinformatics Core Facility.36 Department of Biomedicine . Report is a centralized platform that provides cutting-edge microscopes and expert support to all DBM researchers. The field of light microscopy is dynamic and rapidly evolving. Just in in 2014 Eric Betzig, Stefan W. Hell and William E. Moerner shared a Nobel Prize for 'super-res - olution' microscopy. Before this invention, microscopes were limited to imaging at the micrometer-scale; super-resolution microscopy now pushes this limit to the nanometer range - creating new the possibilities for scientific discoveries. This field is just one example where the microscopy core facility has greatly facilitated access to a new technology for DBM researchers by providing the expertise re - quired to purchase, operate and maintain a super-resolution microscope. Infrastructure and equipment The facility staff is currently supervising over 20 high-end microscopes, including super-resolution, confocal, widefield, FRAP, slide scanning, live-cell imaging, flow cytometer imaging, stereo, and laser capture mi - crodissection. The facility also provides resources for image analysis, including high-end computers, virtual machines, data and image analysis servers, and sev - eral commercial and open-source image analysis softwares. Training and support The facility trains and advises researchers throughout the entire microscopy pro - cess, from initial idea to publication. Support often starts with a conversation about the biology and leads to a robust microscopy experimental design that in - cludes sample preparation, choice of microscope, software for image visualization, and strategy for analysis. Researchers are then trained to work independently at the corresponding microscopes and computers. Future developments In order to learn and develop new microscopy technology, the facility is embed - ded in European and Swiss microscopy networks. In the Basel area, the academ - ic microscopy facilities are organized within the Microscopy Network Basel (MNB, https://microscopynetwork.unibas.ch/home/). The MNB facilitates interactions on the levels of sharing resources and knowledge, fostering collaborations and co-or - ganizing courses, equipment demonstrations, seminars or symposia. While the core facility staff is constantly keeping up with the latest technological developments, a steering committee of DBM research group leaders is providing instrumental guidance. This allows the facility swiftly adapt to the changing and developing needs of the DBM research community.Core Facilities37 Department of Biomedicine .

Report 2014-2016 Flow CytometryFlow Cytometry is a key technology for many DBM research groups in the focal ar - eas immunology & infectious disease, oncology & cancer research and stem cells & regenerative medicine. The DBM Flow Cytometry Facility (FCF) provides high- end infrastructure and expertise for cell sorting and flow cytometric analyses. To analyze prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells, organelles or chromosomes, the sus - pended particles are injected into a constantly flowing sheath stream that passes along several laser beams and a sensitive fluorescence detection area. Each cell that is passing this area can be examined for the presence of multiple fluorescent probes at rates of several ten thousand events per second. Real-time data analy - sis provides exact statistics about signal intensity and frequency of each cell and multiple subpopulations. These can be analyzed directly or further isolated by Flu - orescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). Training and service The facility is run by specialized and highly trained FACS operators who assure that the state-of-the-art technology can be used to its full potential. Cell sorting is gen - erally performed by an FCF operator, while cytometric analyses are carried out by the researchers. To assure a high standard, the FCF staff is providing a sound user training, regular maintenance and calibration of the equipment and correct sample handling. The FCF support covers advice on the experimental design (e.g. sam - ple preparation, selection of optimal antibody panel and fluorophores), the proper setup of instruments and advice in data visualization, interpretation and analysis. In addition, the FCF staff is also supporting cytometers and cell sorters at DBM- Mattenstrasse and DBM-Petersplatz and is providing technical advice to their re - searchers. Infrastructure The FCF equipment offers the possibility to detect up to eighteen different fluo - rescent tags to define specific cell types, which is providing an unparalleled, mul - tiparametric tool for cell characterization and cell isolation. Currently, the facility is maintaining an equipment park with two BD FACSAria III and two BD Influx cell sorters, as well as three high-end BD BD Accuri C6. The facility is accessible to trained users on a 24h/365d basis. While the core facility staff is following the latest technological developments, a steering committee of DBM research group leaders is providing instrumental guid - ance. This allows the facility to swiftly adapt to the evolving needs of the DBM re - search community.Core Facilities Danny Labes danny.labes@unibas.ch .

Report 2014-201643 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016Understanding the molecular events underlying diseases of the nervous system and exploiting this knowledge for improving treatment are among the major chal - lenges in the life sciences. In view of the increasing social and financial burden generated by these diseases, especially in the setting of an ageing population, the Department of Biomedicine (DBM) has defined the neurosciences as one of its fo - cal areas. The Focal Area Neurobiology of the DBM complements parallel efforts at the Biozentrum and at the Friedrich Miescher Institute (FMI) and is part of the Neuro - science Network Basel (NNB), which was acknowledged as a center of compe - tence by the University of Basel in fall 2008. The NNB follows a translational strat - egy and comprises more than 400 neuroscientists from 40 different laboratories associated with the University, the University Hospitals, the FMI and the Basel Life Science Industry. Research is conducted at all levels - from molecules to behavior - thus providing outstanding research opportunities and an excellent platform for a strong educa - tional program. Furthermore, the NNB offers weekly research seminars and lec - ture series at the graduate and postgraduate levels, covering all aspects of basic and clinical neuroscience. Finally, the NNB is part of the trinational educational and collaborative NEUREX network along with the neuroscience programs at the Uni - versities of Freiburg (Germany) and Strasbourg (France). A major aim of the Neuroscience groups at the DBM is to take advantage of the unique expertise in the neurosciences present in the Basel area to pursue transla - tional research projects. As a consequence of these efforts, basic and clinical neu - roscientists have contributed to the development of innovative therapies with lead - ing roles in international colaborations and successfully raised grant support for translational research projects from the Swiss National Science Foundation, the European Union, the Swiss Cancer League, the Swiss MS Society and various pri - vate foundations. The focus of these projects is on neuroinflammatory, neurode - generative, psychiatric, neurological and neuromuscular disorders. Several mem - bers of the DBM/NNB are actively involved in the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) \"The Synaptic Bases of Mental Diseases\". To promote the rapid translation of research results into clinical practice the DBM Focal Area Neurobiology co-organizes the Annual Basel sium \"From Bench to Bedside\". The one-day event provides a platform for ex - change of ideas and is regularly attended by more than 150 local neuroscientists, including basic and clinical researchers from Novartis, Roche, Actelion, Santhera Pharmaceuticals, the FMI and the University of Basel.Neurobiology Bernhard Bettler Department of Biomedicine Physiology University of Basel Ludwig Kappos Department of Biomedicine Division of Neurology University Hospital Basel44 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016Group Members Lisa Adelfinger (PhD Student)* Dr. Werthmann (Postdoc)* Wu (Postdoc) * left during report period Bernhard Bettler Department of Biomedicine Physiology University of BaselThe signaling repertoire of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the central ner - vous system is expanded through interaction with trafficking, effector and regula - tory proteins that constitute stable multi-protein receptor complexes with distinct composition and localization. We have started to deconstruct and reconstruct GPCR complexes in native and recombinant expression systems to address how the composition of such complexes influences fundamental processes such as neuronal excitability and network oscillations. Our ultimate goal is to identify novel drug targets for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases. GABAB receptors GABAB receptors are the GPCRs for the inhibitory neurotransmitter -aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABAB receptors have been implicated in a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions, including epilepsy, essential tremor, anxiety, depres - sion, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, addiction and pain. Despite the involvement of GABAB receptors in mental health disorders, the clinical use of GABAB recep - tor drugs is currently limited to agonists and the treatment of narcolepsy, neuro - pathic pain, spasticity and dystonia. One reason for this is that the main therapeu - tic effect of baclofen - muscle relaxation - is an unwanted side effect for mental health indications. A large body of work supports that native GABAB receptors vary in their kinetic and signaling properties. To some extent, this may be explained by receptor-as - sociated proteins. In collaboration with B. Fakler (Freiburg iBr) we purified native GABAB receptor complexes and identified ~30 constituents using tandem mass- spectrometry (Schwenk et al. , Nature Neurosci., 2016). We found that GABAB re- ceptors not only comprise principal GABAB1 and GABAB2 subunits but also four auxiliary KCTD subunits. These auxiliary subunits regulate the kinetics of the re - ceptor response and influence circadian rhythmicity and emotions in behaving mice (Turecek et al. , Neuron, 2014; Cathomen et al. , Psychiatry, 2016). Prin - and auxiliary receptors subunits, together with the heterotrimeric G-protein, can be viewed as the core building blocks of receptors. Peripheral building blocks can bind to these core building blocks and assemble into receptor complexes with unique properties. Peripheral building blocks comprise effector channels, el - ements of the presynaptic release machinery and proteins that regulate recep - tor localization. For example, we identified HCN channels (Schwenk et al. , Nature Neurosci., 2016) and TRPV1 channels (Hanack et al. , Cell, 2016; collaboration with J. Siemens, Heidelberg) as novel effector channels of GABA B receptors. Togeth - er with H. Br\u00e4uner-Osborne (Copenhagen), a medicinal chemist, we are currently developing synthetic compounds that interfere with defined receptor complexes. These compounds will be tested for their therapeutic potential in psychiatric indi - cations. The advantages of such compounds could include a reduction in side ef - fects as well as entirely new therapeutic applications. mGlu5 Receptors In collaboration with L. Lindemann (Roche, Basle) we have identified mGlu5 recep - tor-associated proteins.

Proximity of HCN2 channels and GABAB receptors at the postsynapse of GABAergic synapses in WT facilitates activation channels). Activated HCN2 channels introduce an additional shunt in the membrane that interferes with propagation of IPSPs to the soma of dopaminergic neurons (indicated with a weak arrow). In KCTD16-/- neurons HCN2 channels are dissociated from receptors and their effector Kir3 channels, which removes HCN2 channels from the hyperpolarizing influence of IP - SPs. A drift of the HCN2 channels to more distal dendritic locations, relative to the postsynapse, results in stronger signal propagation and larger IPSPs at the soma (indicated with a strong arrow).

Report 2014-2016Fig. 1: Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Adult neural stem cells are localized within the subgranular zone of the hippocampus to generate neural progenitors and thereby postmitotic neurons. During a period of about 6-8 weeks the surviving neurons form thousands of new GA - BAergic and glutamatergic synaptic contacts and fully integrate into the mature hippocampal network.The hippocampal formation within the medial temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex is essential for our conscious memory for facts and events. Remarkably, the hip - pocampus is one of the very few regions in the adult mammalian CNS, where new neurons are continuously generated throughout life. This indicates that the new neurons are involved in learning and formation of new memories. However, the un - derlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. During the last three years (2014-2016) we have investigated the regulation of adult neurogenesis on a cellular and behavioural level, and investigated the effects of enhanced neurogenesis on learning and memory in adult mice. Within the hippo - campus, neurogenesis is restricted to granule cells in the dentate gyrus (Figure 1). Adult neural stem cells (green) give rise to transit amplifying cells (yellow) generat - ing postmitotic neuroblasts which subsequently differentiate into young neurons (red). During the following ~6 weeks, they form new dendrites and several thou - sand new synaptic connections within the adult hippocampal network. We investigated the properties of the first GABAergic and glutamatergic synaps - es which sequentially appear a few days and about 2 weeks post mitosis, respec - tively (Heigele et al. 2016, Fig. 1). To investigate adult neurogenesis, we have used an oncoretrovirus which inserts into the DNA of dividing cells to label newly gen - erated neurons with GFP which enables analysis of the young cells in hippocam - pal brain slices. As a second approach, we use transgenic mice expressing the red fluorescent protein DsRed under the control of doublecortin (DCX-DsRed) which is expressed in young neurons for about 3 weeks post mitosis (Fig. 2). Although GABA is an inhibitory transmitter in the adult brain, we have shown that GABA is depolarizing (EGABA= -35 mV) in the newborn neurons for a period of about 3 weeks (Heigele et al. 2016). After 3 weeks the GABA reversal potential shifts to more negative values close to the granule cells resting potential to finally act inhibitory in mature neurons. As glutamatergic synapses are very sparse and inefficient until about 3 weeks post mitosis it was believed that the young neu -Synaptic integration of young neurons into the adult hippocampus Group Members Michael Barz* Selma Becherer (Technician) Student) Constanze Raltschev* (Administrative Assistant) Dr. Jan Michael Schulz (Postdoc) Martine Schwager (Technician) Dr. Mirko Vukcevic* (Postdoc) * left during report periodJosef Bischofberger Calcium Signalling 47 Department of Biomedicine .

Neuroge- nesis was increased by keeping animals for 2-3 weeks in cages with running wheels (see Fig. 3). Fig. 3: Running increase pattern separation during novel object recognition. (A) Adult mice were kept either in con - trol cages (control) or in cages with running wheels (RW) for 2-3 weeks. (B) Afterwards, the animals had to recog - nize and distinguish previously explored familiar and novel objects. (C) Both, running and control mice could recog - nize different distinct objects, briefly explored 24h before. (D) Only running mice (RW), however, could reliably recog - nize different similar objects. Recognition was measured as differential exploration time, quantified as \"novel object recognition\" (NOR) index. Selected Publications Heigele S, Sultan S, Toni N, Bischofberger J.

Func - properties of Physiol. 592:125-40rons do not fire synaptically evoked action potentials (APs). Remarkably, we could show that depolarizing GABAergic synapses can evoke or inhibit APs in the young cells, dependent on the number of active presynaptic GABAergic interneurons. corresponding to about 3-4 interneurons, reliably evoked action potentials. By contrast, when more than 30 % of the synap - tically connected interneurons were active (> 4 nS), spiking was blocked via shunt - ing inhibition. Therefore, moderate interneuron activity could activate young neu - rons and thereby promote functional maturation and synaptic integration of the young cells. In a second project we have studied the formation of new glutamatergic synaps - es at 2-4 weeks post mitosis and its regulation by local astrocytes in collabora - tion with Nicolas Toni (Sultan et al. 2015). Astrocytes release D-serine in an ac - tivity-dependent manner, which is an important cofactor to activate synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors, abundantly expressed in the young neurons dur - ing the period of synapse formation (Schmidt-Salzmann et al. 2014). Therefore, as - trocytes are critically important to regulate new synapse formation in an activity- dependent manner. It is well known that physical activity is associated with hippocampal network ac - tivity. Therefore, we investigated the consequences of 2-3 weeks of voluntary wheel running in adult mice (Figure 3, Bolz et al. 2016). We studied the number of newborn neurons and episodic memory using a \"novel object recognition task\". Furthermore, we have used different types of objects which were either very similar or highly distinct to each other. Whereas both, control and running mice could re - member different distinct objects after the 24h delay period, only the running mice could faithfully recognize the different similar objects (Figure 3D), indicating that increased neurogenesis is in particular important for distinction of similar memo - ry items during memory recall. 48 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury is the result of an impaired delivery of oxygen and/or blood to the infant's brain. One of its typical hallmark is white matter damage, which can severely affect the development of the brain, leading to devas - tating sensory-motor, cognitive and learning deficits in the growing child. Current - ly no available therapy targets the long-term consequences of early brain inju - ry, making regenerative medicine a promising therapeutic option. Several reports suggest that transplanted neural stem cells (NSCs) promote CNS tissue repair not only through cell replacement, but also by providing trophic and immunomodula - tory support for endogenous repair mechanisms, including neurogenesis and ol - igodendrogenesis. A major focus of our research aims at investigating the cellu - lar and molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective role of transplanted NSCs in the context of developmental brain injuries. Impact of NSCs on oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) We have promising preliminary data showing that endovascular injection of human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived NSCs improve both sensory-motor and cogni - tive functions in a rodent model of neonatal HI. We observed that NSCs treatment specifically stimulates white matter repair mechanisms such as OPCs proliferation and maturation with significant increase in myelin basic protein expression. Never - theless, the specific molecular mechanism by which NSCs exert this beneficial ef - fect on OPCs are currently unknown. To address this issue, we are performing in vitro experiments testing the impact of the conditioned medium from human NSCs onto OPCs cultures (Fig. 1) as well as direct cellular interaction between NSCs and OPCs. Our objective is to identify the specific trophic factors released by NSCs that can influence the oligodendroglial lineage. Interaction between microglia and NSCs NSC-mediated regeneration may also occur through immunomodulation of mi - croglia, the immune cells of the brain. Indeed, our research points to a direct inter - action between NSCs and microglia through NSC-secreted factors in vitro and in vivo, in the healthy animals, as published in Mosher et al., 2012. To further under - stand this interaction, we are investigating the impact of a neonatal HI brain injury on the phenotype of microglia in the subventricular zone (SVZ), one of the neuro - genic niches (Fig. 2). The hypothesis is that SVZ microglia adopt a pro-neurogen - ic phenotype, which might contribute to CNS regeneration following HI. Our his - tological data show that the phenotype of microglia undergoes dramatic changes postnatally, and that the HI insult impacts durably these physiological changes. Transcriptomic analyses indicate that HI-exposed SVZ microglia adopt a complex phenotype resembling that observed in neurodegenerative diseases, an intriguing finding that merits further investigation. The implications for SVZ neurogenesis in vivo remain to be explored. Developing matrices to optimize NSCs survival into the host tissue NSCs are typically delivered in a medium solution such as saline. However, once injected, transplanted NSCs show limited survival into the host tissue, thus signif - icantly shortening their therapeutic time-window. To overcome this issue, NSCs can be incorporated in biocompatible matrices. The advantage of such matrices is that they provide physical support for the NSCs, and they can be engineered to carry trophic factors. This research aims at developing matrices that ameliorate NSCs survival, and eventually potentiate central and peripheral neural tissue regeneration. This work is done in collaboration with Prof. D.

Nat Neurosci.Connection to Clinical Practice CSF markers of endogenous regenerative processes in the developing brain Our group teamed up with the CNS Discovery De - partment of Hoffmann-La Roche to evaluate po - tential cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers with a predictive value for neurodevelopmental impair - ments, as there is currently an unmet clinical need for such markers. One of our candidate biomark - ers was doublecortin (DCX), a CNS protein con - sidered as a marker of neurogenesis in the brain (Fig. 3). Through the use of a novel immunoassay (developed by Roche) that allows quantification of doublecortin, we examined the relevance of this protein in the CSF, using the rat model of neonatal HI. Our investigations revealed that doublecortin in the CSF was both a reflector of stroke severity and of HI-induced neurogenesis. We are currently ex - ploring the translational value of these findings by analyzing doublecortin and other CNS biomarkers in the CSF of pediatric patients. Our research is funded by the Swiss National Found (SNF) grant 146632 and SNF grant 31003A_163305 in collaboration with the Fetal and Neonatal Stress Re - search Group of Prof. S. Wellmann at UKBB.

Anti-cal - bindin staining for Purkinje cells is shown in red. The elaborate dendritic tree of this cell has developed almost entirely during the cul - ture period. The dendritic tree reflects the neuronal cell type and the synaptic connections of a given neuron. During development the shape of dendrites is determined by out - growth and retraction of dendritic processes. Our laboratory is interested in how neuronal activity may be linked to the shaping of the dendritic tree of Purkinje cells, the principal cells of the cerebellar cortex. The dendritic tree of Purkinje cells is well developed in organotypic slice cultures (Fig. 1). In previous work we have shown that glutamate receptor activation and increased protein kinase C activity strongly inhibit dendritic development of Purkinje cells. Their inhibitory action is mediated by changes in the calcium equilibrium of the Purkinje cells. The control of intracel - lular calcium is an important link between functional activity and dendritic growth in Purkinje cells we want to further elucidate how changes in functional activity are converted to changes in dendritic growth. For the long-term control of the calcium equilibrium in Purkinje cells calcium clear - ing mechanisms are essential. We have investigated the role of the plasma mem - brane Ca2+- ATPase 2 (PMCA2) which is highly expressed in Purkinje cell dendrit - ic spines. When we applied chronic pharmacological inhibition of PMCA2 function with carboxyeosin we found a mild reduction of the size of Purkinje cell dendritic trees similar to the observation in PMCA2-deficient mice. However, when PMCA2 inhibition was combined with mGluR stimulation it had a partial rescuing effect similar to that seen after blockade of voltage-gated calcium channels. We are cur - rently studying the role of the sodium calcium exchanger (NCX), another important calcium clearing mechanism in Purkinje cells. In addition to controlling dendritic development, protein kinase C activity in Purkinje cells is also linked to SCA-14, a hereditary cerebellar disease with cerebellar dysfunction and Purkinje cell degen - eration. SCA-14 is a particular interesting model because its phenotype and clin - ical settings are indistinguishable from other types of SCA which are caused by polyglutamine expansions. SCA-14, in contrast, is caused by point mutations in the coding region of the PKCgamma gene. The mechanisms by which the muta - tions in the PKCgamma gene lead to Purkinje cell degeneration in SCA-14 are still rather unclear. We have generated a transgenic mouse model in which a mutated form of protein kinase C gamma is expressed specifically in Purkinje cells. In the human disease this mutation causes Purkinje cell dysfunction, degeneration and death. We could show that the presence of the mutated protein in mouse Purkin -Purkinje cell dendritic development and vascular plasticity in the Central Nervous System Group Members Melanie Hassler (MD Student)* Markus Saxer (Technician) Student)* Sabine Winkler (PhD Student) Qinwei Wu (PhD Student) * left during report period Josef Kapfhammer Department of Biomedicine Anatomy University of BaselDevelopmental Cultures Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016Fig. 2: The Purkinje cell dendritic tree in slice cultures derived from mice with transgenic expres - sion of a mutated PKCgamma from SCA14 (B) is severely compromised compared to control (A) and resembles strongly that of Purkinje cell with pharmacological activation of PKCgamma (C).

Fig. 3: For transfection studies Purkinje cells were grown in dissociated cultures. After transfection with a control GFP plasmid Purkinje cells develop a typical dendritic tree in such cultures (A). In contrast, after transfection with CA8, the dendritic tree is smaller and dendritic develop - ment is compromised (B) indicating that CA is involved in controlling Purkinje cell dendritic growth.

Due to the Purkinje cell-specific expression of the transgene we have taken advan - tage of this mouse model for identifying molecules signalling downstream of in - creased PKCgamma activity. Using a gene chip array approach we have identified several potential candidate molecules with increased mRNA expression in Purkin - je cells. Out of those we have further studied carbonic anhydrase 8 (CA8) and have identified it as a potential mediator of PKCgamma activity and Purkinje cell den - dritic development (Fig. 3). Our studies have provided a better understand Purkin - je cell dysfunction and may be helpful for developing novel therapeutic strategies for cerebellar diseases. Neuronal survival is also dependent on an intact blood supply and an intact blood brain barrier. Our group has analysed neurovascular interactions in a slice culture setting. This has allowed us to challenge neurons in organotypic slice cultures by ischemia or excitotoxic compounds and study neuronal survival and the blood vessel architecture simultaneously under these conditions. Our work so far has re - vealed complex interactions between neuronal survival and maintenance of blood vessels under ischemic conditions. This work has provided novel insights in the yet rather poorly explored neurovascular interactions. 52 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016Our research focus is on the pharmacology of psychoactive substances in vitro and in humans. We characterize novel substances (designer drugs) in vitro and also investigate the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of MDMA, LSD, and amphetamines in humans including psychological tests, pharmacogenetics, and functional brain imaging. This work is linked to studies on the acute clinical prob - lems associated with the recreational drug use. In the laboratory, we mainly char - acterize the receptor interaction profiles of novel psychoactive substances and their cytotoxic effects. Novel psychoactive substances Novel psychoactive substances are designer drugs (\"internet drugs\", \"research chemicals\", \"legal highs\") potentially posing similar health risks to clas - sic illicit substances. In the last years we have seen an unprecedented growth in the number of new psychoactive substances on the illicit drug market. Current - ly, more than one new substance is identified in Europe every week. Information on the pharmacology and toxicology of these substances is important to reduce risks to the public. Many novel psychoactive substances interact with biogenic amine neurotransmitter transporters. Amphetamines and MDMA inhibit the dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine transporter and also release these monoamines through the respective transporter. Substances which predominantly release serotonin, similar to MDMA, can be expected to pro - duce MDMA-like effects with serotonergic toxicity including serotonin syndrome, hyponatremia, hyperthermia, and seizures. In contrast, psychostimulants such as methamphetamine or methylphenidate are mostly enhancing dopaminergic neu - rotransmission. Dopamine mediates the reinforcing and addictive properties of drugs of abuse. The relative dopaminergic to serotonergic properties in vitro (do - pamine/serotonin transporter inhibition ratio) of a novel substance can be deter - mined as a useful marker for its potential clinical psychotropic and acute toxic ef - fects (Fig. 1). Mechanism of action of MDMA (ecstasy) MDMA (ecstasy) acutely induces happiness, emotional empathy, and prosocial - ty. MDMA is used as recreational substance and also investigated as medication to assist psychotherapy in psychiatric patients. We demonstrated a critical role for transporter-mediated serotonin and norepinephrine release in the effects of MDMA in humans. The dual serotonin and norepinephrine transporter - loxetine and norepinephrine efflux from trans - mitter loaded cells stably expressing the human serotonin or norepinephrine trans - porter and prevented the MDMA effects in humans. The findings indicate that the psychotropic effects of MDMA in humans depend on transporter-mediated re - lease of both serotonin and norepinephrine. The response to MDMA is also de - pendent on interindividual genetically-determined differences in the metabolism of MDMA. For example, subjects who are cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 poor me - tabolizers show higher plasma concentrations of MDMA and associated faster in - creases in cardiovascular responses to MDMA compared with subjects who are normal metabolizers (Fig. 2). Pharmacokinetics of MDMA and LSD and effects on emotion processing Several clinical studies are investigating the use of MDMA and LSD in substance- assisted psychotherapy to treat post-traumatic stress disorders or anxiety in pa - tients with life-threatening diseases. We therefore studied the pharmacokinetics Pharmacology of novel psychoactive substances, MDMA, and LSD Yasmin Schmid (PhD Student)* Patrick Vizeli (PhD Student) * left during report period Matthias Liechti Department of Biomedicine Division of Clinical Pharma - cology and Toxicology University Hospital MDMA and LSD and the effects of these substances on the processing of emo - tions in healthy subjects. LSD produced subjective drug effects that lasted up to 12h (Fig. 3a) and correlated well with the concentrations of LSD in the blood plas - ma over time (Fig. 3b and c). The half-life of LSD in plasma was 3.5 h. In contrast to LSD, the half-life of MDMA is longer (8h) but the effects of MDMA last only up to 6h despite the continued presence of the substance in the body (Fig. 3d). Thus, there is marked acute tolerance to the effects of MDMA. In a controlled setting, both MDMA and LSD dose-dependently increased feelings of closeness and trust and impaired identification of negative emotions including fear and sadness. These ef - fects of MDMA and LSD on emotion processing may be useful for substance-as - sisted psychotherapy. Fig. 1: Relative dopamine/serotonin inhibition potencies of psychoactive substances. Dopamine to inhibition ratios (mean \u00b1 95% confi - dence intervals) for novel substances are shown in com - parison with those of classic empathogens/entactogens (MDMA, ecstasy) and stimulants (cocaine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine). The ratios derived from in vitro studies help to predict the typically unknown clinical toxic - ity of novel substances. A low DAT/SERT inhibition ratio (<0.1) indicates tenfold greater relative serotonergic vs. do - paminergic activity similar to MDMA. A high DAT/SERT in - hibition ratio (>10) indicates greater relative dopaminergic vs. serotonergic activity similar to methamphetamine. A high DAT/SERT inhibition ratio is a pharmacological char - acteristic associated with more stimulant effects and with higher potential for addiction.

Tobias Derfuss Department Biomedicine Division of Neurology University Hospital BaselRaija Lindberg Gasser Department of Biomedicine Division of Neurology University Hospital BaselOur research focuses the molecular and immunological analysis of multiple scle - rosis (MS), an inflammatory, demyelinating central nervous system (CNS) disease. We have two main research lines: 1) genomic investigations (including genetic, transcriptional and protein expression analysis) and 2) studies on B cell involve - ment in MS pathogenesis. Both approaches provide tools and markers for immu - nomonitoring of current and newly emerging treatments. Immune regulation by microRNAs in MS MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNA molecules, which modulate gene- expression of > 50 % of all protein-encoding genes, and are key regulators of a wide variety of biological processes, e.g. cell proliferation, differentiation, apopto - sis and organ development. Our cellular miRNA studies in immune cells from MS patients have revealed distinct expression profiles compared with those in healthy volunteers. We have also shown that natalizumab, the treatment for relapsing-re - mitting MS, has diverse effects on miRNA expression. We uncovered recently a specific effect of natalizumab on the expression of miR-126 and miR-10 and their potential target, POU2AF1, an important regulator of the transcription factor Spi- B, which binds to unique sequences of the JC virus and plays a critical role in driving virus activity (Meira et al. , 2014, 2016, Fig. 1). Natalizumab treatment has been associated with the development of progressive multifocal leukoencepha - lopathy (PML), a severe opportunistic infection of the CNS caused by reactivation of the latent JC virus. We are presently evaluating the expression of miR-126/10 and POU2AF1 as biomarkers for a PML risk in MS patients treated with natalizum - ab. Another focus of our research is extracellular miRNAs, stored in extracellular vesicles (EVs), in serum and CSF from MS patients. Our aim is to get new insights into the functional role of EVs in immune regulation and cell-to-cell communica - tion in MS. Molecular and immunological analysis of Biomedicine .

Lancet Neurology 2016 (in press) Connection to Clinical Practice Our Laboratory is closely connected to the MS Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Neurology, University Hospital Basel that cares for more than 1000 MS patients per year. This allows access to a population of MS-patients in different stages of the disease. There is also a close collaboration with the Division of Neuroradiology and the Medical Im - age Analysis Centre (MIAC) that enables charac - terization of patients with cutting edge neuroimag - ing techniques. Our Clinical MS Research Group plays a key role in organizing and conducting inter - national therapeutic studies in MS, e.g. with siponi - mod, amiselimod (Kappos L, 2016), the humanized monoclonal antibodies ocrelizumab, daclizum - ab, and GNbAC1. These trials provide unique pos - sibilities to apply basic research approaches to understand disease mechanisms and therapeu - tic responses. Development of biomarkers needs prospective, standardized, and high-quality clini - cal and neuroradiological data from large patient cohorts to allow for validation and implementation in clinical practice. The Swiss MS Cohort Study (SMSC), supported by the Swiss MS Society and coordinated by our MS Group was initiated in 2012. It aims at building and maintaining a long-term co - hort of Swiss MS patients with clinical and MRI fol - low-up data as well as sampling of body fluids.B cells and their targets in MS B-cells have a major role in the pathogenesis of MS. Depletion of B-cells leads to a remarkable amelioration of the disease. The mechanisms by which B-cells impact MS are however incompletely understood. Our research focuses on the identifica - tion of novel B-cell autoantigens and the characterization of the interaction of au - toaggressive B-cells with the CNS. We could show that antibodies against native myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) identify a subset of - romyelitis optica (Pr\u00f6bstel et al. , 2015). Antibodies against the potassium channel KIR4.1 have been suggested as a biomarker in MS. Using eukaryotic expression of this protein we could show that the prominently described antibody reactiv - ities are directed against other proteins than KIR4.1 and that the assay as pub - lished is not useful for clinical practice (Pr\u00f6bstel et al. , 2016, Fig 2). Currently, we are using transgenic animals to better characterize the pathogenic mechanisms of B cells in the animal model of MS. We identified the co-capture of membrane an - tigens by the B cell receptor as a key step in initiating an autoimmune response. This work will be continued in analyzing the capacity of B cell to migrate to periph - eral tissues and harvest their cognate and non-cognate antigens from the tissue. This phenomenon of membrane capture will also be used to identify novel auto - antigens in MS. Immunomonitoring of new treatments and biomarker research The mode of action of many current disease modifying treatments is often not well understood. We aim to get a better understanding of the mode of action and there - by identify candidates for treatment response biomarkers. Currently, we are re - cruiting MS patients that start treatment with dimethyl fumarate. Immune cells of the blood as well as serum will be analyzed for immunological markers, and miR - NA/RNA expression profiles that could potentially correlate with the clinical re - sponse to treatment. Combination of these biomarkers with a standardized clinical and neuroradiologic assessment will hopefully provide means to better character - ize the heterogeneous MS patient populations and to predict the disease course and the treatment response. 56 Department of Biomedicine .

Re - cently, the role of the optic nerve microenvironment shaped by meningothelial cells (MECs) became evident with optic nerve compartmentalization connected to op - tic nerve damage and visual impairment. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction is also central to RGC failure and death. Our work focused on characterizing the cellular component of the optic nerve mi - croenvironment and the role of mitochondrial maintenance on neuronal survival. Furthermore, to translate insight into mitochondrial dysfunction towards treatment options for patients suffering from optic nerve degeneration, we are developing ar - tificial transcription factors targeting OPA1, a key regulator of mitochondrial mor - phology, to treat autosomal dominant optic atrophy. The optic nerve microenvironment As part of the central nervous system, the optic nerve is ensheathed by meninges and bathed in cerebrospinal fluid forming a specific microenvironment. Meningo - thelial cells covering the meninges constitute the cellular component of this micro - environment. Previous work point to an involvement of MECs in pathophysiologi - cal processes leading to optic nerve damage as observed during glaucoma. Our recent work revealed, MECs are highly active facultative phagocytes capable of ingesting bacteria and also apoptotic cells, thereby acting immune modulatory by secreting pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, respectively. Fur - thermore, MECs are capable of ingesting large amounts of neurotoxic substances, e. g. the Alzheimer's disease-related amyloid-beta peptide, and display a remark - able resistance to such substances. Our work strongly suggests a neuroprotective function for MECs through cerebrospinal fluid conditioning and clearance. Mitochondrial maintenance and degeneration of neuronal cells Mitochondrial dysfunction is at the heart of neurodegeneration with specific qual - ity control mechanisms responsible for maintaining mitochondrial and therefore neuronal function. Previously, we studied the role of mitochondrial ubiquitin ligas - es, now we focused on the AAA-ATPase p97 and its role in mitochondrial main - tenacne. We found that p97 is responsible for the removal of oxidatively and ni - trosatively damaged mitochondrial proteins and that blockage of this process is deleterious to neuronal cells. We also recently identified three novel co-factors of p97 involved likely involved in maintaining mitochondrial function through targeted protein degradation and targeted autophagic destruction of mitochondria. Treating autosomal dominant optic atrophy Dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is a neuro-ophthalmic condition characterized by the degeneration of the optic nerve resulting in blindness. DOA is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is caused by mutations in OPA1. OPA1 is a mito - chondrial protein and is involved in mitochondrial dynamics and maintenance of mitochondrial cristae structure. Thus, interfering with OPA1 function leads to dis - turbed mitochondrial dynamics and higher susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli. In DOA, cellular OPA1 levels are reduced due to various haploinsufficient mutations. While this reduction of OPA1 levels to about 50 % does not impact the function of most cells, neurons and especially RGCs depend on full OPA1 function. Thus, re - storing wildtype levels of OPA1 in RGCs would constitute a functional cure for DOA. The optic nerve: Why does it fail and what to do about it?

(A) By combining a catalytically inactive form of the RNA-guided Staphylococcus aureus endonuclease Cas9 (SpdCas9) with a protein domain capable of driving gene expression (e. g. VP64), a RNA-guided transactivator can be generated. By selecting appropriate guide- RNAs, virtually every gene promoter of inter - est can be targeted. While not all guideRNAs will direct SpdCas9 to a site suitable for in - ducing gene activation, the relative ease of guideRNA generation allows probing multiple sites inside a gene promoter greatly acceler - ating development times compared to other artificial transcription factor approaches. (B) AAV2-mediated delivery of SpdCas9 to retinal ganglion cells together with a suitable guideRNA targeting the OPA1- promoter is envisioned to increase OPA1 transcript lev - els, thereby restoring wildtype levels of OPA1 protein, negating haploinsufficiency, and pre - venting RGC death.To this end, we generated a CRISPR-Cas9-based artificial transactivator capable of upregulating OPA1 in mouse neuronal cells in vitro and are in the process of de - veloping viral vectors for delivery of such therapeutics to retinal ganglion cells in vivo. In addition, we established two mouse models of DOA in the lab to assess a therapeutic benefit of such artificial CRISPR-Cas9 transactivators for the treat - ment of this blinding disease.Connection to Clinical Practice Prof. Hendrik Scholl Professor and Chairman, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Basel, University Hospital Basel The ocular pharmacology and physiology lab is closely connected to the University Hospital Eye Clinic under the chairmanship of Prof. Dr. Hendrik Scholl. The main focus is to not only understand mechanisms of (neuro)-degenerative processes of the retina and the optic nerve, but also to modulate these processes to provide better outcomes for patients. In particular, new treatment approaches, including gene therapy and pharmacotherapy, for retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP), age-related macular degenera - tion and diabetic retinopathy are being developed or applied in clinical trials to patients. Also, a close and fruitful collaboration with the Institute of Pa - thology enables access to valuable tissue samples to study human optic nerves to better understand and validate findings from in vitro studies. 58 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016Our research interest is to understand the role and mechanism of cell-to-cell spreading of toxic proteins in neurodegenerative protein misfolding diseases In neurodegenerative diseases the nervous system gets progressively altered. Im - paired structure and function, which is due to degeneration of neural cells, results in severe behavioral disabilities and often death of the patient. Protein misfolding diseases (PMDs) are a class of neurodegenerative disorders, in which disease pathogenesis is accompanied by the deposition of -sheet-rich amyloid aggregates. In each PMD, aggregates are composed of specific misfold - ed proteins, such as A (amyloid- ) and tau in Alzheimer's disease, (SOD1) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and TAR-DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in ALS and frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD) and the prion protein (PrP) in prion disorders. These proteins have little in common, other than show - ing abnormal folding and aggregation. Pathological lesions in PMDs typically start in disease-specific brain regions from where the pathology progressively spreads throughout the brain in patterns that match functional neuronal connectivity. It was first recognized in prion disorders that this stereotypic spreading is due to trans - neuronal propagation of the pathogenic form of the PrP (PrP SC or PrP scrapie). A series of exciting new studies have now provided strong experimental evidence that a 'prion-like' self-propagating mechanism is applicable to a variety of dis - ease-linked proteins, including tau, -synuclein, huntingtin and tdp-43. Further - more, recent work suggests that the spreading of these pathogenic proteins, like the spreading of pathological lesions, follow disease-specific patterns and neural networks that resemble the architecture of functional synaptic connectivity in the healthy human brain. The spreading of misfolded proteins is therefore likely a com - mon feature of neurodegenerative PMDs and might be an important contributor to non-cell autonomous neuronal damage. However, many aspects of this process remain unknown including its contribution to disease progression and the under - lying molecular mechanisms. This hampers the discovery of potential novel thera - peutics in PMDs, for which so far no effective treatments exist. Therefore, the aim of our studies is to understand whether toxic protein spreading is a fundamental trigger for the onset and a key factor for the progression of neu - rodegeneration. We want to understand the role neuronal connectivity plays in this process and elucidate the underlying cellular/ molecular pathways involved in the spreading of toxic proteins. Initially Huntington's disease is used as a model dis - ease, but the ultimate goal is to know whether toxic protein spreading is a disease pathway shared by Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS and many oth - ers. As revealing the existence of a common disease pathway would create the unique possibility to develop the same or a similar therapeutic strategy for all these devastating illnesses. We will approach the above questions by using a combination of genetic mouse models, patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells, molecular biology tools, imaging, optogenetics and electrophysiology to reveal: The relation between spreading and neuronal degeneration. The role neuronal connectivity plays in spreading. The cellular and molecular components borrowed by toxic proteins to transcel - lular (neuron-neuron, neuron-glia) propagate. This is done in state-of-the art in vitro and in vivo experimental designs, includ - ing co-cultures of mouse organotypical brain slices with human stem cell-derived neurons to address disease specific questions in a human related context.

Report 2014-2016Sounds and hearing play a pivotal role in human communication. People who suf - fer from central auditory processing abnormalities are affected in their daily lives and might not be able to appreciate even the most basic verbal communication. Tinnitus, in which phantom sounds are experienced in the absence of acoustic stimulation, is an example of pathology of the central auditory system. Ten percent of the human population suffers from auditory cortex disorders, yet we understand very little about its role in making sense of sounds. In our lab we study the development and function of the auditory cortex. We com - bine optogenetics, in vivo physiology, voltage-sensitive dye imaging and behavior - al assays to explore the role of its neuronal circuits. The goal of our research is to give a new insight into the function of the auditory system and to lead to new ways of reinstating normal connectivity in cases of abnormal signal processing. Ongoing work is directed towards three main questions: 1) How do auditory cor - tical responses develop and how can they be modified? 2) What neuronal circuits are involved in specific sound features, and how do they influence behavior? 3) What influences does the environment have on regulating these auditory neuro - nal circuits? Neuronal responses to different sound features develop asynchronously Using in vivo electrophysiological recording and voltage-sensitive dye imaging in the mouse auditory cortex, we are characterizing the development of auditory re - sponses to sounds of increasing complexity, like pure frequency tones, frequency- or amplitude-modulated sweeps. We also determine the time windows - known as critical periods for plasticity - during which brain organisation can be modified by passive sound exposure. Our results indicate that responses to sound features of increasing complexity ma - ture asynchronously. Passive exposure to these sound features changes neuronal circuit organisation during distinct time windows (Fig. 1). Interestingly, these criti - cal periods coincide with the maturation of sound feature representation. This indi - cates that sensory development and plasticity involve the same cortical substrate. We are currently studying the underlying cortical circuits to shed a new light on how the brain processes different sounds during development. Interneurons enhance tone frequency selectivity in auditory cortex Using optogenetics combined with electrophysiology, we are studying the role of neuronal subpopulations in shaping responses to specific sound features. We are also assessing the behavioural consequences of controlling these neuronal sub - groups in auditory relevant tasks. The subpopulations we now focus on are inhibi - tory neuron subclasses, like the parvalbumin-, somatostatin- or vasointestinal pro - tein-expressing neurons. Our results indicate that inhibitory neurons enhance tone frequency selectivity in response to pure frequency tones (Fig. 2). These changes are correlated with changes at the behavioural level: increasing frequency selectivity at the neuronal level with optogenetics also increases the ability to discriminate to sounds in a go/ nogo behavioural task. We are currently determining whether different types of in - terneurons play a different role in this frequency selectivity, and also whether these subclasses of neurons have a different role in responding to more complex sounds.Development and function of neuronal circuits in the central auditory system Group Members Dr. Stitipragyan Bhumika (Postdoc) (Research Student) Dr. Ivan Usov (Research Assistant)* Ramona Felix (Administrative Assistant) * left during report period Tania Rinaldi Barkat Department of Biomedicine Physiology University of BaselBrain and Sound LabAuditory System .

Our results indicate that the external environment can have very different conse - quences on a developing or a mature brain. We are currently determining the spe - cific cell types and circuits modified by these environmental exposures, and to what extend these changes can be reversed. This research will have an impact on the way we look at the constant occupational noise that we and our children are exposed to on a daily basis, ranging from background music, construction work or even psychosocial stress. 62 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016 Group Members Lukas Enz (MD-PhD Student) during periodNicole Schaeren- Wiemers Department of Biomedicine University Hospital BaselOligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the central nervous system. Their main function is to insulate axons to enable saltatory conduction. They further support neurons by providing continuous metabolic and trophic support. To ful - fill these tasks oligodendrocytes maintain up to 50 single myelin sheaths support - ing many axons at a time. Oligodendrocytes derive from the neuroectoderm and are the last neural cells differentiating during development. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) pro - liferate, migrate and finally contact axons which they ultimately myelinate. This process is tightly controlled not only by a complex intrinsic oligodendrocyte dif - ferentiation program, but also by external reciprocal signaling processes such as the degree of neuronal differentiation. Due to their complex architecture and high metabolic demands, oligodendrocyte function can be easily disturbed; because of that they are often referred to as \"the most vulnerable cells of the CNS\". This is especially unfortunate in the case of disturbances of brain homeostasis. Many events can lead to such disturbances; among them inflammatory pathomecha - nisms of the CNS such as in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In the context of inflamma - tion, oligodendrocytes are generally believed to be simply victims of the inflamma - tory reaction, being lucky they survive. However, this view is probably too simple, and an increasing body of evidence demonstrates that oligodendrocytes can re - act and/or act if challenged by immune reactions (Fig. 1). They express various cy - tokines and chemokines, antigen presenting molecules and co-stimulatory mole - cules, complement and complement receptor molecules, complement regulatory molecules, tetraspanins, neuroimmune regulatory proteins as well as extracellu - lar matrix proteins and many others. Their potential immunomodulatory proper - ties can, at specific times and locations, influence ongoing immune processes as shown by numerous publications. Therefore, oligodendrocytes are well capable of immunomodulation, especially during the initiation or resolution of immune pro - cesses in which subtle signaling might tip the scale. A better understanding of the immunomodulatory oligodendrocyte can help to invent new, innovative therapeu - tic interventions in various diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis. These potential immunomodulatory features of oligodendrocytes are the topic of a recent re - view (Zeis et al. , Brain Research 2016). Emerging as an important correlate of neurological dysfunction in MS, extend - ed focal and diffuse gray matter abnormalities have been found and linked to clinical manifestations such as seizures, fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. To in - vestigate possible underlying mechanisms we analyzed the molecular alterations in histopathological normal appearing cortical gray matter (NAGM) in MS. By per - forming a differential gene expression analysis of NAGM of control and MS cas - es we identified reduced transcription of astrocyte specific genes involved in the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) and the glutamate-glutamine cy - cle (GGC) (Fig. 2). Additional quantitative immunohistochemical analysis demon - strating a CX43 loss in MS NAGM confirmed a crucial involvement of astrocytes and emphasizes their importance in MS pathogenesis. Concurrently, a Toll-like/ IL-1 signaling expression signature was detected in MS NAGM, indicating that immune-related signaling might be responsible for the downregulation of ANLS and GGC gene expression in MS NAGM. Indeed, challenging astrocytes with im - mune stimuli such as IL-1b and LPS reduced their ANLS and GGC gene expres - sion in vitro . detected upregulation of IL1B in MS NAGM suggests inflamma - some priming. For this reason, astrocyte cultures were treated with ATP and ATP/ LPS as for inflammasome activation. This treatment led to a reduction of ANLS and GGC gene expression in a comparable manner.

Mem - bers of the STAT6 signaling pathway, such as IL-4R, IL13R, JAK1 and STAT6, were shown to be expressed by oligodendrocytes. This might indicate an anti-inflammatory \"Th-2\"- like response by oligodendrocytes. Further - more, treatment of oligodendrocytes with a sub-lethal dose of IFN- and TNF- led to the - dendrocytes might play an immune-modu - lating role MS (Zeis and Schaeren-Wiemers, 2008). Fig. 2: Differential gene expression in normal appearing cortical gray matter of chronic MS. Schematic drawing of genes belonging to the ANLS and GGC. This model in - cludes the following sequence of molecular events: Fol - lowing increased synaptic activity glutamate into the synaptic cleft. Glutamate is avidly taken up by the astrocytes sur - rounding the synaptic cleft, increasing intracellular sodium concentration in the astrocyte and activating the energy dependent Na+/K+ ATPase pump (through the recruitment of the alpha 2 subunit). The corresponding hydrolysis of ATP leads to activation of astrocytic glycolysis, i.e. the degradation of glucose to pyruvate, which is then convert - ed to lactate via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Lactate is then released monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1 and 4) into the extracellular space and from there taken up by the neurons (via MCT2). In neurons it serves as an energy substrate following its intracellular conver - sion to pyruvate by LDH. Genes which were found by qRT- PCR to be highly significantly (p 0.001) downregulated in MS NAGM are shown in dark green (in bold), genes with a higher p-value showing a tendency to be downregulated are shown in light green. Genes showing a tendency to be upregulated are shown in light red. Red bolt indicates cou - pling of glutamate transport with glucose utilization.

(2014) Tran - scriptional regulation induced by cAMP we first performed an adjuvant- driven stimulation of the peripheral immune system in C57Bl/6 mice in vivo . This led to similar gene expression changes in spinal cord demonstrating that periph - eral immune signals might be one source for astrocytic gene expression changes in the brain. IL1B upregulation in MS NAGM itself points to a possible endogenous signaling process leading to ANLS and GGC downregulation. This is supported by our findings that, among others, MS NAGM astrocytes express inflammasome components and that astrocytes are capable to release Il-1 in vitro. Altogether, our data suggests that immune signaling of immune- and/or central nervous sys - tem origin drives alterations in astrocytic ANLS and GGC gene regulation in the MS NAGM. Such a mechanism might underlie cortical brain dysfunctions frequently encountered in MS patients (Zeis et al. , BBI 2015).64 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016Fig. 1: The molecular basis of DM1 is an expansion of an unstable repeat sequence in the noncoding part of the DMPK gene (A). Severity of disease is correlated with the size of the repeat expansion (A). In DM1, the mutation is located in a noncoding region and does not alter the protein sequence, but leads to toxic RNA (B). The sequestration of the alternative splicing factor MBNL1 by toxic RNA leads to altered splicing of target pre-mRNAs like CLCN1, encoding muscle-specific chloride channel (ClC-1). This to ClC-1 deficiency and to myotonia (C).

We developed a DM1 pathomechanism-based biochemical assay and screened a collection of isolated natural compounds, as well as a library of over 2100 extracts from plants and fungal strains. HPLC-based activity profiling in combination with spectroscopic methods were used to identify the active princi - ples in the extracts. Bioactivity of the identified compounds was tested in a human cell model and in a mouse model of DM1. We identified several alkaloids, including the beta-carboline harmine and the isoquinoline berberine, which ameliorated cer - tain aspects of the DM1 pathology in these models. These compounds may pro - vide pharmacophores for further medicinal chemistry optimization. To investigate whether deregulation of central metabolic pathways such as AMPK/ mTOR may also be implicated in the pathogenesis of DM1, we are currently exam - ining human skeletal muscle biopsies, as well as human cell lines and DM1 mice challenged by different conditions.

In a broader context we are interested in the disruption of the proteostasis network as a possible pathomechanism for diseases affecting skeletal muscle. In collab - oration with the research group of Prof. Markus R\u00fcegg, Biozentrum Basel, we are investigating the implications of mTOR deregulation on muscle homeostasis and are studying the function and regulation of atrogenes, in particular the regulation of the F-box protein Fbxo32, which represents a potential therapeutic target against muscle wasting diseases. Dysferlin is a transmembrane protein involved in surface membrane repair of mus - cle cells. Mutations in dysferlin cause the muscular dystrophies Miyoshi Myopathy and Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2B. In the laboratory we aim at develop - ing novel treatment strategies for these diseases. Mouse models are valuable tools to test novel therapeutic approaches. A prerequisite for successful animal stud - ies using genetic mouse models is an accurate genotyping protocol. Unfortunately, the lack of robustness of the currently available genotyping protocols for the Dys - ftm1Kcam mouse, a widely used dysferlin knock-out mouse model, has prevented efficient colony management. Initial attempts to improve the genotyping protocol based on the published genomic structure failed. These difficulties led us to ana - lyze the targeted locus of the dysferlin gene of the Dysftm1Kcam mouse in great - er detail. We found that instead of a deletion, the dysferlin locus in the Dysftm1K - cam mice carried a targeted insertion. This genetic characterization enabled us to establish a reliable method for genotyping of the Dysftm1Kcam mouse, and thus has made efficient colony management possible. These results will help the scien - tific community to use the Dysftm1Kcam mouse model for future studies on dys - ferlinopathies. 66 Department of Biomedicine .

Albert Urwyler (Research Associate) Dr. Francesco Zorzato (Research Associate) * left during report period Fig. 1: Cartoon depicting how mutations in RYR1 lead to a decrease in RyR1 con - tent thereby leading to weak muscles. Mutations lead to DNA hyper-methylation and HDAC-4/HDAC-5 over-expression. This causes mef2 sequestration thereby inhibiting transcription of genes regulated by mef2, in - cluding the RYR1 and muscle-specific miRs. A decrease in RyR1 would severely affect muscle excitation-contraction coupling since this calcium channel is a central player in this mechanism, releasing the calcium necessary for muscle contraction from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.Calcium is a universal second messenger regulating different biological functions from muscle contraction, to gene transcription and cell death. In skeletal muscle, Ca2+ regulates contraction and relaxation and alterations in its intracellular con - centration can lead to neuromuscular disorders. Investigations carried out during the past decade have shown that in more than 50 % of the cases, Central Core Dis - ease, Multiminicore disease and Malignant Hyperthermia are linked to point muta - tions in the gene encoding the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium re - lease channel ryanodine receptor (RyR1). There are three isoforms of RyR that are expressed in different tissues; type 1 is preferentially expressed in skeletal muscles but recent data has shown that it is also expressed in some areas of the central nervous system, in some immune cells and in smooth muscle cells. These results imply that mutations in RYR1 may lead to alterations of Ca2+ homeostasis not only in skeletal muscle, but also in other tissues expressing this intracellular calcium release channel. Indeed ryanodinop - athies have recently been implicated in other clinical conditions such as bleed - ing disorders, sepsis and intensive care polyneuropathiy, broadening the clinical spectrum of disorders linked to altered RyR1functions. Interestingly, type 3 RyR which was reported to be expressed at low levels in many tissues, appears to be the predominant isoform in extraocular muscles and we are currently investigating its role in this group of muscles, by using a RYR3 KO animal mouse model. Our research also focuses on different aspects of calcium regulation in skele - tal muscle under normal and pathological conditions and on the identification of pathomechanisms in congenital muscle disorders. While most dominant RYR1 mutations affect Ca2+ homeostasis by changing the biophysical properties of the RyR1 Ca2+ channel, the mode of action of recessive RYR1 mutations is more elu - sive, especially since at the level of myotubes, effects on Ca2+homeostasis are not prominent. On the other hand, striking changes occur in the patient's muscles. Such changes include a drastic decrease of RyR1 protein content, depletion of muscle specific miR-1 and 1-133, as well as depletion of miR-22 and -124 that spe - cifically bund to the 3'UTR of the human RYR1, hyper-methylation of RYR1 CpG is - land and increased content of HDAC-4 and HDAC-5. In order to gain insight into the mechanisms causing the epigenetic modifications and validate whether they represent valid pharmaceutical targets we have generat - ed two mouse models harboring RYR mutations, using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene ed - iting technology. The mutations we chose were originally identified in a severely af - fected patient with Multiminicore disease who harbored a premature stop codon in exon 36 (RyRGln1970X) and a missense mutation in exon 91 (RyRAla4329Asp).

Report 2014-2016Connection to Clinical Practice Anesthesiology - a physiology lab? Once feared as the most dangerous part of sur - gery, modern anesthesia has become very safe with an anesthesia-related mortality of below 1 in 200'000. Monitoring under general anesthesia in - cludes heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, resistance, oxygen consumption, CO2 production, minute ventilation, acid base status, neuromuscu - lar function, urine output and much more. Today anesthesia has an impressive safety record. Nev - ertheless some diseases such as malignant hy - perthermia (MH) are still life threatening. MH is a classical pharmacogenetic disease, triggered by anesthetic agents and characterized by a hyper - metabolic state. Research has identified causative mutations in RYR1 in many susceptible individu - als. However the genetic identity of some suscep - tible individuals is still unknown and needs to be determined in order to induce safe anesthesia. In addition neuromuscular blocking agents and vol - atile anesthetics can trigger severe skeletal mus - cle damage (myolysis, rhabdomyolysis) and hyper - kalemia in patients with neuromuscular diseases. Many open questions on muscle physiology and calcium homeostasis are still to be understood in order identify patients at risk. Research on skel - etal muscle, excitation-contraction coupling and calcium homeostasis has the potential to further increase perioperative patient safety.

Of importance, similar epigenetic modifications may occur in the muscles of patients affected by other congenital myopathies (nemaline, myotubu - lar and SEPN1-related myopathies). Thus discovering a common pharmacologi - cal target downstream the primary genetic defect could potentially benefit a large number of patients. Other important areas of research focus on the role of calcium influx in skeletal muscle excitation contraction coupling as well as characterizing the role of SRP- 35, a 35 kDa retinol dehydrogenase present in skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic re - ticulum. For the latter experiments we have created a transgenic mouse model over-expressing SRP35 in skeletal muscle. Such mice show increased exercise performance and increased glucose metabolism. We think that this model will of - fer important insight into the identification of molecular components coupling mus - cle activity to metabolism and may help identify potential molecular targets for the treatment of age-associated dismetabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes.

Report 2014-2016 Rolf Zeller Department of Biomedicine Anatomy University of Basel Jakob Passweg Division of Hematology University Hospital BaselStem cell research and regenerative medicine are major pillars within the Depart - ment of Biomedicine (DBM) and the life science strategy of the University of Ba - sel. The last decade has seen substantial progress in identifying and isolating stem cells from different adult tissues and embryonic origin, which can be induced to differentiate into various specific cell-types relevant to regenerative medicine. The groups of this focal area are active in various aspects of this fascinating field with relevance to basic, mechanistic and clinically applied, translational research. The basic research efforts aim to identify and isolate stem cells and understand how stem cells are maintained in their normal niches within the embryo and/or the body. As such, several groups are studying how stem cells of the blood are maintained in the bone marrow, differentiate into the various different cell-types of the hematopoietic system, and how their differentiation potential is altered in malignant states that are caused by aberrant stem cell-based cancers (e.g. leu - kemia or lymphomas). The close interactions of clinical with basic researchers al - low bridging the gap between fundamental and translational research. For exam - ple, attempts to grow and differentiate mesenchymal stem cells from human and mouse bone marrow in vitro into different cell- and tissue-types, aim at develop - ing cartilage and bone replacement therapies that can be translated to the clinic. The knowledge gained from these studies forms the basis for designing and devel - oping clinically applicable tissue engineering strategies and in moving toward re - generative medicine. One of the major aims of regenerative medicine is to reactivate and support the re - generative potential of the body in a controlled manner. To this aim, understanding the normal regulation of organogenesis and tissue homeostasis is crucial. While first attempts have given encouraging results, it is important to gain a much better knowledge of how stem cells interact with their niche to maintain their multi-poten - cy and give rise to daughter cells that undergo transient amplification upon leav - ing the niche. These populations of transient amplifying cells will then initiate their specification and differentiation in a controlled manner. Our challenge is to estab - lish culture conditions where stem cells can be maintained and their specification and differentiation into functional tissues can be induced in an efficient and pre - cisely controlled manner. Any functional organ and tissue will consist of well-or - ganized and functionally interacting cells with different identities. Therefore, it is important to e. g. understand the role of embryonic signaling centers in tissue pat - terning/organization and cell-type specification/differentiation. The knowledge gained from analyzing cell-type, tissue specification and organo - genesis during normal embryonic development is highly relevant to directed engi - neering of tissues from progenitor and/or stem cells. So-called induced pluripo - tent stem (iPS) cells - adult cells (e. g. skin cells) reprogrammed into stem-like cells - are increasingly used as they can be relatively easily obtained from patients for cell differentiation and tissue engineering studies. The generation and analysis of iPS cells fits the strategy of the DBM to promote collaborative efforts between ba - sic research groups and clinicians with the aim to significantly reduce the gap be - tween bench and bedside. In addition to interactions within the DBM, there are nu - merous collaborations with groups at the Biozentrum, FMI and the D-BSSE, which Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine69 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016are funded by network grants such as Sinergia and SystemsX.ch. Many of our groups are actively participating in the Basel Stem Cell Network, which is one of the Competence Centers within the Life Sciences at the University of Basel. There, stem cell researchers have the opportunity to closely interact and collaborate with developmental biologists, geneticists and even mathematicians with the objective to foster interdisciplinary and innovative research. Last but not least, with Verdon Taylor and Claudia Lengerke, we recently appoint - ed two stem cell experts in the fields of brain development and hematopoietic stem cell signaling.

Our research focuses on the basic principles governing vas - cular growth and their translation into rational approaches to: 1) treat ischemic dis - eases and 2) improve the vascularization of tissue-engineered grafts. We use pre - cursor cells genetically modified to express controlled levels and combinations of factors, combining the specific advantages of cell and gene therapy. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the master regulator of vascular growth. However, uncontrolled expression causes vascular tumors (angiomas). By the close interaction of basic scientists and clinical surgeons, we are develop - ing novel methods to deliver the VEGF gene alone or in combination with modulat - ing factors to increase its safety and efficacy in vivo , using transduced progenitors, gene therapy vectors and controlled release of recombinant proteins by smart bio - materials. Research is funded by Swiss agencies (SNF and Swiss Heart Founda - tion) and the European Union (FP7 and H2020). 1) Controlled VEGF delivery for therapeutic vascularization We previously found that the transition between normal and aberrant angiogen - esis depends on the VEGF amount in the microenvironment around each pro - ducing cell rather than on the total dose, since VEGF remains tightly localized in the extracellular matrix (Ozawa & Banfi 2004). In order to translate this biologi - cal concept into a clinically applicable approach, we developed a high-through - put FACS-based technology to rapidly purify transduced progenitors expressing specific VEGF levels (Misteli 2010). Controlled VEGF expression by FACS-purified progenitor populations could induce effective vascularization both inside and out - side of thick, engineered cardiac patches (Marsano 2013; Boccardo & Gaudiello (Melly 2012 and manu - and increased in vivo vascularization of osteogenic grafts (Helm - rich 2013; Largo & Di Maggio, manuscript submitted). To avoid the need for genetic modification and improve clinical applicability, in col - laboration with Jeffrey Hubbell (EPFL, Lausanne) we developed a state-of-the-art biomaterial platform based on fibrin hydrogels that enables independent control of the dose and duration of release of matrix-bound growth factors, by which we could identify a 500-fold range of VEGF concentrations inducing only physiologi - cal capillary networks, which were long-term stable and therapeutically effective in ischemic wounds (Sacchi 2014). 2) Cellular and molecular mechanisms of VEGF dose-dependent angio- genesis Our understanding of angiogenic mechanisms is mostly based on developmen - tal models, in which new vessels sprout to vascularize tissues. However, we found that VEGF delivery to skeletal muscle, at the doses needed for functional bene - fit, induces angiogenesis without sprouting, but by circumferential enlargement of vessels, followed by longitudinal splitting (\"intussusception\", Gianni-Barrera 2013; Fig. 1). The molecular basis for the induction of sprouting or intussusception by VEGF is provided by opposite patterns of activation of Notch1 signaling (Gianni- Barrera, manuscript submitted). We also found that the transition between normal and aberrant angiogenesis is not an intrinsic property of VEGF dose, but depends on the balance between VEGF-induced endothelial stimulation and vascular mat - uration mediated by pericyte recruitment by PDGF-BB (Banfi 2012). On the other hand, new vessels regress if VEGF delivery is shorter than about 4 weeks: we identified Semaphorin3A as a molecular target to accelerate the sta -Therapeutic angiogenesis from vascular biology to regenerative medicine71 Department of Biomedicine .

Not only is one baby out of 1000 born with hearing loss, but also more than 50% of people older than 65 years suffer from hearing loss. Hearing loss of adult onset is one of the ten leading causes of disability-adjusted life years globally. It is estimated that 278 million persons worldwide suffer from disabling hearing loss (two-thirds of whom reside in developing countries). The impact of hearing loss on health care costs will very likely increase in the future considering the envisaged improvement in life expectancy. The degeneration of inner ear sensory cells located in the cochlea, known as hair cells underlies most forms of sensorineural hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss is difficult to treat, since it creates both loss of sensitivity and distortion. While hearing aids can increase sensitivity, they often do not overcome the distortion of sound caused by loss of hair cells. Therefore, in order to pave the road for new pro - phylactic and therapeutic approaches for sensorineural hearing loss, it is of the es - sence to thoroughly investigate molecular events involved in hair cell damage and death. Once we understand these molecular events we might try to block apopto - sis signalling pathways while enhancing cell survival pathways, finally this will re - sult in enhanced hair cell survival. During the last couple of years, our research has been centered on the molecu - lar mechanisms involved in hair cell damage and death. It has been demonstrat - ed that signaling pathways exist that promote hair cell death and interestingly, it has also been shown that there are opposing pathways that promote hair cell sur - vival. Different molecules have been found who influence these pathways, among them inhibitors who inhibit the JNK signaling pathway, apoptosis inhibitors, eryth - ropoietin, somatostatin and octreotide which bind to the somatostatin receptor, and others. Also the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) /Akt pathway has been studied in detail and its role in hair cell death and survival has been studied. Late - ly, we have founded a spin off company (Strekin AG, Basel) to explore pioglitazone and its effect on auditory hair cells. Currently, Strekin is running a clinical phase 2 study to investigate whether pioglitazone can protect residual hearing during co - chlea implant surgery.

Report 2014-2016Heart failure is a syndrome in which the heart is unable to adequately perfuse the body's organs with blood. It adversely affects the wellbeing of patients as it may cause muscle weakness and atrophy, dyspnoe, as well as organ damage and dys - function. To be able to function as a pump that provides oxygen and nutrients to our whole body, the heart itself consumes large amounts of energy. A tight reg - ulation of the use of all available resources, including cellular proteins, becomes particularly critical in disease states where metabolism must increase to maintain cardiac performance. In fact, a fundamental mechanism that underlies heart fail - ure is the failure to metabolically adapt. Our laboratory investigates cellular mech - anisms and signaling pathways that regulate cardiac protein turnover and ener - gy metabolism. Functions of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in the heart We analyzed the function of the intracellular metabolic regulator mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which has distinct functions depending on whether it is part of mTOR complex (mTORC)1 or mTORC2. Using tissue-specific inducible knock - out approaches, we have been able to show that mTORC1 is required for basal car - diac function and that it becomes even more important in physiological or path - ological cardiac stress induced by voluntary wheel running or aortic constriction. In mTORC1-deficient mice, pathological pressure overload caused dilated cardio - myopathy without a prior phase of adaptive hypertrophy due to a lack of adaptive cardiomyocyte growth via blunted protein synthesis capacity, and associated with reduced mitochondrial content, a shift in metabolic substrate use and increased apoptosis and autophagy. In contrast, rictor-deficient hearts (rictor is a specific component of mTORC2) are normal during growth or adulthood under basal condi - tions. We found that pressure overload significantly increases rictor protein along with PKC II and PKC phosphorylation in control mice, but not in cardiac rictor knockout mice. Pressure-overload causes hypertrophy with maintained function in controls, but leads to systolic dysfunction of rictor-deficient hearts without hav - ing any effects on cardiac weight, hypertrophy markers or fibrosis. These data sug - gest that mTORC2 regulates metabolism and contractility of the heart via PKCII and PKC (Fig. 1, of neuregulin1 Neuregulin1 (Nrg1 ) has beneficial effects in a range of cardiac disease mod - els and ongoing clinical trials are investigating its therapeutic value in heart failure. The mechanisms that underlie the cardio-protective actions of Nrg1 are poorly understood. We investigated whether Nrg1 modulates cardiomyocyte metabo - lism and whether mTOR is in its cardio-protective effects. We found that Nrg1 stimulates glucose uptake in cardiac myocytes via ErbB2/ErbB4 heterodi - mers and by activating PI3K , Akt and AS160 in a similar manner as insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (Fig. 2, Pentassuglia, 2016). In our ongoing studies, we are assessing to what extent IRS-1 is implicated and whether the identified mech - anism can be exploited under pathological conditions in vivo . Obesity and diastolic dysfunction Approximately 50% of heart failure patients have a preserved ejection fraction, which means that the fraction of total blood present after completion of the fill - ing phase that is pumped out of the heart into the circulation is maintained. HFpEF has been associated with impaired filling of the heart during diastole.

Report 2014-2016We combine human stem cell technology to unravel the original of signaling path - ways in reproductive disease and in early embryonic development. As a putative mediator of inhibin signaling in the ovary we originally identified an E3 ubiquitin li - gase for inhibin B receptor, EULIR, which is now renamed as HECTD1. In order to study its function, we generated a new mutant mouse model using the gene trap strategy. Homozygous mutant mice resulted in a early embryonic lethality, display - ing severe growth retardation, abnormal placental development and defective of neural tube closure (e. g. spina bifida). Hectd1 expression is detected in specific cell populations of multiple tissues (Fig. 1), is regulated by insulin and by heat and hypoxia. E3 ligase activity of Hectd1 regulates the protein level of Iqgap1 through ubiquitination and mediates the dynamics of focal complexes including the recruit - ment of paxillin and actinin. Loss of Hectd1 resulted in accelerated cell spreading but impaired directionality of migration and reduced -catenin localization at ad - herens junctions, suggesting a molecular mechanism in which Hectd1 regulated the cell-cell contact and cell movements during neural tube development. In ad - dition, we found that Hectd1 is a novel centrosome protein (Fig. 2) and it regulates centrosome duplication and disjunction. Hectd1 interacts with numbers of pro teins in Y2H and MS assays, suggesting the eminant role of this gene in many ba - sic cellular actions. Within the frame of the Swiss Center of Applied Human Toxicology (SCAHT) we established a novel in vitro assay based on differentiating human embryonic stem cells (hESC) for testing early neurodevelopmental toxicity, focusing to stages cor - responding to the formation of the neural tube and the generation and proliferation of the neural precursors. This model was setup as a proof of principle aiming at demonstrating that hESC can be used for developmental toxicity testing. We have confirmed the validity and reliability of our assay by analyzing the effect of three neuroteratogens: valproic acid (VPA), cyclopamine (CPA) and nicotine and two control compounds, the hepatotoxic but non-embryotoxic compound theophylline and the neutral compound saccharin, on four independent hESC lines. We have shown that our assay allows the specific identification of neurodevelopmental toxi - cants, can identify a developmentally toxic effect independently of effect on cell vi - ability, allows an estimation of the toxic dose coherent with in vivo data, can distin - guish effects of toxicants with different mode of action and different outputs in vivo , but does not allow to recognize, and therefore to predict, a particular in vivo defect. To determine the correct readout(s), we questioned the capacity of our system to recognize/predict a neural tube defect (NTD). We found that immunocytochemis - try analysis cannot be used to reveal differential effects of VPA vs non NTD-induc - ing toxicants. However, we have selected a number of other markers, specifical - ly and transiently expressed in rosette cells, whose expression can be quantified by RT-PCR. Dose/response experiments have been performed and analyses are ongoing to identify those with the optimal differential expression among the toxi - cants evaluated.Ovarian and reproductive disease modelling using stem cell technology Group Members Dr. Anne-Catherine Feutz (Postdoc) Dr. Sofia Forte (Postdoc) Xinggang Wang (MD-PhD Student) Dr. Hong Zhang (Research Associate) * left during report period Christian De Geyter Department of Biomedicine Division of Gynecological Endocrinology and Repro - ductive Ubiquitination77 Biomedicine .

Noninvasive imaging plays an increasing role in diagnosis, risk stratification and assessment of treatment responses. Advances in image technol - ogy over the last years have allowed for depiction of the heart and blood vessels with ever increasing detail. Novel imaging technologies termed molecular imaging use detection of site-targeted contrast agents to depict the molecular footprint of a disease-relevant phenotype at the cellular level. It is thought that such techniques will in the future contribute to earlier detection of disease, to better risk stratifica - tion and to better assessment of treatment responses. Molecular imaging with ul - trasound contrast agents relies on the detection of microbubbles within diseased tissue. Microbubbles produce an acoustic signal owing to their resonant proper - ties in an ultrasound field. Microbubble targeting is accomplished by either ma - nipulating the microbubble shell for attachment of microbubbles to activated leu - kocytes, or by conjugation of specific ligands to the microbubble surface (Fig. 1). Ultrasound molecular imaging of myocarditis Dilated cardiomyopathy as a consequence of viral myocarditis is a frequent cause for heart failure in young adults. In young patients presenting to the emergency de - partment with either chest pain or signs of heart failure, myocarditis is a differen - tial diagnosis. However, the diagnosis of myocarditis is difficult, as clinical signs, the electrocardiogram and biomarkers (troponins) lack sensitivity/specificity. Thus, there is a need for a rapid, non-invasive imaging tool for the detection of inflamma - tory events occurring in myocarditis. Using microbubbles targeted to leukocytes, to CD4+ lymphocytes and to the endothelial cell adhesion molecule P-selectin we were able to diagnose myocardial inflammation in a murine model of myocarditis even in the absence of effects on myocardial function. The specific detection of the recruitment of CD4+ lymphocytes which are important in driving autoimmune pro - cesses that lead to cardiac damage in myocarditis was possible using non-inva - sive ultrasound molecular imaging. Also, the signals obtained from microbubbles targeted to CD4+ lymphocytes correlated to CD4+ lymphocytes present in tissue as assessed on immunhistology.

This approach places a large proportion of individuals in an intermediate risk catego - ry. Therefore, tools to better assess the risk in these patients are needed. It is gen - erally thought that noninvasive imaging of molecular events associated with ath - erosclerotic disease may serve this purpose. Previous studies have shown that contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEU) molecular imaging using microbubble con - trast agents directed against vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), which is involved in inflammatory processes in atherosclerosis, is feasible in murine dis - ease models. However, the ultrasound contrast agents used in these studies are not suitable for clinical translation, and there is a need for the development of mi - crobubbles employing (a) clinically translatable strategies for conjugation of tar - geting moieties, and (b) targeting ligands that can readily be used in the clinical field. Nanobodies are small antibody fragments derived from heavy-chain-only an - tibodies. They are attractive for applications in molecular imaging, as they are high - ly specific, non-immunogenic and thus offer the potential for clinical translation. Likewise, Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) are potential candidates for clinical molecular imaging given their easy production and selection, high af - finity and low immunogenicity. We are therefore currently developing and validat - ing clinically translatable binders coupled to the microbubble surface using ma - leimide covalent bonding.

Report 2014-2016Our lab is mainly engaged in the investigation of toxicological mechanisms of drugs and other chemical compounds on the liver, skeletal muscle and on the heart. During the last 3 years we published reports mostly in the fields of statin-as - sociated myo- and cardiac toxicity and of hepatotoxicity associated with different drugs such as dronedarone, benzbromarone and flucloxacillin. All of these drugs are idiosyncratic toxicants; adverse effects are rare and appear at therapeutic dos - es, and only in patients with susceptibility factors. Principle aims of our studies are to understand the mechanism of toxicity and, based on the mechanism, to pro - pose and investigate potential susceptibility factors. Regarding statins and myotoxicity, we have shown that statins inhibit the AKT/ mTOR pathway in C2C12 cells but also in vivo in mice. As a consequence, skele - tal muscle protein synthesis is impaired, muscle breakdown is upregulated by in - duction of atrogin-1 and apoptosis of myocytes is increased. The reasons for the inhibition of AKT phosphorylation are inhibition of signaling across the IGF-1 re - ceptor and inhibition of the activation of mTORC2. The IGF-1 receptor is N-glyco - sylated and N-glycosylation is impaired by statins. We have shown that in C2C12 cells, but have obtained similar findings in the heart and in skeletal muscle of mice treated with statins. In additional projects we could confirm that statins are mito - chondrial toxicants and that they are associated with mitochondrial ROS produc - tion in cultured cells, mice and also in skeletal muscle of humans. Future studies will focus on answering the question why statins inhibit activation of mTORC2 and on the molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance associated with statins. Since insulin uses the same intracellular signaling pathway like IGF-1, it can be assumed that similar mechanisms are responsible for statin-associated insulin resistance. Furthermore, we are going to study the effect of impaired mitochondrial prolifera - tion (using PGC1- and PGC1- knock-out a risk factor for statin-asso - ciated myopathy. Finally, we plan to investigate the mechanisms of statin-associ - ated liver injury. A second field of interest is the mechanism of hepatotoxicity associated with spe - cific drugs. For that, we have studied the effects of benzbromarone and drone - darone on isolated liver mitochondria, on human liver cell lines and primary hepatocytes and in mice in vivo . Benzbromarone and dronedarone are mitochon - drial toxicants which inhibit the function of the electron transport chain and of -oxidation. In vivo , dronedarone was more toxic in mice with a defect in mito - chondrial -oxidation than in the corresponding wild type animals. This suggests that impaired mitochondrial -oxidation may be a susceptibility factor for droneda - rone-associated liver injury. Interestingly, dronedarone and benzbromarone break up the mitochondrial network, leading to fragmentation of the mitochondria (mi - tochondrial fission, see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). They are also associated with increased mitochondrial production of ROS. Future studies will focus on the consequences of ROS production on the antioxidative defense system (Nrf2 activation and down - stream reactions) and on the consequences of mitochondrial fission (increased mi - tophagy). Defects in activating the antioxidative defense system and/or in mitoph - agy could represent susceptibility factors for toxicity. This possibility will be tested in engineered cells and in mice. We will expand our research also on tyrosine ki - nase inhibitors, which are known mitochondrial toxicants. Our studies show that, in contrast to what is written in many textbooks, it is possi - ble to find mechanisms for idiosyncratic toxicity. This allows identifying suscepti - bility factors with the final aim to prevent this type of toxicity in patients.Idiosyncratic toxicity of drugs Group Members Fabio Bachmann (PhD Student) Dr. Jamal Bouitbir (Postdoc) Paech Miljenko Panajatovic graduate Student Deborah Rudin (PhD Student) Gerda Sanvee (PhD Student) Beatrice Vetter (Technician) Zhou Xun (PhD Student) * left during report period Stephan Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl Department of Biomedicine Division of Clinical Pharma - cology and Toxicology University benzbroma - rone (BB) or with DMSO 0.1 % (control) and stained with an antibody against TOMM22.

They have therefore become impor - tant for treating different types of cancer. During the development and clinical application of TKIs it was recognized that most of them carry the risk for organ toxicity, e.g. for liver, skeletal muscle and/or cardiac toxicity. Several recent reports have shown that the mechanism may be related to effects on mitochondrial function by these drugs. Since se - rum concentration and tissue distribution of these agents has been characterized, it would be possi - ble to predict organ toxicity, if precise data about cellular toxicity were available. We plan to fill this gap and will therefore study organ toxicity of some of these drugs using established cell models and in mice in vivo . After having obtained these data, we will build a model which predicts organ con - centrations and organ toxicity for individual TKIs in relation to dose and plasma concentrations in hu - mans. Based on such data, we will be able to mon - itor patients treated with such drugs with the aim to individualize and optimize the dosing. 82 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016Heart failure ensues as the final common pathway of cardiac diseases, most fre - quently as a sequel of myocardial infarction. Despite improvements in patient out - come with state-of-the-art therapy, which includes neurohormonal modulation and devices, it still represents a leading cause of death and hospitalization. The recent recognition of intrinsic regenerative capacities in the adult heart that are thought to participate in organ homeostasis, but to be insufficient to compensate for cell loss after injury, provides now a basis for novel therapeutic strategies that aim at the strengthening of endogenous regeneration pathways and the use of car - diac progenitor cells (CPCs). A major interest of our laboratory is to decipher sig - naling and gene regulatory networks that are involved in tissue homeostasis and cell replacement in the heart, and to elucidate how they regulate the delicate bal - ance between the proliferation of immature precursor and progenitor cells and their differentiation and maturation. The microenvironment is an important regulator of cell fate and provides cues from the extracellular matrix (ECM) as well as soluble factors. We are particularly in - terested in how information from the ECM is transduced into a cell fate-regulato - ry response. We recently found that the differential regulation of YAP and of the cell cycle regulator Plk2 in response to ECM proteins either maintains prolifera - tion of CPCs, thus contributing to their amplification, or directs them towards lin - eage commitment and differentiation, whereby Plk2 appears to act as an inverse link between cell cycle and fate decision. YAP and Plk2 are part of a developmen - tally regulated pathway, which is gradually shut down in the postnatal heart, thus allowing for terminal differentiation and maturation of cardiac cells. Such master regulators of cardiac cell fate could be therapeutically targeted to promote regen - eration of the injured heart. In a related line of studies with focus on the role of stem cell-regulatory factors in the heart, we recently uncovered an unexpected function of the hematopoietic cytokine Flt3 ligand and its receptor Flt3 as gatekeepers of CPC quiescence. We have previously shown that Flt3 is upregulated in the ischemically injured heart and that its pharmacological activation confers cytoprotection, hence improving re - modeling and function after myocardial infarction. Flt3 is part of the cancer kinome and cardiomyopathies have been observed in patients under Flt3-targeting recep - tor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Using functional analyses and relating them to whole transcriptome profiling, we are also studying how targeted cancer therapeutics, specifically TKIs, affect cardiac function. Results from these studies will not only provide a mechanistic rationale for cancer drug-related cardiotoxicity, but also help identify key effectors of cardiac growth and regeneration pathways.Growth control and regeneration pathways in the heart Group Members Giacomo Della Verde Dr. Michika Mochizuki (Postdoc) Dr. Lifen (Research Associate) * left during report periodGabriela Kuster Pfister Department of Biomedicine Division of Cardiology University Basel Myocardial ResearchHeart Failure .

Report 2014-2016Various tumors have been shown to contain subpopulations of so-called cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are thought to be responsible for disease initiation, main - tenance, metastasis and relapse after conventional anti-tumor therapies. We hy - pothesize that pathways that regulate stem cells during development can reacti - vate expression during oncogenesis and specifically in CSCs. For example, we show that enhanced expression of the pluripotency-related embryonic protein SOX2 associates with stemness, disease aggressiveness and therapy resistance in putative ovarian and breast CSCs. In breast carcinoma, SOX2 protein expres - sion strongly relies on pAKT activity, suggesting AKT-inhibitors as promising drugs for targeting SOX2-expressing CSCs. In our developmental studies, we previously identified the BMP-WNT-CDX-HOX signaling pathway as an essential regulator of embryonic hematopoiesis. Later on, involvement of CDX genes was demonstrated in human leukemia. Gene expres - sion arrays performed on CDX2-modified leukemic cells confirmed HOX genes as targets but also revealed the transcription factor EVI1 (Ecotropic viral integration site 1) as a putative downstream molecule. EVI1 has been mostly studied in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where high expression predicts adverse clinical outcome. We showed that EVI1 also expresses in lymphoblastic leukemia cells where it reg - ulates apoptosis sensitivity, and furthermore plays important roles as an oncogene in breast as well as in prostate carcinoma, where it regulates cell growth and mi - gration independently of estrogen and HER2 signaling, and respectively appears to control disease progression and therapy resistance at the stem cell level. Using zebrafish to study hematopoiesis and tumor biology EVI1 also plays important roles during development, amongst other regulating na - scent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Using in vivo live imaging studies on trans - genic zebrafish embryos, we could show that evi1 suppression impairs HSC emer - gence by altering cells of the ventral dorsal aorta (VDA; the fish equivalent of the mammalian aorta-gonado-mesonephros region) and thereby impairing their transition to hematopoietic fate (Konantz et al., 2016). Ze - brafish are also used to xenograft human tumor cells and monitor tumor-induced angiogenesis, invasiveness, and response to a range of treatments in vivo and in real time. Moreover, our laboratory aims to generate transgenic zebrafish leukemia models by influencing EVI1, RAS and p53 expression in specific cell types of the hematopoietic compartment; these models are currently being characterized in detail on the functional and molecular levels and in the near future shall be used for drug screens. Finally, in a project sponsored by the Roche Postdoctoral Program (RPF), we recently showed that double transgenic gata1/globin zebrafish can be used to model erythroid lineage toxicity and regeneration; a small molecule screen is planned to further validate the model for a screening setting and to potentially identify new compounds that interfere with erythroid regeneration and maturation. Characterization of murine AML xenotransplantation models Repopulation of immunodeficient mice remains the primary method to functionally assess human AML. We recently developed in our laboratory an experimental ap - proach that enables engraftment of ~95% of AML (instead of 40-60% as report - ed by previous studies), especially also successful with disease subtypes so far considered non-engraftable. We show that this model faithfully mimics human dis - ease, since xenogeneic human AML cells derived from engrafted mice retain im - mune phenotypic and genetic characteristics of corresponding pre-transplant pa - tient samples. Importantly, molecular risk subgroups established in patients were shown to predict time to engraftment/leukemia also in mice (Fig. C-E). We current - ly use this model to understand processes governing leukemia initiation.

Report 2014-2016A fascinating challenge in biology is to unravel the mechanisms underlying the evo - lutionary diversification of animal form. The vertebrate limb skeleton is a particu - larly useful model system to do so, as its anatomy has been drastically altered in evolution through adaptive changes to different modes of life and locomotion. The diversification of anatomies seen in tetrapods derives from the modification of a common ancestral limb skeletal bauplan that had five digits. So far, expression studies suggest that the same set of developmental networks is involved in the morphogenesis of the limb in all tetrapods. So ... how did all these morphologies arise in evolution? The current view in evolutionary developmental biology (evo- devo) is that form evolves through changes in the level or spatial-temporal pattern of expression of pleiotropic developmental genes. In a nutshell, this means that the mutations that drive the divergence of morphologies mostly affect the regulatory regions in the genome that control the transcription of highly conserved develop - mental genes, rather than the coding sequences themselves. Artiodactyls constitute a paradigmatic case of limb specialization, as they dis - play skeletal adaptations for running on uneven terrain, such as elongated limbs and digit reductions/loss. In particular, bovine limbs have only two toes of equal length, allowing them to walk on the distal-most phalanges. We have established that AP polarity is progressively lost in the handplate mesenchyme during bo - vine limb bud development. This leads to distal restriction of the digit-forming do - main and the preferential elongation of the two symmetric digits that will form the hoofed toes. We have identified that failure to sense graded SHH signaling under - lies the loss of handplate asymmetry in bovine embryos. In particular, the expres - sion of the SHH receptor PTCH1 is not upregulated in the bovine limb bud mes - enchyme. Using functional genomic approaches, we identified a SHH-responsive limb enhancer of Ptch1 that we termed LRM and that has functionally degenerat - ed in the bovine lineage. This study provides a molecular and mechanistic expla - nation for evolutionary digit loss in artiodactyls and illustrates how changes in de - velopmental gene regulatory networks contribute to the appearance of anatomical novelties in evolution (Fig. 1) As a continuation of these studies, we are currently using the CRISPR/Cas9 tech - nology to modify the mouse genome and sequentially delete the different con - served regions within the Ptch1 LRM enhancer. These studies, in parallel with a systematic analysis of the entire Ptch1 cis-regulatory landscape using transgen - ic reporter embryos will allow us to understand how SHH signaling is integrated at the transcriptional level in a tissue-specific manner. In addition, we are also studying limb development in another artiodactyl, the pig. In these studies, we are using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq in pig and mouse limb buds to identify diverging regulatory strategies affecting key developmental genes. This approach is allowing us to gain mechanistic knowledge into the gene regulatory networks operating in limb development and uncovering how they may have been rewired during the evolution of vertebrate limb morphology. Most importantly, by studying how form is genetically encoded, our goal is to gain fundamental insight into the human mutations leading to congenital malformations of the limb. As it is estimated that a vast proportion of disease-causing mutations map to the regula - tory genome, we are sequencing, in collaboration with clinical geneticists, some of these candidate cis-regulatory regions in patients with congenital limb defects.Functional Genomics of Limb Development: Mechanisms of Morphological Evolution and the Link to Human (PhD Student) * left during report period Javier Lopez-Rios Department of Biomedicine Anatomy University of BaselDevelopment and EvolutionLimb Development .

Report 2014-2016Research Summary: The ultimate goal of the research group is to investigate an - giogenic therapies based on engineered tissues (patches) to induce safe and ef - ficacious angiogenesis in a chronic ischemic myocardium. For this purpose two different strategies are currently investigated relying on the use of either (1) VEGF- expressing cells or (2) heterogeneous cell population with a high angiogenic po - tential. The group also aims to (3) develop in vitro functional cardiac models to in - vestigate processes of myocardial repair/regeneration. Research is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation and Swiss Heart Foundation. Patches engineered by VEGF-expressing cells. Therapeutic angiogenesis in - duced by exogenous VEGF delivery is a promising strategy. However, VEGF re - lease at the microenvironmental level needs to be controlled to induce only normal capillary network, avoiding growth of aberrancies. A FACS-based technique express a safe VEGF dose from a heterogeneous primary population (Helmrich U, 2011) (collaboration with A. Banfi). Direct intra- myocardial injections of ASC expressing safe VEGF-levels induced controlled an - giogenesis in the heart, beside the poor cell survival observed (Melly and Marsa - no, 2012). Thereafter, skeletal myoblasts expressing safe VEGF levels co-cultured with cardiomyocytes in 3D scaffolds were shown to induce an efficacious angio - genesis in engineered cardiac tissues and superior cell survival upon implantation into an ischemic myocardium (Marsano, 2013). We then hypothesized that patch - es generated by controlled VEGF-expressing ASC could induce normal and ef - ficient angiogenesis not only in the patch itself but also in the surrounding area, working as a controlled delivery system. We found that VEGF release induced nor - mal angiogenesis in the patch already after 7 days, and in the surrounding avas - cular area (simulated by an empty 7mm-thick cell-free collagen sponge) after 28 days upon implantation in a subcutaneous rat model (Fig. 1). Patch prompt vascu - larization resulted in an increased survival of implanted cells up to 28 days (Boc - cardo and Gaudiello, 2016). Patches engineered by cells with a high angiogenic potential. In this ap - proach, we used human adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells as a heterogeneous cell population with a high angiogenic potential thanks to the presence of numerous endothelial/mural progenitors (collaboration with A. Scherberich). We hypothesized that perfusion-based bioreactor culture supported the maintenance of endothelial/mural cells as compared to static culture, thereby accelerating the whole construct vascularization and supporting the cell survival upon implantation in a subcutaneous rat model. Our findings showed that perfu - sion-based culture significantly modulated the initial SVF cell population composi - tion, leading to a significant enrichment of the pericytes compared to static condi - tion. The enriched perfusion-based engineered constructs showed an accelerated in vivo vessel ingrowth at 3 days and promoted the formation of blood vessels by cells of human origin. 3D functional cardiac models. Our angiogenic engineered tissues might also affect cardiac repair/regeneration by influencing cardiomyocyte maturation and functionality and progenitor cell recruitment. Therefore, we aimed here to generate 3D functional cardiac models as tool to investigate interactions of VEGF-express - ing ASC/SVF cells and cardiomyocytes. We hypothesized that the recapitulation of the proper physiological conditions, mimicking the native tissue environment, enhanced the cardiomyocyte maturation, 3D organization and functionality.

The strategy here pursued is based on the tissue engineering paradigm which provides con - trol over the targeted area -reducing not desired systemic effects- and superior implanted cell sur - vival compared to cell intramyocardial injection de - livery. The current research program of the group includes the engineering of 3D patches with high angiogenic potential made by human adipose tis - sue-derived stromal vascular fraction cells, known to (1) contain subpopulations of both mesenchy - mal and endothelial progenitor cells and (2) release a broad range of pro-cell-survival factors. Specif - ic induction of microvascular networks and release of cardioprotective factors in the hypo-perfused myocardial areas might be crucial to preserve car - diomyocyte survival and rescue their contraction capability in order to improve the overall cardiac function.

These systems are used as models to investigate fundamental aspects of tissue development, and as grafts to induce tissue regeneration. Several collaborations have been established within the DBM to employ the developed tools for 3D culture of tumor cells (Prof. G. Spagnoli, Prof. G. Iezzi), endothelial cells (PD Dr. A. Banfi), thymic epithelial cells (Prof. G. Holl\u00e4nder), glial cells (Prof. R. Guzman), pluripotent stem cells (Prof. C. De Geyter) and cardiac cells (PD Dr. A. Marsano). However, the main focus has been maintained around the development of cartilage and bone/bone marrow tissues. Following is a short summary of recent achievements in these research areas. Nasal chondrocytes and environmental plasticity (PD Dr. A. Barbero) We found that chondrocytes from the nasal septum, as compared to articular chondrocytes typically used for cell-based cartilage repair, have superior and more reproducible chondrogenic capacity. This led to the first clinical trial dem - onstrating the suitability and safety of engineered nasal cartilage grafts for recon - structive purposes in the nose. We also found that nasal chondrocytes - of neural crest origin - display a distinct profile of HOX gene expression from articular chon - drocytes - of mesoderm origin. However, upon implantation in a joint, they can be reprogrammed by the recipient site and acquire the HOX \"signature\" typical of ar - ticular chondrocytes. These results have led to the treatment of 17 patients with traumatic cartilage injuries in the knee (Fig. 1). Positive clinical findings have been instrumental to receive EU funding for a multicenter phase II study. Bone, Bone marrow and Vascularized bone (PD Dr. A. Scherberich) The use of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSC) from bone marrow has been proposed to generate osteogenic grafts, but with limited efficiency and reproduc - ibility. We hypothesized that the robustness of the process could be increased by mimicking events of bone embryonic development. Intermediate templates of hy - pertrophic cartilage generated by MSC could robustly and autonomously remod - el into bone tissue. A similar outcome could also be achieved with engineered and decellularized tissues, where the cocktail of factors necessary to initiate the pro - cess is embedded in the deposited extracellular matrix. The bone organ developed by this approach is capable to host fully functional hematopoietic stem cells and is thus being investigated in collaboration with Prof. R. Skoda and Prof. C. Leng - erke as a humanized environment to study interaction of leukemic cells with a 3D stromal niche. MSC are also found within the Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue, mixed with endothelial lineage cells. After demonstrating that SVF cells can self-assemble into osteogenic and vasculogenic structures, we used them in an intraoperative clinical setting to enhance humerus fracture healing in el - derly patients (Fig. 2). Studies are ongoing to combine the strategy of engineered and decellularized matrices (see above) with intraoperative \"re-activation\" by SVF cells to enhance bone and vascular repair. Engineering platforms (Dr. D. Wendt) One main challenge in engineering 3D culture models or tissue grafts is to en - sure efficient nutrition and oxygen supply through thick constructs. This has been addressed by developing bioreactor systems to perfuse cell suspensions/culture medium directly through the developing structures. The devices are used in a va - riety of settings for lab discovery, and are being further developed for the stream - lined GMP manufacturing of cellular grafts for clinical use. More recently, we have also validated a microfluidic system allowing the formation of 3D cellular struc -From 3D culture models to regenerative surgery Ivan Martin Department of Biomedicine Department of Surgery University Hospital BaselTissue EngineeringCartilage Repair .

These include the fol - lowing directions. Facial cartilage reconstruction. Engineered nasal cartilage grafts, which have been previously suvc - cessfully used for reconstruction of the alar lobule of the nose, are currently being investigated for the reconstruction of the nasal cartilage septum after perforation (e.g., due to leishmaniosis) (PD M. Haug, Dr. I. Fulco). Articular cartilage and intervertebral disc repair. Following the demonstration of feasibility and safety of nasal chondrocyte-based engineered cartilage for the treatment of knee cartilage inju - ries, a phase II study enrolling 108 patients in 4 in - ternational centers has been financed by the Ho - rizon 2020 EU Program to investigate the role of tissue maturation on the clinical outcome (Dr. M.

They present as thrombocythemia with thrombocytosis, polycythemia vera (PV) with erythrocytosis, or myelofibro - sis (MF) with expansion of megakaryocytes and bone marrow fibrosis. They lead to bone marrow failure or may transform to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Hema - topoietic stem cell transplantation is the sole curative therapy, but is limited to a subset of patients. It is the goal of our studies to contribute to novel therapeutic approaches for MPN patients by targeting the molecular signaling driving these diseases. MPN are characterized by hyperactive signaling of the JAK2 kinase due to acquired mutations in the JAK2 signaling pathway. JAK2 is an intracellular non- receptor tyrosine kinase essential for hematopoiesis representing the exclusive mediator of signaling from the thrombopoietin receptor MPL, the erythropoietin and GM-CSF receptors. JAK2 activates several signaling pathways including STAT transcription factors, the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway and the mito - gen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which promote cell proliferation, dif - ferentiation and survival. In MPN, JAK2 signaling is constitutively activated by mu - tations in JAK2, MPL or the chaperone protein Calreticulin. The central role of JAK2 signaling in MPN has led to the development of JAK2 inhibitors which act as ATP mimetics and stabilize JAK2 in the active conformation (type I inhibition, e.g. rux - olitinib). However, type I JAK2 inhibitors have not met the expectations. They fail to reduce the mutant clone suggesting limited curative potential, and induce resis - tance. To improve therapeutic targeting of JAK2 signaling in MPN, we are pursu - ing several approaches: More effective targeting of JAK2 A new mode of JAK2 inhibition has recently been reported which stabilizes the in - active form of JAK2 (type II inhibition). We found high potency of type II JAK inhibi - tion in preclinical MPN models. We observed decreased mutant allele burden due to preferential inhibition of mutant JAK2 suggesting type II inhibition could lead to a class of agents with curative potential. Resistance to type I JAK inhibitors is also abrogated. We are continuing our studies on type II JAK2 inhibition, which appears to herald the development of mutant-selective inhibitors, as a basis for improved therapeutic options. Resistance mechanisms to JAK2 inhibitors Response to type I JAK inhibitors is often lost upon prolonged exposure. JAK2 resistance mutations occur in vitro , but have not been observed in patients. It has been shown that MPN cells functionally adapt and reactivate JAK2 signaling through formation of JAK2 heterodimers with other JAK family members such as JAK1 and TYK2. We found that this escape mechanism extends to type I JAK2 in - hibitors in clinical development, and observed cross-resistance. These molecu - lar studies of resistance mechanisms to JAK inhibitors may reveal new therapeu - tic targets, while studies on patient samples will provide insight into clinical JAK2 inhibitor resistance. JAK2 signaling network JAK2 induces activation of STAT-, PI3K- and MAPK signaling. Therapeutic target - ing of these pathways in other malignancies was impeded by feedback or cross - talk signaling revealing intricate signaling networks. We could show that combined inhibition of several targets such as JAK2 and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL can provide superi - or benefit in JAK2-driven leukemias.

Skoda who has established a long-term MPN patient cohort at University Hos - pital Basel, and Prof. J. Passweg, Head of the Di - vision of Hematology at University Hospital Basel. We are studying clinical isolates of MPN patients with different mutational setup or at different stag - es of the disease for characteristics of oncogenic signaling and functional capacity of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. We are interested in the sig - naling dynamics in response to different therapies and upon development of resistance to conven - tional JAK2 inhibitors such as ruxolitinib. Collabor - ative studies with Prof. R. Levine based on the MPN cohort at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center New York, support these efforts. We aim to corre - late the molecular findings with clinical character - istics of response or resistance to therapy in these MPN patients. These translational studies will fa - cilitate potential clinical studies on improved tar - geting of JAK2 signaling in MPN in the longer term.Fig. 1: Overview of JAK2 signaling. The JAK2 tyrosine kinase with Upon activates several signaling including the STAT3 and STAT5 transcription factors, the PI3K/Akt path - way and the MAPK signaling pathway which includes RAS and the kinases RAF, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. In MPN, JAK2 is constitutively activated by somatic mutations leading to excessive myeloid proliferation. The molecular interconnections between JAK2 and the downstream sig - naling pathways is not fully clarified. (Adapted from Meyer S. C. & Levine R. L., Clin.

The comparison of cartilaginous radii between humeral head and glenoid in different planes pro - vides new information to understand the degree of conformity during abduction of the upper limb. To investigate the radii, CT-images of shoulder specimen were analysed using an image visualization software and statiscically analysed. Mea - surements of the radii in the glenoid revealed a significantly larger radius for bone than cartilage, whereas for the humeral head the opposite was the case. Highest ratios for cartilage in the transverse plane were found in the inferior and central ar - eas of the joint surface, whereas the smallest ratios were found in the superior area (Fig.1). The radial mismatch varied between 0.1 mm and 13.6 mm, depending on the measured plane. The results suggest that in abduction, the cartilaginous guid - ance of the humeral head decreases which might permit the humeral head an an - terior-posterior shifting as well as superior-inferior translation.

Pairwise comparison between the pre- and post - operative mineralization at the articular surface showed a significant decrease of the high-density area ratio for the tibia and the talus.

Since the received joint-load is transmitted into the trabecular system, the spongy bone should also exhibits topographical differences. To evaluate the regional variations in trabecu - lar architecture, ten physiologic patellae were analysed for defined parameters of bony structure by means of micro-computed tomography (Fig.2). The obtained measurements are: Bone (SMI); and the Degree of anisotropy (DA). The evaluat - ed architectural parameter varied within the trabecular system and showed regular distribution patterns (Fig.3). It proved to be distinctive with maxima of material and stability situated below areas of the highest long-term load intake. With increas - ing depth, the pattern of distribution was persistent but lessened in intensity. The parameters significantly correlated with the density distribution of the SBP. The trabecular network adapts to its mechanical needs and is therefore not homoge - nously built. Dependent upon the long-term load intake, the trabecular model opti - mizes the support with significant correlation to the density distribution of the SBP.96 Department of Biomedicine .

Paul Erne (Research Associate) PD Dr. Maria Filippova (Research Associate) left during periodTherese Resink Department of Biomedicine University Hospital BaselSignal TransductionCadherins comprise a family of cell-cell adhesion proteins critical to architecture and function of tissues in developing and adult organisms. T-cadherin (T-cad) is peculiar in structure: it lacks transmembrane and cytosolic domains and is mem - brane-anchored via a GPI moiety, implying distinct functions and molecular circuit - ry. Analyses based on immunohistochemistry (IHC), gene expression, epigenetic modification and GWAS have ascribed relevance to T-cad in cardiovascular dis - eases (CVD) and cancer. However biological sense and mechanistic explanations for its functions and/or disease associations are lacking. We focus on delineating T-cad-dependent cellular functions and signal pathway utilization in vascular and cancer cells, with the broader goal being to define basic molecular and biological mechanisms underlying T-cad-mediated control of tissue homeostasis. T-cadherin in the vasculature In CVD T-cad protein expressed on vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) and en - dothelial cells (EC) is increased. Previous studies addressed T-cad functions and mechanisms of action in EC. Focus over recent years extended to SMC which, through their ability to reversibly transition between contractile/differentiated and synthetic/dedifferentiated phenotypes, crucially determine functionality and structure of vessels and thereby the course of CVD. T-cad upregulation promotes insulin resistance, matrix remodeling and proliferation and reduces contractile ca - pacity, all of which are functional hallmarks of the acquisition of a dedifferentiated phenotype. T-cad directly modulates activity of major signalling checkpoints con - trolling SMC plasticity via Akt/mTORC1 and Akt/GSK3 pathways (Fig. SMC polarity, migration and cell-matrix adhesion are currently under study. The role of T-cad in autophagy, a process implicated in behavioural flexibility of SMC and important for cell survival during stress, is also under investigation. Overall our research advances knowledge on the role of cad - herins in vascular (patho)biology and is relevant for development of therapeutic strategies targeting pathological SMC-driven reparation in CVD, or for harnessing phenotype modulation for tissue regeneration/engineering purposes. T-cadherin in cancer T-cad has been implicated in cancer progression primarily on the basis of genetic and epigenetic studies. IHC and functional studies are rare but necessary to un - derstand the role of T-cad in cancer progression. Our work in the context of skin and prostate cancers has shown that T-cad protein and gene expression levels do not always match, highlighting the importance of IHC analysis of expression and cellular distribution in any assessment of disease-associated alterations in T-cad. In normal cutaneous tissue T-cad expression highly depends on cell layer/origin (e. g. squamous and suprabasal low, basal and myoepithelial high, bulge stem and transit-amplifying cells very high) (Fig. 2A). In prostate tissue there is a gradient of T-cad expression across prostate gland epithelial layers (weak in basal, strong in luminal). Expression levels and patterns of T-cad protein in cutaneous and pros - tate cancers are heterogeneous (increased, decreased and/or absent) and de - pend on tumor differentiation status and cell-of-origin (Fig. 2B). Together, these studies imply roles for T-cad in cellular differentiation and maintenance of polar - ized tissue architecture. In vitro and in vivo functional studies have shown that T- cad influences cancer progression through two distinct mechanisms: by regulat - ing tumor cell differentiation, adhesion, invasion and metastasis and by promoting intratumoral .

We aimed to identify new candidate plasma biomarkers with screen - ing-, diagnostic- or monitoring potential in detect - ing early atherosclerosis and risk stratification of CVD. We have compiled a wide-ranging clinical data base on a large study cohort (healthy sub - jects, patients without cardiovascular risk factors, and patients with different stages of atherosclero - sis) and a corresponding bank of plasma samples for protein and lipid biomarker analysis. We found that measurement of plasma T-cad relative to lev - els in healthy subjects has biomarker potential for detecting early atherosclerosis and for evaluating disease severity: an elevation correlates with ear - ly, clinically silent atherosclerosis but a decrease correlates with increasing severity of coronary ar - tery disease (CAD) and higher risk for acute cor - onary syndrome (ACS). We also found opposing correlations between T-cad and its heterophilic li - gand adiponectin (APN) in male and female pa - tients, underscoring a need to consider sex as a confounding variable when evaluating biomarker potentials of APN and T-cad.

Cell Signal 26, 1897-1908 98 Department of Biomedicine Report (External Collaborator) * left during report periodThe prevalence of chronic inflammatory lung diseases (CILD) is increasing world - wide since several decades and together they represent the 4th most frequent cause of absence from education and work. Asthma, COPD and fibrotic changes of the lung are the most frequent CILD and are characterised by chronic inflamma - tion and excessive tissue remodelling. The pathologies, however, occur in disease specific patterns and different lung compartments. Recent studies challenged the long held hypothesis that tissue remodelling is caused by chronic inflammation. Today it is hypothesised that inflammation and remodelling occur independently. Furthermore, the likelihood to develop CILD was linked to epigenetic modifications which are imprinted during the last 8 weeks of embryogenesis and early childhood. Asthma affects 300 million people worldwide and is not curable. The pathogen - esis of asthma is not well understood and it is discussed if allergic and chronic asthma are the same disease or if they are 2 diseases which share many patholo - gies. Since 1922, we have known that a major pathology of asthma is the increase of airway wall thickness which is due to the hypertrophy and hyperplasia of air - way smooth muscle cells (ASMC). Recent studies in asthma patients showed that reduction of ASMC significantly reduced symptoms. ASMC are the major cause of airway constriction, immune cell infiltration, and of chronic inflammation. To - gether with our colleagues we search for novel targets aiming to develop curative therapies. Recently we described a novel signalling pathway which is constitu - tively activated in sub-epithelial cells of asthma patients and leads to the secre - tion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased proliferation and deposition of ex - tracellular matrix components. This signalling pathway involves Erk1/2, Stat1 and PRMT1 and is activated by all tested asthma triggers (IgE, TGF- , PDGF-BB, IL-4, TNF- ). Interestingly, the regulation of this pathway occurs on the epigenetic lev - el and we linked this to our earlier finding: the lack of C/EBP- expression in asth - matic ASMC. In regard to new therapies, the inhibition of PRMT1 may be easier to achieve than the expression of C/EBP- . COPD is the 3 rd most frequent cause of death in the U.S.A. and ranked 4th in Swit - zerland; thus, COPD caused more death than diabetes or neuro-degenerative dis - eases. The susceptibility to develop COPD seems to be defined by epigenetic imprinting during embryo development and later exposure to the known triggers which include cigarette smoke, fine ash, industrial fine dust and organic inhaled matters. Cigarette smoke is the main trigger of COPD which affects 20% of all smokers. COPD is deadly and cannot be cured with any available drugs. In ear - ly stages, COPD shows similar tissue remodelling pathologies as asthma, howev - er, in small bronchi. In late stages, COPD is characterised by tissue degradation (emphysema). Clinical data showed that combining long acting beta2-agonists with long acting muscarinic receptor antagonists achieved better symptoms con - trol and improved lung function compared to other treatments. Using our human cell model with COPD cells, we provided evidence that this drug combination has beneficial effects on extracellular matrix remodelling, thus providing the molecular biological rational of clinical studies.

Cellular Signalling 28,307-15Connection to Clinical Practice Translational medicine studies in chronic inflammatory lung diseases Our studies are focused on chronic inflammatory lung diseases. We link basic and clinical research to find novel bio-markers and therapeutic targets for asthma, COPD, ACOS, and idiopathic fibrosis. None of these diseases is easy to diagnose, and despite symptom control, curative therapies are not available. All studies are based on large pa - tient cohorts, diagnosed according to internation - al guidelines. We preform risk factor analysis and validate new biomarkers, as predictors for exacer - bation and survival of patients. The clinical studies are enabled by a close collab - oration of pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons, hae - matologists, pathologists, and basic research - ers. This translational approach benefits from the close co-location of the Clinic of Pneumology and the research laboratory (DBM). Using human lung samples of patients we are able to isolate prima - ry diseased human epithelial cells, fibroblasts and bronchial smooth muscle cells and provide them to our collaborators in other countries. The cells are analysed for disease specific expression and regulation patterns of biomarkers and inflammato - ry mediators. This also allows us to identify novel disease specific pathophysiological pathways and test new medications on the cellular level. Com - ponents of tissue remodelling are studied under the influence of allergic and non-allergic stimuli. In addition to this translational research projects numerous investigator driven non-commercial randomised studies are performed to optimise patient's safety during bronchoscopy in COPD pa - tients. Our clinic leads collaborative studies with groups in Germany, Italy, Spain, France, the Neth - erlands, Belgium, UK, Serbia and Greece.Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare but devastation non-malignant lung disease with unknown cause and limited therapeutic options. We have recent - ly shown that fibrotic remodelling can be controlled by the two novel drugs, nint - edanib and pirfenidone, however, clinical studies have demonstrated only limit - ed therapeutic benefit for IPF patients. In collaboration with the University of Bern, we obtained data showing that human fibrotic lung tissue contains increased num - bers of pluripotent cells which show characteristics of stem cells. In vitro studies demonstrated that these pluripotent stem cells exhibit anti-fibrotic effects via fi - broblasts and epithelial cells. Our current studies aim to understand the role of these stem cells in tissue fibrosis and to elucidate the mechanism of their anti-fi - brotic properties.

Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in press100 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a group of blood diseases characterized by aberrant proliferation of precursors of the myeloid, erythroid and megakaryo - cytic lineages. They represent clonal stem cell disorders with a tendency towards leukemic transformation. Currently, no curative therapy is available. MPNs com - prise 3 entities: polycythemia vera (ET) and pri - mary myelofibrosis (PMF). The goal of our studies is to advance the understanding of the molecular events that initiate MPN and influence its progression to leuke - mia. A recurrent mutation Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene that substitutes a valine to phenylalanine at position 617 (JAK2-V617F) is present in a majority of patients with MPN, in particular PV. This mutation leads to activation of the Jak2 tyrosine kinase and represents a driver for the proliferation of hematopoietic cells. Activating mu - tations calreticulin (CALR) and the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL) represent other frequent driver events. Despite this progress, several questions remain unsolved including how a single JAK2 mutation causes three different MPN phenotypes, what other genes might be involved and what determines the progression to acute leukemia. We are examining these questions by combining three approaches: mo - lecular studies in patients with sporadic MPN, genetic analysis of familial MPN and transgenic mouse models that mimic the human disease. Analysis of clonal progression in MPN Using next generation sequencing, we determined the mutational profiles of MPN patients and analyzed correlations with clinical outcome and prognosis. We found that increasing number of somatic mutations per patient was associated with high - er risk of transformation to acute leukemia and with reduced survival (Fig. 1). Some gene mutations, e.g. TP53 had a particularly bad prognostic impact. By examining individual colonies grown from patient's peripheral blood, the clonal architecture can be precisely determined. In a subset of patients with sporadic MPN addition - al somatic mutations can either precede or occur after the acquisition of JAK2- V617F. We are examining the impact of the clonal architecture on outcome and re - sponse to therapy. Familial predisposition for MPN Familial syndromes resembling MPN can be grouped into two classes: 1. Inherited disorders with high penetrance and polyclonal hematopoiesis. 2. Hereditary predisposition clonal hematopoi - esis and occurrence of somatic mutations, e.g. in JAK2-V617F. We identified mutations in the thrombopoietin (THPO) gene as the cause for an in - herited form of thrombocythemia in several families with a \"class 1\" phenotype. In another family we found a previously described mutation in MPL. However, in the majority of families neither THPO nor MPL is mutated. The search for these dis - ease genes is ongoing. Families with \"class 2\" phenotype are more common than generally assumed. These germ line mutations increase the likelihood of acquiring a somatic JAK2-V617F mutation. We are using genetic methods to map the locus for these pre-disposing mutations. Mouse models for MPN We generated JAK2-V617F transgenic mice that express the human JAK2-V617F. This conditional construct can be activated by Cre-recombinase. Depending on the mode of Cre-mediated activation, these mice developed a phenotype resembling ET with strongly elevated platelet counts or a PV-like phenotype with increased hemoglobin, thrombocytosis and neutrophilia.

Furthermore, mutations in genes that can modify the course of the disease, such as ASXL1, EZH2, or TP53 are now in the focus interest and are likely to become increasingly im - portant in clinical decision making. To cover the in - creasing need for the comprehensive molecular di - agnostics of MPN, we developed a next generation sequencing (NGS) based gene panel that allows a molecular classification of patients with myeloid neoplasm. This panel is based on our NGS study (Lundberg et al, Blood 2014), and is now being used for the routine diagnostics of MPN patients. Fig. 1: Model of MPN disease evolution and risk stratification in correlation to mutational events. bone marrow microenvironment. We demonstrated that MPN can be initiated by transplanting single hematopoietic stem cells that carry JAK2-V617F as the sole genetic alteration and that loss of function mutations in Ezh2 promoted disease ini - tiation from single cells and accelerated disease towards myelofibosis. We are dis - secting the contributions of additional genes to the pathogenesis using conditional knockout models. We are also using our mouse models for pre-clinical screening of Jak2 inhibitors and other potential therapeutic agents. Fig. 2: Frequency and distribution of mutations in pa - tients with MPN.

Report 2014-2016Deciphering the mechanisms of neurogenesis Development of the brain is controlled in a precise and organized fashion, but the mechanism controlling the differentiation of neuron-types in the cerebral cortex are unclear. The adult mammalian brain contains neural stem cells (NSCs) that continue to generate neurons in defined regions and contribute to brain homeo - stasis and function. Our understanding of the control of NSC activity and mainte - nance is rudimentary, but these processes have implications for brain function and cancers including gliomas. Using mouse genetics in vivo and in cell culture we are trying to understand the molecular mechanisms controlling NSC activity and fate during development, adulthood and gliomas formation. Systems biology of forebrain development As part of the SystemX.ch project NeuroStemX, we analyze neurogenesis during cortical development. NSCs of the developing cerebral cortex generate six lay - ers of cortical neurons in a precise inside-out temporal fashion. The neurons with - in each layer are functionally distinct, express specific markers and transcription - al regulators, and are born at precise times during development. The number of neurons within each layer is precisely controlled through sequentially modulation of NSC and progenitor cell fate. The mechanisms orchestrating neural progeni - tor fate in the developing cerebral cortex are not understood. We have addressed, at the systems biology level, whether all NSCs in the developing cortex have the same potential and respond to the same fate cues to contribute to all neuronal cell- types. We generated high-resolution transcriptome analyses of NSCs, progenitors and newborn neurons by next generation RNA sequencing at the population and single cell levels at each day of cortical development. We are using computational modeling of signaling and transcriptional regulatory networks to uncover the com - plex networks and switches in signaling that control NSC fate decisions. Regulation of adult NSC fate by Notch and Drosha Multi-lineage potential is an adult NSC trait. We showed that the RNAseIII Drosha is an intrinsic regulator of adult NSC maintenance and differentiation. Drosha si - lences NFIB in NSCs by cleaving hairpins in its mRNA thereby repressing expres - sion. Our findings revealed a novel mechanism for the maintenance and oligoden - drocyte fate restriction of adult NSCs. We continue to study targets of Drosha in the NSCs in embryonic and adult NSCs. Neurogenesis continues in adult forebrain from quiescent NSCs. To generate neurons, NSCs activate and enter cell cycle. Notch signaling is critical in this process and we found that Notch2 signaling con - veys quiescence to adult NSCs by repressing cell cycle genes and neurogenesis. Although neurogenesis occurs at all location of the developing embryonic brain, in adults, neuron production is restricted to specific brain regions. We identified dor - mant adult NSCs in niches outside the classical neurogenic zones. These NSCs are regulated by Notch2 signaling and retain neurogenic potential responding to pathophysiological stimuli to control mouse behavior. Thus, we identified novel NSCs in the brain that are held in a reversible, inactive state. Notch in forebrain tumor subtypes Notch signaling maintains NSC and as been proposed to be oncogenic. Howev - er, inactivating mutations in Notch receptors suggest that Notch signaling has tu - mor suppressor functions in human gliomas. We generated genetic mouse models that simulate different human glioma subtypes. These models enable us to study Notch function in brain tumor formation and growth. We identified a tumor sup - pressor function for Notch in forebrain tumor subtypes. Inactivating mutations in the Notch1 and Notch2 receptor genes accelerates growth of some gliomas.

Report 2014-2016Fig. 1: The RNAse Drosha is a key component of the microRNA microprocessor but also regu - lates cell fate by directly destabilizing mRNAs of fate determining factors. Drosha is known for its cleavage of pri-miRNA transcripts to generate pre-miRNAs, the precursors of mature microRNAs. Drosha also processes hairpin structures in Ngn2, NeuroD1 and NeuroD6 in NSCs during development (Knuckles et al. 2012). In the adult brain, NSCs generate neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, except in the hippocampus where oligodendrocytic differentiation is blocked. We have recently shown that NSC maintenance in the hippocampus, and their bias against oligodendrocytes differentiation, is controlled by repression of NFIB expression. Under normal conditions (basal hippocampal neurogenesis), hippocampal NSCs do not express NFIB protein as its mRNA is rapidly de - graded. We showed that Drosha is responsible for this degradation of NFIB mRNA by cleaving specific hairpin structures formed by the transcript. This intrinsic regulation of NFIB expres - sion enables NSCs to remain and self-renew but also prevents them from differentiating into oligodendrocytes. If Drosha is inhibited or blocked, NFIB mRNA stabilizes, the transcript factor is expressed and hippocampal NSCs erroneously differentiate into oligodendrocytes (Drosha (Rolando et al. 2016).Fig. 2: Gliomas are some of the most devastating cancers and the prognosis for patients with high-grade gliomas is very bad with only ineffective and highly aggressive treat - ments being available. Notch signaling has been implicat - ed as being oncogenic and inducing gliomas, particularly in the most aggressive forms of the disease, glioblastoma multiforma. We generated murine models of human glio - mas that lack the tumor suppressor p53 and express the growth factor PDGF. We assessed the role of Notch sig - naling in these tumors by genetic ablation and over ex - pression. We could show that these model glioblastomas contain cells where Notch is active, however, in contrast to expectations, deleting Notch signaling increases tumor growth indicating that Notch signaling, in this form of brain tumor, functions as a tumor suppressor. We were able to support these findings by analyzing human tumor data that also indicated that in some human gliomas sub-types, Notch signaling likely functions as a tumor suppressor (Giachino et al. 2015). These results open up important new directions for potential therapies for patients with gliomas.Selected Publications Rolando C, Erni A, Grison A, Beattie R, Engler A, Gokhale PJ, Milo M, Wegleiter T, Jessberger S and Taylor V.

To this aim we study how gene regulatory landscapes integrate multiple signaling inputs into robust but highly dynamic transcriptional outputs. We are taking advantage of our in-depth knowledge of the self-regulatory signaling systems that control vertebrate limb bud organogenesis. In particular, we are identifying the functionally relevant cis/ trans- regulatory interactions that control the establishment and propagation of this self-regulatory signaling system during initiation and progression of mouse limb bud organogenesis. Often, gene expression is regulated by multiple cis- reg- ulatory modules (CRMs) that are scattered in large genomic landscapes, but how these landscapes integrate transcriptional inputs is still largely unknown. There - fore, we profile chromatin architecture, epigenetic marks, interaction of transcrip - tional regulators with CRMs and transcriptomes to identify the relevant CRMs, which are functionally analysed by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing (Fig. 1). Experi - mental analysis is combined with bioinformatics and in silico simulations to reveal gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and interaction kinetics. A key node in the self- regulatory limb bud signaling system is the BMP antagonist Grem1, whose expres - sion is controlled by a large genomic landscape integrating inputs from all major signaling pathways. Within the Grem1 landscape, we have identified the region re - quired for limb bud expression, which encodes three CRMs regulated by key tran - scriptional regulators in limb buds. Currently, we are studying these CRMs that appear to regulate Grem1 expression in a cooperative manner, possibly as part of a super enhancer. As modern tetrapod limbs display amazing evolutionary di - versity, a second fascinating aspect of your research are insights into how this ro - bust and self-regulatory signaling system evolved and diversified.

Using MSCs for generating cartilage remains challenging due to (1) the heterogenous nature of MSC populations, which likely only contain a small and variable frac - tion of \"stem\" cells and/or early progenitors; (2) their compromised potency after in vitro expansion and (3) inefficient cartilage differentiation. We have done an indepth characterization of a rare popula - tion of adult mouse endosteum derived MSC-type cells as Sca-1+ PDGFR- + population (P S; pre - viously described by Matsuzaki an co-workers) as these cells posses a very robust tri-lineage differ - entiation potential. We have been able to charac - terize four subpopulations of P S cells by FACS analysis. In particular, ontogenic analysis revealed the progressive appearance of the four P S sub - populations during mouse embryonic limb devel - opment. A development-inspired culture protocol was used to generate stable cartilage templates from the P S subpopulations and their endochon - dral bone forming potential was assessed by en - graftment of cartilage constructs into nude mice. This analysis revealed the distinct potential of one of the P S subpopulations for endochondral bone formation and support of host-derived hematopoi - esis.

This is due to functional degen - eration of a CRM controlling up-reg - ulation of the SHH receptor Ptch1 in the limb bud mesenchyme. Another key process is the estab - lishment of the signaling centers controlling proliferation and pattern - ing of progenitor cells. In limb buds, the SHH signaling center is estab - lished in the nascent mesenchyme as the limb bud forms. We have shown that the HAND2 transcription factor is essential to this process and polar - ization of the nascent mesenchyme. ChIP-Seq in combination with genetic analy - sis revealed the gene regulatory logic by which the HAND2-target GRN establish - es proximal, anterior and posterior compartments and activates Shh expression in early limb buds (Fig. 2). Recently, we have shown that HAND2 controls similar GRNs during early heart development. Our studies begin to reveal the similarities in the HAND2-target GRNs controlling both limb and heart organogenesis, which points to a possible shared origin of these two structures. Finally, we have shown that SMAD4, which is part of the transcriptional complexes mediating response to canonical BMP signaling, is essential for normal limb bud development. We have used ChIP-Seq and comparative transcriptome analysis to identify the genes and GRNs that are regulated by SMAD4 chromatin complexes. Our analysis provides insight into the functionally relevant cis-regulatory dynam - ics of SMAD4-mediated BMP signal transduction during limb bud organogene - sis and chondrogenic differentiation. With respect to the latter, we are performing an in depth analysis of the functions of the BMP antagonists Grem1 and Nog - gin and SMAD4-mediated BMP/TGF\u00df signal transduction during chondrogenesis and digit ray formation.

Report 2014-2016The major goal of this focal area is to support and expand research in the field of molecular and clinical oncology in Basel. In particular, we aim at bridging the gaps between basic, translational, and clinical oncology research ongoing at the Uni - versity of Basel and the biotech and pharmaceutical industry in the Basel area. Ul - timately, the focal area should enforce collaborative efforts and common projects between various research groups, research institutes and pharmaceutical indus - try and between different disciplines. An added value is seen in innovative proj - ects that eventually pay off by being transferred to a clinical setting. This research program relies critically on the participating individuals' enthusiasm and initiatives. The Focal Area Oncology is currently chaired by Professor Gerhard Christofori, leader of the \"Tumor Biology\" group at the DBM, and by Professor Christoph Ro - chlitz, head of Clinical Oncology at the University Hospital. The program focuses on two major topics: first to support basic, translational, and clinical research by generating opportunities for oncology research, for example by hosting new re - cruitments within the DBM. In 2015, we were happy to welcome Prof. Nicola Aceto as SNF-Assistant Professor to lead the research group \"Cancer Metastasis\" and, in 2016, Prof. Mohamed Bentires-Alj as Professor of Experimental Surgical Oncol - ogy to lead the research group \"Tumor Heterogeneity, Metastasis and Resistance\". Both are now highly active in shaping the Focal Area Oncology with new initiatives and contributions. The second focus of the Focal Area Oncology is to increase communication be - tween the various researchers, clinicians and pharmaceutical company represen - tatives in Basel and to foster scientific exchange and technological collaboration, also with the other Focal Areas of the DBM. Towards this goal, one-day sympo - sia are organized to offer platforms for the discussion of research progress and for the exchange of ideas. Many members of the DBM Oncology Program are also engaged in the Basel Signaling Alliance, a center of excellence at the University of Basel, and in 2014 they have organized another high-impact international con - ference in Basel,\"Kinome III\". A more recent new addition to the Focal Area On - cology is the Basel Breast Consortium (BBC) which integrates basic, translation - al and clinical research on breast cancer and has already been highly successful in organizing progress report meetings and annual conferences. In addition, re - nowned international cancer researchers are invited to present lectures within the DBM Oncology Program Seminars, and impromptu Guest Seminars complete the seminar activities of the research program. Many members of the Foal Area On - cology are also actively participating in the European Cancer Center (EuCC), an oncology platform initiative of the Universities of Freiburg, Germany, Strasbourg, France, and Basel. Finally, specific advanced courses in experimental cancer re - search and in cell signaling are offered to Master and PhD students. Thus far, these communication activities have resulted into highly successful collaborations and research networks, manifested also by the accomplishments of several System - sX.ch project grants, SNF Sinergia grants, and a highly prestigious European Re - search Council (ERC) Synergy grant. Of note, a recent highly successful biotech startup of the University of Basel (Piqur Therapeutics AG) also has major roots in the DBM Oncology Program.

In the years to come, we still need to enforce scientif - ic exchange between basic and patient-oriented research in order to facilitate the identification of clinical problems for the design of appropriate and innovative ba - sic research approaches and, on the other hand, to further improve on the rapid translation of basic research results into clinical application.108 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016More than 90% of cancer-related deaths, corresponding to more than eight million people worldwide each year, are due to the development of a metastatic disease. Clearly, these numbers reflect our limited understanding of the key processes that drive human cancer metastasis, and the need to develop new therapies that sup - press the spread of cancer. Several unsolved questions frame the metastasis research field, including the search of those molecular events that are fundamental for the metastatic process, and that would represent exceptional therapeutic targets. Cancer cells that leave the primary tumor site and are transported through the circulation to distant or - gans are referred to as circulating tumor cells (CTCs). CTCs are used as a nonin - vasive source of cancer cells for analysis of tumor genotypes (i.e. so-called liquid biopsy), yet their characterization is also an exceptional opportunity to dissect the biology of blood-borne metastasis. While CTCs are extraordinarily rare in circula - tion, even in patients with metastatic cancer (approximately one cancer cell among a billion normal blood cells), their isolation is highly dependent upon technological constraints. However, remarkable advances in the microfluidics field have now en - abled the isolation of viable CTCs from virtually all cancer types, revealing highly unexpected features of the metastatic process. For example, while the majority of CTCs circulate as single cells, they can also be found as clusters of 2-50 cells (a. k. a. CTC-clusters), with the ratio of single ver - sus clustered CTCs varying significantly among different patients, and along dis - ease progression. While CTC-clusters have been previously observed in human specimens, their role in the metastatic process was unknown. When combining microfluidic technologies for CTC isolation, single cell resolution RNA sequenc - ing, patient samples and mouse models, we recently demonstrated that CTC-clus - ters represent key players in the metastatic process. First, we understood that the presence of CTC-clusters in the bloodstream of patients with breast and prostate cancer is associated with a shorter metastasis-free survival and overall surviv - al, respectively, compared to patients in whom only single CTCs are found. Sec - ond, adopting multicolor mouse models to trace metastatic cancer cells in vivo , we concluded that CTC-clusters are oligoclonal units derived from the primary tu - mor (as opposed to be derived from intravascular aggregation events or the prog - eny of a single CTC), and that they are up to 50-fold more metastatic than single CTCs. Third, with a single cell-resolution RNA sequencing approach applied to hu - man CTC-clusters and matched single CTCs from individual patients, we identified the cell-cell junction component plakoglobin to be required for CTC-clustering and metastasis. Together, these results highlight CTC-clusters as a previously unap - preciated, yet potentially targetable mechanism of cancer dissemination. Our research is now focused on the identification of the key vulnerabilities of CTC- clusters. In collaboration with Prof. Christoph Rochlitz, Prof. Viola Heinzelmann Prof. Alfred Zippelius and Prof. Walter Weber at the University Hospital Basel we routinely isolate CTCs from the blood of patients with metastatic cancers. In the lab, we apply microfluidics technology to human and mouse blood specimens, and adopt next-generation sequencing, molecular and computational biology, CTC cultures as well as loss of function screenings in xenograft models. Together, our approach aims to gain fundamental insights into the biology of CTC-clusters, and to identify novel therapeutic targets to suppress the metastatic spread of cancer.Circulating Tumor Cells Kr\u00f3l (Technician) Edward Richards * Manuel Scheidmann (PhD Student) Ramona Scherrer (Technician) Barbara Szczerba (PhD Student) * left during report period Nicola Aceto Department of Biomedicine Biochemistry and Genetics University of BaselAnalysis of circulating tumor cells to dissect the biology of human cancer metastasis Cancer Metastasis109 Department of Biomedicine .

In collaboration with Prof. Christoph Rochlitz, Prof. Viola Heinzelmann, Prof. Alfred Zippelius, Prof. Walter Weber, Dr. Mar - cus Vetter, Dr. Sacha Rothschild and Dr. Julia Lan - din at the University Hospital Basel, we routinely isolate and characterize CTCs from a variety of pa - tients with metastatic cancers (e. g. breast, ovarian and lung cancer). Upon isolating CTCs from blood specimens with microfluidics technology, we pro - cess them for single cell resolution sequencing of their genome and transcriptome, to gain insights into the metastatic process. Further, we have im - plemented a protocol for deriving primary cultures from human CTCs, and use these as a model to study individualized drug susceptibility (i. e. so- called personalized medicine), as well as to study the requirement of specific genes for the metastat - ic process in xenograft models. With our approach, we aim to establish state-of-the-art and clinically relevant tools that will enable the identification of key vulnerabilities of cancer cells during the met - astatic process.Selected Publications Gkountela S, Szczerba B, Donato C, Aceto N.

Report 2014-2016Breast cancer is diagnosed in ~1.5 million women worldwide and ~500,000 lives are lost to the disease annually, the vast majority due to metastasis. Curing meta - static breast cancer represents an unmet medical need. Patients may do well af - ter surgery and adjuvant treatment but drug-resistant, fatal metastases often de - velop. Critical to the phenomenon of resistance is tumor heterogeneity and this is the thread connecting the research in our lab. At the molecular, cellular, and whole organism levels, we assess mechanisms that influence normal and neoplastic breast stem cells, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. We explore both cell autonomous (genetics, epigenetic, and proteomic) and non-cell autonomous mechanisms (immune cells, adipcoytes, etc). We use systems medicine quantitative methods, unbiased pooled shRNA, CRIS - PR, transposon-based screens, and hypothesis-driven approaches. Computa - tional biology is a very important part of our research. Moreover, we use multipho - ton intravital imaging to assess the interactions between cancer cells and immune cells. These interdisciplinary projects seek to elucidate the integrated effects of signaling pathways and epigenetics on breast cell fate and tumor heterogeneity, and to leverage this mechanistic understanding into therapy. With clinicians from the University Hospital of Basel, we are building a breast cancer personalized medicine program wish should ultimately improve treatment for patients (Fig. 1). M.

Our results define a key effect of PIK3CAH1047R on mammary cell fate in the pre-neoplastic mammary gland and show that the cell-of-origin of PIK3CAH1047R tumors dictates their malignancy, thus revealing a mechanism under - lying tumor heterogeneity and aggressiveness (Fig. 2) (Koren et al. , Nature 2015). Molecular mechanisms controlling metastasis: Discontinuation of CCL2 inhibition accelerates breast cancer metastasis by promoting angiogenesis. We have discovered a paradoxical effect of the CC chemokine ligand 2 by mammary tumors recruits CCR2-expressing inflammatory monocytes to primary tumors and metastatic sites, and CCL2 neutralization in mice inhibits metastasis by retaining monocytes in the bone marrow. Surprisingly, interruption of CCL2 in - hibition leads to an overshoot of metastases and accelerates death. This is the re - sult of monocyte release from the bone marrow, enhancement of cancer cell mo - bilization from the primary tumor, as well as blood vessel formation and increased proliferation of metastatic cells in the lungs in an IL-6/VEGF-A-dependent man - ner. Our results call for caution when considering anti-CCL2 agents as monother - apy in metastatic disease and highlight the tumor microenvironment as a critical determinant of successful anti-metastatic therapy (Bonapace et al. , Nature 2014).

Report 2014-2016 The vast majority of cancer patient deaths are due to the systemic dissemination of cancer cells throughout the body and the seeding and outgrowth of second - ary tumors (metastases) in distant organs. One major objective of our research is the identification and characterization of those cancer cells that are able to initi - ate and complete the metastatic process and to overcome current cancer thera - pies. In particular, we focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying the transi - tion from benign tumors to malignant cancers and the metastatic dissemination of tumor cells. Moreover, we have set out to delineate the genes and pathways that allow cancer cells to evade from therapy. In addition to cultured tumor cell lines in vitro, we employ transplantation and transgenic mouse models of specific cancer types to determine causal connections between the expression of particular genes and tumor progression, metastasis and drug resistance in vivo. The development of malignant tumors is in part characterized by a tumor cell's ca - pability to overcome cell-cell adhesion and to invade surrounding tissue by a pro - cess referred to as epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT). An EMT underlies the conversion of epithelial, differentiated cells to mesenchymal, migratory and inva - sive cells. In the past years, we have learned that an EMT occurs in multiple stages and is regulated by sophisticated molecular networks regulating the expression of a large number of protein, lncRNA and miRNA-encoding genes. More recently, we have noted that an EMT also selects for cancer cells exhibiting hallmarks of cancer stem cells and increased drug resistance. Notably, we have identified a large num - ber of transcription factors that act as master regulators not only in the initiation and execution of the morphogenic process of an EMT but also in providing surviv - al signals to cancer cells and thus allowing cancer cells to seed and grow metasta - ses in distant organs. We investigate the direct target genes of these transcription factors and their role in tumor metastasis. We also assess the role of miRNAs and lnRNAs and their target genes in the regulation of an EMT and of metastatic dis - semination. With these experimental approaches we aim at identifying the master regulators of an EMT and cancer metastasis and we plan to scrutinize their poten - tial as therapeutic targets for preventing metastatic disease. In a second line of research, we investigate the molecular pathways underlying the development of evasive resistance to targeted cancer therapy. We employ a number of cultured cancer cell lines and mouse models to study the pathologi - cal, physiological and molecular consequences of therapies targeting tumor an - giogenesis and malignant tumor progression. In particular, we use cell biological, biochemical and bioinformatical analysis to delineate the molecular pathways al - lowing cancer cells to escape from targeted therapy. Recently, we have found that tumors shift their metabolism to glycolysis and acquire a status of metabolic sym - biosis between individual cells of a tumor to overcome anti-angiogenic therapy. Fi - nally, in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies we are investigating the effi - cacy and biological consequences of various anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic cancer treatments.Molecular dissection of malignant tumor progression, metastasis and therapy resistance Group Members Dr. Maren Diepenbruck, Dr. Ernesta Fagiani*,Dr. Bill*, Ronen, (MD-PhD Antoniadis Panous-sis, Isabel Galm, Petra Schmidt*, left report periodTumor BiologyCancer .

Report 2014-2016Our research group aims to identify the molecular (genetic) basis of human dis - eases by combining human genetics knowledge, new genomics technologies, bioinformatics/-statistical approaches, and in-depth phenotyping. We work on complex neuropsychiatric disorders (Sven Cichon and Per Hoffmann), congeni - tal developmental disorders (Isabel Filges, primarily linked to the DKF), and hered - itary colorectal cancer syndromes (Karl Heinimann). Neuropsychiatric disorders We recently published the so far largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of bipolar disorder (BD) (M\u00fchleisen et al. , 2014), a common neuropsychiatric dis - order and implicated novel risk loci at the ADCY2 gene and between the genes MIR2113 and POU3F2. In particular the gene for ADCY2 (encoding adenylate cy - clase 2) is biologically interesting, it plays a key role in cAMP-dependent G-protein coupled receptor pathways. Disturbed neurotransmission at these pathways is a long-standing hypothesis in psychiatric research. We contributed to the largest GWAS of schizophrenia to date (Schizophrenia Work - ing Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014) in which 128 indepen - dent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. Using these GWAS data, we performed several follow-up analyses, including an analysis of the contri - bution of microRNA coding genes to BD (Forstner et al., 2015). A current project aims at the identification of risk genes for BD in large, multiply af - fected BD and major depression families, by analyzing whole-exome sequencing data in up to 10 genetically distant patients selected from each family. Congenital developmental disordersOur goal is to understand the genomic basis of congenital developmental dis - orders and improve patient care. We identified several genes causing develop - mental delay and intellectual disabilities (ID) through the systematic study of in - dividuals with unexplained congenital anomaly (e.g. PTCHD1, SMARCA2). Recent research expands to using next generation sequencing technologies to discover genes in which mu - tations cause early fetal mal-development, since improved ultrasound technolo - gy and its use by maternal fetal medicine specialists fetal diagnosis clinics world - wide deal with an increasing number of cases with serious or lethal anomalies of unknown cause. Most important findings so far were the delineation of the first hu - man lethal phenotype caused by mutations in KIF14 (Filges et al., 2014), and the identification of mutations in CENPF, causing a variable phenotypic presentation ranging from a fetal lethal ciliary phenotype to the postnatal St\u00f8mme syndrome (Filges et al., 2016).

Hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes We have assessed the mutational processes behind large, genomic deletions/in - sertions leading to colorectal cancer syndromes. Little is known about genomic re - arrangements (GRs) in the germ line of cancer patients. We investigated DNA mo - tifs and higher order structures of genome architecture, which may result in losses and gains of genetic material in the germ line, and created an algorithm to predict the propensity of rearrangements (Kovac et al., 2015). Another focus was on juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) with SMAD4 or BMPR1A germline mutations (1st-hit). Little is about nature of somatic altera - tions (2nd-hit) in SMAD4-/BMPR1A related juvenile polyps. We screened polyps from three patients with SMAD4-/BMPR1A germ line mutations for somatic altera - tions and SMAD4 protein expression. No somatic alterations were identified in 14 SMAD4-related polyps. SMAD4 protein expression, however, was lost in 57 % of the polyps (6 showing concomitant loss in both epithelial and stromal compart - ments). In BMPR1A-related polyps, five out of nine (56 %) displayed gene copy number neutral LOH, which had occurred in the epithelial compartment. The het - erogeneity of genetic mutations and protein expression levels indicates that differ - ent modes of gene inactivation can be operational in SMAD4- and BMPR1A-relat - ed polyp formation. The observation that half of BMPR1A-related polyps displayed LOH suggests that BMPR1A acts as a tumour suppressor gene (Blatter et al., 2015). Fig. 1b chr. 10 covering the ANK3 gene, and chr. 11 including the gene ODZ4. Fig. 1b shows re - sults of a biological pathway analysis using the program INRICH, using the complete GWAS results as input. Our analysis shows that association signals in SNPs located in genes coding for proteins of the NCAM1 signaling pathway are significantly clustered. This provides evidence that the NCAM1 sig - naling pathway is disturbed in BD. Future studies will have to show the exact functional consequences (pathophysiology) of such SNP risk alleles on the pathway in BD (Manu - script in preparation). 116 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016Gynecological cancers in general and ovarian cancer (OC) in particular are the main focus of our research. OC is the fifth most common cause of death from all cancers in women and the leading cause of death from gynecological malignan - cies, with a poor prognosis (5-year survival <20%). Major issues with OC are its heterogeneity , its unclear genetic origin, its diagnosis at advanced stages due to the lack of accurate biomarker, its ability to rapidly metastasize into other or - gans, and its insufficient treatment due to disease recurrence (therapy resistance) and missing personalized therapy regimens. Our particular focus is to: (i) iden - tify molecular/genetic signatures that unequivocally discriminate OC patients by their clinico-pathological parameters (e.g. histotype, grade, stages) and identify molecular targets for the better prediction of disease outcome and for the design of targeted therapies. (ii) elucidate the molecular basis and biological functions of aberrantly glycosylated proteins and lipids in cancer initiation, progression, and dissemination. (iii) evaluate in clinical studies novel means to improve diagnosis and treatment of gynecological cancers. Identification of discriminating signatures in the era of omics (Prof. Viola Heinzelmann) Identification of novel \"discriminating\" diagnostic and prognostic markers and therapeutic targets is an urgent need in the fight against cancer. Employing vari - ous glycan-based immunoassays we identified sets of specific markers (glycans) that enable us to discriminate healthy controls from ovarian cancer patients with sensitivity and specificity comparable to the current biomarker CA125 (Jacob et al, 2012, 2014; Pochechueva et al, 2011, 2014, 2016). We also found particular glycan- based signatures (glycans and glyco-genes) which distinguish serous ovarian from peritoneal cancers: this, together with transcriptomic and epidemiological data, provides further evidence that these two cancers are clearly different diseases and hence should no longer be clinically treated as one (manuscript in preparation). We also identified two protein kinases with significance in ovarian cancer. ROR2, a Wnt-signaling-associated receptor tyrosine kinase, is overexpressed in ovar - ian cancer patients (tissue microarray) and is implicated in proliferation, migra - tion, and invasion (Henry et al, 2015). MELK (maternal embryonic leucine-zipper kinase) was identified as an interesting candidate in ovarian cancer (Heinzelmann- Schwarz et al, 2004) already in 2004 when still known as KIAA0175. We now show in broad transcriptomic/bioinformatical data analyses that MELK expression is el - evated in ovarian cancer patients, increases with ascending aggressiveness, and correlates with poor disease outcome, and that its inhibitor OTSSP167 is highly ac - tive against (including drug-resistant) ovarian cancer cells (manuscript in revision). Regulation and function of specific glycan motifs in ovarian cancer (Glyco-Oncology: Dr. Francis Jacob) It is acknowledged that glycosylation is crucial to the proper function(s) of glyco - proteins and glycosphingolipids but the molecular and biological details are poor - ly understood. Owing the expertise of Francis Jacob as Glycobiologist the \"Gly - co-Oncology\" branch within Ovarian Cancer Research was launched in 2015. In collaboration with Nicki Packer (Sydney), membrane protein glycan features (\"bi - secting GlcNAc\" type N -glycans) unique to ovarian cancer cells were identified and experimental evidence is provided that expression of MGAT3 (enzyme for bi - secting GlcNAc synthesis) is epigenetically regulated by DNA-methylation and correlates with presence of bisecting GlcNAc on glycoproteins (Anugraham et al., 2014, Kohler et al., 2016).

Report 2014-2016Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death. Non-trans - formed cells in CRC microenvironment, including tumor-associated mesenchymal stromal cells (TASCs) and immune cells, have been recognized to play key roles in disease progression. Whereas infiltration by specific immune cell types is signifi - cantly associated with prolonged patient survival, TASC abundance predicts un - favorable prognosis. Mechanisms leading to recruitment of these cell populations and underlying their effects on clinical outcome remain to be clarified. CRC arises in an environment populated by the gut microflora. Commensal bacteria translocate across the dysfunctional neoplastic epithelium into the lamina propria, thus possibly stimulating stromal and immune cells. The potential impact of these events on tumor development and progression remains to be fully elucidated. We are interested in investigating interactions occurring between tumor, stromal and immune system in CRC and their modulation by the gut microflora. Under - standing the complex network of tumor-host interactions in CRC may allow the identification of novel prognostic biomarkers and potential new areas of therapeu - tic intervention. Main Projects Role of CRC infiltrating IL-17-producing T cells: Phenotypes and prognostic rele - of tumor infiltrating IL-17-producing T cells (Th17) in CRC are still debated. Upon ex vivo analysis, and in vitro and in vivo experiments we found that CRC infiltrating Th17 are polyfunctional effector cells able to produce, in addition to IL-17, a spectrum of cytokine/chemokines ultimately leading to recruitment of beneficial CD8+ T cells and neutrophils. Our study reveals a positive role played by tumor infiltrating Th17 in CRC, thus calling for caution when envisaging nov - el IL-17/Th17 targeted therapies. Monocytes-Th17 cells crosstalk: Monocytes (Mo) promote differentiation of na - \u00efve cells into Th17. However, their impact on pre-differentiated Th17 cells, such those infiltrating CRCs, is unknown. We assessed the ability of classical (cMo) and non-classical monocytes (ncMo) to promote expansion of memory Th17 cells in vitro . We found that in the absence of microbial stimulation ncMo are more efficient stimulators of Th17 than cMo, and their ability is counteracted by LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction. These data highlight ncMo as potential new thera - peutic targets in IL-17-mediated inflammation. Immune cell recruitment into CRC: Chemotactic factors leading to CRC infiltra - tion by beneficial immune cells are still unclear. Upon ex vivo analysis of human CRC specimens, we identified a panel of chemokine genes underlying tumor in - filtration by favorable immune cell subsets. Stimulation of CRC cells by gut mi - crobiota markedly enhanced the expression of these chemokines in vitro and in vivo, and led to increased T cell recruitment into tumor xenografts. Importantly, in human CRC specimens, bacterial loads correlated with chemokine expres - sion levels and extent of T cell infiltration. Our findings identify the gut microbi - ota as critical modulator of immune cell trafficking into CRCs. Impact of TASCs on CRC progression: Mechanisms underlying the negative prog - nostic significance of TASCs in CRC are not fully understood. By in vitro and in vivo experiments, we found that upon tumor conditioning, TASCs acquire sur - face TGF- expression and induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CRC cells (see Figure 1). This results in higher numbers of circulating tumor cells, ultimately leading to increase metastasis formation. These data reveal a novel mechanism of tumor-stroma interaction and may suggest novel therapeu - tic interventions.Tumor-host interactions in human colorectal cancer (Postdoc) Dr. Elisabetta Associate) * left during report period Giandomenica Iezzi SNSF Professor Department of Biomedicine Department of Surgery University Hospital BaselCancer ImmunotherapyColorectal Cancer . revealed Imagestream (green) co-cultured with TGF- -expressing TASCs (CRC+TASC) undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, as in - dicated by the acquisition of elongated shape (B, see arrows) and by downregulation of E- cadherin and upregulation of N-cadherin, de - tected upon Imagestream analysis (C).

EV patients de - velop plane wart-like lesions mainly on neck and extremities during childhood and have a high risk for early development of NMSC (Fig. 1). Patients have an increased susceptibility to specific human papilloma virus (HPV), usually beta-HPV. These HPV are harmless for the general population because they miss a specific gene named E5. E5 is supposed to be necessary for HPV to overcom the human im - mune system. About 60 % of EV patients present bi-allelic mutations in the genes TMC6/EVER1 or TMC8/EVER2. Function of both proteins and pathomechanism in EV are unknown. Since EV patients are prone to infections by E5-missing HPV it is assumed that TMC6 and TMC8 are part of innate immune system. Immunocom - promised patients after organ transplatation have a 60-fold increased risk for de - velopment of NMSC compared to the immunocompetent population. We hypothe - sized that rare SNPs in one of both TMC genes are correlated to their risk, but our investigations of renal transplant cohort from Basel could not confirm such a cor - relation. Our team was able to expand the phenotypical spectrum of EV by careful examination of patients. Investigations of both TMC genes revealed new mutations and we characterized the stability of correlated mRNA. Identification and analysis of an undescribed gene in EV by the group from J-L Casanova (Rockefeller Uni - versity, NY; INSERM and Imagine Institute Paris, France) in collaboration with our group will help to characterize pathomechanisms beyond EV. IWC IWC is an ultra-rare autosomal dominant inherited genodermatosis with less than 50 patients described in literature. IWC patients are born with an erythematous scaling skin (Fig. 2A).

Most impact is applied to skin car - cinoma development with the aim to understand basic mechanisms and identify new targets for tu - mour therapy. Patients who suffer from the related disease are under medical treatment in the Clinic of Dermatology. Since all of our research activities is close-by the needs of the patients we also exam - ine single families outside of carcinoma topics. For instance, we could analyse the germline mutation in a family without fingerprints. In cooperation with an Israeli dermatological research group we iden - tified a specific splice variant of SMARCAD1 as a transcript responsible for development of finger - prints on human palms and soles (Fig. 3). The knowledge of the underlying cause of their skin disease is important for the patients, not only for estimation of cancer risk but also for the interper - sonal relationships as skin is an important media - tor between human individuals.characteristics may help to distinguish IWC patients from other erythematous ich - thyoses before development of typical white spots. Patients with IWC carry a het - erozygous mutation in the 3'-end of keratin 10 (KRT10) which leads to an arginine- rich C-terminus in the resulting protein instead of glycin-richness. Presumably that switch in charge induces a nuclear signal of the aberrant keratin 10 (K10) resulting in a nuclear accumulation instead cytoplasmic localisation. In epidermal kera - tinocytes of IWC patients, but not in the underlying dermis as we could show, lots of mitotic recombinations or gene conversions occur on the chromosome with the KRT10 gene. That leads to a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the mutation with - out loss of copy number and results in keratinocytes which express only wildtype KRT10. Those cells present as white spots on patients' skin. Even though exam - ined IWC patients carried various mutations and the detected number of arginine differed relevant, no genotype-phenotype correlation could be defined. In contrast to EV, patients with IWC are not excessively reported to develop cSCC, but single reports of early NMSC development exists. Since the disease is ultra-rare estima - tion of NMSC risk is very difficult. Future research of our group aims for identifica - tion of the mechanism underlying the disease and leading to a prognosis for the patients regarding their tumour risk, especially on the skin. 122 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016Gliomas are among the deadliest cancers, with median survivals varying between months for the malignant grade IV glioblastoma (GBM), to decades for low-grade glioma (LGG). Gliomas progress by brain tissue invasion. The aim of our Labora - tory is to understand mechanisms underlying glioma invasion. This involves the identification of biomarkers, genetic regulators, signaling networks and molecular effectors of invasion that can ultimately be targeted to control glioma progression. Through an active exchange between clinics and our laboratory, we are collecting freshly resected glioma biopsies for genotyping and ex vivo cell culture. In parallel, we are entering personal, clinical, imaging, histopathological and molecular anno - tations to construct a comprehensive glioma patient database. This information is useful for classifying gliomas into molecular subsets and allowing identification of biomarkers that may reveal novel glioma pathways. IDH mutations in - ketoglutarate conversion into 2-hydroxyglutarate, accumulation of which maintains CpG methyl - ation. This results in MGMT epigenetic silencing and TP53 CpG-to-CpA mutation - al transition. We stratified 210 LGG according to these molecular criteria in a ret - rospective study. Although IDH mut status is associated with a lower risk of death (HRdeath=0.35, P=0.0023), IDHmut subsets consistently showed higher risks of malignant transformation (MT) than of death. This supports the finding that mo - lecular events relevant to IDH mutation impacts early glioma development prior to MT (see Leu et al., 2016). The interplay of 3q26 clustered genes SOX2, PIK3CA, MFN1 and OPA1 in GBM cell invasion Chromosome band 3q26, frequently altered in GBM, contains the genes for tran - scription factor OPA1, effectors of mitochondria fusion, a process linked to inhibition of cell motility (Fig. 1A). We aimed at determining the roles of these four genes in GBM cell invasion. Compared to parental LN319 GBM cells, individual 3q26 gene knock-downs con - sistently shortened mitochondria, and enhanced cell invasion (Fig. 1BC).

This project consists of the retrospective neuro-im - aging analysis of 64 glioblastoma patients operat - ed in our department for which the following imag - ing parameters are assessed: (i) volumes of enhancing, non-enhancing, necro - sis and edema domains from the pre-operative magnetic resonance images; (ii) preoperative Re - sponse Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO); and (iii) postoperative enhancing residual volume. Multivariable cox proportional hazard models will be used to associate the different tumor compo - nents with overall survival adjusting for the poten - tial confounders: age and postoperative enhancing residual tumor. Preliminary results suggest a sta - tistically significant multiplicative effect of RANO on the hazard for death. As a clinical extension on our project on the 3q26 gene cluster, we are also testing whether 3q26 ge - netic alterations may correspond to specific tumor patterns such as the volume and the type of recur - rence (local vs. distant), and the focality (unifocal vs. multifocal).muno-precipitation and luciferase MFN1 and OPA1 (Fig. 2BC). This indicates a positive regulation loop where AKT signaling activates SOX2 function, which in turn activates PIK3CA, MFN1 and OPA1 transcription. Copy number variations at 3q26 analyzed in 100 glioma biopsies show frequent SOX2 and OPA1 loss (Fig. 3A). SOX2 amplification is consistent with enhanced transcriptional activation of on - cogenic targets such as PIK3CA. In contrast, OPA1 needs to be lost to counter - act the impact of SOX2 on mitochondria fusion and invasion suppression. Thus, among the genes trans-activated by SOX2, are oncogenic and tumor suppres - sor genes. While the oncogenic ones (PIK3CA) are kept 'on', OPA1 may need to be turned 'off' by deletion. Thus, we provide evidence that a regional interplay be - tween 3q26 genes promotes glioma invasion (Fig. 3B). Copy number variations of 3q26 genes suggest optimization of these oncogenic activities and are current - ly being tested for their impact on tumor invasion in glioma patients (see connec - tion to clinical practice). Combined expression of nestin and SPARC identifies isolated astrocytoma cells in brain tissue Identification of individual invasive glioma cells in brain tissue requires markers that specifically recognize tumor cells.

Report 2014-2016Spatio-temporal regulation of cell signaling during cell migration and neuronal differentiation The ability of vertebrate cells to directionally migrate is critical to development, the immune response and wound healing, and its regulation is compromised in pa - thologies such as metastatic cancer and vascular disease. The capacity of neu - rons to directionally extend neuronal processes is crucial for the proper wiring of the brain. Both processes take advantage of a tight spatio-temporal control of cy - toskeletal and adhesion dynamics, with signaling events that operate on length and time scales of single microns and tens of seconds. One current limitation is that these biologically relevant scales are not accessible with traditional biochem - ical and cell biological approaches. We are broadly interested in different signal - ing networks regulating the two processes mentioned above with the focus to de - sign and implement novel technologies to grasp their spatio-temporal dynamics at relevant biological scales. Genetically-encoded biosensors to measure signaling events in time and space We have devised a novel toolkit to rapidly construct genetically-encoded, fluores - cence resonance energy transfer-based biosensors for a wide variety of signaling molecules. Our approach enables to visualize micrometric signaling domains that fluctuate of time scales of tens of seconds. By example, the GTPase RhoA is spe - cifically activated at the tip of F-actin bundles in neuronal growth cone filopodia (Fig. 1) or at the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts. Rac1 and Cdc42 are activat - ed at overlapping but distinct regions within the growth cone. This degree of preci - sion cannot be matched by any biochemical measurement. In the case of the MAP kinase ERK, the biosensor revealed signaling noise within a population of cells, which was not previously accessible using western blot-based measurements cell population averages. Previous work has proposed that duration of the pERK sig - nal in response to different growth factors regulate cell fate decision such as dif - ferentiation or proliferation. We observe that these growth factor-induced signal - ing responses are extremely heterogeneous when analyzed at the single cell level (Fig. 2). This explains the phenotypic \"fate\" noise observed in a population of cells: a given growth factor will not lead to homogeneous proliferation or differentiation within the cell population, but rather a mix of multiple behaviours. Thus, our bio - sensors provide a novel approach to understand signaling dynamics at relevant biological scales. Local mRNA translation during neurite outgrowth We have performed a genome-wide screen for mRNAs enriched within neuronal growth cones. We have found that the MKK7 mRNA, which encodes a MAPKK for JNK, is locally translated within the growth cone. This leads to specific activation of JNK within the neurite, where it regulates microtubule bundling necessary for ro - bust neurite outgrowth (Fig. 3). This provides a spatio-temporal signaling mecha - nism to specifically couple JNK signaling to regulation of microtubules, and to un - couple it from regulation of cellular stress. Spatio-temporal signaling programs during neuronal guidance We are currently studying a large signaling network of 220 neurite-localized pro - teins that regulate the cytoskeleton, identified using a proteomic approach. siR - NA-mediated knockdown of these proteins only leads to very subtle phenotypes that can only be grasped using timelapse imaging of the neurite outgrowth pro - cess.

By chemical modification of the DNA, they alter its coding properties and promote genetic mutation. Such \"damage\" to DNA, how - ever, does not only occur randomly, through chemical reactions, but also by the action of enzymes, in which case the purpose is to increase genetic variance or alter cell fate determining epigenetic signatures, i. e. DNA methylation. Modifica - tions of either kind occur thousands of times in our DNA every day and need to be controlled if genome function is to be maintained. We investigate the molecu - lar mechanisms underlying this dynamic instability of genomes. A main research focus of the past years has been the role of DNA repair in active DNA demethyl - ation and its contribution to the patterning and maintenance of epigenetic pro - grams - hence - cell identity. We have been following three main lines of investi - gation directed towards unraveling the basic molecular mechanisms and function of active DNA demethylation, the relevance of DNA methylation control and stabil - ity for human aging and disease, and the impact of the environment on the stabil - ity of DNA methylation. (Epi)genetic maintenance by DNA repair A long-standing focus of our research has been the biological function of an enig - matic DNA repair pathway operating through the \"Thymine DNA Glycosylase\" (TDG). TDG first caught our attention because of its ability to hydrolyze thymine or uracil from TG and UG DNA mismatches. These mismatches arise frequent - ly in genomic DNA by deamination of cytosine or 5-methylC (5mC) and, unless repaired, will generate C>T mutations, the most prevalent DNA change found in cancers. Thus, its enzymatic activity clearly implicates TDG in the anti-mutagenic repair of these mismatches, but this function has never been corroborated by bi - ological evidence. The entry point for our recent research was the discovery that a defect in TDG causes developmental failure in a mouse model, due to aberrant DNA methylation patterning. Together with work of others on trans-eleven-trans - location (TET) proteins, these findings indicated that TET and TDG constitute a long-sought pathway for active DNA demethylation, operating through oxidation of 5mC by TET and replacement of the oxidized 5mC with a C through TDG depen - dent DNA repair. We then established that TDG and TET cooperate in differentiat - ing cells to drive cyclic methylation and demethylation events at specific gene reg - ulatory sequences. On the mechanistic side, we were able to show that TET1 and TDG physically and functionally interact to form an active DNA demethylase and to provide proof by biochemical reconstitution that the TET-TDG-repair system, coor - dinated by SUMO modification, is capable of productive and coordinated DNA de - methylation. Ongoing work addresses, amongst other questions, the involvement of non-coding RNAs in assembling DNA demethylation complexes in chromatin. DNA Methylation Dynamics in Aging and Disease Aberrant DNA methylation contributes to tumorigenesis by deregulating the ge - nome. Exactly why, how and when methylation changes arise during carcinogen - esis is unknown. Our aim is to identify genetic and environmental conditions con - trolling DNA methylation stability in human tissues and assess the underlying mechanisms. We started by investigating the stability of DNA methylation in the aging healthy human colon. Using a molecular epidemiological approach, we were able to identify distinct patterns of age-dependent and cancer-relevant DNA meth - ylation drift and found that the rate of such changes is modulated by exposure to lifestyle factors such as medication and BMI.

Report 2014-2016The overall goal of our research is to functionally dissect critical molecular mech - anisms that drive the development and maintenance of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Our work currently focuses on genetic alterations of epigenetic regulators such as mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) or nucleoporin-98 (NUP98) often associ - ated with poor disease outcome. NUP98 is recurrently involved in chromosom - al translocations leading to expression of fusions with multiple partner genes. We have cloned full-length cDNAs of several NUP98-fusions including NUP98-NSD1 and NUP98-MLL. In contrast to others, we found that overexpression of NUP98- NSD1 is not sufficient to transform hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, but rapidly induces AML in mice when expressed in combination with the FLT3-ITD mutation, which is present in tumor cells from the majority of NUP98-NSD1+ pa - tients (Thanasopoulou et al. , 2014). In parallel, we found that expression of trans - forming NUP98 fusions resulted in unprecedented alterations of the nuclear mem - brane (collaboration with B. Fahrenkrog, Bruxelles) (Fahrenkrog et al. , 2016). In contrast to NUP98, the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion genes is well es - tablished. MLL-fusions form transcriptionally active large multi-protein complexes that bind to chromatin through adapter proteins like MENIN and LEDGF/p75. We used several in vitro and in vivo AML models to demonstrate potent anti-leukemic activities of several small molecules that inhibit critical co-factors of the MLL fu - sion complex such as the BET-protein BRD4 or the CBP/EP300 transcriptional co- regulators (collaboration with S. Knapp, Oxford/ Frankfurt) (Picaud et al. , 2015). Whether the cell of origin influences the biology of AML is an ongoing matter of debates. We established conditional transgenic mouse lines for some of the most prevalent MLL fusions (\"iMLL-AF9\", \"iMLL-ENL \") that allow to model AML from long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC) but also more com - mitted progenitor cells such as granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP). Ac - tivation of iMLL-AF9 in LT-HSC resulted in unusually invasive clonogenic growth in methylcellulose not observed upon activation in GMP. In vivo , activation of iMLL- AF9 upon transplantation of LT-HSC, induced in 10-20% of the recipients an in - vasive and chemoresistant AML after a very short latency. Interestingly, \"LT-HSC- early iMLL-AF9\" AML cells expressed many genes related to adhesion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) known from progressing solid can - cers. Strikingly, about 20 % of a large cohort of AML patients were character - ized by similar gene expression signatures: akin to the mouse model, leukemic cells from these patients expressed high levels of the transcription factors EVI1 and ERG and the EMT-regulator ZEB1 (Fig. 1). Cross-species comparison revealed >100 genes that characterized aggressiveness and poor outcome in mouse and human AML, and may represent novel biomarkers and/or origin-related therapeu - tic targets (Stavropoulou et al. , 2016). The iMLL-ENL mouse line allowed for the first time to closely model human mixed lineage leukemia associated with this fusion. In contrast to iMLL-AF9, iMLL-ENL preferentially transformed HSC rather than more committed progenitor cells. In - terestingly, transformation by iMLL-ENL was dependent of the fusion exceeding endogenous Mll mRNA levels. Importantly, MLL-ENL mRNA levels exceeding MLL in leukemic blasts were also found in patients carrying this alteration. Collective - ly, these experiments suggested that transformation by MLL-ENL (and most like - ly other MLL fusions) depends on a critical fusion dose, and is significantly influ - enced by cell of origin within the hematopoietic hierarchy (submitted).Dissection of critical cellular and molecular mechanisms of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to develop novel therapeutic strategies Group Members Marwa Almosailleakh (PhD Student) Dr. Laurent Brault Student)* Sabine Juge-Ehret (Technician) Katharina Leonards (PhD Student) Max Alberto Mendez Lopez (PhD Student) Maria Riera Piqu\u00e9 * left during period J\u00fcrg Schwaller Department of Biomedicine, Division of Hematology 2014-2016Fig. 1: Modeling of MLL-AF9-driven AML of different cellular origins in mice revealed striking similarities with the hu - man disease.

Invasive LT-HSC-derived AML was characterized by high expression levels of Evi1 and Erg, and by an EMT-like gene expression signature with direct induction of Zeb1. Interestingly, high expression levels of EVI1 and ERG also characterized AML patients with poor outcome suggesting a similar impact of the cellular origin on the biology of the disease in mouse and man.

Report 2014-2016Previous melanoma immunotherapy clinical trials by our group have emphasized the difficulties inherent in the generation and expansion of memory cells specif - ic for human tumor associated antigens. Indeed, central memory CD8+ T-cells (TCM) have been shown to play key roles in protective immunity against infectious agents, cancer immunotherapy, and in adoptive treatments of malignant and vi - ral diseases. However, CD8+ TCM generation is challenging and usually requires during the - erated a replication incompetent CD40 ligand-expressing recombinant vaccinia vi - rus (rVV40L) to promote the differentiation of human na\u00efve CD8+ T cells into TCM specific for viral and tumor associated antigens. In the absence of CD4+ T cells, a single in vitro stimulation of na\u00efve CD8+ T cells by rVV40L-infected non-profession - al CD14+ antigen presenting cells promotes the rapid generation of viral or tumor associated antigen specific CD8+ T-cells displaying TCM phenotype and func - tions. These observations strongly support the use of similar reagents for clinical immunization and adoptive immunotherapy purposes. Chronic inflammation plays decisive roles in cancer progression by powerfully shaping tumor microenviron - ment. In particular, tumor infiltration by myeloid cells has frequently been associ - ated with poor prognosis in different types of cancer, including murine models of CRC. Granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor pow - activator of myeloid cells. We have observed that GM-CSF induces in human macrophages the ability to inhibit the proliferation of CRC cells in vitro . Important - ly, GM-CSF gene is expressed to significantly higher extents in CRC than in autol - ogous healthy mucosa. By using a large (>1200) number of sporadic CRC speci - mens, accounting for >85% of human CRC, we have observed that in mismatch repair proficient (MMRp) cancers GM-CSF production by CRC cells is associat - ed with improved survival in univariate and multivariate analyses. The favorable prognostic relevance of GM-CSF production by CRC cells is particularly evident in MMRp cancers where poor CD8+ T cell infiltration is detectable. These data un - derline specificities of human CRC immunobiology and indicate that prognostic significance of defined tumor micro-environmental features critically depends on tumor types and related anatomic districts. These data also urge the development of innovative in vitro models, utilizing human cells and sharing critical features of tumor progression in vivo . To address these issues we have used a perfused bio - reactor to sustain CRC cell growth and to test established treatment regimens in an in-vitro setting as compared to normal cell culture or xenografts. By culturing HT29 cells in 3D on collagen scaffolds under direct perfusion tissue-like struc - tures characterized by a heterogeneous pattern of proliferating cells and apoptot - ic cells could be successfully established closely resembling xenografts generat - ed in immunodeficient mice. Upon perfusion, homogeneous seeding on scaffolds could be obtained and significantly higher numbers of tumour cells were recov - ered, as compared to static 3D cultures. Following treatment with clinically rele - vant concentrations of 5-FU no effect on numbers of cells cultured in 3D perfusion and as xenografts was observed, as compared to a marked inhibition of 2D cul - tures. Importantly, in perfused cultures we observed marginal effects on the ex - pression of BCL-2, TRAF1, FLIP apoptosis resistance genes, as compared to a sig - nificant down regulation in 2D cell cultures and 3D static conditions. Accordingly, a combination of ABT-199, a new clinically approved BCL-2 inhibitor, and 5-FU in - duced additional cytostatic and cytotoxic effects in 3D perfused but not in 2D cell cultures.

Report 2014-2016Fig. 1: A) Typically, PI3K inhibitors (PI3Ki) block the cell cycle in G1, and act cytostatic. When treated with a PI3Ki (here PQR309), cancer cells in mitosis can mitotic arrest with an accumulation of pHistone H3 positive cells, which accumulate in G2/M, condense nuclear DNA, and/or undergo apoptosis. At the same time cellular microtubules are disrupted.In normal tissue, cell fate is controlled by surface receptors triggering signaling events at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Here, phosphoinositide 3-ki - nases (PI3K) produces PIP3 to initiate a kinase cascade culminating in the acti - vation of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). PI3Ks controls cell growth, proliferation, survival and migration. In cancer cells, multiple inputs trigger a continuous activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway. PI3Ks are therefore considered as valuable drug targets in oncology and inflammatory disease. BKM120 is one of the clinically most advanced PI3K inhibitors (PI3Ki), is currently in phase III clinical trials and listed in more than 80 clinical trials in oncology. In the framework of PI3K and mTOR-targeting projects supported by the CTI, we have elucidated the mechanism of a BKM120-mediated cell cycle arrest (Bohnacker et al. 2015). Interestingly, BKM120 increased mitotic markers such as phospho-His - tone H3 in a large cancer cell panel, suggesting that the drug acted by a mech - anism that is distinct from other PI3K inhibitors (Fig. 1). Typically, PI3K inhibitors such as PQR309, and GDC0941 and GDC0980, arrest cancer cells in the G1/S cell cycle phase. BKM120 was found to interact with tubulin and PI3K. To further mon - itor the two inherent biological actions of BKM120 we investigated structurally re - lated molecules and generated a potent BKM120-derived microtubule (MT) dis - ruptor MTD147. This chemical split of PI3K and MT activities inherent to BKM120 allowed a functional profiling associating BKM120 with mitotic arrest and Histone H3 phosphorylation. Interestingly, the BKM120-induced mitotic arrest was detect - ed below reported AUC0-24 levels currently used in clinical studies. This suggests that there is no valid therapeutic window for PI3K inhibition without interference with MT stability.

PIQUR Therapeutics, a spin-off company of the University of Basel, has successfully complet - ed phase I clinical trials with its lead compound PQR309. PQR309 is a potent, brain penetrable pan-PI3K inhibitor with moderate action on mTOR kinase activity. Phase II studies have been initial - ized in lymphomas and solid tumors. A first drug combination trial using PQR309 with eribulin, a mi - crotubule-depolymerizing agent, has been initiat - ed in a collaboration with Eisai in triple negative breast cancer patients (piqur.com; clinicaltrials. gov). Support from the Swiss CTI spurred research at University of Basel to generate a number of nov - el lead compounds targeting PI3K and mTOR with defined selectivity and pharmacological profiles. Three compounds, a penetrant pan-PI3K/ mTOR inhibitor, a highly potent pan-PI3K inhibitor and a very selective and brain accessible mTOR inhibitor, have already passed into preclinical val - idation, proof of principle, toxicity and preclinical safety studies. Besides the potential therapeutic value, the produced drug portfolio will provide op - portunities to evaluate the biology of tumor drug resistance to PI3K/mTOR inhibition, and to devel - op tools for chemical genetics approaches. Fig. 2: A) The manipulation of the site of action of proteins of interest (POI) is important in lipid signaling research. The bi-functional chemical-inducer of dimerization (CID) MeNV-HaXS is SNAP- and HaloTag-fused POIs. The covalent association of two tagged proteins can be reversed by il - lumination, where a 360 nm light pulse cleaves the MeNV group (Zimmermann et al. 2014). B) To improve the spec - tral properties of the CID, novel photocleavable molecules were produced: Cou-HaXS can be efficiently and rapidly cleaved at 405 nm, and is well suited for FRAP micros - copy setups. The depicted TIRF images of HeLa cell plas - ma membrane demonstrate how a laser pulse within the highlighted section (broken lines) can dissociate a target protein (here SNAP-GFP) in a spatially controlled fashion from a membrane anchor (Halo-mCherry-CAAX). The lat - eral membrane diffusion of the CID-linked proteins is moni - tored by the recovery of the fluorescence intensities after the FRAP pulse.A combination of chemical, cell biology and X-ray crystallography studies further elucidated why BKM120 blocked MT polymerization: BKM120 binds to the colchi - cine-binding pocket on -tubulin. Binding depends on the orientation of BKM120's core pyrimidine ring. Moreover, biochemical, cellular and structural data suggests that the initially proposed orientation of BKM120 in PI3K is inverted. The in depth analysis of BKM120's activities mechanistically defined its dominant anti-tumor activity, and explains why PQR309 with a triazine core lacks the off-target effect on MT (Bohnacker et al. 2015). The above structure function study also provided starting points for the produc - tion of very potent PQR309 follow-up molecules and mTOR kinase-selective inhib - itors (which entered the drug development program of PIQUR Therapeutics (Beau - fils et al. 2016; see sidebar), and potent microtubule polymerisation blockers with novel pharmaceutical characteristics. Altogether, the studies provide access to improved rational drug trials in drug combination studies, when combining PI3Ki and MT targeting drugs. We have a long standing interest in localized lipid signalling, as this is crucial to PI3K signalling in cancer and inflammation. In the ESF-funded project \"Tracking of Phosphoinositide Pools - Key Signaling Components in Cell Migration and Polar - isation\", we have initiated the generation of novel tools to control subcellular sig - nalling enzyme localization. To be able to dock signalling enzymes to any location in a cell, we have produced so-called chemical-inducers of dimerization (CIDs). These molecules have two reactive groups that specifically form covalent bonds with proteins fused to a SNAP- or a HaloTag (Fig. 2). When one of the proteins is targeted to a cell organelle with a suitable anchor, a target protein can then be as - sociated with this organelle by the addition of a cell permeable CID. To make this association reversible, photocleavable groups were incorporated into the CIDs. This resulted in molecules that allow the dynamic, time resolved and localized dis - sociation of target enzymes from selected membranes (Zimmermann et al. 2014, example in Fig. 2B). photocleavable chemical inducer of di - merization.

The direct connection to the medical oncology division allows translating preclinical discoveries into early clin - ical trials. 1. New combinatorial approaches to enhance cancer immunotherapy A major goal is to develop rational combinatorial approaches that combine the unique ability of immunotherapy to mediate long-term responses and the sig - nificant benefits of cytotoxic and targeted anti-cancer therapies. There are now emerging experiences that the latter may turn immune-resistant tumors into tu - mors sensitive to immune-mediated killing by re-activating pathways within tu - mors responsible for its recognition and/or killing by immune effector cells. We discovered that microtubule-depolymerizing agents (MDA) such as maytansins and dolastatins are capable of inducing the full spectrum of maturational chang - es in dendritic cells (DCs), thereby potentiating the tumor-specific T cell response in vivo . These findings provided novel insights into the therapeutic activity of anti - body drug conjugates including T-DM1 (antibody against HER2 coupled to MDA) in eliciting anti-tumor immunity in patients with early breast cancer and a HER2- expressing orthotopic tumor model. Importantly, the combined treatment of T-DM1 with checkpoint inhibitors (antibodies targeting the immune checkpoints CTLA-4 and PD1) induced the rejection of established tumors due to engagement of both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms. This finding led to the initiation of trials in HER2-positive breast cancer that use the combination of T-DM1 and checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD1/PD-L1 axis.

Mechanisms of immune cell dysfunction in cancer We are interested in dissecting mechanisms underlying T cell dysfunction in can - cer patients to improve cancer immunotherapy by identifying synergistic agents and optimizing patient selection. Recent work has elucidated the cumulative ex - pression of inhibitory receptors as a hallmark of dysfunctional T cells and tumor progression, in particular in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Of note, those inhibitory signals largely impact on the efficacy of treatment-induced immune acti- vation and tumor cell killing. Moreover, changes of the glycosylation within the tu - mor microenvironment are investigated and recent work suggests that the cancer- associated upregulation of sialic acid-containing glycans can engage inhibitory re - ceptors such as Siglecs and significantly inhibit the anti-tumor immune response. 3. Development of anti-cancer strategies in early clinical trials Our clinical research focus lies on the investigation and development of treatment strategies, targets and delivery platforms in early trials in medical oncology. In col - laboration with the Clinical Research Center (CCRC) at our division, we have pro - grams ongoing to create a pipeline of agents that can move into the clinic. In trans - lational projects, we aim at defining predictors of therapeutic responses and at understanding the mechanism of treatment responses and resistance. In addition, we define novel tumor antigens by analyzing the autoreactive antibody repertoire. The clinical programs include cancer vaccines, immune modulatory drugs, mono - clonal antibodies, and nanoparticles such as immunoliposomes. In collaboration with the Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, a program is centered on radiopeptides against peptide receptors. In addition, to optimally develop novel anti-cancer agents, in particular immunotherapeutics, in vitro organotypic assays are performed to study how these compounds modulate immune effector popula - tions in freshly excised tumor tissue, thus closely mimicking the situation found in cancer patients. This program is performed in collaboration with the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Gynecology and Pathology. 136 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016During evolution an immune system has been generated for protection against life- threatening infections. However, the high versatility and complexity of the immune system also harbors the danger of developing various diseases like immunodefi - ciency's and autoimmune diseases. These diseases most often arise as a conse - quence of defects in the development of the immune system and/or as a conse - quence of aberrant immune reactions. The focal area (FA) Immunology of the Department of Biomedicine currently com - prises 27 research groups of which about half of the groups concentrate their re - search on more translational questions whereas the other half is tackling more basic questions. Recently the FA Immunology founded the University of Basel Im - munology Community group (uBICO) with the goal to further strengthen the inter - actions between the immunology related research groups within Basel and to im - prove the training of PhD students of the FA Immunology. Currently members of uBICO are in charge of organizing the weekly immunomeetings, the annual retreat of the research groups within the FA Immunology, the PhD-club in which PhD stu - dents of the FA Immunology discuss their projects and the invitation of 3-4 distin - guished guest speakers per year. Of the more translational research groups within the FA Immunology, 6 concen - trate their studies on a better understanding of the pathogenesis of various auto - immune diseases which include, SLE, Arthritis, Diabetes and MS. One group is studying primary immunodeficiencies and especially the link to the development of autoimmunity. Viruses constitute a life-threatening challenge especially in individuals with prima - ry or secondary immunodeficiencies. Four research groups within the Department focus their efforts on the immune system's early recognition of viral infection and ways by which an anti-viral response can be enhanced. Also fungal infections can have devastating effects especially in immuno compromised individuals. The fac - tors that determine the risk of getting such an infection and the potential therapy of these patients is the research focus of one group within the Department. For a long time it is known that vaccination is the method of choice to prevent in - fectious diseases. However, it has been recognized that not all individuals are able to mount a protective immuneresponse upon vaccination. One group within the FA Immunology is using a systems biology approach in order to improve vaccina - tion strategies. Several groups within the FA Immunology concentrate their research on various aspects of the development of the immune system. Dendritic cell subpopulations are key players in the initiation of various immune responses. One group is concen - trating on the development of the different dendritic cell subsets with special em - phasis on the role of transcription factors in these processes. Yet another group is focusing its research on the molecular mechanisms that guide lymphocyte devel - opment. The instructive and/or the permissive roles of cytokines and the involve - ment of various transcription factors in these developmental processes are the main research focuses of this group.

Report 2014-2016Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are T cells that can inhibit the function of other T cells and therefore are thought to be effective in the treatment of various diseases and could prevent organ rejection upon transplantation. Two groups within the FA Im - munology study the development of Tregs and also address their potential thera - peutic usage in different experimental models. The thymus is the organ in which T cell development and education takes place. The thymus as an organ is rather complex and contains various epithelial subsets that play a crucial role in T cell development and education. One group of the FA Immunology is studying the development of these different epithelial subsets and the consequences of impairment in these developmental processes on the emerg - ing T cell repertoires. Innate lymphocytes (ILC's) show many similarities to T cells including the produc - tion of certain cytokines and the requirement of certain transcription factors for their development. However, unlike lymphocytes these cells do not express an an - tigen specific receptor. Over the years it has been well established that these ILC's play a crucial role in the proper functioning of the immune system. The requirement for one of these in lymph node organogenesis is perfect example of this. The re - search of one of the groups in the Department is focused on the development and functions of these ILC's. T cells in our body play a crucial role in the protection against a wide range of pathogens. However, their differentiation and activation into the various effector functions is not yet fully understood. One group within the FA Immunology is using continuous time-lapse imaging combined with flow cytometry and gene expres - sion profiling to address T cell activation in great detail. In the last years it has been recognized that metabolic pathways play a crucial role in T cell function and longevity and that impairments in these pathways can un - derlie the development of various diseases. Up to now the signaling pathways that regulate the metabolic status in T cells are only poorly defined. The research fo - cus of one of the groups within the FA Immunology is the unraveling of these sig - naling pathways with the major goal to identify new therapeutic strategies for pa - tients with impairments in these. Classical T cells recognize with their / TCR peptides bound to polymorphic MHC class I or class II molecules. However, over the years it became evident that a very significant number of non-classical T cells are also present in our body. These T cells recognize non-peptide antigens like lipids, glycolipids and small me - tabolites of microbial origin bound to MHC related molecules like CD1 and MR1. Two groups within the Department are studying the characteristics of these T cell in great detail and also address their potential role in diseases including infections. Taken together a wide variety of basic translational immunological research activ - ities are ongoing in the Department. Moreover a network of laboratory based re - search with strong links to clinical medicine and other institutes ofthe University of Basel has been established.138 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a primary vasculitis of unknown etiology. Disease man - ifests as an inflammatory syndrome and ischemic symptoms resulting from steno - sis of inflamed arteries. There is strong evidence that T cells play an important role in disease induction and/or maintenance. The pathogenesis remains, however, un - known. One of the goals of our lab is to unravel the events leading to disease and more specifically the immunological target of the T cells. Characterization of the immunological milieu and the T cell compartment in GCA Using multiparameter flow cytometry immunophenotyping and multiplexed cyto - kine measurements we determined the immunological milieu in 42 study subjects (16 GCA patients at diagnosis, 13 disease controls and 13 non-inflammatory, age- matched controls). We identified IL-6 as the main cytokine differentiating between GCA and controls (Fig. 1). Similarly, the IL-8 was higher in GCA, while the other cy - tokines showed no significant difference to controls. This finding nicely fits the clin - ical data showing good response of treatment with an anti-IL6 receptor antagonist. Using multi-color flow cytometry we confirmed that T regulatory cells seemed to be reduced in GCA compared to controls. Th1 T cells were comparable between the groups, while high IL-17-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were more frequent in GCA compared to all controls (Fig. 2). However, the majority of GCA patients had normal frequencies of Th17 T cells, suggesting that distinct patient subgroups might exist. As part of the analysis between the clinical presentation and immuno - logical data we are currently investigating this. Determination of the T cell repertoire in GCA As next steps, we aim to determine the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in patients with GCA. Specifically, we want to test whether the T cells in the inflamed tissue of GCA patients or self-reactive T cells in the peripheral blood are oligoclonally ex - panded. This information can be used to screen for the immunological target of the T cells. The role of autoantibodies targeting 14-3-3 protein isoforms in GCA A recent study suggested that antibodies against isoforms of the so-called 14-3- 3 protein (an intracellular regulatory protein) may be useful as biomarkers in large- vessel avsculitis (LVV), i.e. GCA and Takayasu's This study was done in patients with aortic aneurysm due to LVV, i.e. those with a late complication of vas - culitis. Here, we performed an analysis to assess the presence of these Autoan - tibodies 'at GCA diagnosis'. If present they would have the high potential as bio - markers/autoantibodies for the diagnosis and monitoring of treatment effects as in other autoimmune diseases (e.g. systemic lupus, ANCA vasculitis). To test this, antibodies 14-3-3 ( , , and ) were measured in 51 LVV patients, and 42 controls (including non-inflammatory and inflammatory diseases), using an multiplexed bead-based immunoassay and immunoprecipitation assays. The positive threshold was defined based on values found in young healthy con - trols. Anti-14-3-3 IgG antibodies were compared between GCA patients and con - trols to assess their diagnostic performance as a biomarker. Antibodies against all three 14-3-3 isoforms were detected in GCA patients as well as in age-matched inflammatory and non-inflammatory controls. Amongst LVV patients, detection of antibodies targeting 14-3-3 and was associated with more severe disease, spe - cifically stroke or aortitis. Thus, we could conclude that detection of antibodies against 14-3-3 proteins at the time of GCA diagnosis is not disease-specific.

Influen - za vaccine response profiles are affected Connection to Clinical Practice PD Dr. Thomas Daikeler and Prof. Dr. Christoph Hess Division of Rheumatology and Department of Internal Medicine The Basler Giant Cell Arteritis Cohort Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most prevalent of the primary vasculitis syndromes with an increas - ing disease incidence. Patients typically present with constitutional symptoms, headache, and a systemic inflammatory syndrome. To date thera - py of GCA is based largely on steroids, and guided by parameters reflecting disease activity only par - tially, as indicated by recent imaging-studies. Fur - thermore, intensity and duration of steroid thera - py remain a matter of debate, and no consensus exists in defining remission. Both GCA itself and the steroid based therapy are associated with sig - nificant morbidity. Improving diagnostic accuracy and monitoring of disease activity thus would be of great importance. To study these clinical prob - lems, we established a prospective interdisciplin - ary cohort of patients with GCA. Relevant clinical data, laboratory parameters, serum and periph - eral blood mononuclear cells from all patients are collected at longitudinal time-points. Vascular dis - ease activity is assessed using new technologies such as color-coded duplex ultrasound and posi - tron emission tomography. Thereby we aim at in - tegrating clinical data, imaging studies, and ex - tended immunological and histomorphological assessments for a more detailed understand - ing of the immunopathogenesis of GCA. This may help to (i) further develop precise, ideally non-in - vasive, tools to diagnose and monitor disease ac - tivity, and (ii) generate strategies towards interfer - ing with specific pathways associated with disease activity and/or complications.presence at high levels in LVV with stroke, aortitis and - in a previous study - with aneurysm formation may indicate their value as potential biomarkers for extensive large vessel inflammation.

Report 2014-2016One of our research interests is the role of macrophage polarization in metabolic disease such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Polarization of macrophages is char - acterized by their inflammatory activation and metabolism status. Gaining knowl - edge about the polarization of macrophages is crucial for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of metabolic disease. Deliberate modulation of macrophage po - larization could help to improve glycemic control. Selectively targeting increased glycolysis has already been suggested for anti-cancer therapy. However, it has not yet been studied in metabolic diseases. Our aim is to target macrophage polariza - tion and thereby improve glycemic control. As a potential pharmacologic agent to target macrophage polarization, we assess the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib. Imatinib is approved for the treatment of multiple cancers, most notably for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The primary target of TKIs is the constitutively active tyrosine kinase fusion protein created by chromosome translocation in CML. Imatinib has been shown to suppress aerobic glycolysis in leukemia cells and to drive polarization of tumor-as - sociated macrophages from a pro- to anti-inflammatory phenotype. Interestingly, improvement in glycemic control has been described as a concomitant phenom - enon in diabetic patients treated with TKIs. Thus, based on these known effects of TKIs on immune cells and glycemia, we assess the effects of imatinib on mac - rophage polarization and whether such changes go along with improved glycemic control. The aim is to find ways to deliberately modulate the level of immune cell polarization and subsequently glycemic control. Moreover, we are also interested in the gastrointestinal immune system's role in mediating systemic inflammation in metabolic disease. Specifically, we are aim - ing to decipher the interplay between food intake, gut microbiota, the intestinal immune system, and systemic inflammation. Unhealthy \"dysbalances\" between these players are associated with a broad spectrum of diseases including met - abolic disease. Intestinal immune cells could serve as crucial \"sensors\" of envi - ronmental factors (food intake, environmental toxins or altered microbiota) for the host's immune system. We are interested in how intestinal macrophages respond to different environmental stressors. Our aim is to better understand initial chang - es in immune cell activation that eventually mediate and maintain enhanced sys - temic inflammation in metabolic disease.Immune cell activation in metabolic disease Group Members Dr. Angela Bosch (Postdoc) Theresa Rohm (PhD Student) Shefaa AlAsfoor (PhD Student) * left during report periodClaudia Cavelti-Weder Department of Biomedicine Division of Endocrinology Diabetes and Metabolism University Hospital Basel Translational DiabetesMetabolic Timper K, Seelig M, GT, J, Saudan P, Donath MY, Bachmann MF.

Report 2014-2016Antigen recognition is a central event in immune response and the immune system has evolved a series of receptors, which recognize a variety of antigens and acti - vate specific immune cells. T lymphocytes express membrane-bound T cell recep - tors (TCR) that recognize complexes composed of antigen-presenting molecules and antigens. In addition to small peptides, T cells may also recognize lipids, gly - colipids, and small metabolites of endogenous or microbial origin. Our studies in humans revealed that these latter T cells are as abundant as peptide-specific ones. Our goal is to understand the role of non-peptide-specific T cells in the immune re - sponse, and their participation in diseases. Our studies cover the following three main areas. The first one is lipid-specific T cell immunity. Our aim is understanding the mechanisms leading to lipid recogni - tion by T cells, how lipid antigens interact with the lipid-presenting CD1 molecules, and how lipid-specific T cells participate in the recognition of tumor cells (in hu - man cancer), of mycobacteria-infected cells (in tuberculosis) and of self lipids (in autoimmune diseases). We have investigated the mechanisms how complex lipids are processed by lipases and hydrolases, how the lipid antigens are transported within the antigen-presenting cells, how they are loaded on CD1 molecules. These studies led to the establishment of novel anti-bacterial vaccines taking advantage of lipid-specific T cells providing help to B cells secreting sugar-specific antibod - ies. We have also identified novel tumor-associated lipid antigens, which will be further exploited in leukaemia immunotherapy. The second type of studies investigate the biology of TCR cells. We identified butyrophilin 3A1 as the relevant molecule for the activation of human T cells ex - pressing the TCR V 9-V2 heterodimers by microbial and self-metabolites. These metabolites accumulate in some tumor cells and specifically stimulate TCR V 9- V2 cells. We established a human TCR V 9-V2 transgenic mouse model that is being utilized to explore the anti-tumor function of this T cell population. The third type of studies focus on T cells restricted to the MHC-class-I-related mol - ecule, MR1. These T cells are stimulated by metabolites generated in the vitamin B2 pathway and are called mucosal-associated T (MAIT) cells as they preferential - ly localize within mucosal tissues, liver and skin. We found that the TCR gene rep - ertoire of these cells is remarkably oligoclonal both in peripheral blood and liver, in - ferring preferential stimulation of selected T cell clones in vivo . Unique aminoacids were detected in the CDR3 regions of skin-derived MR1-restricted T cells, possi - bly due to selective expansion following stimulation with metabolites produced by the skin-resident microflora. Biochemical purification revealed a complex array of stimulatory antigens, including vitamin B2-unrelated ones. In order to understand the functional role of MR1-restricted T cells, systematic and sequential studies are ongoing. First, by single cell transcriptomics analyses of MAIT cells we discovered functionally different cell populations, whose roles in liver and gut diseases are being investigated. Secondly, by multidimensional flow- cytometry we identified the phenotypic correlates of these distinct populations. To this aim, panels of monoclonal antibodies have been optimized to allow the char - acterization of T cells within human healthy and diseased tissues. Thirdly, individ - ual cell populations are being investigated after sorting, cloning and in vitro ac - tivation. These studies are revealing how tissue-resident MR1-restricted T cells specialize in their functions and participate in disease evolution.Adaptive and innate T cells specific for non-peptidic antigens: the diseases' perspective Group Members Lena Angman (Technician) Salvatore Calogero (PhD Student) Dr. Marco Cavallari* (Postdoc) Dr. Pauline (Administrative Assistant) Dr. (Postdoc) Dr. Marco during report periodGennaro De Libero Department of Biomedicine Tumorimmunology University Hospital Basel Experimental ImmunologyT .

In previous studies we demonstrated that the metabolic stress evoked by high glucose and saturated fatty acids (contained in animal fat) may in - duce death of the insulin producing beta-cells of the islets. Subsequently we iden - tified interleukin-1 beta as a key mediator of these deleterious effects and showed that it is produce by human beta-cells in type 2 diabetes. We published several additional studies supporting the concept that this mechanism leads to an inflam - matory process and underlies the failure to produce sufficient amount of insulin in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of this we initiated clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes that vindicates this hypothesis and opens the way for a causative treat - ment. Furthermore we identified a new endocrine loop by showing that elevated IL-6 mediates a cross talk between insulin sensitive tissues, L cells and pancreat - ic islets to adapt to changes in insulin. Finally, we uncovered the first monogenic form of type 1 diabetes. This research has contributed to the concept that the in - nate immune system is part of the regulation of metabolism. Our ongoing studies aim at understanding the physiological role of the immune system in metabolism. The general objective is to uncover mechanisms on how the innate immune system contributes to the adaption of pancreatic islet func - tion under various physiological (postprandial and pregnancy) and stressful (obe - sity and diabetes) situations with a focus on macrophages derived IL-1beta in the postprandial stimulation of insulin; Beta-cell and placenta produced IL-1beta and IL-1Ra, and of alpha cell derived GLP-1 in physiology and insulitis; IL-33 induced ILC2 stimulated insulin secretion.

Report 2014-2016Hosts and pathogens share complex interactions across scales from molecules to populations. The Applied Microbiology Research group aims to understand these various levels of interactions by the identification of key factors involved using a systems biological approach (Fig. 1). We want to translate our understanding of the complex host-pathogen interactions into clinical applications, such as novel ad - juvant development targeting specific signaling pathways or preventive measure - ments on a population level. As a main model to explore the host-pathogen inter - action, we use influenza vaccination and epidemic transmission. Vaccine response to influenza Influenza infection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in immu - nosuppressed hosts, such as patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Although vaccination is the preventive strategy, many vaccinated patients fail to mount a protective humoral immunity. Along with transplant related factors such as time after transplantation, immune reconstitution and graft-versus-host diseas - es, the genetic background of each patient also plays a crucial role in modulating and building seroprotection against influenza (and every other pathogen). Currently, we are exploring the impact of genetic polymorphisms (single nucleo - tide polymorphisms, SNPs) on the interferon signaling pathway to influenza-spe - cific humoral vaccine responses in a multi-center vaccine trial. SNPs in the In - terferon (IFN)-lambda pathway may influence the way B-cells encounter vaccine antigens. Alternative variants of IFN-lambda (IFN lambda 1-3) show different bind - ing affinities to the receptor (Fig. 2A). This is mainly dependent on a few amino acid differences at the binding interaction site (Fig. 2B). B-cells show a signifi - cant response to members of the IFN-lambda family (IFNL1-3) (Fig. 2C). Influenza vaccine recipients might therefore, based on their genetic background in the In - terferon lambda genes show important variability in the vaccine responsiveness. The immunological data is computationally modeled in collaboration with the D- BSSE (ETHZ, Prof. Stelling). This may allow the development vac - cine strategies.Group Members Mohammedyaseen Syed- Madeleine Vollmer* (Technician)Elisa Roth (MD Student) Daniela Lang (Technician) * left during report periodTowards a system understanding of immune responses, personalized vaccination strategies, and pathogen transmissionPathogen Transmission .

Vaccination is the key element in the preventive strategy. We aim to understand the clinical and immunological fac - tors associated with vaccine failure in this patient population and to identify clinical and immunolog - ical markers associated with vaccine outcomes after transplantation. This should help to guide a vaccine protocol and to improve the overall out - come. We have conducted a multi-center vaccine trial (Basel, Zurich, Berne, Lucerne, Aarau, and Ticino), building a biobank including immune cells, serum and DNA at various time-points post-vaccine to further explore the vaccine response at multiple levels. We are currently developing computation - al models to identify high-risk patients and predict vaccine outcomes. Such models could also be adapted for other pathogens with available vac - cines such as S. pneumonia and N. meningitidis. Influenza transmission in an urban population Influenza transmission is highly complex and dependent on multiple factors such as population density, age distributions, and individual and herd immunity. Al - though the severity of a flu season can be described with the basic reproduction number (R0, Fig. 3A), which serves as a surrogate for transmission efficacy, it re - mains unclear where and in what context influenza transmission actually happens. In an interdisciplinary and inter-institutional collaboration with the Human Geog - raphy and Center for Primary Health Care (both University of Basel), Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology and Emergency Medicine (both University Hospital Basel), Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Emergency Medicine (both Chil - dren's Hospital University of Basel) and the Computational Evolution Research Group (Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich), we aim to explore the influenza transmission in the City of Basel. Using whole genome sequencing, a technology which has been established for a broad series of pathogens (Fig. 3B), we will determine phylogenetic relationships of influenza samples and transmission pathways. The whole genome data will be used to develop a model to identify where and in what context influenza transmis - sion is most efficient. Besides influenza, such models can be adapted to other in - fectious diseases. This will provide important information to identify and develop novel preventive counter measurements.

Report 2014-2016Accumulating evidence suggests that the gut microbiome (i.e. gut resident bacte - ria) is involved in the pathogenesis of various liver diseases. Interestingly, a spe - cialized T cell subset belonging to the family of innate-like lymphocytes is highly abundant both in the gut mucosa and the liver. These mucosal-associated invari - ant T (MAIT) cells respond to bacterial metabolites produced in the vitamin B2 (riboflavin) synthesis pathway, what places them at a central position in the im - munological gut-liver axis. Antigen presentation to MAIT cells involves the high - ly conserved MHC-related protein MR1. Since these MR1-restricted T cells were identified in the liver only recently, little is known about their function in healthy and diseased liver. Our aim is to elucidate the role of MAIT cells in selected liver diseases, including autoimmune liver diseases, steatohepatitis and viral hepatitis, and in the fibrogen - ic response in the liver. Our studies address a largely unexplored area of human liv - er physiology and pathology. Due to their location and high abundance in the liver, and their responsiveness to bacterial products and various cytokines, we hypoth - esize that liver-resident MAIT cells play a role in the pathogenesis of liver diseases and that changes in MAIT abundance, activation status, and cytokine expression profile influence disease development and outcome. Our study has three main goals: 1. To characterize liver-resident MAIT cells using patient-derived liver biopsies and blood samples. Using both cellular and molecular approaches, we are deter - mining MAIT cell location and abundance in the liver and blood in different path - ological conditions, and analyzing their functional and transcriptional profiles. 2. To determine how the gut microbiome influences MAIT cells present in the liver, gut, and blood. By analyzing tissue and stool samples from patients with liver diseases, we aim at establishing whether changes in bacterial composition par - allel changes in the functionality of MAIT cells. 3. To identify and characterize interactions of MAIT cells within the liver environ - ment. In cell culture experiments, performed with distinct purified subpopula - tions of primary human liver cells, we are defining the cellular and cytokine mi - lieu contributing to MAIT cell activation. The anticipated outcome of our experiments is identification of disease-specific changes and patterns that will allow us to draw conclusions about how MAIT cells influence liver physiology and pathology.Characterization of mucosal-associated invariant T cells in liver diseases Group Martin Lett (PhD Student) Magdalena Filipowicz Sinnreich Cells Protein MR1149 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016Connection to Clinical Practice Most liver diseases are characterized by an inflam - matory response in the liver, driven by numerous triggering conditions, such as exposure to alcohol, excess fat, medication, infection or autoimmunity. A prolonged inflammatory state leads to progres - sive fibrosis that can result in liver cirrhosis asso - ciated with serious complications including loss of liver function or development of hepatocellular car - cinoma. To date little is known about the function of MAIT cells in healthy and diseased liver and very few studies have addressed a role of these cells in human liver tissue and using primary human ma - terial.

Report 2014-2016Fig. 1: Innate cell effector functions.The innate lymphoid cell (ILC) family has emerged as the first line of defense against various pathogens. In addition, ILCs regulate tissue homeostasis and re - pair through the release of cytokines. Based on effector cytokines and transcrip - tional regulation they can be divided into three populations: group 1 ILCs, group 2 ILCs and group 3 ILCs including lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells (Fig. 1). Stud - ies in mouse and men clearly demonstrate that each subset has defined immune functions that depend on the tissue localization, type of activation and disease sta - tus. The molecular mechanisms underlying the tissue-specific regulation of ILCs are not fully understood. In particular, the exposure to environmental signals from commensals and nutrition factors has an effect on local expansion and activa - tion of ILC subsets. Our work focuses on understanding the developmental re - quirements for generating ILCs and for regulating their activation and immune re - sponse in situ. One major topic of investigation is assessing the molecular pathways that coordi - nate ILC development and tissue homeostasis. In recent years we have identified cytokines that act as master regulators of ILC and lymphoid tissue development. Notably, IL-7 and Flt3L are key cytokines in promoting the development of ILCs from fetal liver and common lymphoid progenitors in the bone marrow. Deletion of flt3l severely reduces the number of LTi cells in the neonatal intestine, resulting in impaired development of Peyer's patches, whereas IL-7 is critical for lymph node development (Fig. 2). In adults, both Flt3L and IL-7 regulate the generation of ILCs, although both cytokines operate at different developmental stages of progenitor cells. The complex network of cytokines in various tissues and stages of develop - ment may explain how ILCs can further mature in peripheral tissues. A second focus of our research is the regulation of adaptive immune responses by group 3 ILCs. ILC3s respond to various \"danger signals\" with a specific profile of cytokines, which contribute to T cell polarization and activation of innate immune Innate immune regulation and lymphoid tissue induction Group Members Dr. Anne Baerenwaldt (Postdoc) Stefan (Technician) Claudia G\u00e4rtner-Pelham* (Technician) Edit Lehmann Neu* (PhD Student) Annick Dr. Gleb Turchinovich (Postdoc) Dr. Nicole Von Burg (Postdoc) Julia Wagner* (Undergraduate Student) * left during report periodDaniela Finke Department of Biomedicine Immunology University .

We have reported that ILC3s have the capacity to internalize antigens (Fig. 3) and to present MHC-peptide ligands to T cells. Interestingly, according to their tis - sue of origin, splenic and intestinal (lamina propria (LP)) ILC3s have opposite anti - gen-presenting functions. Comparable to dendritic cells, splenic ILC3s are able to undergo a process of maturation (activation) upon IL-1 stimulation and induce an - tigen specific T-cell proliferation. By contrast, LP ILC3s lack co-stimulatory mole - cules after IL-1 stimulation and induce only very weak T-cell proliferation. In addi - tion, a role in the negative regulation of T-cell responses against the gut microbiota was assigned to LP ILC3s. Hence, differences in the antigen-presenting function of splenic and LP ILC3s are that the former could be considered as immunogenic and the latter tolerogenic. The genetic analysis of both subsets has demonstrated subset-specific transcriptional profiles under steady-state and inflammatory con - ditions. We could further demonstrate that ILC-T cell interactions are bi-direction - al and that Ag-activated T cells provide feedback signals for activation of ILCs. Our current interest is to better understand the molecular pathways, which shape the tissue-specific ILC subset repertoire and immune function in the presence and ab - sence of an adaptive immune system. A third topic of interest is to understand the regulation of early and late effector cy - tokine responses of ILCs in health and disease. The tissue protective role of IL-22 produced by ILC3s has been well documented. On the other hand, ILC3s can con - vert into pro-inflammatory IFN -producing ILC1s (Fig. 1) thus demonstrating a high degree of plasticity. Using gene-targeting strategies we study key pathways pro - moting pro-inflammatory ILC responses in intestinal inflammation and cancer. To - gether, we use systematic molecular and functional analysis of ILC subsets in ge - netically modified mouse models and models for human inflammatory diseases to gain insights into the role of ILCs in chronic inflammation and tumor diseases. 152 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016Fig. 1: With the Basler Taubenaktion we implemented the results of our re - search into public education.A Science communication project: The \"Basler Taubenaktion 2016\" The food basis is the ecological minimum factor for the feral pigeon (Columba liv - ia) in the urban ecosystem. We could show, that a food reduction leads to a re - duction of breeding success and finally to a decrease of the population (Stock & Haag-Wackernagel 2016). Pigeon feeding enlarges the ecological capacity. Over - population as consequence of a large food basis is linked with several problems summarized as the \"pigeon problem\". This includes stress for the pigeons as well as increased risk of disease and parasite infestation. For the city dweller, the pi - geon problem mainly consists of the risk of diseases and parasite transmissions from feral pigeons to humans, as well as structural damages due to fouling with pigeon feces. In a joint project of our research group with our University (department events), the Cantonal Police Basel, Basel City Gardeners, Medical Services of the Department of Health and the Animal Protection Society Basel and Agglomeration, we imple - mented the results of our research in the \"Pigeon Action of Basel 2016\". With a mul - tilingual poster, a flyer and a brochure we tried to convince the public not to feed pigeons. Our pigeon action has been well perceived by the communication media and we hope that the impact of our public education campaign will contribute to the solution of the pigeon problem. Host finding of the pigeon tick Argas reflexus The medically and veterinary important feral pigeon tick Argas reflexus usually feeds on pigeons, but if its natural hosts are not available, it also enters dwellings to bite humans that can possibly react with severe allergic reactions. Argas reflex - us is ecologically extremely successful as a result of some outstanding morpho - logical, physiological, and ethological features. Yet, it was still unknown how the pigeon tick finds its hosts. In our study, different host stimuli such as living nest - lings as well as begging calls, body heat, smell, host breath and tick feces, were tested under controlled laboratory conditions. Of all stimuli tested, heat played an Feral pigeons and fish mobbing a worm Daniel Haag-Wackernagel Department of Biomedicine University of Basel Group Members Dr. Birte Boxler (Postdoc) Jose Lachat Biology of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016important role in host-finding. To confirm our labora - tory results under natural conditions, the heat stimu - lus was tested within a pigeon loft. Therefore, we set up electronically heated modules of the size and body temperature of pigeons and monitored the reaction of the ticks. The results showed that A. reflexus is able to find a host over short distances of only a few centime - ters. Furthermore, it finds its host by random move - ments and recognizes a host only right before direct contact is made. With our findings, we hope to con - tribute to the control of A. reflexus in infested apart - ments, both to diagnose an infestation and to perform a success monitoring after disinfestation. Mobbing strategies of a fish against a sessile annelid predator When searching for food, foraging fishes expose themselves to hidden predators. The strategies that maximize the survival of foraging fishes are not well understood. In an underwater wildlife study performed in the Lembeh Strait (Sulawesi, Indone - sia) we describe a novel type of mobbing behaviour displayed by foraging Peters' monocle bream ( Scolopsis affinis ). The the hidden sessile annelid predator Eunice aphroditois (Bobbit worm). We recognized two different behavioural roles for mobbers (i. e., initiator and subsequent partici - pants). The first individual to exhibit behaviour indicating the discovery of the Bob - bit directed more water jets, absolutely and per time unit, than the subsequent in - dividuals that joined the mobbing. We found evidence that the mobbing impacted the behaviour of the Bobbit, e. g., by inducing retraction. S. affinis individuals either mob alone or form mobbing groups. We suppose that this behaviour may provide social benefits for its conspecifics and in securing foraging territories for S. affi - nis. Our results reveal a sophisticated and complex behavioural strategy to pro - tect against a hidden predator.Fig. 2: The pigeon tick Argas reflexus finds its hosts by their body heat.

Report 2014-2016Fig. 1: NET formation and neutrophil pro-NETotic priming are augmented during preg - nancy. In vitro spontaneous NET formation by neutrophils from healthy pregnant donors over a 3 hour time course by fluorescence microscopy using Immunofluorescence staining for MPO (green) and DNA counterstain with DAPI (blue). Scale bars: 50 m.Human pregnancy is associated with a mild pro-inflammatory state, character - ized by activation of circulatory neutrophils. We have previously shown that this is disturbed in pathologies such as preeclampsia, leading to excessive neutrophil extracellular trap (NETs) formation. NETs are a rather unique innate immune tool employed by granulocytes, whereby their nuclear DNA is extruded into the extra - cellular environment to ensnare and kill a wide-array of microorganisms, ranging from bacteria, fungi to parasites. Aberrant NETs formation may damage or induce cell death of surrounding tissues, and is implicated in a number of pathologies in - cluding rheumatoid arthritis (RA), SLE, small vessel vasculitis, or coagulopathies. The underlying signal transducing pathway initiating the NETotic process involves calcium mobilization, generation of ROS by NAPDH oxidase, nuclear localization of both neutrophil elastase (NE) and citrullination of histones by peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4). The latter events contribute to chromatin unfolding, a prerequisite for efficient DNA extrusion. To date no study has examined NETs generation in normal pregnancies, nor which factors could modulate such a response during extensive period of human gesta - tion. For this reason we recently examined NETosis in all three trimesters of nor - mal pregnancy. Our data indicate that neutrophils from normal healthy pregnan - cies exhibit a distinct pro-NETotic phenotype, which increases towards term. This was characterised by an elevated response to pro-NETotic stimuli, as well as clear elevations in the expression of key signalling components required for efficient NETs formation. In our studies to ascertain which factors drive this phenotypic change, we deter - mined that G-CSF, the circulatory levels of which also increase in parallel during pregnancy, plays a key role in promoting a progressively enhanced NETotic state. We also noted that early in gestation (1st trimester), NETosis is augmented by the action of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which boosts the action of G-CSF, in promoting a primed pro-NETotic phenotype. As pregnancy advances, and the levels of hCG subside to be replaced by other steroid hormones expressed by the placenta, namely estrogen (E2) and progester - one (P4), we observed that maternal neutrophil activity is modulated in a consider - ably more complex manner. In this regard, E2 acts by being pro-NETotic. This ac - tion is antagonized by the action of P4, which serves to retain neutrophils in a highly primed state, yet hindering NETs formation. Our data suggest that the regulato - ry mechanism evoked by P4 involves a blockage of NE localisation to the nucleus, a step previously shown to be vital for efficient NETs formation. Since neutrophil NETs were originally described as an anti-pathogenic mechanism, our data would Multimodal regulation of neutrophil NETosis in pregnancy and disturbance in inflammatory conditions Group Members Giuliano Bayer* Nicole Chiodetti* Girard (Research Leader) G\u00fcnther Sch\u00e4fer (Technician) Maria Stoikou (PhD Student) Chanchal Sur Dr. (Undergraduate Student) (PhD Student) * left during report periodSinuhe Hahn Department of Biomedicine Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology University Hospital Basel Prenatal MedicineNeutrophil NETs, Pregnancy, Preeclampsia, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Inflammation 155 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016Connection to Clinical Practice Prof. Dr. med Irene H\u00f6sli, Prof. Dr. med. Olav Lapaire University Women's Hospital Basel Is NETosis altered in pregnancies complicat - ed by the \"Great Obstetrical Syndromes\"? We have previously detected aberrant NETs for - mation in pregnancies affected by preeclampsia (PE). The key aetological feature driving the devel - opment of PE is defect in placentation, specifically a failure in the transformation of maternal spiral ar - teries from a high pulsatile system to a relaxed low- pressure system. This placental aberrancy in more evident in cases with early onset PE, than those developing PE close to term. Recent studies have indicated that such placental defects are not restricted only to PE, but are also evident in intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), and as suggested by new reports, may even occur in preterm labour (PTL). Consequently, defects in spiral artery modification may be common aetiological factors in the \"great obstetrical syndromes\" (GOS) of PE, IUGR and PTL. What is unresolved is how defective placen - tation contributes to such disparate pathologies. Our query is to determined whether these defects in placentation evident in the GOS are analogous, or whether only those in early onset PE trigger an overt maternal inflammatory response. As a read-out for our study, we will examine the activity of circulatory maternal neutrophils, particularly their ability to undergo NETosis, as we have observed this to be a reliable marker for inflammation. Hence, our study may shed new light onto similarities or differences between the GOS disorders, and also contribute into the development of new screening markers. Together with Prof. Gabor Than (Budapest) we are investigating the role of PP13, a placentally de - rived galectin, in modulating neutrophil activity in PE and other GOS.

During pregnancy neutrophils lie under the increased influ - ence of cytokines, e. g. G-CSF, and sex hormones. This spe - cific milieu appears to poise the neutrophils in a stable pro- NETotic primed state. Depending on the stimulus, for instance microorganisms (MO), neutrophils react by phagocytosis or degranulation. When a different NETotic stimulus is present, such as excessive placentally derived plasma microparticles (MP) in preeclampsia (25), primed neutrophils react with overt NET release. Pro-NETotic combinations of hormones and cytokines are given in green, the most potent in bold green. Inhibitory combinations are given in red, the most potent in bold red. suggest that this operative arm of the innate immune response is highly pro-active in human pregnancy. In this manner, by being in a highly primed pro-NETotic state, such pre-activated neutrophils could react immediately to a pathogenic threat. Our data also provide new insight into how aberrancies in this system may con - tribute to the underlying aetiology of preeclampsia, in that this condition is asso - ciated with elevated levels of hCG and G-CSF, which would serve to enhance NE - Tosis. Since there are suggestions that progesterone levels may be reduced in preeclampsia, such an imbalance may trigger an enhanced pro-NETotic response, which is exacerbated by the occurrence of inflammatory placental micro-debris, abundant in this condition. On the other hand, our data may provide a novel insight into autoimmune condi - tions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, which is associated with reduced levels of progesterone, both during the menstrual cycle, as well as during pregnan - cy. Since NETosis is altered in SLE, it is possible that the negative feedback loop hindering NETs formation provided by progesterone contributes to the preeclamp - sia-like symptoms frequently observed in pregnant women affected by SLE.

Report 2014-2016Worldwide, liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer with an estimated 750'000 new cases annually. 90% of liver cancers are hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Over 95% of HCCs develop on the background of chronic liver disease and indeed, more than 80% of HCCs occur in cirrhotic livers. The most impor - tant risk factor for HCC is chronic viral hepatitis caused by infections with hepati - tis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). Both viruses are parentally transmitted and can cause chronic hepatitis. In the case of HCV infections, the innate immune system in the liver reacts within days after infection with a strong interferon (IFN) driven response. However, despite the upregulation of hundreds of IFN stimulat - ed genes (ISGs), and the recruitment of specific T cells, HCV persists in over 70% of infected individuals. In the chronic phase, ISG expression remains strongly in - duced in a subset of patients depending on the IFN lambda 4 genotype. A recently discovered genetic polymorphism of the IFN lambda gene locus determines if an individual can or can not produce IFN lambda 4 (reviewed in Heim, M.H., Bochud, P.Y., and George, J. [2016]). lambda 4 \"deltaG\" genotype have persistantly induced ISGs. Somewhat paradoxically, IFN lambda 4 produc - ers are less likely to clear the virus spontaneously, and are less likely to be cured by IFNalpha treatments (reviewed in Heim, M.H. (2013). Combined biochemical, immunological and genetic studies provide compelling evidence that IFN lambda 4 is the central regulator of the innate immune response to HCV (Terczynska-Dyla, E. et al. [2014]). In a recent transcriptome analysis we found that the IFN lambda 4 induced ISG induction is qualitatively identical to the response to therapeutically injected pegylated IFN alpha, but significantly weaker. This quantitative difference explains why the endogenous IFN system is ineffective in clearing HCV (Boldano - va et al. [2017]). The molecular mechanisms that link the IFN lambda 4 genotype with the cellular immune response to HCV are still unclear and presently one of the research focus of the Hepatology Laboratory. Hepatocellular carcinomas are characterized by very heterogenous clinical cours - es. It is widely assumed, that genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity underlies the wide variation in clinical presentation, disease progression and response to the dif - ferent treatments. Within the MERiC research consortium (an ERC synergy grant funded collaboration of 4 research groups in Basel) our laboratory is investigat - ing the molecular diversity of HCCs, and the molecular mechanisms of evasive re - sistance of HCCs to systemic therapies. (MERiC = mechanisms of evasive resis - tance in cancer). We realised that transcriptome based molecular classifications systems of HCCs have severe limitations and are clinically not useful (Makowska et al. [2016]). Ongoing efforts for a molecular classification therefore will integrate genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data obtained from tumor biopsies (Daz - ert et al.

Immunity, 27, 173-178T cells belong to the adaptive arm of the immune system and play key roles in pro - tecting the host from invading pathogens. The metabolic repertoire of T cells - which encompasses metabolic enzymes/pathways, the available nutrient sensors and metabolic checkpoint kinases, and the epigenetic programming of metabolic genes - directly enables and modulates specific immune functions (Gubser/Ban - tug et al. ; Dimeloe et al. ; Jones and Thompson; MacIver et al. ; O'Sullivan et al. ; van der Windt et al.). The signaling pathways that are shaping the metabolic repertoire of T cells in vivo remain poorly defined, particularly in humans. We established a critical link be - tween the complement system and immunometabolic adaptations driving CD4+ T cell effector function. In activated human T cells, autocrine stimulation of the com - plement receptor CD46 was found to be required for enhanced expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 and induction of the amino acid transporter LAT1. Fur - thermore, CD46 activation simultaneously drives expression of LAMTOR5, which mediates assembly of the amino acid-sensing Ragulator-Rag-mTORC1 complex, and increases glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation required pro - duction (Kolev/Dimeloe et al.). The cell-intrinsic metabolic repertoire is also subject to modification by extracel - lular local and systemic metabolic alterations - driven e. g. by malignancies or in - fection, respectively. In that regard, depletion of glucose from the tumor-micro - environment by malignant cells has been shown to impair effector-functions of tumor-infiltrating T cells (Zhao, E. et al. , 2016). Systemic metabolic alterations, such as increased abundance of the short-chain fatty acid acetate during bacte - rial infections (i.e. acetate stress-levels), likewise impact immune cell metabolism and function. Specifically, we found that acetate is taken up by memory CD8+ T cells, metabolized and utilized to acetylate GAPDH, which in turn increases glyco - lytic flux and thereby the memory T cell recall capacity (Balmer et al. , 2016). Our ongoing goal is to delineate the molecular basis of how cellular metabolism is regulated, and itself regulates, immune-function in health and disease states, and to define how environmental cues are integrated at the cellular level by immune cells to shape cellular metabolism and function.Basic and translational aspects of lymphocyte function and its metabolic basis Group Members Dr. Maria Luisa Balmer (Postdoc) Dr. Student) * left during report period Christoph Hess Department of Biomedicine Division of Medical Out- patient Clinic/Clinical Immu-nology University Hospital BaselImmuno- biologyLymphocytes .

Report 2014-2016\"Transplantation and Clinical Virology\" is interested in translational research of vi - rus infections to improve clinical diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. This in - cludes - Respiratory viruses (RV); - Human herpesviruses; and - Human polyomaviruses in vulnerable populations (e. g. HIV/AIDS; transplanta - tion; autoimmunity; inherited immunodeficiency). We aim at characterizing 1) key determinants of virus pathology; 2) potential tar - gets of antiviral intervention; 3) adaptive immune responses; 4) modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors in patients. The focus on human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) serves as example: In the last de - cade, 12 new HPyVs have been identified by molecular methods in addition to BK - PyV and JCPyV known since 1971. Currently, at least 5 HPyVs have been con - vincingly linked to diseases, all in immuncompromized patients. Importantly, no specific antivirals are available for the treatment of HPyV disease making immune reconstitution the main stay of any therapeutic approach today. The polyomavirus non-coding control region (NCCR) harbors the origin of viral DNA genome replication and promoter/enhancers controlling the sequential bi-di - rectional expression of PyV early and late gene expression. We reported that kid - ney transplant patients with persistent BKPyV viremia showed the emergence of viral variants with rearranged NCCR. We demonstrated that the emerging rr-NC - CR caused an activated early viral gene expression, higher viral loads, and repli - cation rates (replication capacity) in vitro , and more advanced disease in patients. A similar dynamic change of the NCCR was seen in JCPyV of HIV patients with PML linking activated early viral gene expression to replication and pathology. Impor - tantly, non-rearranged JCPyV NCCR is activated by HIV1 the high num - ber of PML among HIV/AIDS patients. We conducted extensive point mutation analyses of the archetype BKPyV NCCR identifying 3 phenotypic groups whereby Sp1 affinity and orientation governed bi- directional BKPyV early and late gene expression (Fig. 1). The pathologic relevance of the point mutations was supported by their identification in clinical isolates from patients with nephropathy and hemorrhagic cystitis. Thus, similar to HIV/tat in JCPyV, BKPyV (re-)activation does not only result from failure of immune control, but also from activation from the NCCR. Based on clinical studies, BKPyV viremia and nephropathy has been associated with tacrolimus as main calcineurin inhibitor. We observed that cyclosporine A in - hibited/slowed BKPyV replication, whereas tacrolimus activated/accelerated BK - PyV replication in vitro . Importantly, viral activation by tacrolimus was antagonized by sirolimus competing the intracellular binding protein FKBP-12 (Fig. 2). The data strengthen the theme that activation of virus replication plus failure of adaptive im - mune control synergize in the emergence of opportunist viral infections in immu - nocompromised hosts. This knowledge could be taken back to the clinical man - agement of BKPyV not only by reducing immunosuppression, but by switching to low-dose cyclosporine plus mTOR Characterizing BKPyV we observed that BKPyV Vp1 responses were generally stronger and involved mostly CD4 T- cells, whereas LTag responses were weaker, but contained a larger fraction of spe - cific CD8 T-cells in peripheral blood. main cytotoxic ef - fectors, and since LTag are rate limiting for BKPyV replication in vitro and in vivo (see NCCR mutant variants), we hypothesized that LTag-specific CD8 T-cells are key effectors of antiviral immunity.

At the same time the effector molecules and cells of this defense system can also be respon - sible for a broad range of autoimmune pathologies when directed against an indi - vidual's own tissues. Lineage commitment and maturation of T cells is instructed during the cell's intrathymic development and result from a physical and function - al interaction with the stromal microenvironment. Thymic epithelial cells (TEC) con - stitute an essential component of this stroma whereby cortical (c) and medullary (m) TEC have distinct structural, antigenic and functional features. cTEC provide signals that commit hematopoietic precursor cells to a T cell fate and select those immature T cells for further differentiation that express a functionally competent and for the individual largely useful T cell receptor (TCR).

Nat. Immunol. 6, 554-61.* Shared senior authorshipThe research of the laboratory of Paediatric Immunology focuses on a detailed understanding of: (i) the genetic and epigenetic control of TEC development and function. We have generated specific genetic gain and loss of function mouse models that allow a precise interrogation of particular mechanisms relevant for thy - mus organogenesis and function. Our research has defined the direct target genes of the TEC master regulator transcription factor Foxn1 as well as it's DNA bind - ing motif. We detailed the function of FOXN1 and demonstrated that in addition to the transcriptional control of genes involved in attraction and lineage commitment of T cell precursors, FOXN1 also regulates genes involved in antigen processing and thymocyte selection. Thus, critical events in thymic lymphostromal crosstalk and T cell selection are choreographed by FOXN1. Further studies have character - ized the importance of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) for regular TEC biology. DNA methylation and the generation of micro-RNA constitute addition - al epigenetic mechanisms that we have identified to play an essential role in TEC fate, maintenance and function, including the expression of PTA. The expression of some of these PTA is controlled by the nuclear protein Autoimmune Regulator (AIRE). A single cell transcriptome analysis of TEC subsets proficient or deficient in the expression of histone and DNA modifying enzymes further revealed that PTA expression by thymic epithelia is dependent on different epigenetic mechanisms. (ii) the identity of TEC stem/precursor cells and their intermediate stages in differ - entiation towards mature cTEC and mTEC. Using in vivo lineage fate mapping, we demonstrated that 5t+ cTEC-like progenitors give rise to the medullary TEC com - partment. Lineage-tracing demonstrated that the postnatal medulla is expanded from individual 5t+ cortical progenitors located at the cortico-medullary junction. These results therefore not only define a developmental window during which the expansion of medulla is enabled by progenitors resident in the cortex, but also re - veal the spatio-temporal dynamics that control medulla growth. (iii) the role of metabolic pathways in TEC biology. We have generated mice lacking in TEC essential components of the mTOR complex. Absence of mTORC1 signal - ling ensued a decrease in mTEC numbers that correlated with reductions in mito - chondrial mass, respiration, endoplasmic reticulum network and reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, it lowered the affinity of positively selected TCRs and led to reduced negative selection. Hence, our findings link bioenergetic changes in TEC to specific stages in T cell development. (iv) the consequences of altered thymus development on T cell function, in partic - ular regulatory T cells (Treg). Thymic hypoplasia and ensuing peripheral lympho - penia favor the expansion of a particular potent Treg subset that can be identified by CD103 and ICOS. This phenotype represents a lymph node specific differenti - ation stage that requires the availability of antigen. Thus, we showed that tissue- resident cues determine the overall potency of the peripheral Treg pool by shap - ing its subset composition.

Report 2014-2016The mammalian immune system is important to fight infections but it also fulfills many more functions, some of which are perhaps underappreciated. For instance, immune cells are involved in tolerance to the growing fetus, wound healing and the removal of old and altered cells such as tumors. To achieve these diverse goals the immune system is composed of many cell types and soluble molecules. Due to its complexity and power of effector mechanisms many layers of regulation ensure proper control over what is attacked when and where. Any mistakes can lead to severe clinical disease. Modern medicine relies in many ways on the immune system. Vaccines induce protective immune responses and cell and organ transplantation between genet - ically different individuals is made possible through immunosuppressive thera - pies. At times therapeutic immune regulation seeks to exploit the very same cel - lular and molecular pathways to achieve opposing goals. As an example, certain drugs exploit a molecule called \"CTLA-4\" to dampen the immune response (used in organ transplantation) while different drugs targeting the same molecule can enhance immune responses to fight cancer (\"checkpoint inhibitors\" in cancer im - munotherapy). Therefore, we are interested in a better understanding of how molecular mech - anisms control such intricate regulation. We are particularly interested in an im - mune cell type called \"T cells\". We investigate how different T cell subsets are controlled genetically. In the past few years we have focused on a class of small RNAs called microRNAs (miRNA) which regulate other genes posttranscriptional - ly. We found that miRNAs are dynamically controlled in response to many signals including signals required for T cell activation (costimulation). Furthermore, many studies revealed that one miRNA can control many genes but often each gene is only mildly regulated. We have focused our work on a miRNA locus called miR- 17-92. We demonstrated that miR-17-92 is important for regulatory T cells (Treg) which dampen immune responses and follicular helper T cells (T FH) which help B cells generate better antibodies. Although we contributed to a better molecular understanding why miR-17-92 is required for TFH differentiation and function many potentially regulated gene candidates remain to be investigated. In order to study the genetic networks which are controlled by individual miRNAs more comprehensibly we needed to develop novel tools. To this end our group re - cently developed a new CRISPR/Cas-based genome engineering protocol for effi - cient gene editing in T cells. This new approach enables us to introduce very small, defined genetic changes in the genome of T cells. We are now planning to use this new approach to accelerate our miRNA studies. In parallel we have started a collaboration with Dr. Mihaela Zavolan from the Biocentre to generate molecular maps of 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs). miRNAs most frequently interact with the 3'UTRs of their target genes and the lengths of 3'UTRs can vary. Therefore we will use the newly generated maps as a basis to design perturbation experiments using the gene editing protocol. In collaboration with Dr. Christoph Hess we are also investigating how miRNAs control cell intrinsic metabolism. Moreover, we are searching for small molecules which could be used to modulate miRNA function. Such molecules would be use - ful research tools and could potentially be used for therapeutic goals. Finally, based on our initial results obtained with genome engineering tools we are convinced that this technique will open completely new fields which were unimag - inable only a few years ago. We envision using this novel genetic toolbox for stud - ies in human cells including investigations of patient-specific mutations. Therefore we are actively pursuing efforts into this uncharted territory.Towards a better molecular understanding of T cells as a basis for new therapeutic concepts Group Members Marco Amsler Marianne D\u00f6lz (PhD Student) Regan Geissmann (Administrative Assistant) Dr. Dr. Romina Matter-Marone during report period Lukas Jeker SNSF Professor Department of Biomedicine University Hospital BaselMolecular Immune RegulationImmune Regulation .

Our main focus is to understand the interaction of innate and adaptive immune responses in the con - text of bacterial, fungal and viral infections with the aim at elucidating key mecha - nisms of immune protection, thus fostering personalized treatment - with the over - arching goal to improve clinical outcome. Host response to fungal infections Invasive fungal infections are devastating in immune compromised patients and associated with high mortality rates despite treatment. Risk assessment and diag - nosis remain a major challenge leading to administration of broad-spectrum anti - fungal prophylaxis and over-treatment, which in turn is associated with high costs, drug interactions and, most importantly, limited clinical efficacy with emergence of resistant strains. Hence, reliable tools to identify patients at risk and tailored treat - ment strategies to improve patient outcome are urgently needed. We recently found that functional neutrophil, NK-cell and Aspergillus fumigatus - specific Th1 immunity is associated with a better outcome in patients after allo - geneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with invasive aspergillo - sis (Fig. 1A). To get a broader knowledge about immunological factors increasing the suscepti - bility to fungal infections in other patient populations, we further studied risk fac - tors for development of Candida esophagitis in HIV-infected patients. We found that HIV-1-infected patients with Candida esophagitis had an accumulation of tiple, partly Candida -specific immunological defects (Fig. 1B). In addition, long- term immune recovery was impaired even after introduction of combination an - tiretroviral therapy, illustrating that specific immunological gaps persist in these patients. These data clearly support the rationale for early combination antiretro - viral therapy initiation to prevent irreversible immune defects. Adoptive T-cell therapy for infectious diseases Adoptive transfer of pathogen-specific donor-derived T cells is to date the most promising and feasible immunotherapeutic strategy in transplant recipients restor - ing the lacking T-cell function. Its potential as prophylactic or therapeutic treat - ment has been demonstrated for viral infections after transplantation. We recently initiated a clinical trial of adoptive T-cell therapy for treatment-refractory viral in - fections with cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus and adenovirus after - ing the cytokine capture assay\u00ae (Miltenyi Biotec) at the University Hospital of Ba - sel (ClinTrials ID NCTO2007356), which is so far unique in Switzerland. The fact that higher Aspergillus fumigatus -specific Th1 responses correlate with a better clinical outcome in HSCT recipients with invasive aspergillosis encourages the development of antifungal T-cell transfer. We recently identified immunogen - ic Aspergillus fumigatus antigens, which are likely protective by inducing Th1-cell responses in healthy individuals and HSCT recipients with well-controlled inva - sive aspergillosis (Fig. 2A,B). We were further able to select these antigen-spe - cific cells based on activation-dependent expression of CD137 or CD154 with a GMP-compliant protocol (Fig. 2C). Moreover, cell lines containing T cells specific for all three proteins cross-reacted to the most relevant human-pathogenic molds (Fig. 2D). These results greatly foster adoptive T-cell therapy for these problemat - ic infections.

To overcome these issues, understanding the host-pathogen interac - tion and exploring strategies such as adoptive T- cell transfer that boost and induce long-term im - munity may be promising in these patients.Staphylococcal implant infections Bacterial infection of implanted devices is a major health care problem occurring in about 5 % of patients. These infections are mainly caused by biofilm-forming staphylococci, which are generally tolerant to antibiotic treatment. We could re - cently demonstrate that silver-coating can efficiently prevent implant-associated infections and thus can be considered for clinical application (Fig. 3). Further stud - ies are on the way investigating the host pathogen interaction in biofilm-associat - ed infections. 168 Department of Biomedicine .

A) High affinity activated T cells pri - marily differentiate into \"inflammatory\" Th1 cells that home to T cell areas; low affinity activated T cells strongly differentiate into follicular helper T cells (TFH) that provide help to B cells making antibodies. B) Memory T cells generated by high affinity activation maintain a Th1 bias while memory T cells generated by low affinity activation maintain a TFH bias. In both cases, memory T cells are recalled with high affinity antigen. These data suggest that effector T cell lineage can be programmed by the strength of primary stimulation and that memory T cells have reduced Th1 cells TFH cells flexibility.Selected Publications Keck S, Schmaler M, Ganter S, Wyss L, Obserle S, Huseby ES, Zehn D, King CG. (2014) Antigen affinity and antigen dose exert distinct influences on CD4 T-cell differentiation. Proc. Natl. Acad. 111(41):14852-7Our immune systems have evolved to provide host protection against a wide range of infections. CD4+ T cells are unique in their ability to differentiate into a variety of pathogen appropriate and specialized effector and memory subsets. A long-standing question in T cell bi - ology is how this diversity is achieved. The goal of our research is to understand: how do individual T cells give rise to progeny with such diverse cell fates? Individual T cells are inherently variable. On the other hand, T cell differentiation is a dynamic process and requires the integration of multiple signaling inputs including antigen, cytokines and nutrients, over time. Several models have been developed to explain T cell di - versification but most have relied on either population level anal - yses or static, snapshot measurements. Although highly informa - tive, these approaches cannot fully capture the complexity of T cell behavior or shed light on the specific mechanisms underlying flexi - ble and specific T cell responses. To address these issues, we use continuous time-lapse microscopy to monitor the temporal expres - sion of surface markers and transcription factors expressed by sin - gle T cells cultured under distinct differentiation conditions. By re - constructing the phenotypic and proliferative history of divergent T cell family trees, we aim to generate new predictive models that de - scribe the process of T cell diversification. These efforts are complemented by in vivo models to address T cell differentiation during acute bacterial infection, chronic viral infec - tion and tolerance. We are particularly interested in understanding how dynamic access to antigen and cytokines regulates the flexi - bility and plasticity of effector and memory CD4+ T cells. Here we are focused on two broad questions: (i) how does signaling through the T cell receptor regulate the quality and extent of CD4 differenti - ation; and (ii) what are the molecular mechanisms that link T cell re - ceptor signal strength with the generation of heterogeneous CD4+T cell fates? By linking complex T cell phenotype, behavior and fate across time, our goal is to define and uncover novel molecular path - ways underlying T cell fate decisions. We believe that our work to ad - dress fundamental biologic questions will lay a foundation for inno - vative solutions to a wide range of public health challenges.Regulation and dynamics of T cell fate 170 Department of Biomedicine .

Can the improved immune capacity reduce virus spread and disease? Yet, de - spite all therapeutic developments the unavoidable flip-side of decade-long ther - apy continues to be the increased risk of drug-resistant HIV and treatment failure. While most of the responsible mutations in the respective therapy target genes have been characterized, cases with persisting \"low level viremia\" or virologic fail - ure without overt mutations remain puzzling. Therefore, a better understanding of alternative resistance mechanisms, e. g. via mutations in enzyme substrates may prove clinically important. As practical, clinical contributions of our research-driv - en molecular work, and as elements of capacity building towards improved clin - ical care my research group got engaged in projects with rural settings of our globe. Our efforts intend to address aspects of the ambitious WHO 90-90-90 aim towards ending the global HIV epidemic: Identify by year 2020 globally 90 % of all HIV infected people, provide treatment to 90% of them with virus suppression in 90 %. The current focus of ongoing work in my research group is thus on three key questions: 1) How can immune function complement effective HIV therapy? We have recently discovered that recovering immune functions can crucially change the fate of HIV-1 in a given patient. Such competence might assist ther - apeutic strategies to arm the natural defense over time in concert with HIV drug therapy. Published work revealed that HIV tends to change its host tropism during the course of infection: Early, close to 90% of patients harbor mostly HIV that uses the chemokine receptor CCR5 for cell entry, late in the disease up to 50 % of virus - es are CXCR4-tropic. CXCR4-use therefore seemed to indicate the emergence of more aggressive virus variants, characteristic for late-stage disease. We set out to probe this hypothesis by a longitudinal follow-up of patients in the Swiss HIV co - hort study by deep-sequencing approaches. To our surprise, and against expec - tation the study demonstrated the opposite trend: In patients with long term sup - pression of virus replication, CCR5-tropic HIV variants re-appeared or remained, while CXCR4 tropic virus in most cases drastically declined (Fig. 1), obviously as result of therapeutic pressure. This new finding correlates well with other key prop - erties of CXCR4-viruses: lower envelope glycosylation, stronger induction of in - flammation and cell activation. It is thus likely that immune-stimulating features enable preferable control and elimination of CXCR4-tropic HIV variants and -in - fected cells under therapy. 2) Does HIV resistance evolve under long-term therapy? Although combination therapy has become superbly successful for the global fight against HIV, escape from therapy continues to be a serious issue for all inhibitor classes, including the highly potent protease inhibitors (PI). Mechanistically most PI-resistances correlate with genetic changes within the protease gene, i.e. drug- specific mutations or those that confer broad viral resistance to most drugs of the class. However, clinical situations are observed, where no such obvious link can be established. Our investigations identified genetic changes in the gag gene for structural HIV proteins, which serve as protease substrate.

This may help identify new clinically relevant mu - tations to be considered in HIV resistance testing 3) Modern diagnostic tools and patient care in rural Africa. With a translational, practical effort my research group is involved in the establish - ment and implementation of quantitative viral load-testing and the genotypic de - termination of HIV drug resistance in a rural, resource-limited setting. In collabo - ration with N. Labhardt and the Swiss NGO SolidarMed we study therapy efficacy, viral resistance-emergence as well as the successful retention in antiviral care over time in the North of Lesotho. Up to here the project was already able to demon - strate that nurse-led hospitals can achieve, similar to Swiss settings, about 90% treatment success. Pleasantly surprising, also patients' therapy adherence is sim - ilarly high (Fig. 3). However, in very sharp contrast to the positive adult situation, vi - rus control and retention in care for children and adolescents were shown to pose massive challenges. Therefore, along with our most recent introduction of sensi - tive virus-load measurement and sequence-based resistance testing in Butha- Buthe/Seboche we are currently concentrating our work on new concepts to ac - company and improve clinical work towards long-term virus suppression for these key populations and the overall health towards prolonging the lives of the most- affected in a country that, with an overall prevalence of 20% HIV-1-positivity, is among those hardest hit by HIV/AIDS.

Our general research interest is the role of the innate immune system in the pathogenesis of inflammatory rheumatic diseases, including chronic arthritis. Activation of receptors of the innate immune system, such as Toll-like receptors (TLR), has been shown to occur at an early stage of synovitis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)(Ospelt et al. , 2008). In - creasing evidence indicates that inflammatory pathways are controlled by post - transcriptional mechanisms . Epigenetic control of gene expression by microR - NA (miR) was demonstrated to be dysregulated in RA (Duroux-Richard et al. , 2011; Stanczyk et al. , 2008). In our work we have focused on miR regulation of TLR- dependent inflammatory pathways in synovial fibroblasts and monocytes/macro In stimulated synovial cells and monocyte-derived mac - rophages showed differential expression of miRNA in low-density array analysis. Candidate miRs were confirmed by real-time PCR and possible target genes in the TLR-signaling pathway predicted in silico. A set of miR were identified that were found to be regulated by TLR-ligands. Expression of miR and their target genes are measured in blood or synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. To as - sess the functional effects of the candidate miRs, they are overexpressed in pri - mary human synovial cells or monocyte-derived macrophages from the peripheral blood. Alternatively, miR antagonists are used to inhibit miR function in these cells. Subsequently, production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as proliferation and apoptosis are measured. We aim at a better understanding of the contribution of dysregulation of miR ex - pression to the pathogenesis of chronic joint inflammation.

Ann Neurol. 2011 Feb;69(2):408-13Individual cell-migration is fundamental to protective immunity but plays also a central role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Our general aim is to as - sess migration characteristics of primary human T cells within specific subpopula - tions on a single cell level in health and in autoimmunity. Orchestrated migration of T cells provides the basis for their precise positioning within lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. Conversely, migration of autoreactive lymphocytes is fundamental to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The importance of T cell migration in the pathogenesis of MS is supported by the fact that two highly efficacious drugs for the treatment of MS (fingolimod and natalizumab) act on T cell migration. Most of our insight into T cell migration is based on the monitoring of bulk cell pop - ulations in animal models. For human T cells, a relatively limited set of migration- characteristics have been recapitulated in vitro , again mostly by using bulk cell populations and probing the peripheral blood lymphocyte compartment. While important understanding of mechanisms underlying T cell migration derives from these studies, a potential heterogeneity of migration between individual cells is not interrogated using this approach. Also, clinical samples containing only small numbers of T cells are not amenable for analysis using classical in vitro migration assays. Specifically, understanding the migration characteristics of T cells derived from cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients -the closest routinely accessible approxi - mation to pathogenic cells in this disease- would be of particular interest. In recent years, introduction of microfabrication technologies resulted in the gen - eration of so-called microfluidic devices, which allow monitoring of cells on a sin - gle-cell level with high spatio-temporal resolution. We have developed microfluidic devices specifically designed to studying the migration characteristics of primary human T cells. These devices allow a highly precise build-up of soluble and immo - bilized chemokine gradients. Characterizing migration properties of individual hu - man CD4+ memory T cells ex vivo , we have already established the proof of con - cept that this technique can overcome previous limitations of standard migration assays. With the help of microfluidics we aim at assessing migration characteris - tics of immune cells derived from the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with MS and relate these findings with clinical phenotypes.Single cell lymphocyte migration in multiple sclerosis Group Members Corina Frick (MD-PhD Analysis and Tracking .

The disease affects worldwide over 2.5 million individuals and is the most common cause of neurological disability in young adults. Autore - active immune responses in the CNS, mediated by encephalitogenic lymphocytes are thought to play central roles in the initiation and propagation of MS pathology. Priming of encephalitogenic T cells presumably occurs in secondary lymphoid tissues (SLT) outside the CNS. Thus, migration of these cells - or their precursors - to SLT, and from SLT to the CNS are crucial steps in the immunopatho - genesis of MS. To assess migration characteristics of T cells derived from patients with MS our Trans - lational Neuroimmunology Laboratory works in close collaboration to the Division of Neurology of the University Hospital Basel, which includes a MS Outpatient Clinic. This provides access to samples from a unique and well defined population of MS- patients with different stages and courses of the disease and different treatments including experi - mental therapies in clinical development. a) b) c)176 Department of Biomedicine .

(2014) CX3CR1+ cells facilitate the T cells in the colonic lamina propria during antigen-driven Mucosal Im bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn`s disease and ulcerative coli - tis, are chronic relapsing diseases with increasing incidence and prevalence in the developed world. Innate and adaptive immune responses to constituents of the in - testinal microbiota are essential for the development of IBD. Intestinal mononu - clear phagocytes are in direct contact with the intestinal microbiota, initiate innate immune responses and shape adaptive immune responses. Phagocytes are lo - cated in the lamina propria of the gastrointestinal tract, in cryptopatches and iso - lated lymph follicles in close proximity to innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). Infection of animals with the mouse pathogen C. rodentium leads to IL-22 production by ILCs, which regulates the expression of REG family proteins required for the defense to infections with enteric pathogens. The depletion of phagocytes decreased IL-22 production by ILCs. This means that phagocytes support IL-22 production by ILCs required for host defense in the gut (Manta et al, Mucosal Immunol, 2013). Mononuclear phagocytes may also initiate adaptive immune responses in the gut as indicated by the close proximity of phagocytes to T cells in the lamina propria of the gastrointestinal tract. Colonic phagocytes sample continuously fluorescent labelled E. coli. To reduce the complex interactions between phagocytes and T cells in presence of the intestinal microflora with vast array pf potential antigens, an antigen-specific colitis model was developed. In this model the challenge of E. coli expressing the antigen ovalbumin induces colitis in immunodeficient animals (RAG animals) reconstituted with antigen-specific T cells. Ex vivo confocal imag - ing allows the visualization of phagocytes that have sampled E.coli in proximity to T cells. In vitro studies indicated that the phagocytes deliver the antigen to dendrit - ic cells, which migrate to mesenteric lymph nodes. In mesenteric lymph nodes the dendritic cells prime T cells, which home back to the lamina propria. In the lami - na propria phagocytes are able to activate the effector T cells (Rossini et al, Mu - cosal Immunol, 2014). These findings support the hypothesis that mononuclear phagocytes in the gas - tro-intestinal tract are of importance for the sampling of constituents of the micro - biota, the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses. Likely, mononucle - ar phagocytes play a key role in the pathogenesis of IBD.

Report 2014-2016One of the central mysteries of immunology is self-tolerance. How does the human body select ~10e12 T lymphocytes, that are reactive to foreign pathogens but tol - erant to normal cellular constituents of the host? The work of our laboratory seeks to understand the general principles by which a healthy individual's immune sys - tem achieves a state of self-tolerance. We are particularly interested in how a toler - ant T cell repertoire is selected during development and how it's maintained during adult life. The knowledge derived from our research may eventually impact organ transplantation and autoimmune diseases. Over the last few years, we demonstrated that the affinity threshold for negative selection is a constant for all thymocytes expressing MHC I restricted TCRs. This binding affinity threshold (KD = 6 M; estimated T12 2 sec) is a fundamental bio - physical parameter used by developing CD8 lineage cells to establish a tolerant T cell repertoire. More recent experiments indicate that thymocytes destined to en - ter the CD4 lineage use an affinity threshold (KD = 300 M; estimated T12 0.1 sec) for negative selection that is 10-50 fold lower than that used for their CD8 lin - eage counterparts. These differences are explained by the fraction of the corre - sponding co-receptor (CD8 or of CD8 vs 10% of CD4 molecules are loaded with lck. The emerging picture is that MHC I restricted thymocytes require a high affinity (longer duration) interaction be - tween the TCR and the self-antigen to initiate negative selection because so few (< 1%) of the CD8 co-receptor molecules carry lck. MHC II restricted thymocytes on the other hand undergo negative selection with a much lower affinity (shorter duration) interaction because a higher proportion (10%) of the CD4 molecules car - ry lck. Imaging studies and molecular modeling have provided evidence that an antigen engaged TCR must undergo hundreds of collisions with the relevant co- receptors to eventually engage a co-receptor molecule which actually carries the initiating kinase, lck. Based on the number of molecules and the biophysical pa - rameters describing their movement, we developed a mathematical model which describes a mechanism where the TCR can actually \"read\" antigen affinity and es - tablish an affinity (antigen dwell time) threshold for self-tolerance. We also examined the affinity threshold required for the induction of experimental autoimmune diabetes. This involves the activation of the integrin LFA-1, formation of long-lasting T cell - antigen presenting cell conjugates, asymmetric cell division and differentiation into short-lived effector cells. Related to this, we are examining the origin of autoimmune T cells; they frequently express threshold affinity TCRs, which are inefficiently removed by clonal deletion. We are also trying to define the minimum number of T cells required to initiate an autoimmune disease. Another focus of the laboratory is to understand the basic biology of regulatory T cells. Our experiments support the idea that Helios+ FoxP3+ regulatory T cells are survivors of negative selection in the thymus. This implies that the TCR reper - toire expressed on Helios+ regulatory T cells is high affinity anti-self. In vitro ex - periments demonstrated that Tregs require contact with MHC II expressing APCs and IL-2 from conventional T cells to proliferate. We are also using monoclonal Tregs and monoclonal Tconv cells to examine the basis of Treg mediated suppres - sion. An additional project focuses on the role of regulatory T cells in maintaining peripheral tolerance. Finally, we studied the role if MHC II expression in intestinal epithelial cells. In mice specifically lacking MHC II expression in this cell type, we observed an epitheli - al lymphocytosis.Understanding the principles of naturally occuring T cell tolerance Ed Palmer Department of Biomedicine Division of Nephrology University Hospital BaselTransplantation Immunology and Nephrology Retired during report Cells Tolerance .

In broad terms we investigate the following aspects thereof: - B cell responses in persistent viral infection - Role of alarmins in T cell immunity - Virally vectored vaccines - Viral triggers of autoimmune disease - Mechanisms of viral pathogenesis Thereby, our research portfolio covers both adaptive and innate immune defense, with viral infection as a common theme. We combine molecular virological tech - niques (\"reverse genetics\") for the engineering of infectious viruses with state-of- the-art mouse infection models, cutting-edge cellular immunological techniques and a broad range of molecular analytics. Although fundamental by character, the questions addressed have strong links to major unmet global health needs. In the mid- to long- term, this offers translational potential, notably for vaccination and treatment of persistent viral diseases such as human immunodeficiency vi - rus (HIV), hepatitis B and C virus, as well as for select autoimmune disorders and cancer.Immunity and pathogenesis in viral infection Group Members B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Afonso* (Technician) Patricia Aparicio-Domingo* (PhD Student) Dr. (Research Associate) Karen Cornille (Technician) Mirela Dimitrova Ismail Lena Siewert (PhD Student) * left during report period Daniel D.

Report 2014-2016Connection to Clinical Practice Mike Recher, Christoph Hess Immunodeficiency Clinic, Medical Outpatient Unit, University Hospital Basel Molecular mechanisms in and personalized treatment of patients with primary immunodeficiency Patients with suspected immunodeficiency or immune dysregulations are clini - cally evaluated in the Immunodeficiency Clinic of the Medical Outpatient Unit of the Basel University Hospital. If needed, patients are treated with supplementa - tion of immunoglobulins and if available treatment specific immunologic treat - ment. Since 2015, patients with the diagnosis of primary (genetically determined) im - munodeficiency are included into a prospective cohort. Following informed con - sent, a standardized documentation of the physical status of the patient is com - bined with analysis of a standardized set of immunological lab data. In addition, the immuno-metabolism of sorted T and B lymphocytes is assessed in a collab - oration with the Immunobiology Lab of Christoph Hess. Whole exome sequenc - ing is performed and analyzed in a collaboration with Alexander Navarini, Der - matology, University Hospital Zurich. This allows us to prospectively study the disease course but also to determine the molecular mechanism of disease and to treat the patients in a personalized manner taking into account the molecular mechanism of disease.

To date, more than 300 different PID have been char - acterized. Deficiency of the recombination activating genes (RAG) is associated with PID af - fecting number and function of both T and B lymphocytes. RAG-PID associat - ed clinical phenotypes range from pediatric combined immunodeficien - cy (SCID) to adult-onset RAG-associated granulomas and autoimmune disease. While complete loss-of-function mutations lead to RAG-dependent SCID, so- called hypomorphic RAG mutations are associated with the late-onset RAG-as - sociated diseases. The mechanisms involved in autoimmunity and immune-dysregulation due to hy - pomorphic RAG-mutations are poorly defined. Autoimmunity and immune-dys - regulation are also associated with RAG-independent PID, implying that PID and autoimmunity are fundamentally linked. One main focus of the lab is to analyze in murine models how gradual RAG dys - function impacts on immunity to infectious pathogens and at the same time to the formation of autoimmunity. This may help identifying mechanisms involved in the generation of autoimmunity in general.Primary Immunodeficiency Mike Recher SNSF Professor Department of Biomedicine Division Medical Outpatient Clinic University Hospital BaselImmuno- deficiencyImmunodeficiency .

Report 2014-2016A permissive role for IL-7 in mouse B cell development Patients deficient for IL-7 or the IL-7R are practically devoid of T cells but have nor - mal B cell compartments. In mice deficient for IL-7 or the IL-7R both T cell and B cell compartments are dramatically reduced. Based on these findings it was ar - gued that IL-7 plays a redundant role in human B cell development but a non-re - dundant and may be even an instructive role in mouse B cell development. Now we challenged this hypothesis by analyzing the by us generated FLT3L transgen - ic mice. These transgenic mice posses dramatically increased populations of pro - genitor cells in the bone marrow including the pre-pro-B cells. Now by generating IL-7 deficient mice on a FLT3L transgenic background we found a very significant rescue of all the precursor B cell subpopulations in the bone marrow and the ma - ture B cell populations in the periphery. Thus, increased levels of FLT3L make the role of IL-7 in mouse B cell development largely redundant. Our findings rather sug - gest that IL-7 mainly acts as a growth factor for pre-B cells and thereby making B cell development more efficient. Yet, another suggestion coming from our studies is that human B cell development is regulated by FLT3L. Hematopoietic progenitors with multipotent developmental potential: real multipotency or heterogeneity? Over the past couple of years new hematopoietic progenitors with multipotent de - velopmental potential mainly determined in vitro were described. However, by the generation of so-called reporter mice the multipotency of some of these precur - sors in vivo was questioned. Moreover, the multipotent developmental potential in vitro of these precursors was tested at the \"bulk\" but not at the single cell lev - el. Therefore, the in vivo significance of this multipotency is questionable and fur - thermore the in vitro experiments do not exclude heterogeneity within the tested precursor populations. Several years ago we have described a small bone marrow derived precursor pop - ulation with lymphoid and myeloid developmental potential in vitro (Balciunaite G, Ceredig R, Massa S, Rolink AG. Eur J Immunol. 2005 Jul;35(7):2019-30). This pop - ulation comprises 0.1 - 0.3% of total BM nucleated cells and was characterized as being B220+ c-Kit+ CD19- NK1.1-. Now, by identifying new markers and by analyz - ing newly generated mutant mice we have found that this population can be sub - divided into at least 6 subpopulations. The main marker we used for this was Ly6D. Single cell RNA- sequence analysis performed on the Ly6D+ and Ly6D-, B220+ c- Kit+ CD19- NK1.1- cells revealed within the Ly6D+ cells a largely lymphoid restrict - ed transcriptome whereas the Ly6D- cells showed either a transcriptome reminis - cent of lymphoid, myeloid or dendritic these findings reveal that B220+ c-Kit+ CD19- NK1.1- cells are very heterogeneous and that myeloid and lymphoid developmental potential is coming from different cells within this population.

Immunology letters 160, 113-119Connection to Clinical Practice Prof. Dr. Antonius Rolink University of Basel, Department of Biomedicine The prophylactic and/or therapeutic effects of IL-2 - anti - IL-2 complexes on SLE like cGVHD cGVHD as can be induced by the injection of DBA/2 T cells into semi-allogeneic (C57/Bl6 x DBA/2) F1 (BDF1) mice shows many similarities to SLE in man. Some years ago it was shown that injection of IL-2 anti-IL2 complexes into normal mice can re - sult into a dramatic increase of regulatory T cells (Tregs) or CD8 T cells. The increase of either Tregs or CD8 T cells was dependent on the anti-IL2 anti - body that was used for generating the complexes. We have now tested the prophylactic and ther - apeutic effects of these complexes on SLE like cGVHD. Our findings indicate that the treatment of BDF1 mice before the injection of DBA/2 T cells with complexes that induce a Treg increase to a large extent prevents the development of cGVHD whereas the injection of the complexes that induce a CD8 increase had no effect or even made the dis - ease worse. In marked contrast no amelioration of the cGVHD was observed when IL-2 complexes that induce Treg cells were given 3 weeks after induction of a cGVHD (therapeutic protocol). However, the thera - peutic treatment that induces a CD8 increase very significantly ameliorated the autoimmunity as de - termined by the titer of autoantibodies and the de - velopment of immune complex glomerulonephritis. No improvement of disease by these complexes was observed when the cGVHD was induced by CD8 depleted DBA/2 T cells. This finding suggest that the ameliorating effects by the therapeutic treatment with CD8 inducing complexes might be due to an increase of DBA/2 CD8 T cells. Overall, these studies indicate that IL-2 complex - es might well be envisaged for prophylactic and/or therapeutic therapies of cGVHD and may be even SLE. 186 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016Group Members St\u00f6cklinIn mammals, regulatory T cells (Tregs) establish and maintain immune responses toward self- and non-self-antigens by suppression of specific T cells. The population of Tregs consists of functionally different Treg subsets that regu - late different immune responses. Although many studies investigated the function of Tregs, the mechanisms controlling homeostasis and activation of different Treg subsets are poorly defined. We identified that IL-7 signaling, beside its known role in survival, stabilizes the function of Treg in the lymph nodes (LN) during inflammatory T-cell responses. Treg prevented early and increased late IL-7 induction in lymph node stromal cells. Our data suggest that Treg require IL-7R signaling to increase their CD25 expres - sion (Fig. 1) and efficiently compete with other T-cell subsets for IL-2. Improved IL-2 sensitivity stabilized the Treg and promoted of effec - tor in vivo . The of IL-7R specifically on Treg reduced their suppressive function, causing a decrease of eTregs during aging (Fig. 2, A) and mild symptoms of autoimmunity during aging (Fig. 2, B). In various allograft models including skin allograft transplantation, Treg were shown to control im - mune responses to foreign antigens. We established a transplantation model in which I-Abm12 skin allografts are accepted on Rag2/ mice, and the function of polyclonal Treg and their specialized subsets can be investigated after cotransfer with I-Abm12-specific CD4+ T cells. Transfer of high Treg numbers established al - lograft tolerance, which could be reverted by specific Treg depletion. Treg-sup - pressed ABM expansion dependent on the initial ratio and IL-2 production of ABM increased their own and Treg numbers. Treg displayed an effector phenotype in the LN. of IL-7 or transfer of Treg from Il7ra- Treg mice caused graft re - jection in 40 % of tolerant mice (Fig. 3), which could be due to reduced survival in the LN. However, the ratio of Treg/ABM in rejecting mice was in favor of Treg, which usually correlated with allograft tolerance. Therefore, our results suggest that IL- 7R signaling does not exclusively support Treg survival but also increases the sup - pressive activity of allo-activated Treg. Structural lymph node follicular reticular cells LN-FRC and lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) are the main source of IL-7 in the LN and increase IL-7 production on inflammatory T-cell responses. Consistent with this view, allogeneic CD4+ T-cell activation and release of IFN increased IL-7 levels in LN-FRC at early time points, which massively declined thereafter in drain - ing LN of transplanted Rag2/ mice. Treg inhibited both IFN production and ex - pansion of ABM, which correlated with an early reduction of IL-7 transcription in LN-FRC of allograft-tolerant mice. At later time points, the presence of Treg re - sulted in higher IL-7 transcription; the reasons for this are unclear, and further ex - periments need to be done to address this. However, Treg can influence the LN microenvironment to facilitate suppression of T cells, which would allow IL-2 con - sumption and suppression in close proximity of activated T cells, as well as help to maintain immunological tolerance.Regulatory T cells profit from IL-7R signaling during peripheral and allograft tolerance Simona Rossi Girard SNSF Professor Department of Biomedicine Immunology University Hospital BaselImmuno- regulation Group left during report periodT Regulatory Cell .

Report 2014-2016 Martin Stern SNSF Professor Department of Biomedicine Division of Hematology University Hospital BaselNatural killer (NK) cells are a subgroup of lymphocytes that - unlike B- and T-lym - phocytes - do not possess rearranged surface receptors but instead are regu - lated by integration of signals derived from an array of activating and inhibitory receptors. While much progress has been made over the last 10 years in the char - acterization of NK cell surface receptors and their ligands, the function and ligands of several NK cell receptors are still unknown. NK cells are of particular importance in patients under pharmacological immu - nosuppression, e.g. after solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These patients with compromised adaptive immunity are therefore predestined to study the role of natural killer cells in the control of malignant and viral transfor - mation. Our studies focus on one family of NK cell receptors termed Killer-cell Immuno - globulin-like receptors (KIR). KIR are transmembrane proteins and come in an in - hibitory or activating flavor. While the function of inhibitory KIR is clear (provid - ing NK cell tolerance through binding to HLA-class I) both function and ligands of activating KIR are so far undefined. Studies in transplanted patients have hinted that patients carrying activating KIR have a reduced rate of viral infection, point - ing to viral proteins as potential activating KIR ligands. Through studies involving solid organ grafts performed in transplant centers in Switzerland reporting to the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study, we have identified activating KIR receptors as hav - ing a protective role regarding the occurrence of cytomegalovirus replication af - ter transplantation. These studies are accompanied by in vitro experiments aiming to resolve receptor-ligand interactions relevant for this protective role of NK cells. Another line of research is directed towards the identification of activating KIR re - ceptors involved in the recognition of acute myeloid leukemia cells, where clinical studies have also documented a benefit for patients receiving allografts from a do - nor carrying such activating receptor genes. A more recently established line of research analyzes how KIR are involved in the antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), an important mode of action of therapeutically administered monoclonal antibodies. We could show that the su - perior efficacy of modern third-generation glycoengineered antibodies is partly due to their ability to overcome inhibitory signaling by KIR receptors. Finally, in a translational arm of our research and in close collaboration with the Di - vision of Hematology at the University Hospital, we are treating patients with can - cers incurable by conventional chemotherapy with highly purified and ex vivo ex- panded NK cells with the aim to eradicate disease through a combined chemo-/ immunotherapy approach.

However, the causes and pathogenic mechanisms of SLE are still not ful - ly understood. A major hypothesis of the pathogenesis of SLE assumes that the disease is driven by a defective clearance of dead and dying (apoptotic) cells. In the context of an altered clearance, these apoptotic cells could become antigen - ic and initiate an autoimmune response. The complement system has been shown to play an important role in the clearance of apoptotic cells and the deficiency of one of the early components of the classical pathway of complement is strongly associated with the development of SLE. However, most SLE patients have no pri - mary complement deficiency. In contrast, hypocomplementemia in SLE patients is a secondary event and most often associated with antibodies against the first component of the classical pathway of complement (C1q). As we and others have shown, autoantibodies against C1q (anti-C1q) strongly correlate with the overall disease activity in SLE patients, but in particular with renal flares. Our studies sug - gest that the occurrence of anti-C1q in SLE patients is necessary but not sufficient for the development of severe lupus nephritis. It is possible that anti-C1q inter - fere with the normal function of the complement system including the clearance of apoptotic cells. In fact, we could already show that anti-C1q specifically target C1q when bound to the surface of early apoptotic cells. We could also show that an - ti-C1q can activate the classical as well as the lectin pathway of complement and induce a proinflammatory phenotype in macrophages. In addition, we identified a major linear epitope on the C1q molecule targeted by anti-C1q. The dissection of its core amino acid sequence revealed a striking sequence homology with Ebstein Barr Virus suggesting cross-reactivity through molecular mimicry. Independently, studying the binding characteristics of anti-C1q led us to the analysis of the bind - ing of von Willebrand factor to bound C1q. Interestingly, we could observe bind - ing of vWF to bound C1q allowing consecutive aggregation of platelets. Thus, we could demonstrate a direct interaction between starter molecules of primary he - mostasis and the classical pathway of complement system that might contribute to the pathogenic mechanisms in complement-mediated, inflammatory diseases. Currently, our group aims to further examine the origin, pathological role and clini - cal relevance of anti-C1q antibodies in a double approach based on experimental studies of C1q and anti-C1q and clinical studies of patients with SLE. In the exper - imental studies we want to understand i) the origin of anti-C1q, ii) the consequenc - es of the binding of antiC1q, and iii) the immunological consequences of the bind - ing of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) to bound C1q.Antibodies against complement C1q in lupus erythematosus: The autoanti - bodies from SLE patients activate the complement system via both the classical and the lectin pathway.

In addi - tion and thanks to the participation in the Swiss SLE Cohort Study (SSCS) we are also studying the role of other autoantibodies and serum cytokines in SLE. Independent from anti-C1q studies, we are study - ing the role of complement split products (i.e. acti - vation parameters) and complement mannan-bind - ing lectin (MBL) in clinical settings. MBL is strongly related to C1q and has been shown to play an im - portant role in the defence against infectious agents. More recent studies suggest that MBL also binds to apoptotic cells and plays a pro-inflammatory role in experimental settings of ischaemia-reperfusion inju - ry. The high frequency of functional MBL deficiency in the general population (about 25 %) predestines MBL for clinical studies investigating its role in hu - man diseases. 192 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2014-2016Fig. 1: Dendritic cell development Dendritic cells develop in the bone marrow from a monocyte-Dendritic cell progenitor (MDP). Lineage commitment is determined by the acquisition of a specific transcriptional landscape at a determined stage of development. Extrinsic factors, proliferation rate and epigenetic changes will influence the expression of given transcription factors and determine the progression into a specific cell lineage, while restricting other fates. Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells that play a key role in the immune system. Under steady state conditions immature DCs promote tol - erance and induction of regulatory cells. Upon pathogen recognition, DCs under - go maturation and initiate the adaptive immune response by priming T cells. DCs dictate the type of adaptive response towards a particular pathogen by secreting different type of cytokines, maintaining an appropriate inflammatory milieu and re - cruiting specialized effector cells. Such a complex and coordinated response re - quires DC subset specialization, which is obtained through lineage as well as func - tional specificity, controlled by complex transcriptional networks. It is therefore essential to understand the transcriptional regulation of existing subsets through the characterization of their developmental cues, as well as identify the transcrip - tional signature required for the functional properties of each subset. Defining lineage commitment Development of DCs occurs in the bone marrow and requires a complex transcrip - tional lineage specification (fig. 1), which promotes the progression from an un - committed self-renewing stem cell progenitor to a mature DC. Several transcrip - tion factors have been implicated in the development of DC. Some transcription factors impairing DC development also affect other hematopoietic lineages and multiple DC subsets, while some prevent development of a given DC subset. Col - lectively, the hierarchical requirement of each of them during DC development is still unclear. We could recently show how hetero-complexes of transcription fac - tors are promoting lineage specification. We aim at defining the networks, which are intrinsically required for the establishment of lineage commitment within den - dritic cell subsets. Moreover, the transcriptional identity of each subset, which encodes and ensures functional specificity, allowing for the initiation of the ap - propriate response to a particular pathogen or immunological insult, has to be characterized. Given the critical role of DCs in bridging the innate and the adaptive immunity there is increasing interest in understanding the transcriptional network underlying their development as well as their functional specialization.

Klf4 conditional-deficient mice are highly susceptible to S. mansoni infection and succumb around 50 days after in - fection, comparable to IL-4 deficient mice. Also the context of allergic reactions, Klf4 conditional-deficient mice show impaired Th2 immunity. This results in reduced eosinophil recruitment in bronchoalveolar lavage following intra-nasal challenge with house dust mite.Deciphering the complexity of cDC2 DCs can be classified in three major branches based on their ontogeny: conven - into cDC1 and cDC2 (fig. 2). cDC1 are a homogenous group, dependent on the transcription factors Irf8 and Batf3, and can be identified across all organs and tissues based on the expression of XCR1. On the contrary, cDC2 are highly heterogeneous, unified only by the expression of Irf4. The complexity of the cDC2 subset was further highlighted by single cell sequencing experiments. Tran - scriptional profiling of cDC progenitors allowed us to identify Klf4 as a transcription factor involved in the development of a subset of cDC2. A significant reduction of the cDC2 compartment is evident in the absence of the transcription factor Klf4. In some tissues the use of specific markers allowed us to unequivocally identify the Klf4-dependent cDC2 subpopulation, which in skin draining lymph nodes was pre - viously recognized as double negative for the surface markers CD11b and CD24. Despite its identification, the role of this DC subset as well as the functional require - ment for Klf4 was unknown. We could show that expression of Klf4 within cDCs is necessary for the induction of Type 2 immunity. Klf4 deficient mice are highly sus - ceptible to parasitic infections, such as the helminthes Schistosoma mansoni. Fur- ther, impaired Th2 immunity in these mice shows increased resistance to the de - velopment of house dust mite induced asthma (fig. 3). The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Th2 immunity are still unclear. The identification of the tran - scription factor as well as the DC subset involved in Th2 priming will be instrumen - tal to understand how Th2 immunity is established, and potentially lead us to the development of therapeutic interventions. 194 Department of Biomedicine .
