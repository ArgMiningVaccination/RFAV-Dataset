Get in Touch WHAT PEOPLE SAY Chelsea K I've been going to Dr. Kelsi for over a year now and I am so glad I found her! I see her for facial acupuncture and I have been very pleased, not only with the initial results, but I have continued to see those results hold with the maintenance visits. Dr. Kelsi hasn't only helped with acupuncture, but her health and wellness tips have been invaluable. From suggestions for dealing with terrible allergies, or mold issues, to dealing with recurring headaches, she has been beyond amazing. The best part is that I always leave feeling refreshed and relaxed after a visit with Dr. Kelsi. Frank M I've seen Dr. Kelsi for multiple microneedling sessions and am very happy with my results! She does an excellent job at ensuring I'm always comfortable and giving me details on how the session is going. She's answered all my questions and has given me great skin care tips each time I've visited. The healing process has always been fairly quick for me because she's meticulous with the before and after treatment as well. She offers a great amount of value for skin care needs. "}
