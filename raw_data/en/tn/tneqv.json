Truth is, I dont expect people to know because the term and this type of doctor are not very well known by many people. A naturopath is sometimes the one people go to see after they have tried every western medical option with no results, are fed up with \"modern\" medicine or have been told by a friend they know that someone had miraculous results by seeing a naturopath. We should all look to nature first to treat our maladies and health problems. Why? Because it is straying from nature in the first place that has provoked the problems with our health. This may be difficult for many to believe but it is what I have come to see as truth. A naturopath is one who believes in the inherent healing power of nature and the capacity of the body to heal on its own when it has all things necessary to heal itself. We can heal from almost anything if we understand the causes and solutions to the problem. We are passionately concerned with finding the root cause of disease, and not treating symptoms. We are focused on treating the whole person, and realize that all parts of the body contribute positively or negatively to health - physically, mentally, and spiritually. While every health challenge is different and has various causes, the path to healing most of the time for almost every ailment is strikingly similar. The habits and lifestyle practices of those who are truly healthy are not radically different for every person. Cultures and people across the world who have enjoyed health and have lived to be well over 100 years old show common denominators that are foundational and exist among most of these groups of people. Read below about each area of Naturopathy, click on each title for the full article... [Nutrition >](/naturopathic-medicine/nutrition) A major component or one of the cornerstones of Naturopathic Medicine is Nutrition. What goes into the body is one of the most important aspects of health. In fact, next to high quality water and air, it is probably the most important factor that determines the difference between health and dis-ease. A recent quote by the Rockefeller Institute of Medicine Research said \"If the doctors of today do not become the nutritionists of tomorrow, then the nutritionists of today will become the doctors of tomorrow. [Homeopathy >](/naturopathic-medicine/homeopathy) Homeopathy looks for substances that produces the same symptoms that a non healthy individual experiences. It became so popular that at the turn of the 19th century, many schools, hospitals and pharmacies existed that focused on this method. It was only with the modern rise of pharmaceuticals did it get pushed to the back of the bus, only to used by a small group of practitioners. Its popularity is gaining fast ground to the the wonderful results people from all over are having. [Detoxification >](/naturopathic-medicine/detoxification) What is detoxification? Many people don't really realize this or havent thought about it, but we live in a very toxic world. What many people also do not realize is that the toxins we are exposed too can have a very serious, sometimes life threatening effect upon ones health. Did you know that the average person is exposed to more than 200 toxic (disease causing) substances before even leaving for work in the morning. These toxins were never meant to be tolerated by the body as they are in our world today. [Orthomolecular Nutrition >](/naturopathic-medicine/orthomolecular-nutrition) In 1968 the term \"orthomolecular\" was coined by Dr. Linus Pauling, a chemist, and winner of two Nobel Prizes in different fields (chemistry and peace), and the only person in history to have two unshared prizes. The idea is that this type of therapy uses the right molecule or substances to balance ones individual biochemistry. To be even more specific, it is using vitamins, minerals, aminos acids, enzymes, etc...to bring about balance within the human body. [Alkaline/Acid Diet >](/naturopathic-medicine/alkaline-acid-diet) A fantastic book called \" [The pH Miracle: Balance Your Diet, Reclaim Your Health](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446556181/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cosricnon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0446556181)\" by Dr. Robert O. Young explains how achieving this balance in your body can literally transform your health. I have seen these principles in action not only in my own life, but in the life of others and the results are very clear. It is a great way to understand how great health can be achieved. So what is it about? The first thing to understand is pH and how the body works to maintain and balance pH. [Kinesiology >](/naturopathic-medicine/kinesiology) The study of movement, otherwise known as kinesiology is in some places a regulated health profession that is used in rehabilitation, physical and occupational therapy, and in the sport and exercise world. Applied kinesiology or muscle response testing is an off shoot that is a very powerful tool that can be used as a way to look at imbalances that may be causing dis-ease in the body. Many alternative practitioners use this as a way to allow the body to \"speak\", letting the client know where an adjustment may need to be made. [Bach Flower Remedies >](/naturopathic-medicine/bach-flower-remedies) Many ancient cultures around the world have used flowers for medicinal purposes. Dr. Edward Bach was born in England in 1886 and became a doctor in his early 20's. He became a renowned English physician and bacteriologist. Much like Dr. Hahnemann (the father of homeopathy), Bach became very dissatisfied with the medicine of his day and how so much of the efforts were focused on the actual disease and not on the person. [Light Touch Treatments >](/naturopathic-medicine/light-touch-treatment) This therapy, otherwise known by other names such as Spinal Touch Treatment, Body Mechanics or Light Skin Therapy, is an incredible way to recalibrate the body internally, that allows for sending corrective signal and messages to the structural, cellular and energetic system of the body. In other words, it is a way for the body to realign itself naturally so that the flow of communication from the brain and nervous system can open up and be non obstructed. [Reflexology >](/naturopathic-medicine/reflexology) Reflexology is a technique of applying pressure to reflex areas on the hands and/or feet. These areas correspond to and mirror a reflection of the entire body. The right foot corresponds to the right half of the body and the left foot to the left side of the body. It is the same with the hands. The theory of reflexology is that the organs, nerves, glands and other parts of the body are all represented or connected by these areas founds in the hands and feet.
