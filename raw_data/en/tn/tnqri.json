Clinicians can diagnose autism through a brief questionnaire, without any laboratory testing. The latest diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of ASD is described. Rather than viewing it as another diagnostic \"label\" for the patients, early recognition and management of comorbid ASD in PWS may have a significant long-term positive impact on the course of the illness. ASD-related language dysfunction can range from the patient being nonverbal all the way to near-normal cognitive and language functioning. Systemic advantages of being diagnosed with ASD are discussed, including entitlement to certain educational and healthcare services as delineated by state and federal governments. Securing these benefits is an important first step for patients. A case of a patient with PWS who also has autism is described to further elucidate the phenomenon of comorbidity. The advantages of therapies including applied behavioral analysis (ABA) as well as psychopharmacologic management are discussed.
