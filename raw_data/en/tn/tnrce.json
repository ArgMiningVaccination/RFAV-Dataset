When criteria for inclusion in the PMS 310- 1 (https://www.nwcg.gov/publications/310- 1) are not met for a position, wildland fire agencies have the option to establish agency -specific positions and standards for those positions based on unique missi ons and needs. Agencies that utilize positions not contained in the PMS 310 -1, broadly referred to as Technical S pecialists, typically establish minimum standard s for these positions in agency- specific manuals or guides. The federal wildland fire agencies have consolidated these other positions into a single supplement to better support their use and mobilization. The Federal Wildland Fire Qualifications Supplement includes federal agency -sponsored positions that are not included in the 310- 1 and reflected in the Incident Qualification Certification System (IQCS) which are frequently used on wildland fire incidents. Positions and associated requirements listed in this supplement have been approved for inclusion by representatives from the ir respective agenci es. This supplement lists established minimum requirements for training, experience, physical fitness level, and currency standards for all participating agencies. Where necessary, these positions include training to meet NIMS requirements. This supplement incorporates by reference all applicable qualification and certification business practices from the PMS 310- 1 and other agency guides. HOW T O USE THIS SUPPLEMENT The appearance of a particular agency's emblem at the top of a qualification description pag e indicates acceptance and use of the position by that respective agency ; absence of an emblem indicates the position is not used by that agency. When an agency has requirements for a position that differ from common requirements, the additional requiremen ts will be listed under the section titled Agency -Specific Requirements. The absence of additional agency -specific requirements indicates universal acceptance by all participating agencies of the common requirements listed on the qualification description page. When additional requirements apply for an agency, the position must be added to an incident responder 's IQCS records under the respective agency set id. Position t ask books for all agency- endorsed positions in this supplement are available for download on the NWCG Agency -Specific Task Books (https://www.nwcg.gov/publications/position- taskbooks ) This supplement will be updated annually or as needed. Proposed changes or additions to this document or position criteria should be channeled through a respective wildland fire agency training representative for approval and inclusion. iv January 2023 (This page intent ionally left blank.) v January 2023 TABLE O F CONTENTS Introduction .............................................................................................................................................. iii How to Use This Supplement .................................................................................................................. iii Table of Contents ...................................................................................................................................... v OPERATIONS .............................................................................................................................. 1 Assistant Hotshot Superintendent (IHCA) ................................................................................................ 3 ATV Operator ............................................................................................................................ .......................................................................................................... 5 ............................................................................................................................ 6 8 Operator (ENOP) ........................................................................................................................ 10 Fireline ...................................................................................................... .......................................................................................... 16 Military Crew Liaison Advisor (MCAD) ............................................................................................... 17 Strike Team Leader Military (STLM) ..................................................................................................... 18 Specialty Tracked Equipment Operator (STOP) ..................................................................................... 19 Tractor Plow Operator (TPOP) ............................................................................................................... 20 Tractor Plow Operator Initial Attack (TPIA) .......................................................................................... 22 UTV Operator (UTVO) .......................................................................................................................... 24 Water Tender ............................................................................................................ 25 AVIATION .................................................................................................................................. 27 Aerial Observer (AOBS) ......................................................................................................................... 29 Agency Aviation Military Liaison (AAML) ........................................................................................... 30 Airspace Coordinator (ASCO) ................................................................................................................ 31 Air Tactical Supervisor (AITS) ............................................................................................................... 32 Aviation Fuel Specialist (AFUL) ............................................................................................................ 34 Aviation Inspector (AVIN) ..................................................................................................................... 35 Fixed or Rotor Wing Pilot (PILO) .......................................................................................................... 36 Forward Looking Infrared Operator ........................................................................................... 37 Helicopter Cargo Letdown 63 Security Guard (SECG) .......................................................................................................................... 65 Securi ty Specialist Level 1 (SEC1) ......................................................................................................... 66 Security Specialist Level 2 (SEC2) ......................................................................................................... 67 FINANCE .................................................................................................................................... 69 Accounting Technician (ACCT) ............................................................................................................. 71 Buying Team Leader (BUYL) ................................................................................................................ 72 Buying (BUYM) .............................................................................................................
