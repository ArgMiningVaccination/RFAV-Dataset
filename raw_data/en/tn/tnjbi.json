It not only offers consolidated data on member companies' AMR-related actions and partnerships, but it also gives an account of a variety of antimicrobial products and diagnostic tools that are already available on the market or in development. The report includes a number of case studies from all four sectors of the life sciences industry.

However, because of the way in which antibiotic manufacturing discharges trigger resistance in bacteria present in the environment, spreading to human pathogens which then travel the world, antibiotic pollution puts everyone at risk, wherever they live.
