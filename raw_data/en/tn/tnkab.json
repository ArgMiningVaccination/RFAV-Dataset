By Isabella Yang For a long time in Japan, physical health was regarded as a reflection of spiritual aspects. Illnesses were linked to the invasion of evil spirits, and doctors were often believed to be driving those spirits outside patients' bodies. Kyoto National Museum has today a set of Heian period (ca. 12 Century) \"Illness Scrolls,\" in which sick people are portrayed as resembling spirits from hell in religious bhavacakra/rokudoue paintings (paintings of samsara). [[1]](#_ftn1) A treatment scene of cholera in medieval Japan can be seen in \"Woman with Cholera\" (Fig. 1), where the woman, with the help of a doctor wearing a monk-like head cover, vomits dark liquid into a bowl, repelling the uncleanness from her body. [[2]](#_ftn2) Next to the doctor and the patient can be seen a woman holding a bowl of medicine and another making medicine in a mortar. The scroll has an overall tone resembling that of religious samsara paintings, pointing to the link between treatment and spirituality in Japanese traditions. This connection between traditional spirits and diseases is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture; therefore, when modern methods of disease control were first enforced in late 19th century, visual representations of such methods still incorporated traditional elements. One example would be Saga Prefecture Library's \"Smallpox Vaccine Scroll\" (Fig. 2), painted around 1850. On the scroll, the smallpox vaccine is portrayed in a humanized form as a child warrior riding on the back of a giant cow (since smallpox vaccines are taken from cows), holding a spear and driving a dark-skinned demon away. The demon, holding a small child covered in smallpox, seems to be letting go of the child as a result of the spear. For countrymen who did not necessarily have much knowledge about what vaccines were, the picture served as a tool to facilitate their understanding by tying together tradition and modern medication. Similar personifications occurred to other diseases during this period: when the English name of cholera reached Japan, the Japanese translated the pronunciation into kanji characters and made a new name, \"korera,\" with the first character meaning \"tiger.\" As a result of this name, a new traditional demon representing the korera was designed, one with a tiger-like body, sharp teeth and a long tail. On a poster with instruction on how to treat cholera, \"Advice on Preventing the Cholera Pandemic\" (Fig. 3), the korera demon appears in the background among lines of health suggestions. At the bottom of the poster is a cholera patient being treated by several other people, but most of the poster contain verbal information on how to prevent cholera from spreading, such as cleaning the patient's body, drinking fresh water & etc. What is worth noting is that the demonized form of cholera takes up about one fourth of the space, surrounded by the advice, indicating the continued mixing of folklore and public health messages in Japan. As Japan modernized in the early 20th century, more \"progressive\" representations of doctors and patients started to emerge. One example would be Ota Chou's painting, \"Vaccination\" (Fig. 4), which depicts a fascinating scene of a doctor and a patient. Not only are traditional elements nowhere to be seen, the gender roles portrayed also differ from many other depictions. While on the previous poster three women are seen looking after the male patient, they look more like maids than doctors. However, Chou's painting depicts a female doctor professionally vaccinating another female patient. This portrayal is quite peculiar for early modern Japan: while women started working in the early 20th century, an occupation with as high social status as a doctor is very rare. [[3]](#_ftn3) The painting, going against gender stereotypes during the time, weakens the presumed gendered power structure in traditional doctor-patient depictions and creates a scene more \"modern\" in many senses.
