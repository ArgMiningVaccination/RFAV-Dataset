VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 2021 -2022 25 UMC program are aw arded based on the successful completion of all graduation requirements for each program. D etails regarding each program's graduation requ irements are provided in the progra m-specific section of this catalog. All programs require students to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress, the standards fo r which are outl ined in this Catalog. All studen ts are required by V UMC to complete an ex it interview prior to gradua tion. Also, in order to graduate, student s must have no outstandi ng financial balance with V UMC Center for Programs in Allied Health (this does not include educational loans to third -party lenders). SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS (Q UALITATIVE AND QUAN TITATIVE ELEMENTS) All VUMC Students are required to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). SAP is a measure that consists of both qualitative (e.g., grades) and quantitative (e.g., number of hours completed in the clinical setting) measurements. B oth measurements are evaluated on a regular basis for each program. Details about the timing and frequency of SAP review for each program a re contained in the program- specific sections of this catalog. Each program's SAP requirements are also stated within each program section of this catalog. In order to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress, a student must meet at all times the minimum standards established by each program for both qu alitative and quantitative measures. This VUMC Satisfactory Acade mic Progress policy applies to all VUMC students. These standards are con sistently applied by each program to its students, regardless of financial aid status. In order to graduate, a student must successfully complete all courses in the program with the designated minimum score for passing (which varies from program to program). Qualitative Elements of SAP Qualitative Elements of SAP - General Information - Qualitative measurement consists of a student's grades, whether expressed numerically or with letter grades (see Grading Scale chart below). Some programs may calculate these grades into a cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA). Some courses may be graded according to the pass/fail system . Some programs use competency-based a ssessment as a qu alitative measure in ad dition to a grading scale. In these cases student performance of competency- related tasks is assessed in order to determine whether or not a student has obtained competency (pass) or not (fail). Each program-specific section of this catalog provides addition al details regarding each p rogram's qualitative measurement. Qualitative Elements of SAP -- Grading Scale* Qualitative Elements of SAP -- Grading Scale* Scale Grade Definition GPA 100-90% A Excellent 4.0 89-80% B Good 3.0 79-70% C Satisfactory 2.0 69-0%** F Inadequa te** 0.0 P Pass - Any course with a \"P\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. F Fail - Any course with an \"F\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. However, the course must be repeated and passed to gradua te. VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 2021 -2022 26 I Incomplete - May be used at the discretion of the instructor in those cases in which the student is not able to complete work in the normal time. In those instances, the student and instructor develop a written plan for an extension to provide work by a specific d ate that falls within the period of time spec ified by the relevant program's requirements (but in no circumstances greater than one month). An \"I\" that is not replaced by a letter grade within the period of time specified by the relevant program's requirements, due to un satisfactory completion of the student's plan, will be changed to an F a fter the period specified by the program (a period not to exc eed one month). Any course with an \"I\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. Once a grade is assigned to the course (when con ditions are met that allow for the removal of the \"I\" and a ssignment of a final grade), that grade will factor into the student's GPA. W\u00b1 Withdrawal - Utilized when a student leaves the course due to an approved leave-of-absence or withdraws from the school prior to the sched uled completion of a course. Any course with a \"W\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. R Repeat - Some programs allow students to repeat courses. In those programs, for any course that is repeated, a Repeat will be provided as the grade for the first attempt at the course. Any course with an \"R\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. H owever, cou rses will be considered h ours / credit hours attempted for the purpose of determining maximum time frame. P lease refer to each program's student handbook for information abo ut whether students are allowed to repeat courses in any given program. *Programs may, at their discretion, subdivide each grade into categories indicating plus (+) or minus (-) performance for a given grade level on the grading scale (e.g., A-, B+, C+, etc .). Indiv idual program sections of this catalog contain information on p rogram-specific grading systems. **Programs may, at their discretion, establish a failing grade threshold higher than the institutional minimum failing grade as indicated abov e (69 and lower). Individua l program grading sections in this catalog provide program-specific information on failing grade thresholds. Under no circumstances may a program establish a failing grade threshold lower than the institutional threshold grade (69 and lower). All programs must apply and enforce their failing grade thresholds uniformly among students enrolled in the program. \u00b1 Non-puniti ve grades for courses awarded by the school include \"W\". Non-punit ive grades are not included in the computation of a student's overall Cumulative Grade or Point Average. The clock hours or credit hours associated with any courses for which non-puniti ve grades are assigned a re include d as credits attempted when calculating the student's Maximum Time Frame and c redit completion pe rcentage. Qualitative Elements of SAP -- Minimum Average Required for Satisfactory Academic Progress - All students must maintain a minimum qualitative average (expressed as percentage points, grades, GPA and /or competencies passed) as defined by each program in order to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress. Students must achieve the minimum qualitative average at each review of SAP to maintain Satisfa ctory Academic Progress. Students not maintaining SAP will face remedial action, up to and including dismissal from the program. The table below presents the minimum qualitative average required for each program. M ore detailed information is available in the program-spec ific section of this catalog for each program. VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 2021 -2022 27 Program Name Term 1 Term 2 Term 3 Term 4 Dietetic Internship 70% average (rotations & assignments) 80% average (rotations & assignments) Medical Laboratory Science 75% average 75% average Diagnostic Medical Sonography 75% average 75% 75% 75% 75% per course 75% per course Studen ts not completing required coursework or hours will be assigned a failing grade for the course. Additi onal adverse actions may also arise from not completing required co ursework or hours. Non-Credit / Remedial Courses / Proficiency Credit - VUMC does not offer non-credit or remedial cou rses, or grant proficiency credit. Student Grievance Concerning Grades - Students should seek redress of a problem with a grade as soon as possible after receiving the grade and in no case later than one (1) week after the grade is released. Students should confer directly with the course director about grade concerns. Every effort should be m ade to resolve the problem fairly and promptly at this level. If the student cannot resolve the problem through discussion with the course director, the student should formally request an appeal from the P rogram Director within one (1) week of talking with the course director. If the Program Director is the cou rse director in question, the appeal should be made to the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health. The decision of any appeal is final. Quantitative Elements of SAP For all programs, the quantitative measurement of SAP consists of a student's satisfactory completion of program hours, based on a rate-of-progress calculation. The rate of progress calculation is the percentage of total hours completed of those hours the student has attempted. This measurement ensures that all students progress at a rate sufficient to allow them to complete their programs within the maximum time allowed. Each program establishes a number of hours to be attempted a nd a number required to be completed in order for the student to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress. M ore information is available in each program's section in this catalog, but an o utline of program requirements is presented in the following table. Students' progress against quantitativ e SAP requirements is measured at least once a term. There are two instituti onal terms per academi c year. The first term is defined as the period b etween July 1 and December 31. The second term is defined as the period between January 1 and June 30. Sc hedules for each pr ogram' s rotations and other program elements may have differe nt starting and e nding dates from the institution al term dates. Transfer and Readm itted Students/Students Changing Majors If a student transfers to VUM C from another postsecon dary institutio n, the transfe r credits that were acce pted by VUM C will count as credits attempted a nd credit s completed for purposes of calculating the student's quantitativ e progress. The corresp onding grades will not count toward the student's qualitativ e progress. If a student is re-admitt ed into VUMC , changes program of study, or seeks to earn an a ddition al credential, the credits that are applicable to the stud ent's current program of study will be included in de termi ning the student's VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 2021 -2022 28 satisfac tory acad emic progres s standing and the appropriate evaluation level for the student in terms of establis hing the total number of credit s attempted and completed at each of the student's evaluation periods. Students receiving federal finan cial aid may repeat a course in accordance with the VUM C academic po licy. Credits from both course attempts will be counted in total credits attempted and in minimum cu mulative credits completed at VUMC , but only the highest grade earned will be included in the calculation of minimum cumulative GPA. Cred its from both cou rse attempts will also count towards the Maximum Time Frame for Completion. Students may receive financial aid for each repeated course provided that a student may not repeat a passed cours e more than o nce. Progress Evaluations and Reports Each student's progress in completing the program is reviewed du ring a progress evaluation monthly. During these reviews the student's Cumulative Grade (or Point) Average and rate of progress in co mpleting program hours are discussed with the student, and the student receives acad emic, attendance and/or financial aid advising from the scho ol, as the school deems nece ssary. Students will receive a written progress report containing a summary of the student's grades and successfully completed hours. Students are notified in writing shou ld they fail to meet the minimum standards of Satisfa ctory Academic Progress during an e valuation period/term. Students who fail to maintain SAP in an evaluation p eriod are placed on SAP Warning, unless there are two or fewer terms left in the program following the term for which the evaluation is provided, in which case the student will be placed on Academic Probation. More information on Academic Probation is contained in the Academic Probation section of this catalog. SAP Wa rning: Each program establishes a timeframe for its SAP warning period, but in no case does a SAP Wa rning Period last more than one term. Student loan funds may be disbursed during SAP Warning pe riods. When placed on SAP Warning, students are provided n otification in writing that outlines the reasons why the student has been placed on SAP Warning and the requirements the student must meet in order to be removed from SAP Wa rning (an \"Academic Plan\"). The Academic Plan is designed to bring the student into compliance with Satisfactory Acade mic Progress standards within a single term. The student's Academic Plan and progress toward its completion will be reviewed with the student during the pe riod of SAP Warning according to the details of the Plan. At the end of the Warning period, if the minimum standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress are not met a student will be placed on Academic Probation. Students who satisfy the conditions of Satisfactory Acade mic Progress at the end of the Warning period will be returned to Satisfactory Academic Progress status. School personnel, including the appropriate instructor, the Program Director, the Assistant Program Director, and/or the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health are available to discuss any conc erns students may have. Academic Probation Students failing to maintain Satisfa ctory Academic Progress as defined by their program may , at the d iscreti on of the program, be placed on academic probation. When placed on a cademic probation, students are provided writte n notificatio n that outline s the reasons why the student has been placed on p robation and the requirements the student must meet in order to be remov ed from probatio n (an \" Academic Plan\"). The Academic Plan is designed to bring the student into compliance with Satisfact ory Acade mic Progress standards within a designated period of time as defined by the Program Direc tor in the Acade mic Plan. The student' s Academic Plan and progre ss toward its completion will be reviewed with the student during the period of Probation according to the details of the Plan. VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 2021 -2022 29 Students are not allowed to have more than one period of probation while enrolled in their program. Students on probation who do not successfully complete the terms of their Academic Plan will be provided the o pportunity to withdraw. If the student refuses to withdraw , he or she will be dismissed from the program. Studen ts on probation who successfully complete the terms of their Academic Plan will return to Satisfactory Academic Progress standing, and a cademic probation status will be removed. Academic Probation Appeal - Students who have been placed on academic probation may appe al the probation decision. To do so, the student must submit an a ppeal request to the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health in writing (email is acceptable) within five (5) working days of being placed on probation. The appeal request must include: Information about the circumstances or events that prevented the student from maintaining Satisfa ctory Academic Progress, and What has changed in the student's situation to allow the student to be successful in the future. The student may submit documentation along with the appeal request. The Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health will review the appeal and any documentation submitted by the student. The Director will also speak with involved faculty and staff. The student will be notified of the outcome of the appe al in writing within five (5) business days of the appeal submission. The decision of the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health is final. If the appe al is not successful, probation status will continue until 1) the student meets the require ments of the Academic Plan and returns to Satisfactory Acade mic Progress status, or 2) the student fails to meet the requirements of the Academic Plan and subsequently withdraws or is dismissed from the program. If the appe al is successful, the student will not be placed on probation, but the program may impose requirements the student must complete in order to return to Satisfactory Acade mic Progress. Student Dismissal Policy Students who have been placed on p robation and do n ot return to Satisfactory Academic Progress status within the time required by their Academic Plan will be given the opportunity to withdraw or be dismissed from the program. Studen ts may also be dismissed from the program after a period of temporary suspension. Students dismissed from VUMC programs are required to immediately return to VUMC their student IDs and any books, equ ipment or other materials issue d to them by VUMC. VUMC programs pursue dismissal only after a student has been given a reasonable period of warning and /or probation to address deficiencies. Dismissal may also be recommended at any time for a student who demonstrates either a singular egregious behavior or is involved in one or more serious incidents inconsistent with the expectations for students of VUMC, or in violation of VUMC policy. A decision to pursue dismissal requires participation of the program director and relevant program faculty and administrators. The Program Director will meet with the student to hear the student's explanation, including any mitigating circumstances in the situation. The Program Director will then meet with relevant program faculty and administrators to co nsider factors in the situation a nd render a de termination. The dismissal decision is described in a notice to the student written by the Program Director. This communication is presented to the student, in person whenever possible, by the Program Director, although an i n-person meeting may not be possible in all cases. Student Dismissal Appeal - A student who is dismissed from a VUMC program has the right to appeal. Each appeal is decided on a n individual basis. The process for appealing a dismissal decision is as follows: The student must submit a written appeal to the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health. The appeal must be submitted at least one month prior to the start of the term in which the student wishes to be granted entrance into the program. VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 2021 -2022 30 Appeals must include a detailed e xplanation of the circumstances related to the dismissal. As relevant, such appeals should include official/professional documentation (i.e. medical records, cou rt documents, or any other documentation which would support an ap peal). The appeal will be reviewed by the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health, and app roved or denied based on the student's individual circumstances, past academic record, and po tential to successfully complete the program. The Program Director will provide a written decision to the student within fourteen (14) business days. The decision on the dismissal appeal is final. If the student is allowed to re-enroll, the Program Director may place conditions that the student must meet in order to be reinstated. The Program Director may also reinstate the student on a probationary basis. Reinstatement is based on class and space availability. If studen ts who are reinstated a re required to repeat coursework, that coursework must be satisfactorily completed in order to continue in the program. Reinstated students must maintain VUMC student accounts in good standing and may not default on any loan. VUMC reserves the right to terminate a student's enrollment if, during the student's program of study, VUMC determines that the student has failed to maintain the minimum standards of satisfactory academic progress, or has reached the maximum timeframe (150% of the program credits/hours) without succ essfully completing the program; failed to comply with the VUMC rules and regulations as published in VUMC's Catalog; or has failed to meet their financial obligations. Any refund due to the student or other agencies will be calculated and refunded according to the Tuition Refund Policy. A student who has been dismissed for failure to maintain SAP may reapply for admission; however, until SAP status is re-established, the student will not be eligible for any form of federal financial aid. A student making app lication for re-admission must first satisfy all current requirements for admission. In addition, if a student's enrollment was terminated for failure to maintain SAP, the applicant's academic records will be evaluated to determine if it is possible for a satisfactory cumulative grade point average to be achieved and if the program can be completed within the maximum time frame. Temporary Student Suspension VUMC reserves the right to temporarily suspend a student for conduct disrupting or otherwise negatively affecting the learning environment, pen ding consideration of the student's situation by the Program Director and other relevant program faculty and a dministrators.

Fee dback from current students and graduates is critical to understanding the pe rformance of the institution and the programs. Students and graduates are encouraged to participate in these surveys, given the importance of this feedback. Surveys of students and graduates include at least: Course evaluations (administered by programs following conc lusion of courses) Student satisfaction survey (administered by VUMC at least once a year) Graduate satisfaction survey (administered by VUMC at least once a year) Program-spec ific surveys of students (details are available in each program's Program Handboo k) Attendance Atten dance is an essen tial component of success in VUMC programs. St udents enrolled at the institution make a commitment to pa rticipate fully in their education by attending classes, clinical rotations, and o ther educational activities as required by their program of study, and a ccounting for any absences acc ording to program policy. Each program establishes its detailed tardiness, absence and make-up time po licies and procedures. Please refer to the program-specific Program Handbook for more information. It is the student's respons ibility to address any issues related to his/her attendance. A student has the opt ion to determine with the course instructor (in consultation with t he Program D irector, if needed) whether and under what condit ions make -up work will be permitted or requ ired. All programs have processes to allow for absence in cases of emergency, of illness, of the death of a close relative, or when observing a religious holiday. See program-spec ific information in this catalog for further details. Each program has policies regarding unexcused consecutive absences and consequences for such, up to and including dismissal from the program. VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 2021 -2022 33 Leaves of Absence VUMC offers students the option to take a leave of absence from study at VUMC for medical, family or o ther reasons. Students must request the leave of absence in ad vance, except in emergency case s. The student must submit a written request to Program Director, indicating the beginning and ending dates of the leave. A dditiona l documentation to supp ort the request may be required (e.g., medical records, legal records). Each student's request is evaluated on an individual, case-by-case basis. A student may be granted a leave of absence not to exceed a total of 180 calendar days in a 12-month pe riod. Students may take no more than one leave of absence while enrolled in a VUMC program. Time spent in a VUMC- approved leave-of-absence counts toward the maximum allowable time to complete any VUMC program. Exceptions cannot be made to each program's maximum time for completion (150% of normal program length) for student leave-of-absence or for any other reason. Acade mic plans are developed to accommodate students' needs upon returning from leave of absence. At the discretion of the Program Director, students returning from a leave of absence may be required to co mplete coursework in a different academic year than the one in which they matriculated. Student s may be required to present medical documentation in order to return from medical leave-of-absence.

VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 2021 -2022 40 OTHER ADM INISTRATIVE POLICIES Anti-Harassment, Nondiscrimination, and Anti- Retaliation Vanderbilt University Medical Center (\"VUMC\") is an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirm ative Action Employer. VUMC's Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action P olicy is reflected in the following statements (full policy is available online, at https://hr.vumc.org/policies/anti -harassment I. POLICY It is important that Vanderbilt University Medical Center (\"VUMC\") faculty, and staff enjoy an environment free from implicit and explicit behavior used to control, influence, or affect the well- being of any member of the VUMC community. Harassment of or discrimination against individuals based on their race, sex, religion, color, national or ethnic origin, age, disability, veteran s tatus, or genetic information i or any other characteristic protected under applicable federal or state law is unacceptable and grounds for disciplinary action, and also constitutes a v iolation of federal and/or state law. Equally unacceptable within VUMC is the harassment of or discrimination against individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation ii , gender ide ntity iii , or gender expression iv . For purposes of this policy, harassment is any verbal or physical conduct designed to threaten, intimidate or coerce an employee, co -worker or any person working for or on behalf of VUMC. Verbal taunting (including racial and ethnic slurs) that, in the emp loyee's opinion, impairs his or her ability to perform his or her job is included in the definition of harassment. II. GENERAL PROVISIONS A. Sexual Harassment: Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination. It is illegal under state and federal law and is a violation of VUMC policy. Sexual harassment is prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972, and other applicable federal and state laws. Sexual harassment may take different forms. The foll owing examples of sexual harassment are intended to be guidelines and are not exclusive when determining whether there has been a violation of this policy: Verbal sexual harassment may include, without limitation, innuendoes, suggestive comments, jokes of a sexual nature, sexual propositions, lewd remarks and threats; requests for any type of sexual favor (this includes repeated, unwelcome requests for dates); and verbal abuse or \"kidding\" that is oriented toward a prohibitive form of harassment, including that which is sexual in nature and unwelcome. Nonverbal sexual harassment may include, without limitation, the distribution, display or discussion of any written or graphic material, including calendars, posters and cartoons that are sexually suggestive o r show hostility toward an individual or group because of sex; suggestive or insulting sounds; leering; staring; whistling; obscene gestures; content in letters and notes, facsimiles, e- mail, photos, text messages, tweets and Internet postings; or other fo rm of communication that is sexual in nature and offensive. Physical sexual harassment may include, without limitation, unwelcome, unwanted physical contact, including touching, tickling, pinching, patting, brushing up against, hugging, cornering, kissing and fondling and forced sexual intercourse or assault. The Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Education sets forth sexual harassment under Title IX as conduct can include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, no nverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature by an employee, by another student, or by a third party that is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive to limit a student's ability to participate in or benefit from an education program or activity, o r to create a hostile or abusive educational environment. VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 2021 -2022 41 B. Racial and Other Harassment in the Work Environment: Harassment against individuals on the basis of their race, color, religion, or national origin is a form of unlawful discrimination and is pro hibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other applicable federal and state laws. When harassment based on an individual's race, color, religion, or national origin has the \"purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individu al's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment,\" it rises to the level of unlawful discrimination. In addition, these principles apply to harassment on the basis of age, disability, leave status and genetic inf ormation under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, respectively. Finally, VUMC, through its nondiscrimination statement, applies these principles to harassment on the basis of an individual's sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. The following examples of harassment are intended to be guidelines and are not exclusive when determining whether there has been a vi olation of this policy: Verbal harassment includes comments that are offensive or unwelcome regarding a person's nationality, origin, race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, body, disability or appearance, including epithets, slurs and negative stereotyping.

S tudents who do not complete required work or hours in a course wi ll be assigned a fa iling grade for the course. Letter grades are assigned and 'clock hours' recorded on final transcripts. Because the certi ficate program does not grant credits, G rade Point Averages ( GPAs) are not calcu lated. Student Clinical Assessment The DMS Program Clinical Education Plan guides student cl inical assessment, and is divided into the follo wing two (2) sect ions of required c linical performance evaluations: 1. Technical Competencies - These are unique skill sets, outlined in the DMS Program Technical Competencies Plan, which appears in the DMS Program Handbook. The technical competencies provide a pathway for progress ive skill development from basic patient care and portions of abdominal, gynecological, and obstetrical exams to complete exams and advanced imaging skills. Each technical competency must be practiced multiple times during the student's time in the progra m, with observation and rating by credentialed clinical staff (preceptors). Variable levels of assistance by the preceptor are permitted, but students must meet the minimum requirements of competence, as described in the Technical Evaluation Criteria table , which also appears in the Program Handbook. Specific deadlines for successfully completing the required number of technical competencies are specified in each clinical syllabus. 2. Technical Competency Challenges - In addition to achieving the required tech nicalcompetencies as described above, the student is required to pass Technical CompetencyChallenges during each clinical practicum in order to document progressive entry level skill development and complete satisfactory clinical requirements. Technical Co mpetency Challenge requirements are described in the DMS Program VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 2021 -2022 65 Handbook. Technical Competency Challenges may be performed only after 70% of assigned Technical Competencies are satisfactorily completed. Technical Competency Challenges may only be complet ed with designated, appropriately credentialed clinical staff (Clinical Instructors). Minimal levels of assistance are permitted (as described in the Technical Evaluation Criteria table). Student s who are not successful in completing a Techn ical Competenc y Challenge must complete additional repe titions of one or more competencies and consu lt with the program director before he or she may repeat the Technical Competency Challenge. T wo unsuccessful attempts at the same Technical C ompetency Challenge will result in the student being placed on S AP Warn ing, and the implementation of a w ritten plan of action required for the student to return to satisfactory academic status. Timely perform ance of Technical Competency Challenges is required, and failure to meet Ch allenges by the dates spec ified in each clini cal syllabus w ill affect C linical course grades. Entry level skills and competence are determined in the last R otation of clinical cour sework through the Final Competency Assessment with designated, appropriately credentialed Clinical Instructors.

(An opportunity will be available to condu ct this research and present it in competition or scientific paper presentation as a group p roject.) 6. Submit docu mentation for a total of twelve (12) hours of approved professional development activities. Upon satisfaction of these requirements, each student is required to participate in an Exit Interview with the Program Director prior to the release of a certificate or transcript. Other Program Policies Professional Progression, Career Advising Each student enrolled in the V UMC DMS Program has access to faculty and staff members for academic and professional advising. The Program D irector is the primary source for this type of student advising; ho wever, the student may approach other faculty members, clinical ins tructors or staff of the V UMC Ultrasound and/or Radiology Department. Other Center for Programs in Allied Health staff members are also available by appointment to assist students as necessary. A ll official academic advising conducted by program faculty and staff, and is documented and reta ined in the studen t's record. Employment Placement The DMS Program's accreditor ( CAAHEP) requ ires reporting of outcomes and achievement o f designated outcomes pertaining to graduate placement in a related position of employment. The DMS Program assumes that all graduates desire to obtain employment w ithin a relative short time beyond graduation (if a position is not secured prior to gradua tion). While VUMC does not guarantee employment offers or engage in job searches for s tudents, Program Faculty and S taff can offer assistance and advising related to searching for a position. There are numerous ways the program can assist a self -driven stud ent to secure employment. These include, but are not limited to : Notification to students about available positions Review and feedback on resume development Provide resources for conducting job searches Provide references and/or academic verification VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 2021 -2022 68 Since the DMS Program is required to report information on student employment placement to their accrediting bodies, gradua tes are asked to provide detailed information regarding employment. Necessary information will be reques ted at the E xit Intervie w. If the student has not yet obta ined employment, he or she will be expected to provide the information as soon as it becomes available. V UMC will contact graduates regarding employment status in order t o fulfil l accredit ation reporting requirements. E mployment information (including changes) is needed by the program for the first 12 calendar months beyond graduation. C ompl iance with th is request is neces sary for outcomes documentation and distribut ion of graduate achievement of designated benchmarks. G raduate credentialing rates are among the numerous ou tcomes assessed. CAAHE P requ ires repor ting for all eligible specialties. The Program exhausts a ll efforts to provide students with the informat ion and resources necessary to be successful at profess ional credent ialing exams. The ARDMS has transit ioned over the past few years to permit students at tending accredited programs the opportunity to apply and take these credentialing exa ms prior to graduation from the program. While a student may successfully complete the exams prior to graduation, the credential is not released unt il the Program Director indicates successful completion of the program (see Graduation Requirements). In or der to earn the RDMS ( Registered Diagnostic Medical Sonographer) credenti al, one must successfully complete the Sonography Principles and Instrumentation (SPI) exam AN D a corresponding Specialty exam (i.e., Abdomen, Obstetrics/ Gynecology, etc.). V UMC is ac credited as a G eneral Sonography Program that deems its students eligible to apply for and earn the RDMS credential in Abdomen and Obste trics/Gynecology. This credentia ling process results in one (1) credential in two (2) special ties. These exams m ay be taken w hile s till enro lled in the program under the following parameters: Sonography Principles and Instrumentation may be taken immediately upon satisfactory completion of the Physics coursework Specialty exams (Abdomen and Obstetrics/Gynecology) ma y be applied for and taken within the last sixty (60) days of the Academic Calendar While the D MS Program is required by its accreditors t o achieve high rates of student credentialing, it is of utmost importance to the student that appropriate credentials are obtained in the search for employment. Few employers hire graduates prior t o being credentialed, but they often offer employment w ith a condition of obtaining certain credentials. The Program Faculty and Staff expect that VUMC students, as leaders in their field, pursue the ful l credential ing for which they are e ligible prior to and upon graduat ion. Students are advised that whi le the DMS Program provides an introduction to the Vascular Technology specialty, the program does NOT have the clinical reso urces to ensure proficiency in the fu ll spectrum of vascular examinations. However, with the foundation of kno wledge gained at VUM C, many graduates have secured employment that provided the necessary additional training to prepare for the R VT (Registered V ascular Technologist) credential. A graduate can earn the R VT after gaining additional clinical training and experience, and subsequently succes sfully completing the Vascular Techno logy (VT) Specialty E xam. Additional detai ls are available from t he Program D irector for those interested.

Academic Program and Assessment Program Sequence and Delivery The 44 -week, full- time VUMC dietetic internship begins in August with a three -week orientation and concludes in June. Following the three - week orientation for 16 interns: 8 interns complete 15 weeks of disease management rotations + 2 weeks of entry level practice in disease management and 8 interns complete 15 weeks of health promotion rotations + 2 weeks of entry level practice in health promotion At mid -point of the dietetic internship (January), 8 interns previously in disease management rotations, transition into 15 weeks of health pro motion rotations + 2 weeks of entry level practice in health promotion and 8 interns previously in health promotion rotations, transition into 15 weeks of disease management rotations + 2 weeks of entry level practice in disease management At the completio n of health promotion and disease management rotations, 16 students transition into a 2 - week concentration rotation. Successful completion of this rotation confirms their ability to practice as an entry level dietitian in disease management -health promo tion practice settings. Professional Development Days are typically scheduled on most Fridays throughout the internship and include presentations by preceptors and interprofessional teams. Supervised practice and professional development day schedules are designed around 8 -hour schedules. Additional professional development experiences (i.e. qualitative research, clinic based nutrition care, community presentations, and interprofessional teaming) contribute to the overall total hours Grading Scale & Policies Grading scale information includes the following: Course Lecture Lab Practicum / Clinical Total Hours Dietetic Internship 0 0 1286.00 1286.00 Program Totals 0 0 1286.00 1286.00 VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 2021 -2022 76 At the completion of the rotation, preceptors evaluate the students' performance based on written projects, rubrics, quizzes, etc using the following grading scale: Scale Grade Definition 100-90% A Excellent 89-80% B Good 79-70% C Satisfactory 69-0% F Inadequate Additionally, the preceptor provides a professional assessment of the interns' ability to function within each practice domain. The performance levels for the practice domains are: Scale Definition Needs much improvement Needs assistance on many projects; requires guidance to achieve pre -determined objectives Approaching entry level Performs all activities with some assistance; generally, achieves pre -determined objectives Entry level Performs all activities correctly; works w/minimum assistance once guidelines are established; meets pre -determined objectives Beyond entry level Performs all activities w/great accuracy; works independentl y once guidelines are established; exceeds pre -determined objectives Internship Faculty translate preceptor professional assessment scale into objective scores as follows: Scale Grade Needs much improvement 60 = F Approaching entry level 75 = C Entry level 85 = B Beyond entry level 100 = A Professional development experiences are evaluated by Internship Faculty. These experiences enrich job ready skills development in disease management -health promotion practice settings. Competency based experiences include: Professional Development Day (c lasses include simulations, case studies, role playing) Seminar Presentation Research & Development of a Clinical Case Study and Online Business Model Interprofessional Case Collaborations Interprofessional Community Service Collaborations Qualitative Re search and Poster Presentations Internship Leadership Co -Chair Overall scores for each rotation and professional development programming are determined utilizing rubrics and objective scores from core competencies (60%) and subjective performance ratings (40%). The grading scales detailed above apply to rotation and professional development programming. At program completion , a minimum overall score of 85 must be achieved to meet requirements for receipt of a Verification Statement. The score of 85 indic ates \"entry level - performs all activities correctly; works w/minimum assistance once guidelines are established; meets pre -determined objectives \" VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 2021 -2022 77 After each rotation, students review competency grading forms during individual evaluation conferences with rotation preceptors. Students review scores on written projects, objective scores for core competencies and subjective performance ratings for professional behavior and readiness for entry level practice. The rotation grade is 60% objective (i.e. based on written projects) and 40% subjective (i.e. based on professional performance behavior and readiness to practice). If a project score is below 70, an alternative project is assigned and scored by the Internship Faculty; in consultation with the preceptor. If a student submits work late (beyond the documented and/or re -negotiated due date), a minimum of 5 points per day is deducted from the earned score. If an intern earns an overall rotation score of less than 75 in one rotation, the intern will meet wit h the Internship Director and Educational Coordinator(s) to prepare a written action plan for improvement to meet competency within a specified time period, depending on the learning needs of the intern, and within the 44 -week program. Failure to achiev e a minimum score of 75 in a second rotation will result in the intern being placed on academic probation. Mid- internship (January) students are required to have an overall average score of 75; which translates to \"approaching entry level.\" The mid -internship overall score for rotations is determined utilizing rubrics and objective scores from core competencies (60%) and su bjective performance ratings (40%). Professional development experiences are evaluated by Internship Faculty and reviewed individually with interns. Competency based experiences include: seminars, clinical case study/online business model, interprofessio nal case collaborations, community service, qualitative research/poster presentations and co - chair leadership. Overall scores for professional development experiences are determined utilizing rubrics and objective scores from core competencies (60%) and s ubjective performance ratings (40%). Grade information is accessible to students at any time in the student online learning management system (Canvas). Conferences may be scheduled at any time by the Internship Faculty or at the students' request. At p rogram completion , a minimum overall score of 85 must be achieved to meet requirements for receipt of a Verification Statement. Internship Faculty meet with each student during summary week to summarize performance in the 44 -week internship program. Failure to achieve a final overall average score of 85 will result in termination prior to or at the summary week conference. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) SAP Standards VUMC Dietetic Interns are required to maintain established program standards of competence and knowledge. Students are evaluated on a numerical rating scale (based on 100 points) by the rotation site preceptor. Additionally, Internship Faculty evaluate student professional development experiences using the same numerical rating scale (based on 100 points). The student is considered as maintaining satisfactory academic progress if he/she maintains a m inimum average score of 75% in rotations and as indicated below in these additional categories: VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 2021 -2022 78 Rotations in disease management -health promotion >=75% Required for each rotation Required mid -year grade >=75% Overall grade required at mid -year for continuance in the program Program completion - average in each domain >=75% Overall average grade required at program completion in practice domain categories I -IV Program completion -domain V >=85% Overall average grade required at program completion in practice domain category V. Program completion - total overall average >=85% Required at completion of internship; overall composite percentage out of 100 points. If an intern earns an overall rotation score of less than 75 in one rotation, the intern will meet with the Internship Director and Educational Coordinator(s) to prepare a written action plan for improvement to meet competency within a specified time period, depending on the learning needs of the intern, and within the 44 -week program. Failure to achieve a minimum score of 75 in a second rotation will result in the intern being placed on academic probation. Failure to return to satisfactory academic progress status after being placed on academic probation within the time required by th e intern's written action plan for improvement may result in dismissal from the program.

Student Assessment VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 2021 -2022 95 Grading Policies Definitions: Course: Any portion of the program that includes instruction, has its own syllabus with grading criteria, and is identified as a discrete unit of instruction on t he program calendar. Transcript grade: Several related courses may be combined for one transcript grade. Individual courses are co-requisites for the final transcript grade. When evaluating acceptable acad emic progress in the first semester, course grades are considered independe ntly of the final transcript grade. Practicum: Also called rotations. This portion of the program involves time spent in the patient care laboratory and typically takes place during the second semester. The grading scale is as follows: 90 - 100% = A 80 - 89% = B 75 -79% Below 75% = = C F Lecture/Student Laboratory (June - December): Students must attain a minimum final grade of 75% in each course. Courses that include both a lecture and student laboratory are typically weighted as follows: Lecture 70% / Laboratory 30%; Parasitology does not have a clinical practicum component so the student lab grade constitutes the transcript grade. Patient Laboratory / Clinical Practicum (January - June): The clinical practicum grade consists of three compone nts: o Technical/Performance o Theory o Behavioral Evaluation (minimum of 10% of total grade) A minimum grade of 75% is required for both the technical and theory portions of the practicum. A minimum grade of 75% is required for the behavioral evaluation. Exit Exam: Students must pass a final comprehensive exam at the end of the program year. Students have three attempts to pass the exam with a minimum passing score of at least 75%. Transcript Grades Upon co mpletion of the year of training, an of ficial transcript is sent to the State of Tennessee Medical Labo ratory Board, the American So ciety of Clinical Pathology Board of Certification or other certification organization, and, for 3+1 students, the affiliated university or college granting the bacc alaureate degree. The following breakdown groups the courses, but may be altered upon request by the acade mic affiliate. Final transcript grades are calculated using the co-requisite course grades. The most common c o-requisite course weighting is Student Lecture/Laboratory course grade (50%) and the Clinical Practicum course grade (50%). However, alternative co-requisite course weightings may occur and a re given in related co urse syllabi. Grading Transcript grades include the final grade received d uring the lecture/student laboratory and the corresponding clinical practicum for the particular course. Generally, the lecture/student laboratory and clinical practicum share equal weight for the final transcript grade (i.e., each portion is weighted at 50% so the average of the two portio ns is the final transcript grade). Deviations from this general weighting occa sionally occur if there is a large discrepancy in the length of time between the course lecture and practicum portion s. Such a deviation will be noted in the course syllabus and is designed to evenly VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 2021 -2022 96 distribute the weight, based on the time commitment required of the student in each po rtion. Individual courses are co-requisites for the final transcript grade. When evaluating Satisfactory Academic Progress, course grades are considered independently of the final transcript grade. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Students are required to maintain established program standards of competence and knowledge. An overall grade of 75% in each course, including the lecture/student laboratory and clinical practicum, is required for the successful completion of the course. Students who do not meet this requirement are removed from Satisfa ctory Acade mic Progress status and subject to a range of academic remedial actions, as outlined in this catalog under the policies of the VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health. Advanced p lacement credits are not allowed. The program and a ll related courses must be completed in their entirety for a transcript to be created and given. S tudents must successfully complete all componen ts of the program within the 13 months of the program and in the order presented. The Program Advisory Committee reserves the right to extend a student's training to make up for a deficit in a single course, but this remediation is not to extend training more than five (5) months from the end of the program year. As part of the Academic Probation, the student must independently review the presentations and other materials from the deficient coursework for a period of no more than two (2) weeks. During this time, the student will meet with the program director, educ ation coordinator, and the student support services manager to identify issues and discuss ways to improve their grades. The student will not be given time away from the typical program coursework or classes to complete this remedial work. The student is n ot allowed to be tardy or absent during this two -week period unless an emergency justifies this tardy or absence. At the end of the two -week review period, the student will take a comprehensive exam based on the material from the deficient course. The grad e from this comprehensive exam will replace the previous course grade. If the grade is less than 75%, the student will be dismissed from the program. If a student does not achieve a minimum grade of 75% in a second course, a clinical rotation, or a behav ioral evaluation, s/he is dismissed from the program. Graduation Requirements Students must achieve an overall minimal grade of 75% in all courses. Students must achieve a minimum of 75% on all Behavioral Evaluations. Students must pass their final comprehensive exam at the end of the year with a 75% or higher. Students must pay tuition and fees in full. Upon s uccessful completion of the program, students are eligible to sit for exams to receive national certification. Upon receipt of national certification by a recognized na tional agency, students become eligible for licensure from the State of Tennessee as a Medical Laboratory Technologist. Successful completion of the Program is not contingent upon passing of any national certification exam.

Please refer to each program's student handbook for information about whether students are allowed to rep eat courses in any given Students who do not complete required work or hours in a course will be assigned a failing grade for the course. Clinical Rotation E valua tions Students receive a clinical evaluation from their respective preceptor at the end of each clinical rotation week. The Program Director and/or the Clinical Coordinator will review these evaluations with each student. These evaluation conversations allow for frequent and constructive feedback to students on their professional development. These evaluations are counted toward course grades in the Clinical Rotations course series as well as the review of Satisfactory Academic Progress. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Each students' academic progress is evaluated quarterly. A student is considered to be maintaining satisfactory academic progress (SAP) by maintaining a 75 percent academic average in didactic coursework and in clinical rotations. In addition, students mus t have satisfactory attendance in order to maintain satisfactory academic progress. Prior to the determination of SAP status, the student, the Program Director and the Clinical Coordinator meet to discuss the student's progress. These meetings include dis cussion of grades in didactic courses, evaluations and performance in clinical rotations, radiation dose reports, absences, contact hours, professionalism and conduct, etc. Students are given the opportunity to discuss any questions or concerns they may ha ve related to their academic progress. Following this meeting the Program Director and the Clinical Coordinator determine whether the student is maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress.

The perfusionist prepares and operates the heart-lung machine and other sophisticated equipment as directed by healthcare physicians. The perfusionist measures various blood and other parameters to identify appropriate mecha nical, pharmacological, and thermal manipulation to maintain tissue viability. To perform these tasks the perfusionist must have a thorough und erstanding of both the physiology and an atomy of respiratory and circulatory systems and be able to operate complex eq uipment. Additionally the perfusionist must be capa ble of handling stressful situations, pay great attention to detail, communicate effectively, and be willing to stay abreast of new de velopments in the profession. The Vanderbilt Perfusion Program was founded in 1979. The program is directed in collaboration with the Vanderbilt Heart and Vascular Institute. Certification/Credentialing Upon co mpletion of the program gradua tes receive an accredited Certificate in Cardiovascular Perfusion Technology that qualifies gradu ates to apply for and take the Perfusion Basic Sciences Examination a nd the Clinical Application in Perfusion Exam administered by the American Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion (ABCP).

Offered in the Summer Semester Prerequisites: SIM 502, CR 501, RES 502, CVPT 502 Grading and Assessment Didactic Evaluation System The grading scale for the VUMC Perfusion Program is as follows: Scale Grade Definition GPA 100-95% A Excellent 4.0 94-90% A- Excellent 3.7 89-87 % B+ Good 3.3 86-83% B Good 3.0 82-80% B- Good 2.7 79-77 % C+ Satisfactory 2.3 76-75% C Satisfactory 2.0 74-0% F Inadequate 0.0 P Pass -Any course with a \"P\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. F Any course with an \"F\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. However, the course must be repeated and passed to gradu ate. I An Incomplete may be used at the discretion of the instructor in those cases in which the student is not able to complete work in the normal time. In those instances, the student and instructor develop a written plan for an extension to provide work by a specific date that falls within the period of time specified by the relevant program's requirements (but in no circumstances greater than one month). An \"I\" that is not replaced by a letter grade within the period of time specified by the relevant program's requirements, due to unsatisfactory completion of the student's plan, will be changed to an F after the period specified by the program (a period not to exceed one month). Any course with an \"I\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. Once a grade is assigned to the course (when conditions are met that allow for the removal of the \"I\" and assignment of a final grade), tht d ill ft it th tdt' GPA W A Withdrawal is provided when a student leaves the course due to an a pproved leave-of-absence or is withdrawn from the scho ol prior to the scheduled completion of a course. Any course with a \"W\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 2021 -2022 123 Succe ssful completion of a course requires a student to receive a 75% or greater for the final grade for the course. Scores are calculated according to the derivation chart in each syllabus. Students who do not complete required work or hours in a course will be assigned a failing grade for the course. Final grades for each co urse are computed on the following bases: Students must attain a final grade of 75% in each course in order to maintain Satisfactory Acade mic Progress. Non-academic evaluations (beha vior and conduct evaluations) will be completed by instructors for academic advising and/or remediation p urposes. While these evaluations are calculated into the grade, behavior/professionalism conce rns (e.g., missing of examinations or classes, tardiness, etc.) will have negative consequen ces for the student's ability to maintain Satisfactory Acade mic Progress, putting the student at risk of SAP Warning, probation and/or dismissal from the program. Clinical Evaluation Student clinical competency is measured by means of a clinical evaluation form. The clinical evaluation form has been d esigned to address the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor learning domains of the program as well and the interpersonal domain. The form is reviewed by the student and the instructor immediately following each case. If the evaluation consistently shows lack of competency in a particular area of a student's performance, the student will receive increased instruction and practice. Extra simulation sessions facilitated and supervised by the Program Director may be required. In add ition the student will be evaluated on a mid-term evaluation and/or end of rotation evaluation by clinical instructors as outlined in the syllabus of each clinical course. The clinical evaluation scale is as following: 1. Dependent: > 90% of the time the student almost REQUIRES direction, guidance, monitoring, and support, while < 10% of the time the student EXHIBITS assertiveness, efficiency, focus, and eagerness to learn. 2. Novice: 75% of the time the student REQUIRES direction, guidance, monitoring, and support, while 25% of the time the student EXHIBITS ass ertiveness, efficiency, focus, and eagerness to learn. 3. Assisted: 50% of the time the student REQU IRES direction, guidance, monitoring, and support, while 50% of the times the student EXHIBITS assertiveness, efficiency, focus, and eagerness to learn. 4. Supe rvised: 25% of the time the student REQUIRES direction, guidance, monitoring, and suppo rt, while 75% of the times the student EXHIBITS assertiveness, efficiency, focus, and eagerness to learn. 5. Self-Directed: < 10% of the time the student REQUIRES direction, guidance, monitoring, and suppo rt, while >90% of the time the student EXHIBITS assertiveness, efficiency, focus, and eagerness to learn. Students are expected to make appropriate clinical progress over time, as outlined in each of the clinical courses' syllabus. Clinical Competence At the completion of the case requirements for each clinical level - or at any time by the request of the Program Director - the student's clinical performance is evaluated by the members of the Clinical Competency Committee. The student advances to the next clinical level by passing the preceding clinical course. VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 2021 -2022 124 Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) In order to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress through the curriculum plan, the student must achieve a grade of \"75%\" or better at all times in each course including simulation, research lab courses and clinical rotations. It is recommended that each student monitor his/her own progress according to the course syllabus. Stud ents who do n ot meet these requirements during the semester will be placed on an acade mic monitoring with a remedial action plan. Progression in the Program The program and all related courses must be completed in their entirety for a transcript to be created and given. Advanced p lacement is not allowed. All grades of Incomplete must be replaced by a final grade before a transcript can be created. Students are required to complete all compone nts of the program within the 22 months of program matriculation, and in the sequen tial order as presented in this catalog. The Program Advisory Committee reserves the right to extend a student's training to make up for a deficit in a single course, but this remediation is not to extend training more than five (5) months from the end of the program year.
