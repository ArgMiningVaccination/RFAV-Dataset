The egRNA may include a n RNA aptamer linking sequence, operably linking the [00792] escort RNA sequence t o the RNA guide sequence. I n embodiments, the egRNA may include one o r more photolabile bonds o r non-[00793] natually occurring residues.

I t i s t o b e understood that any o f the RNA guide sequences a s described herein [00796] elsewhere can b e used i n the egRNA described herein. I n certain embodiments o f the invention, the guide RNA o r mature crRNA comprises, consists essentially of, o r consists o f a direct repeat sequence and a guide sequence o r spacer sequence. I n certain embodiments, the guide RNA o r mature crRNA comprises, consists essentially of, o r consists o f a direct repeat sequence linked t o a guide sequence o r spacer sequence. I n certain embodiments the guide RNA o r mature crRNA comprises 1 9 nts o f partial direct repeat followed b y 23-25 n t o f guide sequence o r spacer sequence. I n certain embodiments, the effector protein i s a FnCpf1 effector protein and requires a t least 1 6 n t o f guide sequence t o achieve detectable DNA cleavage and a minimum o f 1 7 n t o f guide sequence t o achieve efficient DNA cleavage i n vitro. I n certain embodiments, the direct repeat sequence i s located upstream (i.e., 5') from the guide sequence o r spacer sequence. I n a preferred embodiment the seed sequence (i.e. the sequence essential critical for recognition and/or hybridization t o the sequence a t the target locus) o f the FnCpf1 guide RNA i s approximately within the first 5 n t o n the 5 ' end o f the guide sequence o r spacer sequence. The egRNA may b e included i n a non-naturally occurring o r engineered Cpf1 [00797] CRISPR-Cas complex composition, together with a Cpf1 which may include a t least one mutation, for example a mutation s o that the Cpf1 has n o more than 5 % o f the nuclease activity o f a Cpf1 not having the a t least one mutation, for example having a diminished nuclease activity o f a t least 97%, o r 100% a s compared with the Cpf1 not having the a t least one mutation. The Cpf1 may also include one o r more nuclear localization sequences. Mutated Cpf1 enzymes having modulated such a s diminished nuclease activity are described herein elsewhere. The engineered Cpf1 CRISPR-Cas composition may b e provided i n a cell, such a s [00798] a eukaryotic cell, a mammalian cell, o r a human cell. I n embodiments, the compositions described herein comprise a Cpf1 CRISPR-Cas [00799] complex having a t least three functional domains, a t least one o f which i s associated with Cpf1 and a t least two o f which are associated with egRNA. The present invention provides compositions and methods b y which gRNA-[00800] mediated gene editing activity can b e adapted. The invention provides gRNA secondary structures that improve cutting efficiency b y increasing gRNA and/or increasing the amount o f RNA delivered into the cell. The gRNA may include light labile o r inducible nucleotides. T o increase the effectiveness o f gRNA, for example gRNA delivered with viral o r [00801] non-viral technologies, Applicants added secondary structures into the gRNA that enhance its stability and improve gene editing. Separately, t o overcome the lack o f effective delivery, Applicants modified gRNAs with cell penetrating RNA aptamers; the aptamers bind t o cell surface receptors and promote the entry o f gRNAs into cells. Notably, the cell-penetrating aptamers can b e designed t o target specific cell receptors, i n order t o mediate cell-specific delivery. Applicants also have created guides that are inducible. Light responsiveness o f a n inducible system may b e achieved via the activation [00802] and binding o f cryptochrome-2 and CIB1. Blue light stimulation induces a n activating conformational change i n cryptochrome-2, resulting i n recruitment o f its binding partner CIB1. This binding i s fast and reversible, achieving saturation i n <15 sec following pulsed stimulation and returning t o baseline <15 min after the end o f stimulation. These rapid binding kinetics result i n a system temporally bound only b y the speed o f transcription/translation and transcript/protein degradation, rather than uptake and clearance sequence binding site. n esgRNA may have first and second linker sequences, 3 ' t o a protector sequence. I n alternative embodiments, linkers 1 and 2 may for example each independently b e 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , o r 4 nucleotides long, with a protector sequence o f 0 , 1 o r 2 nucleotides i n length. I n a n exemplary embodiment, induction o f esgRNA targeting may b e illustrated [00870] using miR-122 i n a HEK.293 cell system, i n which miR-122 i s not expressed natively. I n the absence o f exogenous miR-122, the protected esgRNAs d o not mediate targeted EMX1.3 nuclease activity. When exogenous miR-122 i s added (100 n g / well) targeted EMX1.3 cutting was observed (as distinct cleavage artifacts visible a s electrophoretic variants o n gels). This demonstrates that highly expressed endogenous miRNAs can b e utilized i n systems that provide genetically inducible sgRNAs. Any miRNA may b e used i n place o f miRNA122, with a corresponding sequence readily determined. For example, a n sgRNA may b e linked t o a n \"escort\" RNA aptamer sequence [00871] complementary t o a n endogenous target miRNA. The target miRNA may form a n RNA- induced silencing complex (RISC) within the cell. When the target miRNA i s present i n a cell there i s binding o f the escort RNA aptamer sequence t o the target miRNA, which results i n cleavage o f the esgRNA b y the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) within the cell. Cleavage o f the escort releases the active sgRNA. For example, a protected guide may b e described i n the following aspect: a non-[00872] naturally occurring o r engineered composition comprising a n escorted single CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA (esgRNA) comprising: a n RNA guide sequence capable o f hybridizing t o a target sequence i n a genomic [00873] locus o f interest i n a cell; and, a n escort RNA aptamer sequence, [00874] wherein the escort RNA aptamer sequence comprises binding affinity for a n [00875] aptamer ligand o n o r i n the cell, o r the escort RNA aptamer sequence i s responsive t o a localized aptamer effector o n o r i n the cell, wherein the presence o f the aptamer ligand o r effector o n o r i n the cell i s spatially [00876] o r temporally restricted.

This biomass can b e used directly for biofuels o r can b e converted t o convenient energy containing substances b y thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result i n fuel i n solid, liquid, o r gas form. There are two types o f biofuels: bioethanol and biodiesel.

These methods may also b e applied t o plants. I n particular embodiments, fusion o f inactive Cpf1 endonucleases with histone-[001150] modifying enzymes can introduce custom changes i n the complex epigenome (Rusk e t al., Nature Methods, 2014).

I n further particular embodiment, the CRISPR system, and preferably the Cpf1 CRISPR system described herein, can b e used t o disrupt o r alter chromosome number and generate haploid plants, which only contain chromosomes from one parent. Such plants can b e induced t o undergo chromosome duplication and converted into diploid plants containing only homozygous alleles (Karimi-Ashtiyani e t al., PNAS, 2015; Anton e t al., Nucleus, 2014).

I n a s cleavage for a third 4CL gene was abolished due t o SNPs i n the target sequence. These methods may b e applied t o the Cpf1 effector protein system o f the present invention. The methods o f Zhou e t al. (New Phytologist, Volume 208, Issue 2 , pages 298-[001162] 301, October 2015) may b e applied t o the present invention a s follows. Two 4CL genes, 4CL1 and 4CL2, associated with lignin and flavonoid Populus tremula \u00d7 alba clone 717-1B4 routinely used for transformation i s divergent from the genome-sequenced Populus trichocarpa. Therefore, the 4CL1 and 4CL2 gRNAs reference genome are interrogated with in-house 717 RNA-Seq data t o ensure the absence o f SNPs which could limit Cas efficiency. A third gRNA designed for 4CL5, a genome duplicate o f 4CL1, i s also included. The corresponding 717 sequence harbors one SNP i n each allele near/within the PAM, both o f which are expected t o abolish targeting b y the 4CL5-gRNA. All three gRNA target sites are located within the first exon. For 717 transformation, the gRNA i s expressed from the Medicago U6.6 promoter, along with a human codon-optimized Cas under control o f the CaMV 35S promoter i n a binary vector. Transformation with the Cas-only vector can serve a s a control. Randomly selected 4CL1 and 4CL2 lines are subjected t o amplicon-sequencing. The data i s then processed and biallelic mutations are confirmed i n all cases. These methods may b e applied t o the Cpf1 effector protein system o f the present invention. I n plants, pathogens are often host-specific. For example, Fusarium oxysporum f . sp. Puccinia graminis f . sp. triticiattacks only wheat. Plants have existing and induced defenses t o resist most pathogens. Mutations and recombination events across plant generations lead t o genetic variability that gives rise t o susceptibility, especially a s pathogens reproduce with more frequency than plants. I n plants there can b e non-host resistance, e.g., the host and pathogen are incompatible. There can also b e Horizontal Resistance, e.g., partial resistance against all races o f a pathogen, typically controlled b y many genes and Vertical Resistance, e.g., complete resistance t o some races o f a pathogen but not t o other races, typically controlled b y a few genes. I n a Gene-for-Gene level, plants and pathogens evolve together, and the genetic changes i n one balance changes i n other. Accordingly, using Natural Variability, breeders combine most useful genes for Yield, Quality, Uniformity, Hardiness, Resistance. isolates, but also have selective advantage over CCR5 gene-undisrupted cells during R5-tropic HIV-1 infection. Genome mutations a t potential off-target sites that are highly homologous t o these CCR5 guide RNAs i n stably transduced cells even a t 8 4 days post transduction were not detected b y a T 7 endonuclease I assay. Fine e t al.

With specific CRISPR guide strands, Fine e t al. demonstrated the efficacy o f this system i n cleaving the HBB and CCR5 genes i n human HEK-293T cells a s a single Cas9 and a s a pair o f Cas9 nickases. The trans-spliced SpCas9 (tsSpCas9) displayed ~35% activity with the wild-type SpCas9 (wtSpCas9) a t standard transfection doses, but had substantially decreased activity a t lower dosing levels. The greatly reduced open reading frame length o f the tsSpCas9 relative t o wtSpCas9 potentially allows for more complex and longer genetic elements t o b e packaged into a n AAV vector including tissue-specific promoters, multiplexed guide RNA expression, and effector domain fusions t o SpCas9. L i e t ( J Gen Virol. 2015 Aug;96(8):2381-93. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.000139. Epub 2015 Apr 8 ) demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9 can efficiently mediate the editing o f the CCR5 locus i n cell lines, resulting i n the knockout o f CCR5 expression o n the cell surface. Next-generation sequencing revealed that various mutations were introduced around the predicted cleavage site o f CCR5.

Considerations for Therapeutic Applications: A consideration i n genome editing [001238] therapy i s the choice o f sequence-specific nuclease, such a s a variant o f a Cpf1 nuclease. Each nuclease variant may possess its own unique set o f strengths and weaknesses, many o f which must b e balanced i n the context o f treatment t o maximize therapeutic benefit. Thus far, two therapeutic editing approaches with nucleases have shown significant promise: gene disruption and gene correction. Gene disruption involves stimulation o f NHEJ t o create targeted indels i n genetic elements, often resulting i n loss o f function mutations that are beneficial t o patients. I n contrast, gene correction uses HDR t o directly reverse a disease causing mutation, restoring function while preserving physiological regulation o f the corrected element. HDR may also b e used t o insert a therapeutic transgene into a defined 'safe harbor' locus i n the genome t o recover missing gene function. For a specific editing therapy t o b e efficacious, a sufficiently high level o f modification must b e achieved i n target cell populations t o reverse disease symptoms. This therapeutic modification 'threshold' i s determined bythefitnessofeditedcellsfollowing treatment andtheamountofgeneproduct by impairment andrestricted and patterns agar plates supplemented with ampicillin and chloramphenicol.

Bands corresponding t o un-cleaved target were gel extracted using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and the target PAM region was amplified and sequenced using a MiSeq (Illumina) with single-end 150 cycles. Sequencing results were entered into the PAM discovery pipeline. ActivityofCpf1cleavage in293FTcells Cpf1 proteins codon optimized for human expression were synthesized with a n N-[001593] terminal nuclear localization tag and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 CMV expression plasmid (Figure 5E). Collectively, these results suggest that FnCpf1 recognizes the crRNA through a combination o f sequence-specific and structural features o f the stem loop. Example 13:Cpf1-family proteinsfromdiversebacteriasharecommoncrRNAstructures and PAMs T o investigate the use o f Cpf1 a s a genome editing tool, the diversity o f Cpf1-[001608] family proteins available i n the public sequences databases wase exploited. A BLAST search o f the WGS database a t the NCBI revealed 4 6 non-redundant Cpf1-family proteins (Figure 64). 1 6 were chosen based o n our phylogenetic reconstruction (Figure 64), a s representative o f Cpf1 diversity (Figure 100A-100B and 106). These Cpf1-family proteins span a range o f lengths between ~1200 and ~1500 amino acids. The direct repeat sequences for each o f these Cpf1-family proteins show strong [001609] conservation i n the 1 9 nucleotides a t the 3 ' o f the direct repeat, the portion o f the repeat that i s included i n the processed crRNA (Figure 100C). The 5 ' sequence o f the direct repeat i s much more diverse. O f the 1 6 Cpf1-family proteins chosen for analysis, three ( 2 - MC2017, Lb3Cpf1; SsCpf1) were associated with direct repeat sequences that are notably divergent from the FnCpf1 direct repeat (Figure 100C). Notably, these direct repeat sequences preserved stem loop structures that were identical o r nearly-identical t o the FnCpf1 direct repeat (Figure 100D). Orthologous direct repeat sequences are tested for the ability t o support FnCpf1 [001610] nuclease activity invitro. Direct repeats that contained conserved stem sequences were able t o function interchangeably with FnCpf1. The direct repeat from candidate 3 (BpCpf1) supported a low level o f FnCpf1 nuclease activity (Figure 100E), possibly due t o the conservation o f the 3'-most U . A n invitroPAM identification assay (Figure 107A) was used t o determine the [001611] PAM sequence for each Cpf1-family protein. PAM sequences were identified for 7 new Cpf1- family proteins (Figures 100E and 107B-C), and the screen confirmed the PAM for FnCpf1 a s 5'-TTN. The PAM sequences for the Cpf1-family proteins were predominantly T-rich, varying primarily i n the number o f T s constituting each PAM (Figure First and betaregion, small regions primary systemcomprising "}
