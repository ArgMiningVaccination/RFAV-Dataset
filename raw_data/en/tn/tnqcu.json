Again, mistake delays proper treatment and make situation worse, more often. Compliance is crucial to obtain optimal health outcomes, such as cure or improvement in QoL. Patients may delay treatment or fail to seek care because of high out-of- pocket expenditures. Despite phenomenal development, conventional therapy falls short in cancer management. There are two major hurdles in anticancer drug development: dose-limiting toxic side effects that reduce either drug effectiveness or the QoL of patients and complicated drug development processes that are costly and time consuming. Cancer patients are increasingly seeking out alternative medicine and might be reluctant to disclose its use to their oncology treatment physicians. But there is limited available information on patterns of utilization and efficacy of alternative medicine for patients with cancer. As adjuvant therapy, many traditional medicines shown efficacy against brain, head and neck, skin, breast, liver, pancreas, kidney, bladder, prostate, colon and blood cancers. The literature reviews non-pharmacological interventions used against cancer, published trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

Citation: Introduction In 2019, 1.8 million new cancer cases and 0.6 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the USA [3](#ridm1841602156). Globally, cancer responsible for at least 20% of all mortality [4](#ridm1841663788), 18.1 million new cancer (9.5 million cases were in men and 8.6 million in women, according to AICR), 9.5 million death in 2018 [5](#ridm1841447212), [6](#ridm1841437012), 5- year prevalence 43.8 million (a nearly 67% of total cancer patients) [7](#ridm1841440828), [8](#ridm1841438380), is predicted to rise by 61.4% to 27.5 million in 2040 [9](#ridm1841425612). Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the USA and rest of the world [10](#ridm1841419756), [11](#ridm1841415724). It is estimated that there will be 18 million new cases of cancer and 9.6 million cancer deaths in 2018 (GLOBOCAN 2018). Mortality rates in LMICs were 2-fold higher for cervical cancer and 40% higher for male lung and liver cancers during 2012-2016 [3](#ridm1841602156), with around 70% of deaths from cancer reported in LMICs [12](#ridm1841384692), [13](#ridm1841332884). Asia, Africa, and Latin America are home of 50% of cancer patients collectively; with more than half of global cancer-associated mortalities occurring in Asia alone [13](#ridm1841332884). Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death (nearly 1 in 5 of all cancer death) [14](#ridm1841345412), stomach cancer is the 3rd [15](#ridm1841342964) and pancreatic cancer is the 7th [16](#ridm1841337204) leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Prostate cancer is the second most frequent cancer diagnosis made in men and the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths for males [17](#ridm1841334900). Asia and Europe are the home of more than 60% prostate cancer patients [18](#ridm1841301788). Breast cancer is prevalent in 12% of women in the USA more than 2.5 million new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2017 [19](#ridm1841298332). The rate for breast cancer declined by 35% in last 3 decades but number of deaths remain same [20](#ridm1841294300). The 3 most prevalent cancers in 2019 are prostate, colorectal and skin melanoma among males, and breast, uterine corpus, and colorectal among females [21](#ridm1841290916). Overall cancer death rates declined faster in blacks than whites in US, although rates for cancers of the breast, uterine corpus, and pancreas are increasing in black people [22](#ridm1841317628). Also, black men have a 70% higher prostate cancer and a more than 2-fold higher mortality rate compared with white men [23](#ridm1841312804). The cost of delivering cancer treatment is estimated to rise globally with a projected total spending of $458 billion by 2030 [24](#ridm1841307692). However, the financial burden stems from employment loss, cost of care even when patients don't require chemotherapy, out of pocket costs' opportunity costs of informal care time and can continue long after the death of the patient [25](#ridm1841306828), [26](#ridm1841253244). Studies say 46 billion in productivity lost in major emerging economies due to cancer [27](#ridm1841278876) and economic costs of tobacco-related cancers exceed USD 200 billion each year [28](#ridm1841277292). Also, cancer causes 2.6 times more likely to file for bankruptcy than the non-cancer people [29](#ridm1841275564). Cancer trends in young adults, reflect recent changes in carcinogenic exposures, which could foreshadow the future overall disease burden [30](#ridm1841273908). Cancer cachexia (anorexia, weight loss, loss of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle) is reported in 30%-80% cancer patients and causes 20% of all cancer deaths [31](#ridm1841269156). Worldwide, some 60%-80% people depend on alternative medicines [32](#ridm1841263036), [33](#ridm1841261884), [34](#ridm1841255836), which is also true for nearly 40% 70% European [35](#ridm1841219324), [36](#ridm1841215364), 50% Italian, 40% Korean, 30% British [37](#ridm1841208884) and up to 87% of Australian cancer patients [38](#ridm1841205860). Use of unapproved/unlabeled/wrong herbal treatment is not uncommon [39](#ridm1841200676), [40](#ridm1841198300) and also drug interactions reported phyto-therapeutics in oncology [41](#ridm1841227604). So, Proper and up-to-date knowledge is necessary in using alternative treatment options as patients who received alternative medicines had a 2.5 greater risk of dying compared to those who received conventional cancer treatment [42](#ridm1841222852). Reasons Behind Choosing Alternative Care Pain is affects approximately 66% cancer patients [43](#ridm1841167156), distressing or intolerable in more than onethird of patients [44](#ridm1841162188) and chronic pain is associated with primary cancer itself or metastases or its treatment (chronic post-cancer treatment pain) [43](#ridm1841167156), [44](#ridm1841162188), [45](#ridm1841157652), [46](#ridm1841151316). Although, WHO described opioids as essential medicines for pain control but distribution shows substantial inequity, a less than 20% of the world's population consuming more than 90% of the world's supply [46](#ridm1841151316). Also, some 85% of PCPs perceived their training in pain management to be inadequate in a Pan-European survey [47](#ridm1841146636). Along with these, fear of dependence, prescription diversion, regulatory scrutiny, withdrawal symptoms, opioid-related adverse events and deaths limit its use [46](#ridm1841151316), [48](#ridm1841177380), [49](#ridm1841171980), [50](#ridm1841170324), [51](#ridm1841109972), [52](#ridm1841108028). There is a lack of high-quality evidence regarding the analgesic efficacy of NSAIDs in cancer; contradiction and inconsistent findings also reported [53](#ridm1841101980), [54](#ridm1841100756), although advocated as a useful adjunct for management of cancer pain [55](#ridm1841094492), [56](#ridm1841091036). In addition, long-term use of NSAIDs is often associated with many serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal, and other side effects [54](#ridm1841100756), [57](#ridm1841087940). Some other studies also reveal association of NSAIDs with certain cancer types [58](#ridm1841084124), [59](#ridm1841078940). Several studies support use of cannabis/marijuana is gradually increasing around the world [71](#ridm1840999028), but many studies oppose it's use or at least demand further investigation of benefit risk are still commonly conventional approaches for treatment of patients harboring advanced cancer [81](#ridm1841030996). Traditional chemotherapy also associated with neuropathic pain [82](#ridm1841026460), fatigue and sleep disturbance [83](#ridm1841023796), anxiety and depression [84](#ridm1841018540), mouth sores, nausea and vomiting, early satiety [85](#ridm1840863460), alopecia [86](#ridm1840925596), bone and muscle wasting [31](#ridm1841269156), [87](#ridm1840914940). Futile medication use in management of terminally ill cancer patients has also been reported, one-fifth of cancer patients at the end of their life took futile medications (statins and antidementia drugs in nearly 100% cases, antihypertensives and bisphosphonates in nearly 30% cases) [88](#ridm1840912564). The goal of cancer palliative care is to prevent or treat, the symptoms and side effects of the cancer type and its treatment, caregiving to any related physical, emotional, social, and spiritual aspects [89](#ridm1840908316), [90](#ridm1840906012), [91](#ridm1840903636). Some alternative therapies, like acupuncture, physical therapy, aromatherapy, CBT are widely recommended along with mind-body interventions like yoga, tai chi, meditation and mindfulness, that keep people fit and energetic as they undergo treatment [1](#ridm1841593364), [2](#ridm1841596388). Herbal and Non-Herbal Plant Derivatives Medicinal plants are a rich source of secondary metabolites with interesting biological and pharmacological activities [92](#ridm1840899892). Kuruppu et.al, 2019 reported that there are 3000 plants possess some anticancer properties and nearly 75% cancer drugs are derived from natural sources, 40% of them are FDA approved [93](#ridm1840895716), [94](#ridm1840889164), [95](#ridm1840888372), [96](#ridm1840883692), [97](#ridm1840881820). Only vincristine, podophyllotoxin, In addition, there are 195,000 pharmacologically active compounds for which the interactions are quantitatively known [99](#ridm1840868284). According to an estimate, more than 300,000 secondary metabolites in promising results in cancer research. Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) also have been demonstrated to exert synergistic effects with other anticancer drugs, improved efficacy and an independent medical profession in Hong Kong and mainland China [108](#ridm1840803652). Cancer patients used CHM to improve their physical and emotional well-beings and to reduce cancer therapy-induced toxicities [111](#ridm1840787524). Nutrition and foods are related to about 30% of all the cancers cases [112](#ridm1840782556). Omega-3s from fish pack a stronger punch than other oils when it comes to cancer prevention [113](#ridm1840778452), [114](#ridm1840773772), [115](#ridm1840583884). Seaweeds are specifically used to treat tumors in CHM [116](#ridm1840579132). Several studies revealed that active metabolites among the terpenoids, including carotenoids, polyphenols and alkaloids sources with anti-proliferative activity represent an important and novel alternative to treat several types of cancer. Lung Cancer American Cancer Society estimated that in 2018 lung and bronchus cancers would be responsible for 234,030 new cases which represent 14% of all new cancer cases and 154,050 deaths [126](#ridm1840536652). Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 80%-85% of all cases [127](#ridm1840532332), [128](#ridm1840527508). More than half of the NSCLC cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage (stages III and IV) [129](#ridm1840525276). Smoking causes at least 80% of lung cancer deaths [130](#ridm1840648684). Lin et.al, 2019 concluded association between lung cancer incidence and increased reliance on coal for energy generation [131](#ridm1840647028). Other possible reasons are exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution, exposure to radiation, and occupational exposure to agents such as asbestos, nickel, chromium, and arsenic [132](#ridm1840642924). Cannabidiol (a non-psychoactive compound recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) stroma and secondary lung metastases [133](#ridm1840637164). [Table 1](#idm1850272932). [Table and QOL for patients with advanced NSCLC [140](#ridm1840608940). Astragalus-based [144](#ridm1840590868), [145](#ridm1840587412), reduces the protein level of PD-L1 in lung cancer cells [146](#ridm1840440972)and enhances autophagic cell death. [Figure 2](#idm1850148492)f) to chemotherapy of Vinca alkaloids (Microtubule-targeting agents) has been a major obstacle to the treatment of lung cancer [148](#ridm1840431756). New generation agents that have the potential to overcome the mechanisms of resistance to the available drugs may provide new therapeutic opportunities [149](#ridm1840429740). High vinorelbine blood levels were associated with severe toxicity [150](#ridm1840423764). [Figure 3](#idm1850136396)d) [151](#ridm1840418868). STE plasminogen activator (u-PA) reported in an older study [152](#ridm1840412892). Oral administration of STE could not prevent the tumor formation but provided strong inhibition of tumor growth [153](#ridm1840408140). [154](#ridm1840405692), induction of apoptosis [155](#ridm1840399212), of [156](#ridm1840395756)and also chemosensitizer lung cancer cells and lung adenocarcinoma xenografts due to presence of tannins (P. emblica) [163](#ridm1840494972). T. belerica induced apoptosis in lung cancer through substantial deposition and retention of paclitaxel in sampled lung tissue in rodent model [169](#ridm1840467900). [170](#ridm1840461348). Figure 1.Alternative Treatment Options 12. One third cancer patients use alternative medicine-are not well regulated and may interact with conventional treatments like chemotherapy and radiation. Some alternative therapies, like acupuncture, physical therapy, aromatherapy, CBT are widely recommended by oncologists for cancer pain management. Mind-body interventions like yoga, tai chi, meditation and mindfulness, which were each used by less than 10% of patients, can keep people fit and energetic as they undergo treatment, reduce the side effects of traditional therapies and improve patients' sleep, stress and mental health. Many hospitals even have alternative medicine centers that offer these programs. Figure 2.Plant derived biomolecules studied in lung cancer Chemotherapy remains the indispensable choice for the vast majority of patients with advanced NSCLC, including primary tumors and lung metastases [168](#ridm1840470996), [171](#ridm1840460844). Use of the pulmonary route is a promising way to decrease the severe systemic toxicities associated with chemotherapy. Inhalation allows the administration of high drug doses directly to lung tumors without prior distribution in the organism [172](#ridm1840455372), [173](#ridm1840452564). However, Bei-Mu, Jie-Geng, and Mai-Men-Dong-Tang are important improved the survival rate [174](#ridm1840446588). Euphorbia mauritanica and Kedrostishirtella extracts may play a role in inducing cell death in lung cancer cells [175](#ridm1840232724). Several 2019 reviews reveal fucoidans (sulfated polysaccharide mainly derived from brown seaweed) in lung cancer management. Brown algae like Fucusvesiculosus, Turbinariaconoides, Laminaria japonica ( [Figure 3](#idm1850136396)g) are tumor migration and invasion, apoptosis induction and inhibition lung cancer cell progression respectively [176](#ridm1840227612). Fucusevanescens, Sargassum sp., Saccharina Japonica was reported to inhibit proliferation and metastasis, and inducing apoptosis in vitro increased metastatic activity of cyclophosphamide and showed cytolytic activity of natural killer cells in 2 different studies and F. vesiculosus ( [Figure 3](#idm1850136396)h) was found to show average antitumor and superior efficacy against LLC in review of Misra et.al, 2019 [179](#ridm1840346700). Sponge alkaloids from Aaptos showed potential human lung adenocarcinoma A549, from Fascaplysinopsis exerted an anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effect in lung cancer, from blue sponge Xestospongia showed apoptosis as well as stimulate anoikis in H460 lung cancer cells in review by Ercolano et.al, 2019 [180](#ridm1840344828). Polyphyllin D from Paris polyphylla is well known for its induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathways against lung cancer [181](#ridm1840341012). High fish consumption was significantly associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer [182](#ridm1840333308), [183](#ridm1840328772). Possible mechanism could be changes in formation of PGE2 and PGE3 and alteration of Akt phosphorylation [184](#ridm1840324740). However, other studies reveal healthy dietary intake like high fruit, vegetable, soy protein, poultry (white meat), low-CHO, fish oil-containing diets, together with exercise also decline risks of lung cancer among non-smokers [185](#ridm1840319340), [186](#ridm1840318116), [187](#ridm1840311924). Conversely, long-term use of high doses of some supplements, such as retinol, -carotene, B vitamins, and vitamin E, increase lung cancer risk in current and former smokers [188](#ridm1840306524). Smokers should continue to avoid -carotene supplementation [189](#ridm1840301196), [190](#ridm1840297596). When a person stops smoking before the age of 40, they reduce their chances of dying from smoking-related disease by 90% [191](#ridm1840294788). Telephone counseling reduce cost of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Again, cessation with intensive telephone counseling and NRT could be over 20% [186](#ridm1840318116). Also, lung cancer mortality can be reduced by 20% via low dose CT lung cancer screening and treatment of early-stage disease [192](#ridm1840290612). Figure 3.Plants studied in lung Figure 3(h).Undaria pinnatifida (Source: The Marine Life Information Network) Blood and Bone Marrow Cancer (Leukemia) Hematopoietic cancers constitute a diverse group of diseases including leukemias, lymphomas, plasma cell tumors, myelodysplastic syndromes, and mastocytosis. They arise primarily from two categories of immunological cell types, myeloid and lymphoid cells [193](#ridm1840283988). AML is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults, accounting for over 80% of all diagnosed acute leukemias [194](#ridm1840280748), [195](#ridm1840278948). Globally, between 1990 to 2018, the number of leukemia cases markedly increased from 297,000 to 437, 033 [196](#ridm1840272324), accounting for close to 250,000 annual deaths due to AML worldwide [197](#ridm1840267572). Optimization of post-remission therapies to maintain complete remission and prevent relapse is a major challenge in treating patients with AML [198](#ridm1840263828). Children with Down syndrome have a 150-fold increased risk of developing AML and 20-fold increased risk of developing ALL [199](#ridm1840260804). The incidence of ALL is about 3.3 cases per 100,000 children [200](#ridm1840255044). Outcomes for patients with CML have substantially improved due to advances in drug development and rational treatment intervention strategies [201](#ridm1840253100). Allowed costs for leukemia patients averaged almost $157,000 in the year after diagnosis, with costs for AML almost tripling that amount, according to a new report from the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) [202](#ridm1840245324). [Table 2](#idm1850104140). [Table of ROS, c-caspase-3, -9, c-PARP, c-DFF-45, and decreased the level of caspase-8 and Bid [204](#ridm1840239348). Enhanced cell synergistic cytotoxicity [212](#ridm1840053996). Combined treatment with HSP90 inhibitor provides an alternative way for the treatment of FLT3-ITD positive AML [213](#ridm1840049892). FDA approved for treatment of patients with CML resistant or intolerant to tyrosine kinase used for the treatment of Multiple Myeloma [225](#ridm1840115196). Hybrid 25 which proved even more potent than clinically used doxorubicin against CEM/ADR5000 cells [226](#ridm1840108788). Significantly enhanced NK-92MI cell (natural [232](#ridm1839866028). [Figure 4](#idm1849990324)h) (alkaloid) [233](#ridm1839861420). Inhibited the growth and proliferation of the K562 cell lines and induced apoptosis in K562 cells by affecting the imatinib, significantly increased the apoptosis degree, decreased the activation of NF-B and the expression of its regulated genes [239](#ridm1839836724). [240](#ridm1839963660). Causes caspase-independent necrosis-like cell death CLL, the use of 2g of EGCG from the green tea extract twice a day was able to reduce the absolute leukocyte count [242](#ridm1839957180), [243](#ridm1839950916), [244](#ridm1839948972), [245](#ridm1839946308), [246](#ridm1839941772). EGCG was also shown to inhibit DNA replication in leukemia cell lines and to modulate vascular endothelial growth factor leading arrest in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells [251](#ridm1839919524). Effective against the proliferation of both types of acute leukemic lymphocytes of AML and ALL patients [252](#ridm1839917004). Polydatin, a natural precursor of resveratrol (RSV) induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MOLT-4 leukemia cells [253](#ridm1839911532). Combination of chloroquine with RSV and 2 other stilbenes induced significant cell death and toxicity in on RCH-ACV and 697 ALL cells [254](#ridm1839908148). RSV is a molecule known severe toxicities proportional inhibitory effects on HL-60 cell proliferation [258](#ridm1839892308). Peel extract promotes growth inhibition of K562 cells mainly via G2/M phase arrest while still conserving apoptosis induction, but at a lower rate [259](#ridm1839888708). Juice extract significantly induced apoptosis in all leukemic cell lines and also induced cell cycle arrest in vitro [260](#ridm1839884172). The polysaccharide PSP001, isolated from the rind of pomegranate fruit exhibited anti-oxidant activity in addition to growth inhibitory effect on leukemic cell lines [261](#ridm1839881580). [262](#ridm1839878412). A metabolite of ginseng saponin, compound K induced apoptosis in human leukemia cells and also induced the activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, and modulation of Bcl-2 families [263](#ridm1839873444). In addition to cell growth inhibition, compound K suppresses cell DNA synthesis and induces cell cycle arrest at G1 phase in pediatric AML [264](#ridm1839871716). It might through CD11c+ [265](#ridm1839671940). Down-regulated the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase, with inhibiting the expression of c-Myc in a concentration-dependent manner [266](#ridm1839667116). [267](#ridm1839660996). Teniposide and etoposide have been inhibitors of MYB transcription factor [268](#ridm1839657252). GMZ-1 suppresses growth and induce cytotoxicity in NALM-6 cells, effectively induced apoptosis by arresting cell cycle progression and increased the nuclear break down in NALM- 6 leukemic cells [274](#ridm1839634572). Cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in human leukemic HL-60 cells also reported downregulated Bcr-Abl against imatinib-resistant CML cells [276](#ridm1839759132). Inhibits growth acute promyelocytic leukemia cells by inducing retinoic acid receptor-independent cell differentiation and apoptosis [277](#ridm1839751932). inhibits MV4-11 cell proliferation and reduces drug resistance in AML [278](#ridm1839749052). Pterostilbene ( [Figure 4](#idm1849990324)k) (phytoalexin) isolated from grapevine leaves and blueberries, showing no toxicity in humans up to a dose of 250 mg/day [279](#ridm1839744372), increases Fas expression in T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines [280](#ridm1839739620). Blueberry extracts exerted anti-AML efficacy and specifically provoked Erk and Akt regulation within the leukemia stem cell subpopulation [281](#ridm1839734580). Quercetin ( [Figure 4](#idm1849990324)l) is for the anti-AML efficacy of blueberry extracts. It can augment and focus the anti-AML efficacy of nano-liposomal ceramide (Lip-C6) in T-cell ALL (T-ALL), or AML [283](#ridm1839724860), are present in about 20% of T-ALL that causes self-renewal and hematopoietic recovery after chemotherapy [284](#ridm1839719244). PHF6 mutations have a significant role in leukemia stem cell activity in the pathogenesis of T-ALL [285](#ridm1839713484). PHF2 low expression was significantly associated with leukemia cell proliferation and several poor prognostic indicators in adult ALL patients. By restoring IKAROS function (zinc finger transcription factor encoded by the IKZF1 gene), PHF2 can be promoted through histone modification [286](#ridm1839708804).

Hyperthermic intraperitoneal (obtained from Streptomyces caespitosus) is the only protocol to demonstrate an adjuvant HIPEC benefit in colorectal cancer patients at high risk for peritoneal failure and an alternative to high-dose and short-term oxaliplatin [566](#ridm1837771124). 5-FU plus mitomycin remains the with anal cancer [567](#ridm1837768820). Bleomycin ( [Figure 10](#idm1849731308)e) is of several glycopeptides derived from Streptomyces verticillus, gained FDA approval in July 1973. The extract from Streptomyces sp. MUM265- represents a valuable bioresource of bioactive compounds for the future development of chemo-preventive agents, with particular promise suggested for treatment of colon cancer [568](#ridm1837765220). Bleomycin is an indispensable antineoplastic agent for the treatment germ cell tumors and lymphomas. Pirfenidone ( [Figure 10](#idm1849731308)d) (novel orally available antifibrotic drug approved by the FDA in 2014) is currently the only approved therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), considered as a salvage drug for refractory cases of bleomycin-induced lung injury [569](#ridm1837759532). In a similar study, Yu et.al, 2019 reported EZY-1 (16-amino-acid peptide was isolated from Eucheuma) inhibit induced by bleomycin [570](#ridm1837755356). Figure 10.Biomolecules from non-plant origin studied or used in different types cancers Alternative Therapies and Mind-Body Interventions According to the Global Health Observatory Report from the WHO, insufficient physical activity is the 4th leading risk factor for mortality. Participation in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week or its equivalent is estimated to reduce risk of breast and colon cancer by 21%-25% [571](#ridm1837750100). Approximately 50% of all leukemia, lymphoma, colorectal- and breast cancer patients are affected by CIPN. Sensorimotor training (SMT) or whole-body vibration (WBV) can reduce the symptoms of CIPN and attenuate motor and sensory deficits [572](#ridm1837747436). Hypnosis, music ( [Figure 11](#idm1849729004)) and relaxing video reduced anxiety and pain associated with colonoscopy and need for sedation during function, change in brain metabolism and change in brain structure are associated with cancer treatment. CBT moderately improved anxiety and depression in patients with early-stage breast cancer [582](#ridm1837705460), significantly improved tumor associated fatigue levels after 8 weeks [583](#ridm1837699556), improved QoL [584](#ridm1837696172), improved cognitive function [585](#ridm1837691852), improved insomnia [586](#ridm1837686884), [587](#ridm1837495396), reduced fear of cancer recurrence [588](#ridm1837490500) and most importantly, reduced pain and distress [589](#ridm1837486252). Mindfulness-based approaches and hypnosis reduced demonstrated efficacy in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms. 40% to 50% CRC patients reported fear of cancer recurrence, tends to increase around the time of scans or other testing for recurrence [590](#ridm1837615924). Also, CRC patients have unique psychosocial needs (e.g., isolation, embarrassment) related to altered eating and bowel habits and sexual dysfunction that warrant clinical attention [591](#ridm1837613116). Acceptance and commitment therapy, meta-cognitive therapy, and mindfulness-based therapies emphasize mindfulness, acceptance, cognitive flexibility, and patient values changes in self-efficacy or confidence in using coping skills targeted by the intervention, acceptance of unwanted thoughts and feelings, or enhanced social support as well as physiological mechanisms (e.g., decreased arousal to negative thoughts and feelings about cancer) [592](#ridm1837610020). Combined CBT/GET improves fatigue and functional outcomes for a subset of patients with post-cancer fatigue in breast or colon cancer [593](#ridm1837604404). CBT intervention has the potential to ease acute anxiety during the often-challenging re-entry phase and to prevent the development of chronic, debilitating, and costly anxiety [594](#ridm1837600228). Physical activity interventions also reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms in breast cancer survivors [595](#ridm1837595764). Telehealth approaches may improve access to mental health resources especially for those with limited online access or lack of online skill [596](#ridm1837590292). Yoga has a solid effect on cancer-related fatigue in patients with breast cancer [597](#ridm1837587268). It is one of the most prevalent complementary therapies used in breast cancer care, seems to be as effective as other exercise modalities for improving the QoL of women with breast cancer [598](#ridm1837581652). Wei et.al, 2019 reported significant improvement in lymphedema status, range of shoulder motion and spinal mobility after an 8-week yoga intervention [599](#ridm1837579420). Although, yoga could not improve HRQoL in patients with colorectal cancer [600](#ridm1837574092) but research supports that yoga is a promising intervention for reducing fatigue and sleep disturbances in this patient group [601](#ridm1837569772). Figure 11.Music Therapy: Pain or Distress Management 619. In the UK, music therapists are trained to master's level and are registered with Health and Care Professions Council as allied health professionals. Aristotle recognized the innate ability of melodies to surpass \"feelings such as pity and fear, or enthusiasm,\" and thus \"heal and purify the soul.\" The Greeks identified Apollo as the father of both healing and music, alongside his many other accolades (as God of light, sun, truth, prophecy, plague and poetry). Dyadic yoga may offer effective relaxation techniques for lung cancer patients and their caregivers who were undergoing an extreme stressor in addition to the cancer experience [602](#ridm1837564804), feasible and beneficial for patients having toxic thoracic radiography [603](#ridm1837562212). Approximately 20% of breast cancer survivors develop breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) [604](#ridm1837556884). Acupuncture is safe and effective at reducing breast cancer-related lymphoedema in patients after breast cancer treatment [605](#ridm1837551484) and managing joint stiffness. Acupuncture use among breast cancer patients in the US is currently as high as 16% to 63% [606](#ridm1837544428). At the current time breast cancer related lymphedema is incurable but well manageable by a number of physical therapy modalities, especially complete decongestive therapy (CDT) [607](#ridm1837540180). Obesity is a factor that deteriorates the CDT efficacy. Early treatment, before developing fat accumulation and fibrosis, must be primary goal in the treatment of BCRL [608](#ridm1837535140). The first \"intensive treatment\" phase aims to decongest the swollen arm through two or more weeks of daily therapist-delivered treatment including multi-layer compression bandaging and manual lymph drainage (MLD). This is followed by a \"maintenance\" phase of patient self-treatment, with compression usually in the form of hosiery [609](#ridm1837531252). The mindfulness component may enhance the positive impact of exercise on cognitive function in breast cancer [610](#ridm1837529956), [611](#ridm1837521388). Tai Chi is accessible to most people and does not require special facilities or expensive equipment [612](#ridm1837518076). Healthier dietary choices were the most frequently reported change already made by people affected by CRC, followed by increased physical activity, stress management, quitting smoking and alcohol and therapies including meditation, tai chi, and naturopathy [613](#ridm1837513828). Greater shoulder muscular strength was significantly associated with better functional well-being in breast cancer survivors with TC Qigong training [614](#ridm1837511164). Massage with or without aromatherapy have been suggested by a few studies in breast cancer to ameliorate anxiety and other symptom relief [615](#ridm1837506700) and immunologic state [616](#ridm1837500580) that needs further investigation. TENS was found valuable in lung cancer patient underwent standard posterolateral thoracotomy [617](#ridm1837350412). Animal-assisted activities ( [Figure 12](#idm1849726412)) has potential benefit children with cancer because pediatric oncology patients often suffer from distress due to physical examinations, venipuncture, chemotherapy infusions, spinal taps, surgery, hospitalization, pain, fear of medical procedures, unpleasant physical symptoms, uncertainty, and worry about death [618](#ridm1837345660). Figure 12.Hospitalized kid on animal visit 620. Understanding whether AAA is safe and effective for pediatric cancer patients is critical, especially because of concern about infection in immunosuppressed persons. Conducting AAA research in pediatric oncology requires understanding current regulations and variations in practice. Knowledge of regulations helps us understand elements required for intervention protocols (e.g., hand-cleaning), whereas knowledge of practice variation can help us identify research opportunities. Conclusion The journey from diagnosis to treatment of cancer affects the patients' lives in a variety of ways. Debilitating symptoms arising both due to disease and its treatments consistently hamper their QoLs. CAM treatment aims to restore body's ability to protect, regulate and heal itself. Since almost 50% of existing medicine is derived from plants, it is clear that natural sources, especially plants can be investigated for effective medicines in cancer treatment. These data can equip providers and patients with the information they need to have informed conversations regarding non-drug approaches for treatment of specific cancer conditions. The use of CAM by cancer patients is becoming widespread. This is a reflection of the many needs and concerns that are currently not being met by conventional medical practice. Significant proportions of cancer patients in developed countries use complementary therapies as adjuncts to conventional symptom management to improve their QoL. India's indigenous systems of medicine, such as Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani, are more than 5,000 years old, and in rural areas, the Indian population has relied heavily on these practices, particularly Ayurveda. In addition, CAM has the potential for the primary and secondary prevention of cancer through counselling on healthy lifestyle, nutrition and supporting the human power of 'salutogenesis' throughout life. The lack of communication about CAM use may be due to fear of a negative response, physicians being perceived as not supportive nor helpful, or physicians and patients having differing views about CAM. Discussions of CAM therapies may have additional benefits for the patient-provider relationship, as studies have shown it indicates use of participatory decision-making, patient-centered communication, and thus greater patient satisfaction, not only in cancer care but also in other arenas of healthcare.
