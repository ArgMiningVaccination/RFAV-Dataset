From 1937 to 1952, known cases of Americans contracting polio skyrocketed from ten thousand to a staggering figure of roughly fifty-seven thousand cases. Of those cases within that time period, approximately one thousand five hundred deaths as a result of polio were recorded. In the year 1953, The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis provided the scientist Dr. Jonas Salk with the tools necessary to research, and develop a working vaccine to combat the devastating polio disease. After much trial and error, Dr. Salk was finally able to create what he felt was a successful polio vaccination, and proceeded to conduct a field test. After resounding success, manufacturing instructions for the Salk vaccine were sent to a series of scientific laboratories for immediate production and administration to American children. The disaster that occurred next will forever be known through American medical history as the Cutter Incident (named so after one of the labs that administered the polio vaccine). This medical crisis sent shockwaves throughout America and the medical community, and numerous lawsuits were filed against Cutter Laboratories, resulting in fewer and fewer labs willing to accept contract work in developing vaccines. On September 11, 2001, 19 people hijacked four airliners and carried out suicide attacks against their targets.. Two of the planes crashed into the towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, the third plane hit the Pentagon just outside Washington, D.C., and the fourth crashed in a field in Pennsylvania. Over 3,000 people were killed during the attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., including more than 400 police officers and firefighters. (\"9/11 attacks\"2010). The conspiracy theories started just days after the September 11, 2001 attack. The conspiracies were easy to spread fast when using the internet and they became more and more elaborate as time went on. The most popular 9/11 conspiracy theory is that 9/11 was orchestrated by the American government. UNDERSTANDING HEPATITIS B EXPERIMENTS and GAY CANCER Makori A bloodmobile searched for gay volunteers for the experiments, 10,000 men gave blood samples and the experimenters found that \u00bd were positive for Hepatitis B. But only 1,000 were inoculated with a suspected contaminated batch. The first cases of AIDS \"Jamestown and triumphs\" Julie Atkinson Reconstructive US History Professor Brumbaugh December 20,2014 Before the settlers landed in Jamestown, The Indians occupied the land and lived there for centuries. They were the first people to arrive in Jamestown. Some say there were 25,000 Indians; others say around 50,000 of the American natives, who lived on the land. There were about thirty different tribes whom the powhatan chiefdom took charge. However, each tribe had their own chief. In time there would be a change; King James 1 of England granted for another colony to be established under the Virginia Company of London which consisted of many wealthy Englishmen who wanted to invest their money into the company. They expected to What if what you had been told your whole life was a lie? How would you feel if everything reported about a terrorist attack or a shooting was actually a conspiracy by the United States? What is a conspiracy? According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a conspiracy is \"a secret plan made by two or more people that is harmful or illegal\". There are so many conspiracy theories out there in the world starting as early as the 1800s. These theories range from scientific, terrorist, criminal, political, economic and business, and even religious conspiracies. The two conspiracy theories that I am talking about is the attack that changed the United States, as we knew it, the one that we believed was a terrorist attack, also known as 9/11, and the Sandy Hook shooting. There are multiple reasons that lead me to consider these two attacks to be something more than a terrorist and criminal attack. The reasons are because the timelines do not add up, there are too many inconsistencies, and the benefits are too great. Maggie Koerth-Baker touches on the dangers of people believing in conspiracy theories. She gives specific examples in which belief in a conspiracy theory has had dangerous real-world consequences. I'm going to tell you about a conspiracy theory that I think is causing havoc in the real-world. Over the years there have been many occurrences that have led to many suspicious citizens that do not believe the answers that they receive which has led to the creation of conspiracy theories, and many of them. Some of them make sense and provide factual information and support yet others are more abstract and do not contain much proof and if they do contain proof it is quickly deemed as false. In some cases some conspiracy theories turn out to be the truth. The definition of a conspiracy theory is an explanatory hypothesis that accuses a person or group of people of planning and or covering up major events that have occurred throughout history. The official story of 9/11 is a conspiracy theory in that the government claims 19 hijackers conspired together to hijack four planes and create terror in the world. Four American airplanes were hijacked; two were driven into the World Trade Centers and the third airplane into the Pentagon. The fourth airplane suspected target was the White House, but it was diverted by the brave men and women aboard that hijacked airplane, and crashed the airline jet before it could reach its target. It was like time stood still as America watched through television broadcast these unbelievable and horrifying events taking place. The reports told of the smell the jet fuel, burning flesh, and people jumping out windows to their death to escape the flames. Assessing our vulnerability to terrorist attack remains difficult in part because the events surrounding the attacks of September 11, 2001, have not been thoroughly explained. In its investigation into them, the 9/11 Commission slid past many important questions, leaving them unanswered, and did not adequately challenge the Bush administration when Conspiracy Rising: Conspiracy Thinking and American Public Life questions the popularity of conspiracy post 9/11 and government secrecy which calls for analysis of comparative work of prior historians. Martha Lee, professor of political science at the University of Windsor, observes current obsession over President Obama's birthplace as a replacement for government involvement in 9/11. However, she argues that although conspiracy changes through different events, the cause for it remains similar to those of the 19th century. Lee, in the first part of the article, explains her deep appreciation to Knight's work. As his work shows the global changes in political, economic, and social structures that produce fear and anxiety among society. Lee The central idea of my concentration is conspiracies in America. While exploring my concentration I have worked with various combinations like newspaper and colored pencil, ink and acrylic, and colored pencil and soft pastel. I enjoyed seeing how I could coney my message while also keeping the message pleasing to the eye. Throughout the year I got to see my work change from crude conspiracies to political posters and work clearly changed as time went on. Brianna Winn Mr. Smith English 111 18 May 2016 Fact or Fiction The United States government was formed to create a democracy fit for the idea that they would be considered \"land of the free.\" Unfortunately, throughout the history of several world wide events, the intentions of the \"forefathers\" have strayed to manipulate events and people. The government has been accused for many past years of lying when main events strike the nation causing many tragedies as well as causing emotional anguish on the world. Many claims of false accusations are typically only made public after several years of sealed documents and evidence are put away, which indeed could be a conspiracy of its own. Conspiracies have been made throughout the course of many years for just about any event that occurs around the world. Conspiracies can vary anywhere from ludicrous to factual, there has been specific verifiable evidence to suggest that the events, 9/11, JFK assassination, and Gulf of Tonkin, as told, are not completely accurate. A Government Conspiracy To most a fairy tale, to some an interesting topic of discussion, however, to a small population, 5 % to be exact, Government conspiracy does exist. How, you might ask, do I intend to prove that indeed government conspiracy is real? I do not intend to prove Brian Keeley's short essay, \"Of Conspiracy Theories\" discusses conspiracy theories and their value in an epistemological context. Keeley denes a conspiracy theory as \"a proposed explanation of some historical event (or events) in terms of the signicant causal agency of a relatively small group of persons-the conspirators-acting in secret (Keeley 1999, pg. 116).\" Keeley seeks to answer the question of why conspiracy theories are unwarranted. His interest in the warrant of conspiracy theories focuses on \u00acthe unfalsifiability of conspiracy theories and how conspiracy theories are founded upon an extraordinarily large amount of skepticism. In section III, Keely discusses what a conspiracy theory is, and contends that there is no grounds for In 1976, Dr. Jonah Salk, creator of the killed-virus vaccine used in the 1950s, testified that the live-virus vaccine (used almost exclusively from the 1960s-2000s in the U.S.) was the \"principle if not sole cause\" of all reported polio cases since 1961 in the United States.
