This report consists of Detailed Accounting Reports (DAR), Performance Summary Reports (PSR), and Budget Formulation Compliance Reports (BFCR) prepar ed by the National Drug Control Program agencies . The DAR is required pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1704(d)(1)-(2): Not later than February 1 of each year, in accordance with guidance issued by the Director , the head of each National Drug Control Program Agency shall submit to the Director a detailed accounting of all funds expended [Office of Na tional Drug Control Po licy (ONDCP) guidance refers to this as a Detailed Accoun ting Report(DAR)] by the agency for National Drug Control Program activities during the previous fiscal year an d shall ensure such detailed accounting is authenticated for the previous fiscal ye ar by the Inspector General for such agency prior to the submission to the Director as frequently as determined by the Inspector General but not less frequently than every 3 years\" and \"The Director shall submit to Congre ss not later than April 1 of each year the information submitted to the Director under paragraph (1). The Director of the Office of National Drug Cont rol Policy is also authorized under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703(d)(7) to \"monitor implementation of the Na tional Drug Control Program, including - (A) conducting program and performanc e audits and evaluations; and (B) requesting assistance from the Inspector General of the relevant agenc y in such audits and evaluations....\" In assessing reliability, ONDCP anticipates each Office of Inspector General (OIG) will conduct an attestation review consistent with the Statements for Standards of Attestation Engagements , promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. [1] An attestation review is more limited in scope than a standa rd financial audit, the purpose of which is to express an opinion on management's assertions. The objective of an attestation review is to evaluate an entity's financial reporting and to provide negative assurance. Negativ e assurance, based on the criteria established by ONDCP guidance, indicates that nothing came to the attention of the OIG that would cause them to believe an agency's submission was presented other than fairly in all material respects. ONDCP guidance [2] permits an agency to request an \"Unreasonable Burden Exception,\" if the drug- related obligation is less than $50 million. An agency or bureau included in the National Drug Control Budget with prior year drug-related obligations of less than $50 million may submit an Alternative DAR and PSR and BFCR. An agency or bureau submitting an Alternative DAS shall provide the drug control funding obligations information required under Sectio n 7.a. and the assertions required under Section 7.b of the ONDCP Circular: National Drug Control Pr ogram Agency Compliance Reviews. An agency or bureau submitting an Alternative PSR shall provide the performance reporting information required under Section 6.a. and Section 8.a. and the assert ions required under Section 6.b and Section 8.b of the ONDCP Circular: National Drug Contro l Program Agency Compliance Reviews. [1] Consistent with the requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1704(d)(1), the Inspector General shall determine the frequency with which to conduct an attestation review of accounting reports, but such reviews shall be conducted not less fr equently than every 3 years. [2] ONDCP Circular: National Drug Control Program Agency Compli ance Reviews. October 22, 2019 For this reporting period, and consistent with 21 U. S.C. \u00a7 1704(d)(1), the OIGs from Education, Health and Human Services, Justice, Treasury and Transpor tation elected to conduct an attestation review for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2020. Department Compliance and Attestation Reviews The following Departments and agencies did not fully comply with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1704(d)(1) and ONDCP guidance. ONDCP will work with the identified agencies in fulfilling the requirements of the Circular for the FY 2021 reports . Department of State Bureau of Internatio nal Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs provided all requested documentation, but the Department of State Inspector General (IG) was unable to gather sufficient data as to rend er an opinion. With the submission of the requested documentation, they have been assessed a rating of \"pass.\" Department of Transportation Federal Avia tion Administration did not provide a Summer Budget Letter, as required. The IG did not receive reporting information on time due to COVID-19 issues and were unable to authenticate some reports. With the submission of all other required information, they have been assessed a rating of \"pass.\" The Department of the Treasury IRS summer budget was not submitted to ONDCP at the same time as that budget request was submitted to its superiors, in accordance with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703(c)(1)(A). For this reason, they have been assessed a rating of \"fail.\" Note that ONDCP has begun working with agencies that were recently designated by ONDCP as National Drug Control Program Agen cies. Their data are not included in this report since ONDCP is still in the process of working with them to define their drug budget methodology and discussing required annual reporting, however our intent is to i n corporate their drug related information in next year's edition of this publication. These new agencies include: AmeriCorps, United States Postal Inspection Service, the Food and Drug Ad ministration at HHS, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives and the Federal Bureau of Investigations at DOJ; the Office of Financial Assets Control and FINCEN at Treasury; the Defense Security and Cooperation Agency; and the Science and Technology Directorate at DHS. Provided below are a summary table and synopses of each agency's report. Together these sections describe each agency's compliance with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1704(d)(1) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703(d)(7). Where there were compliance issues or material weaknesses identified, ONDCP will work with the agency to address prior to the submission of the FY 2021 reports.

CSOSA does not have an IG component or function to review and express a conclusion on the reliability of the accounting and performance assertions made in its report. ONDCP granted CSOSA's exception request for the FY 2020 reportin g period. 4 No Material Weakness Identified. This category includes circumstances where Agency level audits found materials weaknesses in accounting procedures; however, they did not impact the accurate reporting of drug control funding and/or there were no material weaknesses regarding drug control reporting. 5 This Agency has been included in the drug control budget for FY 2021, but has no input to the FY 2020 Report.Summary of Agency Reports Department of Agriculture The Department of Agriculture's (USDA) U.S. Fore st Service (USFS) submitted to ONDCP all FY 2020 information in a single document (Tab A) as part of its requirement under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1704(d)(1) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703(d)(7). The funding levels for USFS fell below the reporting threshold of $50 million; therefore, ONDCP granted the exception that allowed their submissions to consist of a limited report that includes a table of FY 2019 drug-related obli gations. USFS is assessed a rating of \"pass.\" USDA's Office of Rural Development (ORD) a lso submitted all the required reports and documentation. ONDCP appreciates the increased collaboration with ORD over the past year and looks forward to continuing to work together to ensure as much relevant information about ORD's important anti-drug work serving regions of the countr y severely impacted by the drug overdose crisis is shared with ONDCP. Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency The Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) FY 2020 BFCR, DAR and PSR (Tab B) was granted an exception from certain provisions relating to review of their report by an IG, as required under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1704(d)(1), because CSOSA does not have an OIG component or function to review and express a conclusion on the reliability of the accounting and performance assertions made in its report.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reports actuarial outlay estimates for this mandatory spending program rather than budget authority and therefore expenditures are calculated under a different ti me schedule than discretionary funding. In accordance with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1704(d)(1), the OIG has notified HHS that they have chosen not to authenticate the material noted for fiscal ye ar ending September 30, 2020 for ACF and CMS.

The 2020 Rural Development Budget and Performance submission requested funding to support this effort in the 2020 President's budget. The Rural Development affirms the accuracy of the information contained in the submission. (2) Funding Levels Represent Bureau- Level Request - The funding request in this represents the funding level s by uni t in the budget submission made by the agency to the Department without alteration or adjustment by any official at the Department . Jeffrey S. Machelski Associate CFO - Budget and Policy Detailed Accounting Report: Assertions (1) Obligations by Budget Decision Unit - The account information has been collected thru the Rural Development Financial system. The FY 2018 Farm Bill (FB) set 20 percent from the discretionary appropriations for the Distance Learning and Telemedicine grant account funding for substance use disorder. Annually the account sets in the financial system this set aside. Rural Development has not received any direct funding for this purpose in the 2020 annual appropriations. (2) Drug Methodology -The drug methodology agreed with ONDCP was applied The FB authorizes the Secretary to use 20 percent of the funding provided for the Distance Learning and Telemedicine program to support substance use disorder treatment services. In addition, the FB has authorized prioritizing the selection of projects for Community Facilities direct loans or grants that will allow states, counties, tribes, and other applicants to prevent and treat opioid abuse and to support people in recovery. The FB provides authority for setti ng priority points to applicants who intend to provide substance use disorder prevention services, treatment services, and/or recovery services with their projects and employ staff that have appropriate expertise and training in how to identify and treat individuals with substance use disorders. (a) Data - The funding set aside made available by the 2018 FB is set in the accounting system by using funding codes that the program staff uses. The methodology described about is based on these funding codes d efining the nature of the funding set aside and the obligations incurred against it. (b) Financial Systems - The methodology should describe above describes the relationship of decision units reported to ONDCP and the programs/activities as reported in the financial system. This data represent the obligations related to the 2018 FB 20 percent set aside. (3) Application of Drug Methodology - The drug methodology disclosed Section 7.a.(2) was the actual methodology used to generate the table required by section 7.a.(1). Calculations are well documented to independently reproduce these data. Also, calculations provide a means to ensure consistency of data between reporting years. (4) Material Weaknesses or Other Findings - There are not material weakness or other findings. Rural Development has not completed A -123 or internal compliance review on this specific program but the budget and obligations would be included in the overall testing of the budget authority and obligations if the program(s) were sampled. (5) Methodology Modifications - There was not modification on the methodology from prior year. (6) Reprogramming or Transfers - There were not reprogramming or transfers affecting this funding. (7) Fund Control Notices : RD believes that the data presented are associated with obligations against a financial plan that complies with all Fund Control Notices issued by the Director under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703(f) and Section 9 of the ONDCP Circular, Budget Execution. The funding estimates and expenditures are consistent with the approved drug methodology and budget formulation. Jeffrey S. Machelski Associate CFO - Budget and Policy Performance Summary Report : Assertion s (1) Performance reporting system is appropriate and applied - Rural Development uses the financial system for reporting obligations . Information regarding the number of grants provided as they related to the drug control RD efforts is based on agency GPRMA documents and other information that measure the agency's contribution to the Strategy . Fiscal year 2018 was the first year that Rural Development got appro priations in support of the Opioids crisis and that is only for the Distance Learning and Telemedicine grant program. RD has not developed performance specifically for drug control efforts. Targets are set based on the number of applications that were funded in prior year and the estimated available funding for the upcoming year. (2) Explanations for not meeting performance targets are reasonable - RD has met the target for the Distance Learning and telemedicine (DLT) program. The only program with a s tatutory set aside for substance use disorder. (3) Methodology to establish performance targets is reasonable and consistently applied - Setting the target is consistently applied for the DLT program. (4) Adequate performance measures exist for all significant drug control activities: RD DLT program is the only program with statutory set aside to support this effort. Targets are set up based on prior obligations and well as availability of the funding. The 2018 FB established the statutory set aside of 20 percent of the funding made available for the DLT program thru the annual appropriations will be in support of substance use disorder. Annual appropriations has not provided direct funding for this effort. Jeffrey S.

As background, the majority of DoD counterdrug activities are funded from a transfer appropriation and account both titled Drug Interdiction and Counterdrug Activities, Defense . Funds appropriated to this account are subsequently transferred by DoD to the various Military Departments and Defense Agencies for program execution. As designed, the transfer account supports centralized oversight and decentralized program management and execution. The account is structured into projects , each identified by a unique Project Code. A Project Code may identify a discrete function, or may represent the aggregate of similar activities executed by the various geographic combatant comm ands. However, although the entirety of the account supports DoD counter drug-related activities , the account is not structured by the drug control functions of the National Drug Control Budget. In order to reasonably and fairly quantify the account's financial commitment to the drug control functions , each Project C ode is statistically weighed among the functions , either in its entirety or proportionally, using an interactive financial management database. This methodology provides a reasonable basis for consistently estimating DoD counterdrug program support to the National Drug Control Budget functions. The Military Departments and Defense Agencies use accounting systems of record for tracking obligations of funds transferred from the Drug Interdiction and Counterdrug Activities, Defense appropriation. These accounting systems do not interface directly with the counterdrug financial management database; the Military Departments and Defense Agencies manually enter obligation s by Project C ode in to this database on a quarterly basis. At the end of each fiscal year, the Military Departments and Defense Agencies submit detailed transaction listings of actual Service/Agency obligations , which are compared to the aggregate data contained within the counterdrug database . The aggregate data is then compiled into a single obligation s report by drug control function, using the methodology described above . The report further informs the DoD Detailed Accounting Submission and Annual Statement of Assurance provided to the Office of National Drug Control Policy . DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A.

Fiscal Year 2020 Counterdrug Performance Summary Report U.S. Department of Defense Activities Funded by the Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities Appropriation & Military Services Operations Tempo UNCLASSIFIED January 29, 2021 FY 2020 DoD Counterdrug Performance Summary Report THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK TABLE OF CONTENTS Executive Summary .............................................................................................................1 Alignment with the National Drug Control Strategy ...........................................................2 Measuring Performance .......................................................................................................3 Performance Results and Discussion ...................................................................................5 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Department of Defense (DoD) counterdrug (CD) program s cited within this report support the National Drug Control Strategy (NDCS) and the National Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime. Program oversight is provided by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics and Global Threats (DASD (CN&GT)) in cooperation with the Office of Drug Demand Reduction (DDR) within the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness . Programs administered by DASD ( CN&GT ) support the detect ion and monitor ing of aerial and maritime drug thr eats bound for the United States, U.S. and international partner operations and information sharing, and the conduct of global intelligence and counter threat finance analyses . DDR oversees drug testing and prevention programs. This Performance Summary Report ( PSR) encapsulates five quantitative measures of DoD CD program performance. Four pertain to programs funded by the Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities, Defense appropriation. Of these, two pertain to physical drug and precursor seizures in particular geographical areas: the Western Hemisphere Transit Zone (WHTZ), and the Indian Ocean . The other two measures highlight drug testing program results for U.S. Armed Services members and DoD civilians administrated by DDR . The final measure tabulates aerial and maritime operating tempo (OPTEMPO ) contributions funded by the U.S. Armed Services in support of CD operations . All five measures align with NDCS line s of effort; two with Prevention ; three with Reduce Availability . Looking at Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 results holistically , three take aways emerge relevant to achievement of NDCS goals. First, U.S. and partner nation physical drug and precursor seizures in the WHTZ and Indian Ocean denied approximately $6.7 billion in revenue to illicit drug traffickers in FY 2020, the majority of which were the result of WHTZ seizures . Second, less than one percent of the DoD military and civilian workforce tested positive for illicit drug use, with both groups registering slight reductions from FY 2019. Lastly , military ship steaming hours quadrupled in FY 2020 as compared to the previous fiscal year . The increase was largely the result of presidentially directed \"enhanced counter drug operations\" that began April 6, 2020 in the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility . The deterrence effect that resulted from the increase in DoD regional presence offers one explanation for the decreased volume of illegal drugs seized during this period. COVID -19 was another contributing factor that negatively impacted U.S. and partner nations' interdiction and boarding operations, and likely influenced the logistics operations of global illicit trafficking organizations . 3 MEASURING PERFORMANCE The Department of Defense delivers global support to the nation's CD and countering transnational organized crime (CTOC) efforts via programs focused on detecting and monitoring (D&M) aerial and maritime drug threats bound for the United States, by supporting U.S. and international partner operations and information sharing, conducting global intelligence and counter threat finance analyses , and by encouraging a drug- free workplace thro ugh drug demand reduction (DDR) programs. Measures of performance assigned to these activities are used by decision makers to : Measure actual results f or comparison to annual goals and progress toward strategic objectives. Guide the allocation of budgetary resources during the annual planning, programming, budgeting, and execution process. Provide management and oversight of DoD CD and CTOC programs. Facilitate communications and engagements with internal and external stakeholders. D EFINING MEASURES OF SUCCESS Performance measurement programs administered by CN&GT and DDR help ensure that component and subcomponent goals, objectives, programs, and activiti es support the following strategic and program management imperatives to: Align programs and initiatives with strategic goals and objectives: Geographic Combatant Commands, Military Departments, and Defense Agencies are responsible for developing, managing and reporting on programs funded by the Drug Interdiction and Counterdrug Activities, Defense appropriation through an established performance measurement program and associated metrics . Link program performance to management and resource decision -making: Performance metrics provide stakeholders with key output and outcome data which is used to evaluate the performance of programs and supporting organizations. By accurately measuring performance, leaders and managers can make more informed program and resource decisions. Frame stakeholder expectations: DoD CD and related counter -illicit traff icking programs often support and enable related missions performed by U.S. interagency and international partners. Performance metrics help DoD to frame expectations for the execution of programs and activities in support of common objectives. 4 SUPPORTIN G PROGRAM MANAGEMENT When successfully implemented, performance measurement program s ensure component and subcomponent goals, objectives, programs, and activities align with and support DoD CD program objectives, while also providing insight and traceability for: Mission Execution: Effective metrics support mission execution by defining the parameters of mission success and by measuring progress toward objectives. Once programs reach the execution stage, properly developed output and outcome metrics will help keep programs on course to achieve desired end states. Strategic Integration: In addition to supporting mission execution at the tactical and operation levels, performance metrics support CD objectives identified in component Theater Campaign Plans (TCP) and similar operational -level documents. Operational Effectiveness : Metrics support program efficiency by helping identify initiatives and activities with the highest return on investment (most effective at achieving program o bjectives at lowest cost). Components employ metrics to inform program reviews, guide procurement decisions, and identify opportunities for process improvement. Reporting: DoD employs metrics to catalogue and report component performance toward the achievement of program goals . P ERFORMANCE TARGETS Target setting is a management process delegated to CD program managers who are most knowledgeable about specific CD activities and associated performance informatio n. Obtaining performance targets from those who are most closely involved with the CD activity leads to more informed and realistic targets. Once targets are set, they are not changed for a period of time but remain flexible as more information is received and as circumstances change. When setting performance targets, CD program managers review trends and history and consider variations in performance, peaks, troughs, and seasonal, economic, and political factors. Other factors considered include changing political leadership as well as new authorities and modifications to existing authorities. 6 Agency Management Use : Management uses t his measure to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of JIATF -S D&M operations and program activities. It is also used to inform policy and resource decisions at every management level , to include Program Objective Memoranda (POM) and annual budget request s. 2020 National Drug Control Strategy (NDCS) Alignment : The activity represented by this performance measure aligns with the NDCS 'Reducing the Availability of Illicit Drugs in the United States' line of effort. FY 2020 Result: In FY 2020, JIATF -S logged 8,454 Critical Movement Alerts (CMAs) comprised of initial intelligence submissions, of which 7,481 were Drug Movement Alerts (DMAs), a subset of CMAs that capture an impending or ongoing illicit drug movement. During quarterly Consolidated Counterdrug Data Ba se (CCDB) vetting conferences, each interagency partner -submitted event is examined to ensure strict adherence to agreed -upon criteria as defined in the CCDB User's Manual. This refinement process resulted in the designation of 2,658 validated JIATF -S maritime events for FY CCDB maritime JIATF -S was able to target 853 (32%). Target in this context, is the act of trying to locate an illicit conveyance with resources such as, aircraft, ships, h elicopters, etc. The remaining 1,805 events ( 68%) were not targeted primarily due to weaknesses or shortfalls in targeting information and shortages in air and maritime detection and interdiction resources. Of the 853 targeted events, 278 (33%) were detected by U.S. or partner nation (PN) D&M assets. Of these , 188 were successfully handed -off to U.S. or PN law enforcement I&A assets . This resulted in a success rate of 68% for disruptions once the illicit target was detected , falling short of the 80% success rate target . The 80% FY 2020 target was set as an incremental increase towards a goal of 100% (the target is reviewed on an annual basis). M any variables affect the actual hand -off success percentage, but each year U .S. and PNs strive to becom e more efficient and effective by increasing capabilities, capacities , and competencies with assets/resources, command and control, information sharing, and technological advancements to enable better \"detection\" to \"hand- off\" successes. JIATF -S serves as a critical force multiplier for U .S. law enforcement agencies for evidence collection, grand jury proceedings, indictments, and extraditions leading to the interdiction or arrest of key drug trafficking organization ( DTO) members , Consolidated Priority Or ganization Target s (CPOT ), and the disruption of prioritized transnational threat networks. Below is a summary of FY 2020 law enforcement statistics as compared to FY 2019 for drug seizures where JIATF -S provided assistance: Arrests/Detainees: 707, decreased by aircraft): by 12% Cocaine: 255.8 MT, decreased by 9% ($6.6B loss to 7 Marijuana: 39 MT , increased by 63% ($429M loss to traffickers) Heroin: 0 KG Explanation for not meeting FY 2020 target (if applicable): The ultimate hand -off success percentage is driven by many factors including U.S. and PN end- game capabilities, environmental conditions, trafficker adaptations and the target's ability to outrun \" blue forces, \" to name a few. Corrective actions to implement in FY 2021 (if applicable): Although the availability of law enforcement I&A assets is beyond DoD's purview, USSOUTHCOM has taken steps to extend the range and time-on-station of supporting aerial D&M assets by deploying a total of four purpose-modified De Havilland DASH-8 ' PALE ALE' Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) in recent years. In the maritime domain, USSOUTHCOM continues to develop tactics, techniques, and procedures for its Multi- Mission Support Vessel (MMSV) to thwart a thinking adversary. The MMSV extend s friendly force s' time -on-station , and adds the D&M capability of sea -based unmanned aerial systems . Data Source: JIATF -S data is derived from the JIATF -S HELIOS database and the CCDB hosted and maintained by DIA. Procedures to Ensure Data Quality: Beginning in FY 2010, JIATF-S developed drug interdiction continuum indicators to assess its caseload, operational efficacy, and utilization of detection and monitoring (D&M) resources. In FY 2015, it refined and realigned its metrics to reflect updated CCDB event criteria. All event -based CCDB data entered by JIATF -S and its U.S. interagency and international partners is reviewed and validated quarterly via a joint interagency vetting process. This data is the best available authoritative source for estimating known illicit drug flow (or Primary Movement) in the Western Hemisphere. Validated CCDB event data is deemed to be \"high confidence\" (accurate, complete, and unbiased in presentation and substance as possible). Target Methodology: The 80% FY 2021 target was set as an incremental increase towards a goal of 100% (the target is reviewed on an annual basis). As mentioned previously, many variables affect the hand -off percentage, but each year U .S. and PNs strive to become more efficient and effective by increasing capabilities, capacities , and competencies with respect to operational assets , command and control, information sharing, and technology advancements. 9 Data sources : DMDC : The Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) Person nel Data Repository includes data from the Active Component Personnel Master File, the Reserve Components Personnel Data System, and the Military Drug Test File. The Active Component Personnel Master File provides an inventory of all individuals assigned to an Active Component (excluding Active Duty Reservists for training) at any given point in time for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. It provides a standardized and centralized database of all personnel, past and present, of the AC. File sources are from various personnel centers; their requirement to submit data to DMDC is covered under DoDI 1336.05, \"Automated Extract of Active Duty Military Personnel Records.\" USAMITC : The Laboratory Information Management System is a centra l data repository located in San Antonio, TX, at the U.S. Army Medical Information and Technology Center. Examples of data fields in the system include donor identification, collection specimen number, collection unit, collection date, laboratory screenin g test results, laboratory confirmation test results, and final test results. Specimens are included in this statistical report based on the date that drug-testing laboratory results were reported, not the date of collection. Pembrooke : A commercial, vendor- owned database called eScreen Drug Testing System is used to collect and consolidate drug- testing data for DoD civilians subject to workplace drug testing. Summary data is provided to DDR for compliance monitoring. Procedures to ensure data quality : The DoD DDRP policy for military service members is promulgated in DoD Instruction 1010.01 with detailed guidance concerning drug testing procedures contained in DoD Instruction 1010.16. The DoD DDRP policy for civilian personnel is contained in DoD Instruction 1010.09. All drug testing data entered into the DMDC database is reviewed and verified by each Service and Component quarterly. Depar tment of Defense Instruction (Do DI) 1010.16 requires all Services to develop and manage a medical review process (MRP) to review all drug positive results for prescription drugs. In addition, DoDI 1010.16 requires the military drug testing laboratories to have robust internal and external quality assurance programs to ensure the quality and accuracy of all analytical results. DoDI 1010.09 requires all DoD Components to use the U.S. Army Fort Meade Forensic Toxicology Drug Testing Drug Testing Laboratory (FTDTL) for DoD civilian personnel. Target methodology: DoD policy requires 100% random urine drug testing for every Service member annually. Given the success of DoD's civilian drug testing program, the random testing rate for civilians in testing -designated positions will be 50% of the workforce per year. The effectiveness of this program is measured by monitoring the prevalence of drug use from drug testing statistics published annually with a 2% or less urine drug positive rate for military personnel, and a 1% urine drug positive rate for DoD civilians in Testing Designated Positions. 10 These goals were established in response to Office of the Undersecretary of Defense OUSD (P&R) Memorandum, \"Well -Being of the Force Indicators,\" dated 3 March 2008. Goals were set at values substantially lower than what was reported in DoD Surveys of Health Related Behavior Am ong Military Personnel. Annual statistical reports track testing and positive rates by Military component. These reports are sent to the National Guard Bureau, Military Departments , and Director, Joint Staff for awareness and to address any focus areas. 12 FY 2019. DoD views the increase as reflective of improvements in counter- drug intelligence analysis capabilities . Corrective actions to implement in FY 2021 (if applicable) : CENTCOM estimates that COVID -19 constraints will continue to impact operations. Some CTF -150 Maritime platforms have adopted strategies to protect against COVID infection, and may be more willing to conduct boardings. COVID concerns remain forefront for US and partner forces in the CENTCOM AOR and will likely continue to limit the number of boardings and maritime interdictions . Data Source: RNIFC is from the Consolidated Counterdrug Database (CCDB) . The CCDB is hosted and maintained by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) . Procedures to ensure data quality: As with JIATF -S, each CTF -150 CCDB interdiction event is reviewed and validated through a quarterly interagency vetting process. CCDB event- based estimates are the best available authoritative source for estimating known illicit-drug flow (or Primary Movement) through the Indian Ocean. Validated CCDB event data is deemed \"high confidence\" (accurate, complete and unbiased in presentation and substance as possible). FY 2021 target methodology: T he RNIFC target of 4,800 kg for heroin interdictions, first set in FY 2019, and used again in FY 2020, will remain the benchmark for FY 2021. Factors that RNIFC controls that support this target include an improved focus on targeting via collaboration with DEA Kabul to further illuminate the drug trafficking networks and vulnerabilities at their sources. Further, the development of a Land Based Coordinators Toolkit and Source of Supply analysis tools will provide better information to regional law enforcement partners to conduct I&A operations. Two of the most important uncontrollable factors for FY 2021 include: 1) Whether ships assigned to CTF-150 will continue to be stationed in the traditional heroin smuggling routes off the East Coast of Africa , or utilized elsewhere due to more pressing global security concerns; and 2) Whether COVID -19 restrictions will continue the negatively impact the ability for CTF -150 to conduct boardings.

METHODOLOGY MODIFICATION None MATERIAL WEAKNESS OR OTHER FINDINGS None REPROGRAMMING OR TRANSFERS None OTHER DISCLOSURES None Performance Summary Report 8. a. Performance Reporting The following is a summary report on the progress that the Defense Health Agency has made in supporting National Drug Control Strategy Goal 4. \"to increase the mandatory prescriber education and continuing training on best practices and current clinical guidelines.\" To help meet this strategic g oal the Defense Health Agency collaborated with the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to design and implement Buprenorphine Waiver Training (BWT). This training is offered internal to DoD staff and provides licensed physicians (MDs and DOs), with the appropriate knowledge and training hours needed to apply for a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) waiver that would then be used to write prescriptions for Medication Assisted Therapy (MAT). This would expand DoD capability to meet the treatment needs of Active-Duty Service Members and their families by provid ing training in evidence-based MAT care to DoD providers. (8.a.1) Performance Measures To help measure help measure performance on this goal, an overall raw number count of providers completing training metric was chosen and has regularly been reported. (8.a.2) Prior Years Performance For the years since the training has been available and for which completion data have been counted, the following are prior year's performance: For CY-17 through CY-19 DoD has trained 318 DoD prescribers (124, 91, and 103, respectively). (8.a.3) Current Years Performance For this CY-20, there were 57 DoD prescribers who completed training. (8.a.4) Quality of Performance Data As data are captured and reported only upon completion of the training, and training is only offered through a rigorous application process, the quality of the count data is estimated to be high. 8. b. Performance Reporting Assertions (8.b.1-4) I assert that for the raw count numbers provided above in section 8.a are appropriate and applied consistently, that no explanations for not meeting performance targets are necessary and that this metric is adequate for informing this drug control strategy. 8. c. Criteria (8.c.1-3) The data reported in 8.a are the most current, reliable and recently available. As raw count data they are not subject to a method requiring an estimate. ______________________ Mary Markivich, PsyD MAJ, USA Clinical Psychologist Executive Director, Addictive Substance Misuse Advisory Committee Chief, Behavioral Health Specialty Care Psychological Health Center of Excellence, Research and Development (J-9) Defense Health Agency Tab D UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OFFICE OF FINANCE AND OPERATIONS January 28 , 2021 Ms. Sandra D. Bruce Acting Inspector General U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W. Washington, DC 20202- 1510 Dear Ms. Bruce : This letter constitutes the Department's Budget Formulation Compliance Report for calendar year 2020 , in response to section 6 of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Circular National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews , dated October 22, 2019. The Circular instructs that this Compliance Report include ( 1) information on the Department's summer budget formulation (in this case, for fiscal year 2022) ; and ( 2) assertions by the Department relating t o that summer budget formulation. More specifically, the ONDCP Circular presupposes the Department engaged in an agency - wide budget formulation process for fiscal year 2022 during the summer of calendar year 2020 , and expects the Department , in this Com pliance Report , to (1) include a copy of the transmittal letter and resource summary table from the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education's (OESE) fiscal year 2022 budget request for drug control programs submitted to ONDCP this summer; and (2) make assertions to OIG for the purpose of OIG expressing a conclusion about the reliability of those assertions regarding (a) the timeliness of OESE's budget submission to ONDCP , and (b) the funding request in that submission representing the budget submission made by OESE to the Department without alternation or adjustment by any official at the Department . However, the Department in fact did not carry out an internal budget formulation process for fiscal year 2022 under which OESE developed or subm itted a budget request to ONDCP in summer of 2020. Consequently, OESE did not submit such a request to ONDCP and, thus, the assertions required by the ONDCP Circular are not applicable. Fortunately, ONDCP Circular (in section 6(b)(1)), in tandem with the ONDCP Circular Budget Formulation dated October 22, 2019 (in section 9(a)(1)), accommodates the above circumstances. In combination, the two Circulars indicate that for agencies with no budget data appli cable for the summer budget submission, the agency (1) notify ONDCP by July 15 th that the agency budget formulation process does not include the submission of any agency budget proposal, budget formulation data, or other pre -decisional budget information to the agency for review or adjudication prior to development of the OMB -level fall bu dget submission; and (2) in this Compliance Report, include an assertion to affirm that is the case. www.ed.gov The Department of Education's mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access. Page 2 - Ms. Sandra D. Bruce The Department notified ONDCP by e -mail on May 1 3, 2020 (copy enclosed) that for the above reasons ONDCP would not be receiving a summer drug control budget request from the Department for the fiscal year 2022 formulation cycle. And for purposes of this Compliance Report we reaffirm that assertion, inclusive of the assertion that the Department's fiscal year 2022 budget formulation process did not include the submission by OESE of any budget proposal, budget formulation data, or other pre -decisional budget information to the agency for review or adjudication prior to development of the Department's OMB -level fall budget submission.

Sincerely, Larry Kean Director, Budget Service Enclosure 2 TABLE OF PRIOR -YEAR DRUG CONTROL OBLIGATIONS Fiscal Year 2020 Obligations (in millions) Drug Resources by Function Prevention $58.294 Total 58.294 Drug Resources by Decision Unit School Safety National Activities $58.294 Total 58.294 ____________ PROGRAM DESCRIPTION A subset of projects funded under School Safety National Activities, which is a broad discretionary authority under Title IV, Part F, Section 4631 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as amended, comprise the only Department of Education activities included in the national drug control budget in fiscal year 2020 . School Safety National Activities support a range of strategies to assist State and local efforts to improve students' safety and well -being. Activities supported under School Safety National Activities that have a clear drug control nexus, and for which funds are thereby included in this accounting of drug control funds, include (1) School Climate Transformation Grants and related technical assistance to help create positive school climates by developing and adopting, or expanding to more schools, the use of multi- tiered decision- making frameworks that guide the selection, integration, and implementation of evidence- based behavioral practices for improving school climate and behavioral outcomes for all students; and (2) dissemination, outreach, and ot her technical assistance activities that support and improve drug and violence prevention efforts. In addition to activities that include drug preventio n, School Safety National Activities carried out by the Department in 2020 also included: (1) Project SERV (School Emergency Response to Violence) , which provides education -related services to LEAs and institutions of higher education (IHEs) in which the learning environment has been disrupted due to a violent or traumatic crisis ; (2) Project Prevent grants to LEAs to help schools in communities with pervasive violence break the cycle of violence; (3) School Emergency Management Activities, such as Grants to States for Emergency Management and the Department's Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools Technical Assistance Center, which helps schools, school districts, and IHEs in the development and implementation of high- quality emergency operations plans ; (4) Mental Health Service Professional Demonstrati on Grants and School -Based Mental Health Services grants, which help increase the number of counselors and other mental health professionals to provide services to students in high- need school districts ; and (5) a small number of miscellaneous other school safety activities . Although the Department obligated funds for all five of these activities in fiscal year 2020, funds for these five components of School Safety National Activities are not included in the ONDCP drug budget and, therefore, they are not included in this obligations report. 3 DISCLOSURES Drug Methodology This accounting submission includes all fiscal year 2020 obligations of funds under School Safety National Activities, with the exception of activities that have no clear drug control nexus. Accordingly, the amounts in the enclosed table of prior -year drug control obligations include all funding for School Safety National Activities, with the exclusion of obligations of funds for (1) Project SERV; (2) Pr oject Prevent; (3) School Emergency Management Activities ; (4) Mental Health Service Professional Demonstration Grants and School -Based Mental Health Services grants ; and (5) miscellaneous other school safety activities . Obligations by Drug Control Function All obligations of funds for the School Safety National Activities program shown in the table on page 2 of this report fall under the ONDCP drug control function category of prevention. Obligations by Budget Decision Unit All obligations of drug control funds in the table on page 2 of this report are displayed using the School Safety National Activities program as the budget decision unit . Methodology Modifications The Department does not have any drug control budget methodological modifications to disclose. Material Weaknesses or Other Findings The Department does not have any material weaknesses or other findings to disclose that affect the presentation of fiscal year 2020 drug-related obligations in this report. Limitations that affect the presentation of drug- related obligations in this report are explained in the disclosures below. Reprogrammings or Transfers There were no reprogrammings or transfers of drug- related budgetary resources in the Department of Education in fiscal year 2020. Other Disclosures The Department acknowledges the following limitation in the methodology described above for deriving the obligations of fiscal year 2020 drug control funds att ributable to the School Safety National Activities program: No t all obligations of funds included in the resource summary of this report support drug prevention activities \u2014 some of these funds support violence prevention and school safety activities that have no drug control- related nexus. 4 ASSERTIONS Obligations by Decision Unit The fiscal year 2020 obligations of drug control funds shown in this report for the School Safety National Activities drug budget decision unit are the actual 20 20 obligations of funds from the Department's accounting system of record for the School Safety National Activities program. Drug Methodology The methodology used to calculate the fiscal year 2020 obligations of drug prevention funds presented in this report is reasonable and accurate, because: (1) the methodology captures all of the obligations of funds under the School Safety National Activities program that reasonably have a drug control- related nexus, and (2) these obligations of funds largely corres pond to the display of resources for the School Safety National Activities program in the Department's budget justifications to Congress that accompany the President's budget. Data No workload or other statistical information was applied in the methodology used to generate the fiscal year 2020 obligations of drug control funds presented in the table on page 2 of this report. Where assumptions based on professional judgment were used as part of the drug methodology, the association between these assumptions and the drug control obligations being estimated is thoroughly explained and documented in the drug methodology disclosure and in the other disclosures on page 3 of this accounting report. Financial Systems Financial systems supporting the drug methodology yield data that fairly present, in all material respects, aggregate obligations from which the drug- related obligation estimates are derived. Application of Drug Methodology The methodology disclosed in the narrative of this report was the actual methodology used to generate the fiscal year 2020 obligations of drug control funds presented in the table on page 2. Material Weaknesses or Other Findings There are no material weaknesses or other findings by independent sources, or other known weaknesses, that affect the presentation of fiscal year 2020 drug-related obligations in this report. The limitation of the methodology described above for deriving the obligations of fiscal year 2020 drug control funds in this report is disclosed on page 3. Methodology Modifications The Department did not make any modifications in the methodology it used to calculate its drug control obligations between fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020. 5 Reprogrammings or Transfers There were no reprogrammings or transfers of Department of Education drug control funds in fiscal year 2020. However, subsequent to the Department submitting its fiscal year 2020 financial plan to ONDCP, the Department reallocated various small amounts of funds across activities within School Safety National Activities . As a result of these reallocations the Department's drug control budgetary resources decreased by $465 ,457, fro m $58,759,118 (as estimated in the financial plan) to the final amount of $58, 293,661. Fund Control Notices The Director of ONDCP has never issued to the Department of Education any Fund Control Notices under 21 U.S.C. 1703(f) or the applicable ONDCP Cir cular, Budget Execution. Therefore, the required assertion that the data presented in this report accurately reflect obligations of drug control funds that comply with all such Fund Control Notices is not applicable. 400 MARYLAND AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20202 www.ed.gov U.S. Department of Education Performance Summary Report Fiscal Year 2020 In Support of the National Drug Control Strategy February 17, 2021 U.S. Department of Education Performance Sum mary Report for Fiscal Year 2020 TABLE OF CONTENTS Transmittal Letter ................................ ................................ ................................ ............ 1 Performance Summary Information ................................ ................................ ................. 2 School Climate Transformation LEA Grant s (FY 2014 Cohort) ............ ............ .2 School Climate Transformation LEA Grant s (FY Cohort) ............ ............. 8 Assertions ... 13 2 FY 2020 Performance Summary Information School Climate Transformation Grant - Local Education al Agency Grants Program 2014 Cohort In FY 2014 , the Department made the first round of awards under the School Climate Transformation Grant - Local Education al Agency (LEA) program to 71 school districts in 23 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The funds are being used to develop, enhance, and expand systems of support for implementing evidence -based, multi -tiered behavioral frameworks for improving behavioral outco mes and learning conditions for students. The goals of the program are to connect children, youths, and families to appropriate services and supports; improve conditions for learning and behavioral outcomes for school -aged youths; and increase awareness o f and the ability to respond to mental -health issues among school -aged youths. School districts used these funds to implement models for reform and evidence - based practices that address the school -to-prison pipeline \u2014the unfortunate and often unintentional policies and practices that push our nation's schoolchildren, especially those who are most at -risk, out of classrooms and into the juvenile and criminal justice systems. The grants provide d funding for up to five years, for a total of nearl y $180 million. The fi nal year of a five -year funding cycle was made to these grantees in FY 201 8. Drug prevention was an allowable activity. Indeed, grantees were encouraged, as part of their local needs -assessment, to measure student drug use along with other relevant issues and problems. The local needs -assessment was also used by grantees to help identify and select the most appropriate evidence -based practices. If the needs -assessment indicate d that drug abuse was an issue for students, drug abuse prevention should have been addressed as part of implementation of a multi -tiered behavioral framework. The Department developed a variety of measures to assess the performance of the 2014 cohort of School Climate Transformation Grants to LEAs , including (1) measures related to increasing the capacity of LEAs to implement a multi - tiered , decision -making framework to improve behavioral and learning outcomes and (2) measures to demonstrate the progress of LEAs in achieving th ese outcomes as evidence d by decreasing student disciplinary actions and increased student a ttendance. Among those measures, the two discussed below are the most directly related to the drug prevention function of this program. Final performance data for th e 2014 cohort of grants would have been included in the Department's FY 2019 Performance Summary Report, but the grants were on no -cost extensions as of a year ago had not yet submitted their final performance reports. Due to COVID -19, the grantees are operating under further 3 No-Cost Extensions. For that reason, as explain ed below, data for two of the measures in this section of the Report are based on only 50 of the 70 grantees. Measure 1 : The number and percentage of schools that report an annual decrease in suspensions and expulsions, including those related to possession or use of drugs or alcohol. Table 1 Year Number Target Number Actual Percentage Target Percentage Actual 2015 2016 . ED established several GPRA performance measures for assessing the effectiveness of the FY 2014 cohort of School Climate Transformation Grant s to LEAs . Two measures were related to addressing the goals of the National Drug Control Strategy. This measure was one of the two selected for that purpose. It is expected that grantees may show progress in meeting this measure due to improvement in school climate that result s in a decrease in actual student us e of drugs or alcohol, and as a result these students do not face disciplinary action for such use. Alternatively, grantees may show progress because they change their disciplinary approach to student drug o r alcohol use and take a more supportive disciplinary approach to addressing the behavior, rather than relying on suspensions and expulsions. FY 2019 Performance Results FY 2019 was the final performance period for the FY 2014 cohort. Of the 70 grantees, in fiscal year (FY) 2020, 20 grantees requested and were approved for No-Cost Extension s under the Department 's Administrative Relief for discretionary grantees impacted b y the Coronavirus disease - 2019 (COVID -19) offer. This relief , which was offered to grantees affected by the loss of operational capacity and increased costs due to the COVID -19 crisis , allows grantees until December 31, 2021 to submit their final perfor mance reports. The 2019 actuals in Table 1 are preliminary data for the final year(s) of these projects based on final reports from 50 of the 70 grantees . More complete data should be available later this year and may be included in the Department's FY 2021 Performance Summary Report. Worsening performance in the FY 2019 performance period (both when actual data are compared to FY 2018 actual data 4 and to falling short of FY 2019 targets) is almost certainly due to the COVID -19 crisis. FY 2020 Performance Target . Targets for FY 2020 are not applicable, because FY 2019 was the final performance period for these grants . Tables 2, 3, and 4 Grantees are not required to collect and report to the Department disaggregated data corresponding to suspensions and expulsions that are related to possession or use of alcohol or drugs only, but some grantees voluntarily report such information . Accordi ngly, for such grantees, beginning with the FY 2016 baseline data available for this performance m easure, the Department is report ing this more detailed data in the tables below . Because grantees were not required to collect or report these data, no targets were set for these additional measures. Table 2: Number and percentage of schools that report an annual decrease in suspensions and expulsions related to possession or use of alcohol only . Out of a total of 70 grantees, 31 grantees reported these data measures for FY 2016; 6 grantees reported data for FY 2017; none reported data for FY 2018 ; and to date , none reported data for the final FY 2019 performance period . Because grantees were not required to collect or report these data, no targets were set for these additional measures. If any grantee s report additional data on this measure by the end of calendar year 2021 , such data may be included in the Department's FY 2021 Performance Summary Report . Table 3: Number and percentage of schools that report ed an annual decrease in suspensions and expulsions related to possession or use of other drugs only . Out of a total of 70 grantees , 32 grantees reported data for FY 2016, 8 grantees reported data for FY 2017; none reported data for FY 201 8; and to date, none reported data for the final FY 2019 performance period. If any grantee s report additional data on this measure by the end of calendar year 2021 , such data may be included in the Department's 2021 Perf ormance 204 41% 19 20% 5 Table 4: Number and percentage of schools that report ed an annual decrease in suspensions and expulsions related to possession or use of alcohol and/or other drugs . Out of a total of 70 grantees , 41 grantees reported data for FY 2016 ; 21 grantees reported data for FY 2017 ; none reported data for FY 2018; and to date, none reported data for the final FY 2019 performance period. If any grantee s report additional data on this measure by the end of calendar year 2021 , such data may be included in the Department's FY 2021 Performance Summary Repor t. Measure 2 : The number and percentage of schools annually that are implementing the multi -tiered behavioral framework (MTBF) with fidelity. Table 5 Year Number Target Number Actual Percentage Target Percentage Actual 2015 512 584 52% 68% The Measure . ED established several GPRA performance measures for assessing the effectiveness of the FY 2014 cohort of School Climate Transformation Grant s to LEAs . Two measures were related to addressing the goals of the National Drug Control Strategy. This measur e was one of the two selected for that purpose. Although schools have long attempted to address issues of student disruptive and problem behavior (including substance use, violence, and bullying), most of our Nation's schools have not implemented compre hensive, effective supports that address the full range of students' social, emotional, and behavioral needs. Research demonstrates that the implementation of an evidence -based, multi - tiered behavioral framework, such as Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), can help improve overall school climate and safety. A key aspect of this multi -tiered approach is providing differing levels of support and interventions to students based on their needs. Certain supports involve the whole school (e. g., consistent rules, consequences, and reinforcement of appropriate behavior), with more intensive supports for groups of students Cohort FY2014 Actual FY2015 Actual FY2016 Actual 269 44% 201 46% 6 exhibiting at -risk behavior, and individualized services for students who continue to exhibit troubling behavior. This sec ond measure supports the drug prevention function of this program because a school that is implementing a multi -tiered behavioral framework with fidelity can be expected to be a school where any prevention program(s) - including drug prevention program(s) - selected for implementation is (1) an evidence -based program and (2) has an improved chance of being implemented more effectively. This measure is designed to inform whether the LEA School Climate Transformation Grants result in such increased capacity. FY 2019 Performance Results . Of the 70 grantees, in FY 2020, 20 grantees requested and were approved for a No-Cost Extension under the Department's Administrative Relief for discretionary grantees impacted by the Coronavirus disease - 2019 (COVID -19) offer. This relief, which was offered to grantees affected by the loss of ope rational capacity and increased costs due to the COVID -19 crisis, allows grantees until December 31, 2021 to submit their final performance reports. The FY 2019 actuals in Table 5 reflect preliminary performance data based on the 50 grantees that have submitted final performance reports . More complete data should be available later this year and may be included in the Department's FY 2021 Performance Summary Report. Worsening performance in FY 2019 (both when actual data are compared to FY 2018 actual data and to falling short of FY 2019 targets) is almost certainly due to the COVID -19 crisis. Regardless, t here was one improvement among the metrics for this performance measure. The percentage of schools implementing the multi -tiered behavioral framework (MTBF) with fidelity increased from 64 percent to 68 percent between FY 2018 and FY 2019. FY 2020 Performance Target . Targets for FY 2020 are not applicable, because FY 2019 was the final perf ormance period for these grants . Methodology . These measures constitute the Department's indicators of success for the School Climate Transformation Grant - Local Educational Agency Grants program 2014 cohort . Consequently, we advised applicants for a grant under this program to give consideration to these measures in conceptualizing the approach and evaluation for their proposed program. Each grantee is required to provide, in its annual performance and fin al reports, data about progress in meeting these measures. To receive funds after the initial year of a multi -year award, grantees must submit an annual continuation performance report that describes the progress the project has made toward meeting the predefined benchmarks and milestones. This performance report also provides program staff with data related to the GPRA measures established for the program. 7 Authorized representatives for the grant site sign the annual performance report and, in doing so, certify that to the best of their knowledge and belief, a ll data in the performance report are true and correct and that the report fully discloses all known weaknesses concerning the accuracy, reliability, and completeness of the data included. Generally, the Department relies on the certification concerning data supplied by grantees and will not conduct further reviews unless data quality concerns arise. The ED -funded Technical Assistance Center on Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (www.pbis.org) is providing training and technical assistance t o grantees on data collection. 8 FY 2020 Performance Summary Information School Climate Transformation Grant - Local Educational Agency Grants Program 2019 Cohort In FY 2019 , the Department made a new round of awards under the School Climate Transformation Grant - Local Educational Agency (LEA) program to 69 school districts . The grants provide fundin g for up to five years, for a total of nearly $218 million. The funds are being used to develop, enhance, or expand systems of support for , and tec hnical assistance to, schools implementing a multi -tiered system o f support for improving school climate. The goals of the program are to connect children, youth, and families to appropriate services and supports; improve conditions for learning and behavioral outcomes for school - aged youth; and increase awareness of and the ability to respond to mental - health issues among school -aged youth. The Department established several GPRA performance measures for assessing the effectiveness of the FY 2019 cohort of the School Climate Transformation Grants to LEAs program. Four of the measures relate to addressing t he goals of the National Drug Control Strategy. Measure 1 . The number and percentage of schools annually that are implementing a multi -tiered system of support framework with fidelity. Table 1 Year Number Target Number Actual Percentage Target Percentage Actual 2020 305 45% 2021 314 48% The Measure: Similar to M easure 2 for the 2014 SCTG -LEA cohort, this measure supports the drug prevention function of this program because a school that is implementing a multi -tiered system of support framework with fidelity can be expected to be a school where any prevention program(s) - including drug prevention program(s) - selected for implementation is (1) an evidence -based program and (2) has an improved chance of being implemented more effectively. This measure is designed to inform whether the LEA School Climate Transformation Grant result s in an increased capacity. FY 2020 Performance Results . FY 2020 performance data have been received from 56 of the 69 grantees and ha ve been aggregated ; 13 grantees did not submit data due to the loss of operational capacity and impacts from the COVID - 19 pandemic. As shown in Table 1 above, the 56 grantees reported that 305 9 schools, or 45 percent of those participating, implemented the multi -tiered behaviora l framework with fidelity. More complete data should be available later this year ; if so , it will be included in the Department's FY 2021 Performance Summary Report. FY 2021 Performance The FY 2021 performance targets for the number and percentage of schools annually that are implementing the multi - tiered behavioral framework with fidelity are set at 314 and 48 percent, respectively. These targets represent an annual increase of 3 percen t and 3 percentage points, respectively . Measure 2 . The number and percentage of schools annually that are implementing opioid abuse prevention and mitigation strategies. Table 2 Year Number Target Number Actual Percentage Target Percentage Actual 2020 196 42% 2021 202 45% The Measure : Measure 2 addresses the opioid crisis and its devastation on families and communities across the United States, and the belief that schools can play an important role in both preventing opioid abuse and addressing the mental health and other needs of students affect ed by the epidemic. Accordingly, in the FY 2019 competition for School Climate Transformation Grants to LEAs, the Department included a competitive preference priority for applicants that proposed to implement opioid abuse prevention and/or mitigation strategies. Sixty -eight of the 69 grantees addressed this priority. Measure 2 is designed to drill down below the grantee (i.e., LEA) level to determine how many (and what percentage of) schools served by the grant are implementing opioid abuse prevention a nd mitigation strategies. FY 2020 Performance Results . FY 2020 performance data have been received from 48 of the 69 grantees and ha ve been aggregated. Of the 69 grantees, 21 grantees did not submit data due to the loss of operational capacity and impacts from the COVID -19 pandemic. As shown in Table 2 above, the 4 8 grantees reported that 196 schools, or 42 percent of those participating, implement ed opioid abuse prevention an d mitigation strategies. More complete data should be available later this year ; if so , it will be included in the Department's FY 2021 Performance Summary Report. FY 2021 Performance The FY 2021 performance targets for the number and percentage of schools annually that are implementing opioid abuse prevention and mitigation strategies are set at 202 and 45 percent, respectively. 10 These targets represent an annual increase 3 percent and of 3 percentage points, respectively . Measure 3 . The number and percentage of schools that report an annual decrease in suspensions and expulsions related to possession or use of alcohol. Table 3 Year Number Target Number Actual Percentage Target Percentage Actual 2020 281 61% 2021 289 64% The Measure : Similar to the FY 2014 cohort measure for the School Climate Transformation Grants to LEAs, it is expected that grantees may show progress in meeting this measure due to improvement in school climate that results in a decrease in actual student use of alcohol, and as a result these students do not face disciplinary actions for such use. Alternatively, grantees may show progress within their disciplinary approach to studen t alcohol use and take a more supportive disciplinary approach to addressing the behavior, rather than relying on suspensions and expulsions. FY 2020 Performance Results . FY 2020 performance data have been received from 49 of the 69 grantees and ha ve been aggregated. Of the 69 grantees, 20 grantees did not submit data due to the loss of operational capacity and impacts from the COVID -19 pandemic, and/or unavailable baseline data. As shown in Table 3 above, the 49 grantees reported that 281 schools, or 61 percent of those participating, had an annual decrease in suspensions and expulsions related to possession or use of alcohol. If more complete data should become available later this year , they will be included in the Department's FY 2021 Performanc e The FY 2021 performance targets for the number and percentage of schools annually that report an annual decrease in suspensions and expulsions related to possession or use of alcohol are set at 289 and 64 percent, respectively. These targets represent an annual increase of 3 percent and 3 percentage points, respectively. Measure 4 . The number and percentage of schools that report an annual decrease in suspensions and expulsions related to posses sion or use of other drugs. 11 Table 4 Year Number Target Number Actual Percentage Target Percentage Actual 2020 288 57% 2021 297 60% The Measure : Similar to the FY 2014 cohort measure for the School Climate Transformation Grants to LEAs, it is expected that grantees may show progress in meeting this measure due to improvement in school climate that results in a decrease in actual student s' use of drugs, and as a result , these students do not face disciplinary actions for such use. Alternatively , grantees may show progress within their disciplinary approach to student drug use and take a more supportive disciplinary approach to addressing the behavior, rather than relying on suspensions and expulsions. FY 2020 Performance Results . FY 2020 perfo rmance data have been received from 49 of the 69 grantees and ha ve been aggregated. Of the 69 grantees, 20 grantees did not submit data due to the loss of operational capacity and impacts from the COVID -19 pandemic, and/or unavailable baseline data. As shown in Table 4 above, the 49 grantees reported that 288 schools, or 57 percent of those participating, had an annual decrease in suspensions and expulsions related to possession or use of other drugs. If more complete data should be come available later this year , they will be included in the Department's FY 2021 Performance Summary Report. FY 2021 Performance The FY 2021 performance targets for the number and percentage of schools annually that report an annual decrease in susp ensions and expulsions related to possession or use of other drugs are set at 297 and 60 percent, respectively. These targets represent an annual increase of 3 percent and 3 percentage points, respectively. Methodology . These measures constitute the Dep artment's indicators of success for the School Climate Transformation Grant - Local Educational Agency program FY 2019 cohort . Consequently, applicants for a grant under this program were advised to give careful consideration to these measures in conceptualizing the approach , and the evaluation of, their proposed program. Each grantee is required to provide, in its annual performance and final reports, data about progress in meeting these measures. To receive funds after the initial year of a multi -year award, grantees must submit an annual performance report that describes the progress the project has made toward meeting the predefined benchmarks and milestones. This performance report also provides program staff with data r elated to the GPRA measures established for the program. 12 Authorized representatives for the grant site sign the annual performance report and, in doing so, certify that to the best of the signer's knowledge and belief, all data in the performance report were true and correct and that the report fully disclosed all known weaknesses concerning the accuracy, reliability, and completeness of the data included. Generally, the Department relies on the certification concerning data supplied by grantees and wil l not conduct further reviews, unless data quality concerns arise. The ED -funded Technical Assistance Center on Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (www.pbis.org) provides on -going training and technical assistance on data collection. Assertions Performance Reporting System The Department of Education has a system in place to capture performance information accurately and that system was properly applied to generate the performance data in this report. In instances in which data are supplied by grantees as part of required periodic performance reports, the data that are supplied are accurately reflected in this report. Data related to the drug control programs included in this Performance Summary Report for Fiscal Year 2020 are recorded in the Department of Education's software for recording performance data and are an integral part of our budget and management processes. Explanations for Not Meeting Performance Targets The explanations provided for not meeting performance targe ts are reasonable given past experience, available information, and available resources. No recommendations for plans to revise performance targets are needed, because the only targets not met were for the last performance period for the applicable grants . Methodology for Establishing Performance Targets The methodology described to establish performance targets for FY 2021 is reasonable given past performance , current circumstances, and available resources. It should be noted that 100 percent of the grantees were affected by unanticipated school closures and restructuring instruction because of the COVID -19 pandemic. The Department has set FY 2021 targets anticipating a relatively small improvement in perf ormance over FY 2020 based on reasonable expectations of grantees' continued progress, with possible modifications, and due to delays in FY 2020 activities . 13 Performance Measures for Significant Drug Control Activities The Department of Education has est ablished at least one accepta ble performance measure for the Drug Control Decision Unit identified in its Detailed Accounting of Fiscal Year 20 20 Drug Control Funds. Criteria for Assertions Data No workload or participant data support the assertions provided in this report. Sources of quantitative data used in the report are well documented. These data are the most recently available and are identified by the year in which the data was collected. Other Estimation Methods No estimation methods other than professional judgment were used to make the required assertions. When professional judgment was used, the objectivity and strength of those judgments were explained and documented. Professional judgment was used to establish targets for programs until data from at least one grant cohort were available to provide additional information needed to set more accurate targets. We routinely re -evaluate targets set using professional judgment as additional information about actual p erformance on measures becomes available. Reporting Systems Reporting systems that support the above assertions are current, reliable, and an integral part of the Department of Education's budget and management processes. Data collected and reported for the measures discussed in this report are stored , or will be stored, in the Department of Education's PPI-JIRA (Program Performance Information) system. Data from PPI-JIRA are used in developing annual budget requests and justifications .

Since ACF's obligations for drug -related activities falls below the reporting threshold of $50 million, we attest that full compliance with the ONDCP Circular would constitute an unreasonable reporting burden. 330 C Street, S.W., Washington, DC 20201 | www.acf.hhs.gov Amanda E. Barlow -SDigitally by Amanda E. Barlow -S Date: 2021.03.17 13:24:53 -04'00'Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families Detailed Accounting Submission Within the Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) program, the Regional Partnership Grants (RPG) are competitive grants for regional organizational partnerships to provide services and activities to children and families impacted by a parent's or caretaker's substance abuse. Resource Summary FY 2020 Obligations *($ in millions) Drug Resources by Function Regional Partnership Grants $30 Total, Drug Resources by Function $30 Drug Resources by Decision Unit Administration for Children Youth and Families $30 Total, Drug Resources by Decision Unit $30 1. Methodology: There is $30 million allocated for RPG as part of the larger PSSF program, and costs specific to drug prevention are not tracked separately within the RPG program. Funds are competitively awarded to jurisdictions that provide, through interagency collaboration and integration of programs and services, activities and services that are designed to increase the well-being of, improve permanency outcomes for, and enhance the safety of children who are in out-of-home placements or are at risk of being placed in out-of-home placements as a result of a parent's or caretaker's substance misuse. 2. Drug Methodology: Providing the total obligation funded to the RPG program is the only method to estimate drug prevention for the larger PSSF program. ACF obligated $30 million, which is $20 million from the mandatory fund and $10 million from the discretionary fund to support the RPG program to provide general technical assistance and evaluation services to jurisdictions, as well as services and activities to children and families impacted by a parent's or caretaker's substance abuse. Grantees select a range of services and activities that increase the well-being, permanency, and safety of children who are in or at risk of being placed in an out-of-home placement due to parental substance misuse. Examples of those services and activities may include substance abuse treatment for parents as well as other social service activities that improve parenting capacity and family functioning.

Information regarding the performance of the drug control efforts of ACF is based on agency Government Performance and Results Modernization Act (GPRMA) documents and other agency information that measures the agency's contribution to the FY 2018 -2022 HHS Strategic Plan. The table and accompanying text represent highlights of its achievements and includes performance data through FY 2019, the most recent year for which data are available. Since funding for RPG is part of the larger PSSF program, ACF considers those activities to be part of the larger program pe rformance goals, which includes the key measure in the table below. 2. Prior Years Performance Targets and Results: Measure FY Target Result 7P1: Of all children who exit foster care in less than 24 months, maintain the percentage who exit to permanency (reunification, living with relative, guardianship or adoption). (PSSF, Guardianship Assistance) (Outcome) 2019 93.1% 92.2% (Target Not Met) 2018 92.4% 92.9% 92.2% 92.2% (Target Met) 2016 92.1% 92.0% (Target Not Met) The FY 2016 result of 92.0 percent reflected improved performance over the FY 2015 result of 91.9 percent but fell just short of the target of 92.1 percent. In FY 2017, performance increased to 92.2 percent, meeting the set target of 92.2 percent, and the FY 2018 target of 92.4 percent was exceeded with a result of 92.9 percent. In FY 2019, performance declined to 92.2 percent, missing the target of 93.1 percent. ACF will continue to support state agencies as they work to move children to permanent homes. 3. Current and Future Year Performance Targets: Measure FY Target Result 7P1: Of all children who exit foster care in less than 24 months, maintain the percentage who exit to permanency (reunification, living with relative, guardianship or adoption). (PSSF, Guardianship Assistance) (Outcome) 2022 Prior Result 92.4% Oct-21 ACF will continue to support state agencies as they work to move children to permanent homes and anticipates that, despite small annual fluctuations, the performance will continue to improve by 0.2 percentage points over the previous year's performance through FY 2022. 4. Quality of Performance Data : States report child welfare data to ACF through the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis Reporting System (AFCARS). All state semi-annual AFCARS data submissions undergo extensive edit-checks for validity. The results of the AFCARS edit-checks for each of the six-month data submissions are automatically generated and sent back to each state, to help the state to improve data quality. Many states submit revised data to ensure that accurate data are submitted, often for more than one prior submission period. ACF has conducted AFCARS compliance reviews in all states. All states reviewed were required to undertake a comprehensive AFCARS Improvement Plan (AIP). To speed improvement in these data, the agency provides technical assistance to states to improve reporting to AFCARS, improve statewide information systems, and to make better use of their data. All of these activities should continue to generate additional improvements in the data over the next few years. Assertions: 1. Performance reporting system is appropriate and appl ied. Yes - see response number four (4) Quality of Performance Data above. 2. Explanations for not meeting performance targets are reasonable. Yes - see narrative response number two (2) Prior Years Performance Targets and Results above. 3. Methodology to establish performance targets is reasonable and consistently applied. Yes - future performance targets take into account most recent performance in order to account for trend data. 4. Adequate performance measures exist for all significant drug control activities. Yes - as noted previously, ACF considers the drug control activities to be part of the larger program performance goal 7P1, which is a key measure for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program area. Naomi Goldstein Deputy Assistant Secretary for Planning, Research, and Evaluation TO: Director Office of National Drug Control Policy FROM: Amanda Barlow Director Office of Legislative Affairs and Budget Administration for Children and Families SUBJECT: FY 20 20 Assertions Budget formulation Repor t In accordance with the requirement s of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Memo, and the ONDCP National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Review Circular , I make the following assertion regarding the attached ACF's FY 2022 HHS-J submitted to ONDCP over the summer, and the assertions that : The summer Budget Formulation was provided to ONDCP at the same time as that budget request is submitted to the Department. The funding request provided to ONDCP represented the funding levels in the budget submission to t he Department. and other Substance Abuse and reauthorized through FY 2021 as part of t he Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-123). Grants funded under this program support regional partnerships in establishing or enhancing a collaborative infrastructure to build a region's capacity to meet a broad range of needs for families affected by substance use disorders and involved with or at risk for involvement with the child welfare system. Program Description and Accomplishments On the mandatory side , there are $20 million in funds reserved for the Regional Partnership Grants (RPG) Progra m to provide services and activities to benefit children and families affected by a parent's or caretaker's substance abuse, including opioid addiction, who come to the attention of or at risk for becoming involved with the child welfare system. In FY 2018 and FY 2019, the RPG Program received an additional $20 million appropriation above the authorized funding level. In September 2017, ACF awarded 17 grants in 17 states to improve the well -being of families and children affected by substance abuse and to build on the evaluation findings from previous RPG projects . Results from previous RPG projects demonstrate that the majority of children at risk of removal remained in their parent's custody following enrollment into RPG services. The rates of placem ent into permanent settings, including reunification with their parent(s), increased significantly in the year following RPG enrollment, among the subset of youth who were in an out -of-home placement. In addition, the overall rates of child maltreatment decreased substantially in the year after enrollment in the RPG program. In addition to the funding authorized in Title IV -B, subpart 2, of the Social Security Act, the FY 2018, FY 2019, and FY 2020 appropriations included additional discretionary funds for special initiatives. The FY 2018 and FY 2019 appropriations bills included an additional $20 million in discretionary funding to increase funding for RPGs. Using the additional discretionary funds provided in those appropriations, ACF awarded 10 three- year RPG projects in FY 2018 and 8 five -year RPG projects in FY 2019. The FY 2020 Appropriations Act included an additional $10 million for the RPG program. The FY 2020 appropriations will be for funding 24-month supplemental extensions of R PG projects funded in FY 2018. The purpose of this supplemental funding is to enhance the specific, well -defined program services and activities underway with a particular emphasis on activities for continuous data-informed partnerships; to institutionalize program strategies and evaluation activities; and to plan for the sustainability of the project. Budget Summary The FY 2022 request for the PSSF program on the mandatory side, is , to continue the success of earlier RPGs and will support state efforts to reduce foster care placements due to parental substance use. Adult substance use disorders, including opioid use disorder , remain a major and growing factor for involvem ent in the child welfare system and in out -of-home placements. The RPG program represen ts the only source of funding specifically focused on the intersection of substance use disorders, including opioid addiction, and child welfare involvement.

We also reviewed the Performance Summary Report, wh ich includes management's asse rtions and related performance information for the fiscal year ended Sept ember 30, 2020. Lastly, we reviewed the Budget Formulation Compliance Report, which includes budget formulation information for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2022 1, and the Chief Financial Officer's or accountable senior executive's assertions relating to the budget fo rmulation information. CDC management is responsible for, and submitte d, the Detailed Accounting Re port, Performance Summary Report, and Budget Formulation Compliance Report, which were prepared in accordance with the ONDCP Circular National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews , dated October 22, 2019 (ONDCP Compliance Reviews Circ ular). It is our responsibility to express a conclusion about the reliability of management's asser tions based on our review. We performed this review as required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1704(d)(1) and as authorized by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703(d)(7) and in compliance with th e ONDCP Compliance Reviews Circular. 1Although CDC's Budget Performance Compliance Report wa s provided to ONDCP as of FY20, the budget figures reflect the FY22 funding request. Amy conducted our review in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified P ublic Accountants and the standards app licable to attesta tion engagements, as described in the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) publication, Government Auditing Standards (July 2018). Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to obtain limited assurance about wh ether any material modifica tions should be made to management's assertions to be in accordance with the criteria. A review is substantially less in scope than an examination, the objective of whic h is to obtain reasonable assurance and express an opinion about whether manageme nt's assertions are in accordance with the criteria in all material respects. Accordingly, we do not expres s such an opinion. We believe that our review provides a reasonable basis for our conclusion. Based on our review, we are not aware of any ma terial modifications th at should be made to CDC's Detailed Accoun ting Report and Performance Summary Report for fiscal year 2020 and CDC's Budget Formulation Compliance Report for fi scal year 2022 for them to be in accordance with the ONDCP Compliance Reviews Circular.CDC's Detailed Accounting Re port, Performance Summary Re port, and Budget Formulation Compliance Report assertions 2are included as Attachments A, B, and C, respectively. ******** Although this report is an unrestr icted public document, the inform ation it contains is intended solely for the information and use of Congr ess, ONDCP, and CDC.

Explanations for Not Meeting Performance Targets are Reasonable While opioid overdose deaths decline, IMF (illicitly manufactured fentanyl) deaths continue to increase and involve more drugs. Gladden 2019, shows a small 4.6% decrease in opioid overdose deaths from July\u2014December 2017 to January\u2014June 2018 in 25 states. However, i ncreases in IMF overdos e deaths involving multiple drugs almost negated decreases in fentanyl analog deaths and prescription opioid-involved overdose deaths. In contrast to the decreases in opioid overdose, opioid deaths involving IMF increased by 11.1%. The report also shows increases in IMF deaths co-occurring with multiple opioids, benzodiazepines, cocaine, and methamphetamines; these increases almost negated declines in other types of opioid overdose deaths. In the evolving drug epidemic, synthetic opioids and polysubstance use continue to drive the trend in overdose deaths. Gladden RM, O'Donnell J, Mattson CL, Seth P.

The baseline using 2015 was generated using the 29 PfS states as the denominator and the 2016 Actual and Target Measures for outlying years were calculated using the 29 PfS states, as opposed to the 5 states used in years prior. 3 A new baseline and subsequent years' targets were calculated using a broader drug overdose death category to better repr esent the opioids recently associated with drug overdose mortality (including prescription, heroin, and synthetic other than methadone) in recognition of the evolving nature of the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States. 4 CDC will replace measure because the overdose death data do not distinguish between discrete types of opioids, using a me asure that does will better guide prevention activities. New measu r e: Reduce the age-adjusted annual rate of overdose deaths involving natural and semisynthetic opioids (e.g., oxycodone, hydrocodone) or methadone as a contributing cause of death among states funded through CDC's multi-state surveillance and prevention cooperative agreement (per 100,000 residents) 2017 Historical Actual 2018 Historical Actual 2019 Historical Actual 2020 Target 2021 Target 4.40 per 100,000 residents 4.9 per 100,000 residents TBD 3.91 per 100,000 residents 3.74 per 100,000 residents New measur e: Reduce age-adjusted annual rate of overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone (e.g., fentanyl) among states funded through CDC's multi-state surveillance and prevention cooperative agreement (per 100,00 residents) 2017 Historical Actual 2018 Historical Actual 2019 Historical Actual 2020 Target 2021 Target 9.0 per 100,000 residents 11.2 per 100,000 residents TBD 7.99 per 100,000 residents 7.65 per 100,000 residents Performanc e Measures\u2014The report must describe the performance measures used by the agency to assess the National Drug Control Program activities it carried out in the most recently completed fiscal year and provide a clear justification for why those measures are ATTACHMENT B Page 3 of 6appropriate for the associated National Drug Control Program activities. The performance report must explain how the measures: clearly reflect the purpose and activities of the agency; enable assessment of agency contribution to the National Drug Control Strategy; are outcome-oriented; and are used in agency management. The description must include sufficient detail to permit non-experts to understand what is being measured and why it is relevant to those activities. CDC has been tracking the rise of opioid overdose deaths and using the data to inform prevention activities to curb this alarming epidemic. Over 450,000 people have died from overdoses involving opioids - prescription or illicit in the United States from 1999 through 2018. In response to this growing public health crisis, CDC launched its Overdose Prevention in States (OPIS) effort in FY 2016 as means to equip states with resources and expertise needed to reverse this epidemic. As a part of OPIS, CDC's Prescription Drug Overdose Prevention for States (PfS) program funded 29 state health departments to advance and evaluate comprehensive state-level interventions for preventing opioid-related overdose, misuse, and abuse. CDC has tailored its response as the epidemic continues to evolve. In FY 2019, CDC released its new Notice of Funding Opportunity, Overdose Data to Action (OD2A). This program funds 47 states, Washington, D.C., 16 localities, and two territories to advance the understanding of the opioid overdose epidemic and to scale-up prevention and response activities which builds on previous surveillance efforts to foster an interdisciplinary, comprehensive and cohesive public health approach to the complex and changing nature of the opioid overdose epidemic. In FY 2022, CDC will continue to support recipients along the trajectory of moving from data to action, building upon work completed through OD2A. Currently, CDC is measuring progress in reducing overdose deaths involving all opioids among the states funded specifically for PfS for the award made in FY 2016. CDC updated its measures to ensure that the denominators adequately capture states funded through CDC's multi-state surveillance and prevention cooperative agreement. Since 2016, as the epidemic has evolved, CDC has scaled its programs from an initial cohort of states to a program with a national scope. The updated language allows CDC to consistently report outcomes based on the denominator of funded states. For FY 2022, CDC's measure of natural and semi-synthetic opioid overdose deaths was replaced with a new measure that captures methadone and thus better captures overdoses related to prescription opioids. This update allows CDC to better guide prevention activities related to safer prescribing. In FY 2018, the age-adjusted annual rate of opioid deaths involving prescription opioids was 4.9 per 100,000 residents among states funded for the PfS program. Prior Years Performance Targets and Results\u2014For each performance measure, the report must provide actual performance information for the previous four fiscal years and compare the results of the most recently completed fiscal year with the projected (target) levels of performance established for the measures in the agency's annual performance budget for that year. If any performance target for the most recently completed fiscal year was not met, the report must explain why that target was not met and describe the agency's plans and schedules for meeting future targets. Alternatively, if the agency has concluded ATTACHMENT B Page 4 of 6it is not possible to achieve the established target with available resources, the report should include recommendations concerning revising or eliminating the target. See charts above for targets and actuals. CDC did not meet its most recent (FY18) target to reduce the age-adjusted annual rate of overdose deaths involving opioids per 100,000 population among the states funded through Prescription Drug Overdose: Prevention for States (PfS) program. We believe this is related to the growing issue of polysubstance use which means that an opioid-involved overdose often occurs in combination with exposure to other opioids and/or other non-opioid substances. Some examples of polysubstance exposures found in combination in overdose deaths include: (IMF) and methamphetamine; and prescription or illicit opioids and benzodiazepines. The overdose epidemic has grown increasingly complex by co- involvement of prescription and illicit drugs. For example, synthetic opioids (primarily IMF) were involved in 23.7% of deaths involving prescription opioids, 37.4% involving heroin, and 40.3% involving cocaine. CDC will continue to strengthen surveillance activities, identify interventions, and implement prevention programs that address the evolving nature of the epidemic. In an example of the success of CDC's current opioid programs, the Forest County Potawatomi Community in Wisconsin created a media campaign targeting the stigma associated with opioid use disorder within Native American culture. In collaboration with the Tribe's Executive Council, the campaign kick-off engaged community members, law enforcement, media, and over 90 tribal youth. The media campaign \"blitz\" featured a television ad running 62 times per week during peak programming, and print media (billboards) displaying images of tribal members. Since the launch of the campaign, Forest County Potawatomi Community has experienced no deaths by overdose, as well as an increase in community members seeking inpatient treatment, medication- assisted treatment, and residence in transitional living homes. CDC has also replaced the measure because the overdose death data do not distinguish between discrete types of opioids; using a measure that does will better guide prevention activities. Current Year Performance Targets\u2014Each report must specify the performance targets established for National Drug Control Program activities in the agency's performance budget for the current fiscal year and describe the methodology used to establish those targets. See target charts on first page of report. Targets were set based upon an understanding of scientific findings and current and planned CDC-funded state-level activities to address and prevent opioid overdoses. Quality of Performance Data\u2014The agency must state the procedures used to ensure that the performance data described in this report are accurate, complete, and unbiased in presentation and substance. Agency performance measures must be supported by data sources that are directly pertinent to the drug control activities being assessed and ideally allow documentation of small but significant changes. These data are from CDC's National Center for Health Statistics' National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). NVSS data are provided through contracts between NCHS and vital registration systems operated in the various jurisdictions legally responsible for the registration of vital ATTACHMENT B Page 5 of 6events including deaths. The age-adjusted rates of overdose deaths involving opioids per 100,000 are based on death certificate data captured in NVSS. oNumerator=Annual number of drug poisoning deaths (also referred to as drug overdose deaths) involving opioids among funded states oDenominator=Bridged-race population estimates for funded states (produced by U.S. Census Bureau in collaboration with NCHS) ATTACHMENT B Page 6 of 6 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 7500 Security Boulevard, Mailstop C3-01-24 Baltimore, Maryland 21244-1850 Office of Financial Management MEMORANDUM DATE: March 4, 2021 TO: Director Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) FROM: Megan Worstell Director, Office of Financial Management and Chief Financial Officer Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services SUBJECT: ONDCP Circular: National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews(Revised Memo from October 30, 2020 Sections 6-8) In accordance with the requirements of the ONDCP Circular: National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews, dated October 22, 2019, CMS is making the following ONDCP \"technical edits\" based on comments received from ONDCP to our compliance memo submitted to Department of Health and Human Services dated October 30, 2020.

Reprogrammings or Transfers CMS asserts that there have been no reprogra mming or transfers, since we do not receive specific ONDCP appropriation funding for drug control activities.Fund Control Notices CMS asserts that we do not receive specific ONDCP appropriation funding for drug control activities. Therefore, our estimates are not based on obligations, but are based on estimates of the Medicare and Medicaid current law benefit costs, which are conducted by the CMS OACT. Section 8 - Performance Summary Report In accordance with the requirements of the ONDCP Circular: National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Review, dated October 22, 2019, CMS makes the following assertions under Section 8 ,Performance Summary Report for the National Drug Control Activities: CMS' approach to drug control budget estimates is different from other agencies, since CMS does not receive specific ONDCP appropriation funding for drug control activities. As such, CMS does not feature specific performance measures related to drug control activities in the CMS budget justification. The performance sec tion of our drug control chapter reflects the scope of substance use disorder activities and interventions suppor ted by our mandatory program spending and does not correlate with any specific measures, targets or results. Please refer to our published FY 2021 CMS Congressional Justification. Performance Reporting Systems CMS asserts that we do not feature specific perfo rmance measures, targets or results related to drug control activities in the CMS budget jus tification since CMS does not receive specific ONDCP appropriation f unding for drug control activ ities. As such, the performance section of our drug control chapter reflects the scope of substance use disorder activities and interventions supported by our mandatory program spending.

Executive Summary CMS does not receive specific Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) appropriation funding for drug control activities that ties directly to sp ecific account structures or performance measures. Our estimates of the Medicare and Medicaid current law benefit costs are conducted by the CMS Office of the Actuary (OACT). The performance section of our drug control chapter reflects the scope of substance use diso rder activities and interventions supported by our mandatory program spending and does not correlate with any specific measures, targets or results. In reviewing the budget formulation circular issued and based on the unique characteristics of CMS, the Attachment C: Alignment of Budget Submission to Drug Control Funding Priorities is not applicable. With this memorandum, we have included Attachment A : FY 2022CMS DCP Health and Human Services Justification (HHS-J). impacts communities nationwide. In addition, in conjunction with the Department of Health a nd Human Services (HHS), CMS continues to focus on Agency Priority Goals (APG) such as the Reducing Opioid Morbidity and Mortality. Additional information can be found on Performance.gov . Medicare Part B In 2020, CMS implemented Section 2005 of the SU PPORT Act, which created a new Medicare benefit for OUD treatment services furnishe d by opioid treatment programs, including Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) with methadone. CMS imp lemented this benefit with flexibility for the delivery of OUD treatment counseling and therapy services using two-way interactive audio-video communication technology as clinic ally appropriate. CMS also implemented new Medicare policies to expand treatment options for beneficiaries with OUD: a set of bundled episodes of care for management an d counseling for OUD in a doctor's office that are payable under the Physician Fee Schedule (PFS). Medicare Part D CMS has incrementally adopted successful opioid policies in the Part D program to address opioid overutilization, while preventing the interrup tion of medically necessary drug therapy. Part D sponsors are now expected to implement improved opioid safety alerts at the point of service that alert a pharmacist of possible overutilization. CMS expects all Part D sponsors to limit initial opioid prescription fills for the treatment of acute pain to no more than a seven days' supply, consistent with the Centers for Dis ease Control and Preventi on (CDC) Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain, to reduce th e potential for chronic opioid misuse or abuse. CMS' Overutilization Monitoring System uses administrative data to identify potentially at-risk beneficiaries who meet certain clinical guidelines in quarterly reports to Part D plans. Part D plans may adopt drug manageme nt programs to address poten tial overutilization of frequently abused drugs by identified beneficiaries. If deemed necessary, a sponsor could limit at-risk beneficiaries' access to coverage for such drug s through pharmacy lock-in, prescriber lock-in, and/or a beneficiary-specific point-of-sale (POS) claim edit. To increase access to MAT, which include a broa d range of medications adjunctive to counseling and behavioral therapies to treat substance use disorders (SUD), CMS requires that Medicare Part D formularies include covere d Medicare Part D drugs used for MAT. In 2020, all plans will have at least one MAT pr oduct on a non-branded tier. Medicaid The Federal government establishes general guide lines for state Medicaid programs, while states have significant authority to design, implement and administer their own programs. CMS works to ensure that states have the tools they need and to share best practices to improve care for individuals with OUD. States have long been required to develop a Drug Utilization Review (DUR) program aimed, in part, at reducing inappropriate prescribing of outpatient prescription drugs covered under the State's Medicaid Prog ram. The Medicaid DUR Program promotes patient safety through state-ad ministered utilization ma nagement tools and systems that interface with the claims processing systems. In addition, pursuant to section 1010 of the SUPPORT Act, CMS has provided additional guidance to states seeking to promote non-opioid options for chronic pain management. While Medicaid programs vary by state, all 50 stat es currently offer some form of MAT. To further expand coverage, Section 5022 of the SUPPORT Act makes be havioral health a mandatory benefit for children and pregnant women covered under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), requiring that child health and pregnancy-related assistance include coverage of services necessary to prevent, di agnose, and treat substance use disorders. In addition, CMS issued guidance on best practices in Medicaid for covering MAT in a joint informational bulletin with Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Instituteon Drug Abuse. CMS uses its demonstration authority under Secti on 1115 of the Social Security Act to provide a streamlined process for states interested in in creasing access to the full continuum of care for beneficiaries with SUD. This opportunity allows coverage of services to Medicaid beneficiaries who are short-term residents in an institution for mental diseases (IMD), provided that coverage is part of a state's comprehensive OUD/SUD stra tegy. Over half of states have an approved SUD demonstration in place. Models Through the CMS Innovation Center's Maternal Opioid Misuse (MOM) Model, CMS awarded grants to states that are designed to address fragmentation in the care of pregnant and postpartum Medicaid beneficiaries with SUD. The primary goals of the model are to improve quality of care and reduce costs for pregnant and postpartum women with OUD and their infants. Furthermore, CMS also entered into cooperative agreements with states for the Integrated Care for Kids (InCK) Model. The InCK model aims to improve child health, reduce avoidable inpatient stays and out-of-home placement, and create sustainable payment models to coordinate physical and behavioral health care.

The Medicaid total reflects the net outlays of Medical Assistance Payments benefit grants and the Vaccines for Children Program, administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Medicare total reflects gross benefit outlays. Attachment C FY 2020 Drug Control Methodology 1) Drug Methodology - The Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Drug Control budgetary resources are derived from the Medicare and Medicaid curren t law benefit costs by the CMS Office of the Actuary. See detail below how Medicaid and Medicare methodology is determined. a. FY 2020 Outlays/Enacted by Budget Decision Unit - CMS distributes drug control treatment in to two functions: Medicaid - Treatment Medicare - Treatment Medicaid Treatment: Included in this Drug Control Accounting re port for FY 2020 are estimated Medicaid outlays, rather than obligations, since CMS receives no direct funding from ONDCP. Based on the Medicaid Methodology stated below, OACT projected $5,640.0 milli on in estimated outlays in Medicaid treatment costs based on the methodology below. Medicaid Methodology These Medicaid projections were based on data from the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) for 2007 through 2012, based on expenditures for claims with substance use disorders as a primary diagnosis. Managed care expenditures were estimated based on the ratio of substance use disorder expenditures to all expenditures for fe e-for-service by eligibility group. The estimates were trended forward to Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 us ing the growth rate of expenditures by state and eligibility category from the CMS-64, MAX data, and estimates c onsistent with the President's Budget. The annual growth rates were adjusted by comparing the rate of substance use disorder expenditure growth from 2007-2011 to all service expenditure growth and adjusting the growth rate proportionately. Medicare Treatment: Included in this Drug Control Accounting re port for FY 2020 are estimated Medicare outlays, rather than obligations, since CMS receives no direct funding from ONDCP. Based on the Medicare Methodology stated below, OACT pr ojected $2,910.0 million in estimated outlays in Medicare treatment costs based on the methodology below. Medicare Methodology The estimates of Medicare spending for the treatment of substance use disorder are based on the FY 2021 President's Budget baseline. These pr ojections reflect estimate d Part A and Part B spending and are based on an analysis of historical fee-for-service claims through 2018, using the primary diagnosis code 6included on the claims. The histor ical trend was used to make 6Based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding system. The applicable ICD-9 codes for substance abuse include a subset of the 291, 292, 303, 304, and 305 category of codes, and also ICD-9 code 7903. The applicable ICD-10 codes for substance abuse include a of codes.projections into the future. These projections are very similar to those for the 2020 President's Budget and vary only slightly due to changes in the baseline. An adjustment was made to reflect spending for beneficiaries who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans, since their actual claims are not available. It was assumed that the proportion in costs related to substance use disorder treatment was similar for beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans as for those enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare. These estimates do not include spending under Medicare Part D because there is not a straightforward way to get this information. There is no diagnosis code associated with prescription drug claims, and drugs used to treat substance use disorder are often also used to treat other conditions. 2) Methodology Modifications - None 3) Reprogramming or Transfers - CMS does not receive direct appropriations from the ONDCP and have no reprogramming or transf ers that would be applicable. 4) Other Disclosures -N o n e DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 7500 Security Boulevard, Mailstop C3 -01-24 Baltimore, Maryland 21244 -1850 Office of Financial Management MEMORANDUM DATE: TO: FROM: October 30, 2020 Richard J. Baum Performance Budget Coordinator Office of National Drug Control Policy Megan Wors te ll Director and Chief Financi al Officer Office of Financial Management Centers for Medi care & Medicai d Services SUBJECT: Drug Control Agency Compliance In accordance with the requirements of the National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews , dated October 22, 2019 , the Center s for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is providing this memorandum in response. Obligations by Budget Decision Unit CMS does not receive specific Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) appropriation funding for drug control activities . Therefore, o ur estimates are not based on obligations, but are based on estimates of the Medicare and Medicaid current law benefit costs, which are conducted by the CMS Office of the Actuary (OACT) . In addition, CMS does not have any grant programs scored in the National Drug Control Program budget ; therefore , there are no applicable programs listed on grants.gov . The performance information for the CMS programs identified in the methodology agreed to by ONDCP are available in the CMS Congressional Justification and in the ONDCP National Drug Control Strategy. Drug Methodology Medicare Medicare provides coverag e for hospital, physician, skilled nursing facility, home health care, and other medical care services, as well as Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, to eligible Americans. Medicare benefits are permanently authorized with Medicare substance use disorder treatment benefit payments being made by Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B. This benefit outlay total includes the estimated impact for services provided to beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage (Part C) . Medicare Part D prescription dr ug spending is not counted in these estimates. Medicaid Medicaid is a means -tested health care entitlement program financed by the States and the Federal Government. Medicaid mandatory services include substance use disorder services for detoxification and treatment for substance use disorder needs when identified as part of early and periodic screening, as well as diagnostic and treatment services for individuals under age 21 years of age. Additional Medicaid substance use disorder treatment services may be provided as optional services. The recently enacted Substance Use -Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment ( SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act also requires States to cover medication -assisted treatments from FY 2020 - FY 2025. (See Exhibit A) Application of Drug Methodology CMS asserts that the drug methodology disclosed in Exhibit A was the actual methodology used to generate the table s and narrative s required by Section 6a. Material Weaknesses or Other Findings CMS asserts there have been no material weaknesses or findings or other findings by independent sources, or other known weaknesses, including those identified in the CMS 's Annual Statement of Assurance under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A- 123, Appendix A and the Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) , which may affect the presentation of prior year drug -related estimates . Please refer to the FY 2019 CMS Financial Report on the Independent Auditor's Financial Statement Opinion and Laws and Regulation Letters. Methodology Modifications CMS asserts no modifications were made to ONDCP methodology for reporting drug control resources from the previous year's reporting. Reprogr ammings or Transfers CMS assert s the drug activity data prese nted are assoc iated from mandato ry spend ing estimates based on the Medicare and Me dicaid curren t law benef it c osts. Fund Contro l N otices CMS assert s that drug activity data prese nted are assoc i ated from mandato ry spend ing estimates based on the Medicare and Me dicaid curren t law benef it c osts and not obligations. Performan ce Summar y Report CMS ' appro ach to drug contro l budge t estimate s is differen t from other agenc ies, since CMS does not receive specific di scret ionary appropr iation funding for drug contro l activiti es. As such, CMS does not feat ure specific perform ance measure s related to drug contro l activities in th e CMS budge t jus tificat ion. The performanc e section of o ur drug contro l chapt er reflects the scope of substance use disorder activiti es and interventi ons supported by our mandatory program spendi ng and does not correl ate with any specifi c measures, targets or results.

FrontzDeputy Inspector General for Audit Services SUBJECT: Independent Attestation Review: Health Resources and Services AdministrationFiscal Year 2020 Detailed Accounting Repor t, Performance Summary Report for National Drug Control Activities, Budget Formulation Compliance Report, and Accompanying Required Asse rtions (A-03-21-00354) This report provides the results of our review of the attached Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Detailed Accounting Report, which includes the table of Drug Control Obligations, related disclosures, and management's assertions for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. We also reviewed the Performance Summary Report, wh ich includes management's asse rtions and related performance information for the fiscal year ended Sept ember 30, 2020. Lastly, we reviewed the Budget Formulation Compliance Report, which includes budget formulation information for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2022, and the Chief Fi nancial Officer's or accountable senior executive's assertions relating to the budget fo rmulation information. HRSA management is responsible for, and submitted, the Detailed Accounting Repor t, Performance Summary Report, and Budget Formulation Compliance Report, which were prepared in accordance with the ONDCP Circular National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews , dated October 22, 2019 (ONDCP Compliance Reviews Circ ular). It is our responsibility to express a conclusion about the reliability of management's asser tions based on our review. We performed this review as required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1704(d)(1) and as authorized by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703(d)(7) and in compliance with th e ONDCP Compliance Reviews Circular. We conducted our review in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified P ublic Accountants and the standards app licable to attesta tion engagements, as described in the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) publication, Government Auditing Standards (July 2018). Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to obtain limited assurance about wh ether any material modifica tions should be made to management's assertions to be in accordance with the criteria. A review is substantially less in Amy Frontz Digitally scope than an examination, the objective of whic h is to obtain reasonable assurance and express an opinion about whether manageme nt's assertions are in accordance with the criteria in all material respects. Accordingly, we do not expres s such an opinion. We believe that our review provides a reasonable basis for our conclusion.The ONDCP Compliance Reviews Circular related to the Detailed Accounting Report, section 7b(1), requires that HRSA include an asserti on that obligations reported by budget decision units are either: (1) actual obligations derived from the bureau's accounting system of record or (2) consistent with the application of the approved methodology for calculating drug control funding against the bureau's accounting system of record. HRSA did not indicate in its assertion that it reported both actual a nd estimated obligations. Although HRSA asserted that the obligations reported by its budget decision unit were actual obligations, we noted that HRSA has two budget decision units and only one reported actual obligations. HRSA reported actual obligations for its Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP) and reported estimated obligations for its Bureau of Primary Health Ca re (BPHC). Due to the methodology described in the report, obligations for BPHC are estimates. HRSA should have indicated the reported obligations were estimated ob ligations, consistent with the ONDCP Compliance Reviews Circular, which allows reporting of estimated obligations. HRSA told us that it will ensure future reports accurately reflect either actual or estimated obligations , as described in the methodology. Our review identified that HRSA incorrectly asse rted that its reported dr ug obligations were only actual obligations. This resulted in a devia tion from the ONDCP Compliance Reviews Circular. Based on our review, except for the matter desc ribed in the preceding paragraphs, we are not aware of any other material m odifications that should be made to HRSA's Detailed Accounting Report and Performance Summary Report for fisc al year 2020 and HRSA's Budget Formulation Compliance Report for fiscal year 2022 for them to be in accordance with the ONDCP Compliance Reviews Circular.

In a query of the 2019 UDS, a total of 802 health centers reported patients and/or patient visits in the SBIRT category, exceeding the program target. The FY 2020 and F Y 2021 performance targets for the two Health Center Program performance measures were set using a methodology based on the number of health centers providing SUD services and SBIRT services. The target for health centers providing SUD services was set at 865 for each of the respective target years, which is a maintenance level from the FY 2019 actual results. Additionally , the target for health centers providing SBIRT services was set at 802 for each of the respective target years, which is a maintenance level from the FY 2019 actual results. These projections reflect no additional Health Center Program awards targeting SUD or SBIRT services provided in FY 2020 and the level of program appropriations projected for FY 2021. The Rural C ommunities Opioid Response Program's goal is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with opioid overdoses in rural communities through the strengthening of the organizational and infrastructural capacity of multi -sector consortiums. HRSA has developed OMB -approved perfor mance measures to support this large -scale initiative, and data collection and analysis of the first reporting period (September 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020) began in spring 2020 and will be completed by fall 2020. QUALITY OF PERFORMANCE DATA BPHC requi res that recipients submit and annual UDS Report on a standardized (calendar) year. Because of the importance of accuracy in these data, all reports are subjected to an intensive editing process. This process, conducted under contract, involves substanti al computer editing plus the use of highly skilled, highly experienced, reviewers who are familiar with health center operations, and business and information technology practices. Reviewers receive annual training. Editing t akes place at three distinct points in the overall process: 1.At recipient, prior to submission. As the recipients enter data into the Electronic Handbooks (EHB), they are informed prior to their submission of the data to BPHC, of any of slightly over 1,000 errors, which might be dete cted. This process generally results in all of the mathematical errors and most of the logic errors being corrected prior to submission. In addition, the EHB system checks to determine that all requiredinformation has been submitted. Missing tables and, especially, missing sub -tables relating to individual programs, are identified and recipients are contacted to obtain themissing information. These submissions are held until complete. 2.By Review er s. Once submitted, the EHB system forwards the reports to reviewers for actual review, and correction (as needed).

Attachments 1Only the Budget Formulation report assertions are included as Attachment C since the report contains prospective information.MEMORANDUM TO: Dir ector Office of National Drug Control Policy THROUGH: Richard Bau m Senior Policy Advisor Office of National Drug Control Policy FROM: Jillian Curtis C hief Financial Officer Indian Health Service SUBJECT: FY 2020 Assertions Conc erning Drug Control Accounting In accordance with the requirements of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Circular National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews , I make the following as sertions regarding the attached annual accounting of drug control funds for the Indian Health Service (IHS): Obligations by Budget Decision Unit I assert that obl igations reported by budget decision unit are the actual obligations from the Unified Financial Management S ystem (UFMS), the agency's accounting system of record for these budget decision units, consistent with the drug budget methodology discussed below. Drug Methodology I assert that the drug methodology used to calculate obligations of prior year budgetary resources by function for all Areas and Operating Offices was reasonable and accurate in accordance with the criteria listed in Section 7a(1) of the Circular. In accordance with these criteria, I have documented/ identified data which support the drug methodology, explained and documented other estimation methods (the assumptions for which are subjected to periodic review) and determined that the financial systems supporting the drug methodology yield data that present fairly, in all material respect, aggre gate obligations from which drug- related obligation estimates are derived. The IHS methodology for estimating the drug control budget was established using the amounts appropriated for the Alcohol and Substance Abuse Prevention programs authorized under Public Law (P.L.) 102-573, the Indian Health Amendments of 1992. See attached table \"Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Treatment and Prevention Program authori zed under P.L. 102- 573\" for list of programs. This table reflects DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES Public Health Service Indian Health Service Rockville MD 20857 ATTACHMENT A Page 1 of 5estimated amounts. When originally authorized and appropriated, the funds were allocated to Tribes in their Indian Self- Determination contracts and compacts by specific programs. However, when the programs were reauthorized and captured under P.L. 102- 573, some IHS Area offices allocated th e funds in lump sum while others maintained the specific program breakout. Therefore, at the current time precise amounts of funding for each program are not available. The table is maintained toestimate current funding level and is the basis of the drug budget control methodology.Excluded is the amount for the Adult Treatment programs, which represents the originalauthorization for IHS to provide alcohol treatment services. The focus on alcoholismtreatment is the reason for the exclusion. Drug Resourc es by D ecision Unit: The IHS drug control funds are appropriated in two budget line items: 1) Alcohol and Substance Abuse (ASA), and 2) Urban Indian Health Programs (UIHP). The ASA funds are primarily allocated to Tribes under their Indian Self-Determination contracts and compacts, where they manage the programs and have authority to reallocate funds to address local priorities. The portion of the alcohol fund included in the drug control budget methodology is as described above, i.e., the entire budget exc luding the amount for adult treatment. The UIHP funds are allocated through contracts and grants to 501(c)(3) organizations. The portion of UIHP funds included in the drug control budget methodology is for the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism programs transferred to the IHS under the UIHP budget. Drug Resources by Function: Under the methodology, two programs through FY 2007 were identified as Prevention programs, Community Education and Training and Wellness Beyond Abstinence. In FY 2008, one half of the new funds appropriated for Methamphetamine and Suicide prevention and treatment were also included in the Prevention function; these funds are now referred to in the table as substance abuse prevention and treatment. The treatment function comprises the remaining program excluding adult treatment. In addition, the amount of UIHP funds is included under the treatment function. Application of Drug Methodology I assert that the drug methodology disclosed in this section was the actual metho dology used to generate the table required by Section 7a(2) of the Circular. Reprogramming or Transfers The IHS did not execut e a reprogramming impacting either the Alcohol and Substance Abuse funding line, nor the Urban Indian Health funding line with f unds appropriated in FY 2020. Funds Control Notices IHS was not issued an y Fund Control Notices by the Director under 21 U.S.C. 1703 (f) and Section 9 of the ONDCP Circular Budget Execution, dated October 22, 2019.

Toedt -05'00' ATTACHMENT B Page 1 of 8FY 2020 Performance Summary Report National Drug Control Activities - Indian Health Service (IHS) Decision Unit 1: Office of Clinical and Preventive Services, Division of Behavioral Health, IHS Measure 1: Improvement/Accreditation: Accreditation Rate for Youth Regional Treatment Centers (YRTCs) in operation 18 months or more. YRTC Accreditation Table 1: Measure 1 FY 2016 Actual FY 2017 Actual FY 2018 Actual FY Actual must describe the performance measures used by the agency to assess the National Drug Control Program activities it carried out in the most recently completed fiscal year and provide a cl ear justification for why those measures are appr opriate for the associated National Drug Control Program activities. The performance report must explain how the measures: clearly reflect the purpose and activities of the agency; enab le assessment of agency contribution to the National Drug Control Strategy; are outcome-oriented; and are used in agency management. The description must include sufficientdetail to permit non-experts to understand what is being measured and why it isrelevant to thos e activities. Measure No. (1): The YRTC Accreditation measures reflects an evaluation of thequality of care associated with accreditation status by either the Joint Commission orthe Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF). This isaccomplished in part by working to ensure that 100 percent of YRTCs achieve andmaintain accreditation status. Accreditation status serves as evidence that the centerscommit to quality improvement, monitor the results of services, and meet rigorousperson-centered standards that emphasize an integrated and indivi dualized approach to services provided to American Indian a nd Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth who enter residential treatment for alc ohol and substance abuse. Agency management uses the performance measure as a tool to monitor the commitment to quality services providedby the centers. (2)Prior Years Performance Targets and Results - For each performance measure, the report must provide actu al performance information for the previous four fiscal years and compare the results of the most recently completed fiscal yearwith the projected (target) levels of performance established for the measures inthe agency's annual performance budget for that year . If any performance target for the most recently completed fiscal year was not met, the report must explainwhy that target was not met and describe the agency's plans and schedules for meeting future targets. Alternatively, if the agency has concluded it is not possibleto achieve the established target with available resources, the report should include recommendations concerning revising or eliminating the target. The 100 percent accreditation performance measure was met in FY 2020. ATTACHMENT B Page 2 of 8 (3) Current Year Performance Targets - Each report must specify the performance targets established for National Drug Control Program activities in the agency 's performance budget for the current fiscal year and describe the methodology used to establish those targets. The FY 2021 performance target for the YR TCs remains unchanged at 100 percent for accreditation status. The methodology used to establish the fiscal year target is 100 percent of YRTCs achieving and maintaining accreditation as a reflection of the quality of care associated with accreditation stat us. The methodology used to determine the actual results at the end of the fiscal year is the number of accredited YRTCs as the numerator and the total number of YRTCs as the denominator. In FY 2020, the number of federally-operated YRTC facilities representing the numerator and denominator was six. (4) Quality of Performance Data- The agency must state the procedures used to ensure that the performance data described in this report are accurate, complete, and unbiased in presentation and substan ce. Agency performance measures must be supported by data sources that are directly pertinent to the drug control activities being assessed a nd ideally allow documentation of small but significant changes. Annually, the IHS Office of Clinical and Preventive Services (OCPS), Division of Behavioral Health (DBH) requires all YRTC s to verify their current accreditation certification status by forwarding a co py of this documentation to Agency Headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. Using verified program documents, this methodology ensures that standards for c ontinued accreditation are continually being met and deficiencies are addressed. To ensure data for this performance measure are accurate, complete, and unbiased, the IHS DBH collects, evaluates, and monitors individual program files for each YRTC. ATTACHMENT B Page 3 of 8 Decision Unit 2: Office of Clinical and Preventive Services, Division of Behavioral Health, IHS Measure 2: Universal Alcohol Screen ing: 9 through 75 years of age Universal Alcohol Screening Table 2: Measure 2 FY 2015 Actual FY 2016 Actual FY 2017 Actual FY 2018 Actual FY 2017 with a baseline result of 68.0 percent. **Measure retired after FY 2017 due to changes to the logic and reporting from a new system, the Integrated Data Collection System Data Mart (IDCS DM). Universal Alcohol Screening Table 2: Measure 2 FY 2016 Actual FY 2017 Actual FY 2018 Actual FY Actual reflects measure logic change to screen patients 9 through 75 years and reporting from the IDCS DM. (1) Performance Measures- The report must describe the performance measures used by the agency to assess the National Drug Control Program activities it carried out in the most recently completed fiscal year and provide a clear justification for why those measures are appr opriate for the associated National Drug Control Program activities. The performance report must explain how the measures: clearly reflect the purpose and activities of the agency; enab le assessment of agency contribution to the National Drug Control Strategy; are outcome-oriented; and are used in agency management. The description must include sufficient detail to permit non-experts to understand what is being measured and why it is relevant to thos e activities. Measure No. (2): The FY 2017 measure, Universal Alcohol Screening, reported alcohol screening among patients ages 12 through 75 years of age. In FY 2018, this measure changed to expand screening among patients ages 9 through 75 years, in an effort to align ages with measure No. (3) Sc reening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT). Screening is an effective tool in identifying risky alcohol use and the updated screening criteria and measures will have a far-reaching positive impact on the overall health of AI/AN communities. (2) Prior Years Performance Targets and Results - For each performance measure, the report must provide actual performance information for the previous four fiscal years and compare the results of the most recently completed fiscal year with the projected (target) levels of performance established for the measures in the agency's annual performance budget for that year . If any performance target for the most recently completed fiscal year was not met, the report must explain why that target was not met and describe the agency's plans and schedules for meeting future targets. Alternatively, if the agency has concluded it is not possible to achieve the established target with available resources, the report should include recommendations concerning revising or eliminating the target. ATTACHMENT B Page 4 of 8 Beginning in FY 2018, the new Universal Al cohol Screening measure reflects updated screening ages of patients ages 9 through 75 years and reporting from IHS's Integrated Data Collection System Data Mart (IDCS DM). The FY 2020 target was 42.4 percent. Final result for FY 2020 IHS Measure No. (2 ) Universal Alcohol Screening will be available by December 31, 2020. (3) Current Year Performance Targets - Each report must specify the performance targets established for National Dr ug Control Program activities in the agency 's performance budget for the current fiscal year and describe the methodology used to establish those targets. The FY 2021 target for Universal Alcohol Screening is 39.0 percent. The target is based on consideration of pr ior year performance and projected funding for the IHS Alcohol and Substance Abuse program. Th e FY 2020 result will be reported from the IDCS DM. (4) Quality of Performance Data- The agency must state the procedures used to ensure that the performance data described in this report are accurate, complete, and unbiased in presentation and substan ce. Agency performance measures must be supported by data sources that are directly pertinent to the drug control activities being assessed a nd ideally allow documentation of small but significant changes. The FY 2018 result reflects the first year of reporting from the IDCS DM. The measure reflects the Annual IHS User Popul ation Estimates in the denominator and is produced by the NDW Workload/Userpop Mart. The IDCS DM enables full I/T/U partic ipation, produces on-demand results, and reduces the amount of time to access data results. The data source for the IDCS DM is the IHS's National Data Warehouse (NDW) that was instituted in 2006. The IDCS DM contains a mirrored subset of NDW data . It uses the Annual IHS User Population Estimates as its denominators for many of IHS's clinical GPRA and GPRAMA performance measures. The NDW built various reports that provide metadata feedback to sites that submit data export files consisting of patient demographics and patient workload. Some acknowledgement reports address the completeness of the NDW data while other error reports identify specific errors in an export f ile. Source data files are accepted \"as is\". The NDW relies on the facility to ensure the quality of the data that is being transmitted. It verifies the integrity of the data after it is loaded; that is, the data received is represented accurately in the NDW. Completeness The NDW addresses file completeness by se nding automated report s that track data exports as they are received and loaded into the NDW, as described in the NDW Export Tracking Data Mart User Guide (https://www.ihs.gov/sites/npirs/themes/res ponsive2017/display_objects/documents/Da ta_TC/NDW_ExportTracking_DataMart_UG.pdf ) 1) The NDW Data Transmission Log Report is an acknowledgement notification email that the file was received. 2) If ATTACHMENT B Page 5 of 8errors are detected in the export file, an acknowledgement notific ation describes why the file was rejected, and 3) NDW Post Da ta Load Report provides a summary of the encounters and patient registration status (a dded, changed, deleted, rejected) as well as any error descriptions. If the individual facility corrects the identified errors, registrations and/or visits, they are included in the next NDW export as modifications. They will be processed and uploaded by the NDW. Data Verification The NDW performs scheduled data integrity checks on samples to ensure the NDW is storing data as it is received from the sites. This is to verify that the data received and processed in the NDW accurately reflects the storage of data transmitted from the source system. The NDW Data Quality Mart provides user population and workload reports that can provide information about possible issues in the \"quality\" of the received data. The NDW Data Quality that provide a quantified picture of problems with their data, as we ll as enough detail to allow record level identification of problematic data. Any detail displayed is within the boundaries of currently required laws and regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The reports high light missing data elements that were not uploaded into the NDW. When a site fi xes those data elements and re-exports, the data can then be uploaded into the NDW as modifications.

SBIRT Table 3: Measure 3 FY 2016 Actual FY 2017 Actual FY 2018 Actual FY Actual New measure reflects measure logic change to screen patients 9 through 75 years and reporting from the IDCS DM. (1) Performance Measures- The report must describe the performance measures used by the agency to assess the National Drug Control Program activities it carried out in the most recently completed fiscal year and provide a cl ear justification for why those measures are appr opriate for the associated National Drug Control Program activities. The performance report must explain how the measures: clearly reflect the purpose and activities of the agency; enab le assessment of agency contribution to the National Drug Control Strategy; are outcome-oriented; and are used in agency management. The description must include sufficient detail to permit non-experts to understand what is being measured and why it is relevant to thos e activities. Measure No. (3): The SBIRT measure will assess patient for risky alcohol use and the level of intervention type needed. Interventions will include either a brief intervention/brief negotiated interview or a referral for brief treatment or more intensive treatment among patients ages 9 through 75 years of age. Screenings will be documented within the local facility Electronic Health Record. The SBIRT model will be used in primary care and emergency depa rtments as a way to integrate behavioral health into care. Research shows that ear ly intervention among risky alcohol drinking patterns can deter more significant issues later in life. By identifying risky drinking patterns early on, IHS will be able to provide services that will reduce the long term effects of alcohol use and a ssociated medical complications for the AI/AN population. (2) Prior Years Performance Targets and Results - For each performance measure, the report must provide actual performance information for the previous four fiscal years and compare the results of the most recently completed fiscal year with the projected (target) levels of performance established for the measures in the agency's annual performance budget for that year . If any performance target for the most recently completed fiscal year was not met, the report must explain why that target was not met and describe the agency's plans and schedules for meeting future targets. Alternatively, if the agency has concluded it is not possible ATTACHMENT B Page 7 of 8to achieve the established target with available resources, the report should include recommendations concerning revising or eliminating the target. Beginning in FY 2018, the new SBIRT measure reflects reporting from IHS's IDCS DM. The FY 2020 target was 12.2 percent. Final result for FY 2020 IHS Measure No. (3) Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referr al to Treatment (SBI RT) will be available by December 31, 2020. (3)Current Year Performance Targets - Each report must specify the performance targets established for National Drug Control Program activities in the agency 's performance budget for the current fiscal year and de scribe the methodology used to establish those targets. The FY 2021 target for the SBIRT is 14.3 percent. The target is based on consideration of prior year performance a nd projected funding for the IHS Alcohol and Substance Abuse program. The FY 2020 resu lt will be reported from the IDCS DM. (4)Quality of Performance Data- The agency must state the procedures used to ensure that the performance data described in this report are accurate, complete,and unbiased in presentation and substan ce. Agency performance measures must be supported by data sources that are directly pertinent to the drug control activities being assessed and ideally allo w documentation of small but significant changes. As a clinical measure, the SBIRT measure is subject to the same processes described for the Universal Alcohol screening measure using the IDCS DM.

It is our responsibility to express a conclusion about the reliability of ma nagement's assertions based on our review. We performed this review as required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1704(d)(1) and as authorized by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703(d)(7) and in compliance with the ONDCP Circular. We conducted our review in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified P ublic Accountants and the standards app licable to attesta tion engagements, as described in the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) publication, Government Auditing Standards (July 2018). Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to obtain limited assurance about whether any ma terial modifications should be made to management's assertions to be in accordance with the criteria. A review is substantially less in scope than an examination, the objective of whic h is to obtain reasonable assurance and express an opinion about whether managemen t's assertions are in accordance with the criteria in all material respects. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. We believe that our review provides a reasonable basis for our conclusion.

Attachmentsfetal alcohol spectrum disorders resulting from alcohol use by the mother during pregnancy. Beginning with the reporting of FY 2010 actual obligations, NIAAA's methodology for developing budget numbers uses the NIHresearch categorization and disease coding (RCDC) fingerprint for underage drinking that allows for an automated categorization process based on electronic text mining to make this determination. Once all underage drinking projects and associated amounts are determined using this methodology, NIAAA conducts a manual review and identifies just those projects and amounts relating to prevention and treatment. Contract expenditures supporting underage prevention activities are also included. This subset makes up the NIAAA ONDCP drug control budget. Prior to FY 2010, there was no validated fingerprint for underage drinking, and the NIAAA methodology was completely dependent upon amanual review by program officers.

NIDA's comprehensive research portfolio addresses a broad range of drug abuse and addiction issues, ranging from the support of fundamental neurobiology to community-based research. As our Nation looks for science-based approaches to enhance its prevention and treatment efforts, NIDA's broad portfolio and its continuing efforts to work with other Agencies and NIH Institutes on a variety of transdisciplinary issues will provide the tools necessary to move these efforts forward. Research serves as the cornerstoneof NIDA's efforts to disseminate research information and educate health professionals and the public, especially our Nation's youth, about the factors influencing drug use, its consequences, and about science-based and tested treatment and prevention techniques. These research and dissemination efforts to develop, test, and disseminate information on the basis of addiction, its consequences, and enhanced therapeutic techniques support the ONDCP Goal 3 (treatment). Efforts to enhance the science base and disseminate information on the factors that inhibit and facilitate drug use and its progression to addiction and other health consequences, and on science-based approaches for prevention interventions support the ONDCP Goal 1 (prevention). NIDA obligations are allocated between prevention and treatment research based on the professional judgment of scientific program officials on specific grant and contract projects. These scientists review the grant application, project purpose and methodology, and/or progress report to determine whether the project meets NIDA's criteria for categorization as prevention or as treatment research. Projects are coded and entered into the NEPS system prior to funding. NIDA's FY 2020 Enacted budget from the FY 2021 President's Budget (PB) was $1,457,724,000. In December of 2019, NIDA received the FY 2020 Enacted budget of $1,462,016,000 ($1,195,695,000 for direct and $266,321,000 for research relating to the Opioid Crisis) which was an increase of $4,292,000 above the FY 2020 CJ.

SRO -5.2 focus es on developing or evaluating the efficacy or effectiveness of new or adapted prevention interventions for substance use disorders (SUD) and contributes to the objective of \"Enhancing Research and the Development of Evidence- Based Prevention Programs\" in the 2020 National Drug Control Strategy . NIDA's prevention efforts, in particular, advance the goal of supporting the research and development of innovative technologies and additional therapies to prevent addiction. Preventing the i nitiation of substance use and minimizing the risks of harmful consequences of substance use is an essential part of addressing SUD. To this end, NIDA funds a portfolio of prevention research to understand and intervene upon mechanisms that underlie risk and resilience for addicti on and common comorbidities. NIDA's prevention research portfolios encompass a broad range of research on how biological, psychosocial, and environmental factors operate to enhance or mitigate an individual's propensity to initiate substance use or to esca late from use to misuse to SUD across different developmental stages. This information, along with rapidly growing knowledge about substance use and addiction (including tobacco, alcohol, illicit, and nonmedical prescription drug use), is helping to inform the development of prevention strategies that are evidence-based and rooted in a growing understanding of the biological (e.g., genetics, neurobiology), psychosocial (e.g., support systems, stress resilience), and environmental (e.g., socioeconomic, cultural) risk and protective factors. NIH -supported research is building the scientific knowledge base needed to advance our goal of developing effective and efficient prevention strategies. As such factor s are identified, NIDA also supports research to develop and test innovative prevention interventions that target underlying risk and protective factors, as well as strategies for effectively and sustainably implementing evidence-based prevention interventions. One example is a multi- site collaborative p roject between NIDA, CDC, SAMHSA and the Appalachian Regional Commission that works with communities to reduce opioid use and its consequences, with the goals of increasing uptake of evidence-based practices, including medication -assisted treatment ( MAT ), HIV/ hepatitis C screening , and overdose prevention. A robust evidence base exists for a variety of prevention interventions, including: School-based models, such as Life Skills Training, that help students develop social,emotional, cognitive, and substa nce refusal skills ; Family -based models, such as Strong African American Families, that provide parents with tools and practices that help their children learn problem-solving and self-regulationskills to support healthy social and emotional development ; and Implementation frameworks , such as Communities That Care that engages a coalition of local community organizations and leaders to identify and intervene on local risk andprotective factors . These prevent ion models have proven effective, but more rese arch is required to determine whether new interventions are required to impact targets specific to the prevention of non-medical use of opioids and opioid use disorder ( OUD), particularly during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood initiation of opioid misuse. In response to this need, NIDA's ATTACHMENT B Page 3 of 20FY 2020 Performance Summary Report for National Drug Control Activities 3 Division of Epidemiology, Services, and Prevention Research (DESPR) is supporting a series of studies to develop and test effective strategies to prevent opioid misuse and OUD among older adolescents and young adults. The focus of these studies is on strategies within settings that can identify and reach at-risk individuals and populations, such as health care, justice, school, and child welfare systems. In addition to opioi d-focused efforts, DESPR supports research on integrating prevention and treatment services into healthcare and community systems to reduce the burden of drug problems across the lifespan. DESPR supports prevention specific portfolios of research and training grants that span efficacy, effectiveness and services -related questions. Within DESPR, the Prevention Research Branch (PRB) cultivates research to understand mechanisms of action of effective prevention approaches, to develop preventive interventions for understudied populations, and to address emerging public health crises. In addition to opioid related research, PRB funds research to develop and test interventions to address factors underlying risk for substance misuse while also enhancing protective factors. (2) Provide n arrative that examines the FY 20 20 actual performance results with the FY 2020 target, as well as prior year actuals. If the performance target was not achieved forFY 20 20, the agency should explain why this is the case. If the agency has concluded it is not possible to achieve the established target with available resources, the agency shouldinclude recommendations on revising or eliminating the target . The FY 2020 target w as met. NIDA funded nine prevention pilot studies that were conducted in FY 2020, under the auspices of the Helping to End Addiction Long- term (HEALSM) Initiative. These grants used the two -phase, milestone -based UG3 -UH3 grant mechanism, which allows for grants that successfully complete pilot-study progress milestones to apply to advance into larger clinical studies. Of those nine pilot studies, seven completed their pilots and were eligible for transition. (Two of the studies had planned for two -year pilot phases, so were not eligible for transition. ) Three of the seven transitioning studies are highlighted as examples below. One transiti oning study involves modifying an existing alcohol and drug prevention intervention designed for American Indian/Alaska Native youth to be appropriate for opioid prevention in young adults 1. The study conducted focus groups to determine how best to engage the target population, adapted and enhanced the intervention to specifically address opioid use, and pilot- tested th e intervention. The scaled-up study will test the intervention in larger groups over a 12- month period, examine the mechanisms by which it produces change, and explore approaches to making it sustainable over time. Another trans itioning study is focused on preventing OUD among adolescents/young adults ages 18-24 years experiencing homelessness , and explor es whether providing housing in addition to opioid and related risk reduction services could improve outcomes2. The pilot study demonstrated feasibility of recruitment, locating housing and placement into housing, and 1 UH3 DA050235- 01: Development and Implementation of a Culturally Centered Opioid Prevention Intervention for American Indian/Alaska Native Young Adults in California 2 UH3 DA050174-0 2: Prevention of OUD: The HOME (Housing, Opportunities, Motivation and Engagement) Randomized Trial ATTACHMENT B Page 4 of 20FY 2020 Performance Summary Report for National Drug Control Activities 4 delivery of prevention services through strengths-based outreach and advocacy. Partnerships with community -based homeless youth service providers and landlords have been established for the post- pilot phase, housing has been identified, and Institutional Review Bo ard (IRB) approval has been obtained. The scaled -up study will compare individuals randomly assigned to receive housing alongside opioid and related risk prevention services to individuals who receive those services alone. A third study devel oped a plan to leverage technology that is appealing to adolescents and young adults to facilitate delivery of an emergency department -based intervention via health coaches. In their transitioning pilot, researchers were able to adapt promising health coach -delivered interventions3 and pilot test feasibility/acceptability in adolescents and young adults, as well as actively engag e hospital administration leadership in the study. As the project transitions to the next phase , it will begin testing the intervention in a sample of over 1,000 adolescents and young adults in emergency department settings. (3) The agen cy should describe the performance target for FY 20 21 and how the agency plans to meet this target . If the target in FY 20 20 was not achieved, this explanation should detail how the agency plans to overcome prior year challenges to meet targets in FY 20 21. The FY 2021 targ et is to launch 1- 2 clinical trials, based on pilot study results, to test the effects of a prevention intervention for opioid use disorder. As stated above, of the nine pilot studies funded in FY 2020, seven reached their milestones and were eligible for transition into clinical trials, with others likely to do so in the next year. NIDA awarded these transition grants at the end of FY 2020, and expects the relevant trials to begin in FY 2021, which should allow the target to be met. (4) The agen cy should describe the procedures used to ensure performance data for this measure are accurate, compl ete, and unbiased in presentation and substance . The agency should also describe the methodology used to establish targets and actuals, as well as thedata source(s) used to collect information. Data Accuracy, C ompleteness and Unbiased Presentation The researc h field is guided by standard scientific methodologies, policies, and protocols. The scientific process also has several benchmarks within it to ensure scientific integrity . For instance, research designs, such as qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods, have each been tested, with evidence- based strategies established to guide the implementation of all scientific research studies . In these processes, data collection, security, management, and structures are clearly defined to ensure optimum ana lyses . Data analyses are guided by statistical methodologies, a mathematical science used to test assumptions. In addition, NIH has incorporated standardized policies and procedures for making funding announcements, assessing meritorious science, monitoring progress of grantees and scientists in achieving the expected outcomes, and assessing performance at the project's 3 UH3 DA050173- 01: Optimized Interventions to Prevent Opioid Use Disorder among Adolescents and Young Adults in the Emergency Department ATTACHMENT B Page 5 of 20FY 2020 Performance Summary Report for National Drug Control Activities 5 conclusion. Researchers are also expected to publish findings in peer-reviewed journals, which offer another layer of assessment and val idation of the findings. In addition, all studies involving human subjects must receive Institutional Review Board (IRB) clearance, yet another form of review that ensures the relevance of the study and the safety of the subjects . NIH's research activities implement and practice all scientifically relevant procedures to ensure data quality and to substantiate findings. In implementi ng scientific research, NIH uses established tools to develop and oversee programs and improve their performance, proactively monitoring grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements and assess their performance. The following briefly describes the NIH scientific process, which has been assessed by outside entities and is regarded as premier. Assessment to fund meritorious sc ience (peer review) . NIH uses rigorous assessment to determine scientific merit and make funding decisions based on the best science. In general, project plans presented in competing grant applications and contract proposals are subject to three levels of review focused on the strength and innovation of the proposed research, the qualifications of the investigator(s), and the adequacy of the applicant's resources: The first le vel of review, called peer review, ensures that the most meritorious sc ience, as determined by the scientific field's experts, is identified for funding. NIH has over 11,000external experts participating in peer review panels, each of whom is nationallyrecognized for his or her area of expertise. The applications are systematically reviewedand scored to inform funding decisions. NIH is one of the few Federal agencies with alegislative requirement for peer review . The second level of review is by the Institute's National Advisory Council, which is comprised of eminent scientists along with members of the general public. The Councilserves as a useful resource to keep each Institute abreast of emerging research needs andopportunities, and to advise the Institute on the overall merit and priority of grantapplications in advancing the research . All members of Council are appointed by the HHS Secretary. The third level of review is by the Institute Director, with input from Institute staff whohave relevant expertise. The Director makes the final decision on whether an applicationwill receive funding. These layers of expert review assessing scientific methodologies and relevance to the field enable funding of the most promising research to advance the field. Consequently, funding decisions made at the agency level are conducted in a consistent, merit -based fashion, guided by scientific methodologies and relevance. Performance monitoring of grants and contracts . Once an award is made, additional NIH policies and guidelines are implemented to ensure oversight of the proposed project aims and program goals. The NIH Grants Policy Statement provides the standardized protocols for monitoring performance-based grants and contracts. Although there are many procedures, a few significant items include the timely submission of progress and final reports. These are assessed by NIH project officers and grants management staff to determine adherence to the approved scientific research plan and to appropriate cost principles an d legislative compliance . Project ATTACHMENT B Page 6 of 20FY 2020 Performance Summary Report for National Drug Control Activities 6 officers may work closely with principal investigators to facilitate adherence, address barriers, and ensure quality programmatic achievements. As a standar d performance- based practice, the approved scientific aims and objectives formulate the terms and conditions of each grant award and become the focus of scientific monitoring. The NIH Grants Policy Statement, referenced as a term of every award, states the specific administrative requirements for project monitoring an d enforcement actions when a grantee fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the award. NIH staff monitor scientific progress against the approved aims and scope of the project, as well as administrative and fiscal compliance through review of periodic progress reports, publications, correspondence, conference calls, site visits, expenditure data, audit reports (both annual institutional financial reports and project-specific reports), and conference proceedings. When a grantee fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award, enforcement actions are applied. These may include modification of the terms of award, suspension, withholding support, and termination. A further che ckpoint for programmatic assessment occurs when the applicant requests renewal support of continuation research. A peer review group again assesses the merits of future research plans in light of the progress made during the previous project period, and any problems in grantee performance are addressed and resolved prior to further funding. This process further demonstrates use of assessments to improve performance. Review of manuscripts. Ultimately, the outcomes of any scientific research are judged based on published results in a peer-reviewed journal. The peer -review publication process is another point at which the quality and innovation of the science undergoes a rigorous evaluation. For most scientific journals, submitted manuscripts are assigned to a staff editor with knowledge of the field discussed in the manuscript. The editor or an editorial board will determine whether the manuscript is of sufficient quality to disseminate for external review and whether it would be of interest to their readership . Research papers that are selected for in -depth review are evaluated by at least two outside referees with knowledge in the relevant field . Papers generally cannot be resubmitted over a disagreement about novelty, interest, or relative merit. If a paper is rejected on the basis of serious reviewer error, the journal may consider a resubmission. Methodology Used t o Establish Targets/Actuals The targets a re established based on the state of the science in a particular field and knowledge of the scientific process by which advances are made. NIDA supports a robust portfolio on implementation science research to better understand the factors that influence successful dissemination and implementation of tested and efficacious interventions in real world settings. The targets are established based on where the field stands in this process and on the next logical scientific step for moving the field forward . Data Sources Each grantee pr ovides an annual progress report that outlines past- year project accomplishments, including information on patients recruited, providers trained, patents filed, manuscripts ATTACHMENT B Page 7 of 20FY 2020 Performance Summary Report for National Drug Control Activities 7 published, and other supporting documentation, depending on the goals of the study. This information allows NIH to evaluate progress achieved or to make course corrections as needed . ATTACHMENT B Page 8 of 20FY 2020 Performance Summary Report for National Drug Control Activities 9 Treatment\" in the 2020 Strategy . (2) Provide n arrative that examines the FY 2020 actual performance results with the FY 2020 target, as well as prior year actuals. If the performance target was not achieved for FY 2020, the agency should explain why this is the case. If the agency has concluded it is not possible to achieve the established target with available resources, the agency should include recommendations on revising or eliminating the target . The FY 2020 target w as met. NIDA funded4 the pre- clinical development of a new implant that will deliver nalmefene, a drug that blocks opioid signaling, over a six -month period. The goal is to advance this compound to be tested in humans for the prevention of relapse to opioid addiction in patients following opioid detoxification. This long- acting formulation will use the Proneura\u00ae technology that has been successful in an FDA-approved long-acting formulation of buprenorphine. This long- acting nalmefene is completing the necessary nonclinical safety, toxicology, pharmacokinetic and manufacturing activities to start studies in humans (clinical trials) and begin the process of appl ying for FDA approval . In FY 2020, NIDA als o funded5 a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GM0017, an implant that delivers the opioid antagonist naltrexone for six months. This compound is being developed for prevention of opioid relapse in individuals with OUD who have been detoxified. Recruitment for this study has been delayed due to COVID-19, but it is expected that clinical results will soon be presented to the FDA. (3) The agency should describe the performance target for FY 2021 and how the agency plans to meet this target . If the target in FY 2020 was not achieved, this explanation should detail how the agency plans to overcome prior year challenges to meet targets in FY 2021. The FY 2021 targe t is to conduct a Phase I clinical trial of an anti -opioid vaccine and a new medication to treat OUD . Based on its investments in focused medications development under the HEAL Initiative, NIDA expects that these trials will be conducted in FY 2021. (4) The agency should describe the procedures used to ensure performance data for this measure are accurate, complete, and unbiased in presentation and substance . The agency should also describe the methodology used to establish targets and actuals, as well as thedata source(s) used to collect information.

NIH uses these established tools for program development; for actively monitoring grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements; and for assessing perform ance of grants and contracts in order to oversee the program and improve performance. These tools have been described in response to question 4 above. Data Sources For SRO -4.9's FY 20 20 target , NIDA relied on annual progress reports provided by each grantee that outline d past -year project accomplishments, such as information on patients recruited, providers trained, patents filed, manuscripts published, and other supporting documentation. This information allow ed NIH to evaluate progress achieved and to make course corrections when needed. ATTACHMENT B Page 11 of 20FY 2020 Performance Summary Report for National Drug Control Activities 12 interventions at the individual-, school/college- , family -, community-, and policy-level in support of this effort. Many intervention strategies involve an educational component in which information about consequences of underage drinking is shared with participants, thereby contributing to the objective of \"Enhancing Research and the Development of Evidence- Based Prevention Programs\" in the 2020 Strategy . (2) Provide nar rative that examines the FY 2020 actual performance results with the FY 2020 target, as well as prior year actuals. If the performance target was not achieved forFY 20 20, the agency should explain why this is the case. If the agency has concluded it is not possible to achieve the est ablished target with available resources, the agency should include recommendations on revising or eliminating the target. The FY 2020 target was met. NIAAA-funded researchers developed and evaluated digital technology-based interventions to prevent or reduce alcohol misuse among underage college and high school students. Research indi cates that perceived norms about alcohol use are a strong correlate of alcohol misuse that predict alcohol consumption over time. Perceived norms among college students tend to be exaggerated relative to actual drinking norms and may have adverse effects on both individuals and the community. NIAAA- supported researchers recently created a text messaging intervention for heavy drinking, underage college students that was designed to realign perceived drinking norms with actual drinking norms of their campus peers. Heavy drinking in the study was defined as more than four drinks per day or more than 14 drinks per week for males, and more than three drinks per day or more than seven drinks per week for females in the past 30 days. Participants were assigned to either an experimental or control condition. The experimental group received text messages containing information about campus-specific drinking norms while the control group received text messages containing unique facts unrelated to alcohol. Text messages were sent daily to participants over a period of 10 weeks. The intervention was shown to be effective at reducing peak alcohol consumption and alcohol-related conseque nces three months after the beginning of the study. These intervention effects, however, were not maintained another three months later. This study demonstrates the feasibility of text- based norms interventions in reducing alcohol use and its consequences around the time of engagement with the intervention . In FY 2020, NIAAA a lso supported research to develop and test digital, school- based interventions aimed at preventing and reducing alcohol use among high school students. One ongoing study focuses on developing and test ing the efficacy of an e -learning intervention to improve school staff's knowledge, skills, and sel f-efficacy in supporting sexual minority youth and protecting them from bullying victimization. Prior research has demonstrated that sexual minority youth have an increased risk of future alcohol and other substance use and supportive school environments can help reduce substance use. Another school- bas ed study recently demonstrated that eCHECKUP TO GO is effective in reducing alcohol- related cognitive risk factors and alcohol use in both male and female high school seniors. eCHECKUP TO GO is a brief, we b-based personalized feedback intervention designed to reduce alcohol use by targeting cognitive risk factors (e.g., perceived drinking norms ATTACHMENT B Page 13 of 20FY 2020 Performance Summary Report for National Drug Control Activities 13 among peers) and protective behavioral strategies (e.g., behaviors that minimize the risk of alcohol- related consequences). In combination with the FY 2019 actual performance which demonstrated the efficacy of interventions designed to prevent alcohol misuse among college-age individuals, the digital interventions described above contribute to the Institute's goal of evaluating and promoting evidence -based intervention strategies to prevent substance misuse in underage populations.

Ultimately, the outcomes of any scientific research are judged based on published results in a peer- reviewed journal. The peer -review publication process is another point in which the quality and innovation of the science undergoes a rigorous evaluation. For most scientific journals, submitted manuscripts are assigned to a staff editor with knowledge of the field discussed in the manuscript.

Research papers that are selected for in -depth review are evaluated by at least two outside referees with knowledge in the relevant field. Methodology Used t o Establish Targets/Actuals The targets ha ve been established based on the existing protocols. As discussed above, these protocols undergo a rigorous review process to determine which research areas hold the most promise for filling gaps and should therefore be prioritized for testing. The target values are based on sound methodological procedures and related timelines set for each protocol. While these methodologies cannot precisely predict the course of a study, the likely path of implementation and timing is based on knowledge gained from earlier research and will be used to generate the targets for this measure. Data Sources Progress repor ts that outline project accomplishments allow NIH to evaluate progress achieved and/or to make course corrections as needed. Peer -reviewed publications are also used as indicators of performance.

NIAAA is also developing a resource that will contain information that every health professional should know about alcohol to help them better recognize its effects in their patients and deliver improved care for those whose drinking may be affecting their health. SRO -4.15 is focused on the evaluation of treatment interventions for alcohol misuse in underage populations. This measure contributes to the objective of \"Enhancing Evidence-B ased Addiction Treatment \" in the 2020 Strategy . The development of evidence- based in terventions for alcohol- related problems is a major priority for NIAAA, and the Institute's underage drinking portfolio includes research projects that are develop ing and testing behavioral and other therapies for interven ing with underage drinking. (2) Provide narrative that examines the FY 2020 actual performance results with the FY 2020 target, as well as prior year actuals. If the performance target was not achieved for FY 20 20, the agency should explain why this is the case. If the agency has c oncluded it is not possible to achieve the established target with available resources, the agency should include recommendations on revising or eliminating the target. The FY 2020 target was met. NIAAA- supported researchers evaluated a treatment invent ion in an underage, incarcerated population. Research suggests that combining evidence- based behavioral interventions - e.g., m otivational interviewing plus cognitive behavior therapy (MI/CB T) - that focus on motivation, problem-solving, communication, men tal health , and substance use may be useful in improving outcomes for incarcerated youth. In the current study, NIH-supported researchers conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of MI/CBT in mitigating alcohol and marijuana use and aggression among incarcerated youth. The control condition, RT/ SET, was a combined intervention consisting of relaxation training (a mindfulness approach) and treatment as usual ( substance-education and twelve s tep programming). Eligibility criteria included using alcohol or marijuana at least monthly; heavy drinking (defined as more than five standard drinks for boys, more than four standard drinks for girls) at least once; or alcohol or marijuana use in the four weeks before either the offense for which they were incarcerated, or before they were incarcerated. The researchers found RT/SET to be slightly more effective than MI/CBT in reducing percent of heavy drinking days and significantly more effective in reducing alcohol- related aggression after the youths' release from incarceration . RT/SET and MI/CBT both reduced aggression after release but neither showed significant effects on marijuana- related behavioral outcomes. These results suggest that RT/SET may be a viable, lower-cost intervention for delivery in youth correctional settings ; however, additional research on RT/SET is needed. Homeless youth have high rates of alcohol and other substance use which is associated with unsafe sexual behavior. In FY 2020, NI AAA supported an ongoing study that is conducting a large- scale evaluation of AWARE, a brief motivational interviewing -informed group risk reduction intervention focused on reducing alcohol and other substance use and sexual risk ATTACHMENT B Page 18 of 20FY 2020 Performance Summary Report for National Drug Control Activities 18 behaviors among homeless individuals aged 18-25. AWARE is being evaluated in settings where homeless youth often seek health- related and other services. NIAAA is ma king progress toward facilitating treatment for alcohol misuse in underage populations, from development and evaluation of screening and brief intervention tools (FY 2019 actual performance) to evaluation of treatment interventions that targe t alcohol and other substance use in vulnerable underage populations as described above.

If the target in FY 20 20 was not achieved, this explanation should detail how the agency plans to overcome prior year challenges to meet targets in FY 20 21. The FY 2021 target is to test another behavioral therapy for intervening with alcohol misuse in an underage population. Behavioral interventions have the potential to reduce alcohol misuse and the associated consequences among youth and adolescents. NIAAA anticipates meeting this target as the Institute currently supports multiple projects that involve evaluating behavioral therapies, such as motivational interviewing, motivational enhancement, and cognitive-behavioral therapy, in adolescent populations.

Measure 1 is the percent of clients in public substance abuse treatment programs who report no illegal drug use in the past month at discharge. The measure links directly to a key goal of the SAPTBG Program, which is to assist clients in achieving abstinence through effective substance abuse treatment. This measure reflects the program's emphasis on reducing demand for illicit drugs by targeting chronic users. Project Officers monitor targets and data on a regular basis, which serve as a focus of discussion with the states, and aids in the management of the program. 2. The targets for FY 2016 through FY 2019 were not met. The results are being monitored closely to provide necessary technical assistance to states and jurisdictions as the impact of national policy changes is better understood. In particular, behavioral health worker shortages and shorter lengths of stay by clients in substance abuse treatment programs may be contributing factors to the decreasing proportion of clients reporting no drug use in the past month at discharge. The findings will increase our awareness of the opioid epidemic and the corresponding lagging response in the use of medicated assisted treatment (MAT) in response to the rising opioid use disorder (OUD ) epidemic. 3. SAMHSA uses results from previous years as one factor in setting future targets. Changing economic conditions, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, as well as Medicaid expansion may impact substance abuse treatment programs throug hout the country. Fluctuations in outcomes and outputs are expected and SAMHSA continues to work with states to monitor progress and adapt to the needs of targeted groups. Technical assistance is provided as needed. 4. The data source for this measure is the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) as collected by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality. States are responsible for ensuring that each record contains the required key fields, that all fields contain valid codes, and that no duplicate records are submitted. States crosscheck data for consistency across data fields. The internal control program includes a rigorous quality control examination of the data as received from states. Data are examined to detect values that fall out of the exp ected range, based on the state's historical trends. If outlier values are detected, the state is contacted and asked to validate the value or correct the error.

Measure 2 for Decision Unit 2 reflects the primary goal of the 20% Prevention Set -Aside of the SAPTBG grant program and supports the first goal of the National Drug Control Strategy: reducing the prevalence of drug use among 12 -17 year ol ds. This measure represents the percentage of states that report improved rates for perceive d risk, aggregated fo r alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana. The measure of \"perceived risk of harm from substance use\" has been used to inform prevention policy and programming since the 1960s2, as it remains a significant predictor of substance use behaviors3. For example, \"Mo nitoring the Future,\" tracks the trends in perceived risk with substance use since the 1970s4. This depicts a consistent pattern of a leading indicator. In addition, a longitudinal study conducted in Iceland found that levels of perceived risk of harm meas ured at age 14 significantly predicted substanc e use behaviors at ages 15, 17, and 225. In brief, tracking and monitoring levels of \"perceived risk of harm\" remains important for informing prevention policy and programming as it can assist with understandi ng and predicting changes in the prevalence of substance use behaviors nationwide. 2. In FY 2014, 35.3% of states reported increased rates of moderate or great perceived risk of two or more substances. Although the actual did not meet the target in FY 2014, the perceived risk (actual) is higher than FY2012 or FY2013. Given that a break in trend occurred in the 2015 NSUDH data and estimates are generated from over a two-year period, CBHSQ has not been able to report data in recent years. Although data for FY 2018 suggests that targets for this measure are still not being met. 2Morgan, M., Hibell, B., Andersson, B., Bjarnasson, T., Kokkevi, A., & Narusk, A. (1999).

The general trend of lower numbers associated with perceived risk (not meeting targets) may be associated with recent contextual factors, such as marijuana lega lization and decriminalization. Future targets take into account this change in environment, wh ich may be associated with lower rates of perceived risk. The data trends for this measure are best understood by examini ng the measure definition. This measure is not the same as the average rate in those states. Rather, it is the percentage of states that improved from the previous year (using the composite p erceived risk rate). A state is categorized as improved if it increases its rate of perceived risk on at least two of the three substances targeted (alcohol, cigarettes, & marijuana). If a state' s rate of moderate or great perceived risk increased for only one of the substances, it is not coun ted as improved. For example, if a state's rate of perceived risk improved for ciga rettes and alcohol, it would be counted as improved. Alternatively, if only one or none of the perc eived risk rates increased, the state would not be counted as improved, even if all the rates were stable. Another consideration is that state estimates are based on two years of pooled data. There is a one-year overlap, which decre ases the ability to reflect annual change. Da ta for a particular fiscal year are reported in the following year. State estimates based on the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) results are reported annually during Dece mber. 4. Program changes during FY 2011 and FY 2012 resulted in a n eed to monitor the data so that future targets would align with expectations. This measure was i nitially dropped and then added back due to its important relationship to subsequent substance use. Du ring this lapse, no targets were calculated for future years. Rather than reduce targets to align with the lowest (possibly aberrant) performance report, SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Prevention closely monitored the data during FY 2011 - FY 2015. We anticipate fut ure targets will be met as they better align with the changing environment due to marijuana laws. Right now, it is too early to know how the changing marijuana laws will impact future t argets, so no changes are being proposed. 5. Data for levels of perceiv ed risk of harm from substance use are obtained annually from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). T he NSDUH survey is sponsored by SAMHSA and serves as the primary source of information on the prevalence and incidence of illicit drug, alcoh ol, and tobacco use among individuals age 12 or older in the United States6. For purposes of measuring SAPTBG performance, a state has improved if levels of perceived risk of harm increase for at least two of the following substances: binge drin king, regular cigarette use, and/or regular marijuana use. Annual performance results are derived by using the following formula: ATTACHMENT B Page 5 of 84 Decision Unit 3: Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) Programs of Regional and National Significance (PRNS) Measure 3 : Percent of adults receiving services who had no involvement with the criminal justice system (no past month arrests) Table 3: Measure 3 FY 2015 Target FY 2015 Actual FY 2016 Target Actual Target Actual Target Actual FY 2019 Target FY 2019 Actual 3 is the percent of clients served by the capacity portion of the PRNS portfolio8 who report no past month arrests. The programs are designed to help clients receive a comprehensive array of services, which promote improved quality of life. T his measure reflects success in increasing productivity and remaining free from criminal involvement. 2. This measure relates directly to and supports the national drug co ntrol strategy. The results are monitored routinely throughout the period of performance. 3. Programs included in this measure are HIV/AIDS Outreach, Pregnant Postpartum Women, Recovery Community Services Program, State Adolescent Treatment Enhancement and Dissemination (SAT -ED), Targeted Capacity Expansion (TCE), TCE/HIV, Targeted Capacity Expansion - Technology Assisted C are, and Crisis Support programs. 4. CSAT is able to ensure the accuracy and completeness of this measure as all d ata are submitted via the SAMHSA Performance Accountability and Reporting System (SPARS) , a web -based data entry and reporting system. The s ystem has automated bui lt-in checks designed to assure data quality. The SPARS online data entry system uses pre - programmed validation checks to make sure that data skip patterns on the paper collection tool are followed. These validation checks ensure th at data reported through the online reports are reliable, clean, and free from errors. These processes reduce burden for data processing tasks as sociated with analytic datasets since the data being entered have already followed pre -defined validation check s. ATTACHMENT B Page 6 of 85 Decision Unit 4: Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) Programs of Regional and National Significations (PRNS) Measure 4 : Percent of program participants that rate the risk of harm from substance abuse as great (all ages) Table 4: Measure 4 FY 2015 Target FY 2015 Actual FY 2016 Target Actual Target Actual Target Actual FY 2019 Target FY 2019 Actual Decision Unit 4 reflects the goals of CSAP's PRN S, as well as the National Drug Strategy. CSAP PRNS constitutes a number of discretionary grant programs, such as the Strategic Prevention Framework State Incentive Grants (SPF SIG), the Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI), the Sober Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking Act (STOP Act) grants prog ram, and others. For this decision unit, performance on levels of perceived risk was select ed to represent CSAP PRNS. The measure of \"perceived risk of harm from substance use\" has been used to inform prevention policy and programming since the 1960s9 as it remains a significant predictor of substance use behaviors . For example, \"Monitoring the Future,\" tracks the trends in perceived risk with substance use since the 1970s10. This depicts a consistent pattern of a leading indicator. In addition, a longitudinal study conducted in Iceland found that l evels of perceived risk of harm measured at age 14 significantly predicted substance use behaviors at ages 15, 17, and 22 .11 Because it can assist in understanding and predicting changes in the prevalence of substance use behaviors nationwide, tracking and monitoring levels of \"perceived risk of harm\" remains important. It informs prevention policy and programming. M easure 4 has been revised to be consistent with the program's current performance measurement ef forts. It combines all ages and reports only those respondents perceiving great risk of harm. In FY 2017, 84.7% of program participants rated the risk of substance abuse as great. This is slightly lower than the FY 2016 result of 89.4%. One possible explanation for the slight reduction in FY 2017 is the changing laws around marijuana use, which may be decreasing perceived risk. Previously, SAMHSA reported the percent of program participants (age 18 and up) who rate the risk of substance abuse as moderate or great, which measures increased levels of perceived moderate or great risk of harm from su bstance use. The percentage of MAI program participants perceiving moderate or great risk of harm from cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use increased (among those with matched baseline and exit data) by almost ten percentage points between FY 2010 and FY 2013. Because this finding remained so high over three years, SAMHSA changed the measure and now reports only perceived great risk. 9 Bjarnason, T. & Jonsson, S. (2005).

Information about any data problems or questions is transmitted to the Contracting Officer' s Representative, who works with the program Government Project Officers and grantees on a resolution. Grantees also receive instructions on the data collection protocols at gran tee meetings and through survey administration guides. Other performance results reflect the prop ortion of matched baseline -exit surveys that show an increase in levels of perceived risk -of-harm for those engaging in at least one of the following behaviors: binge drinking, regular cigarette use and regular marijuana use. Starting in FY 2018 this data has been collected and stored w ithin SPARS. T he new instrument captures cigarette use under a broader measure of tobacco use. Therefore, data reported in 2 018 and 2019 reflects those who report perceiving a great risk -of-harm in engaging in at least one of the following behaviors: binge drinking, reg ular tobacco use, or regular marijuana use. 3.The FY2018, FY2019 , and FY2020 numbers are lower than previous years. As mentioned above, the survey instruments were updated including a change from a measure of cigarettes to a more general question about tobacco use. In recent years, there have also been tremendous changes in the status of marijuana with states making this substance legal pot entially impacting the level of risk associated with its use.

To the best of my knowledge, the budget formulation, accounting, and performance assertions presented by CBP are accurate and complete. Sincerely, Jose M. Fabre Executive Director Office of Finance, Budget Directorate 3 METHODOLOGY CBP is a multi -mission agency and calculates obligations by budget decision unit and function, pursuant to an approved drug methodology. On the basis of past practice, five organizations within CBP (Office of Fi eld Operations [ OFO ], U.S. Border Patrol [USBP], Office of Training and Development [OTD], Office of Information and Technology [OIT], and Air and Marine Operations [AMO]) were provided with guidance on preparing estimates for the reporting of drug control funds. These offices were asked to estimate, on the basis of their operational expertise, the portion of their activities related to drug enforcement. The aforementioned organizations identified resources in their financial plans that support the drug enf orcement mission of the agency. OFO , USBP, OIT, OTD, and AMO attribute their resources to both intelligence and interdiction functions. Office of Field Operations OFO is the law enforcement component within CBP responsible for carrying out CBP's complex a nd demanding border security mission at all Ports of Entry (POE s). OFO manages the lawful access to our Nation and economy by securing and expediting international trade and travel. OFO operates 328 POEs and 16 Preclearance locations, 47 User Fee Facilitie s, and 19 Express Consignment Carrier Facilities. POEs welcome travelers and facilitate the flow of goods essential to our economy 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. OFO estimates that for FY 2022 there will be 3,316 CBP officer positions related to drug contr ol efforts on enforcement teams. These enforcement teams work closely with the Passenger Enforcement Rover Team and Passenger Analytical Unit teams to coordinate all enforcement activities. CBP estimates that 69 percent of the enforcement teams' time is devoted to drug enforcement. The smuggling methodologies and their indicators are similar for both narcotics and anti -terrorism activities. As of November 2018, OFO had 506 canine teams, whose primary mission is drug detection. U.S. Border Patrol USBP is re sponsible for almost 6,000 miles of land borders between POEs with Canada and Mexico and nearly 2,000 miles of coastal waters surrounding the Florida Peninsula and Puerto Rico. In the FY 2022 Budget, USBP requests funding to hire and sustain up to 20,555 B order Patrol agents (funded within Operations and Support (O&S) - Border Security operations - US Border Patrol), assigned to the mission of detecting and apprehending illegal entrants between the POEs. These illegal entrants include aliens and drug smuggl ers, potential terrorists, wanted criminals, and persons seeking to avoid inspection at the designated POEs due to their undocumented status. It has been determined that 15 percent of the total agent time nationwide is related to drug activities, which equ ates to 3,083 Border Patrol Agent FTE. Of the 15 percent related to drug interdiction, 3.5 percent of these efforts are related to intelligence and 96.5 percent to drug interdiction. These activities include staffing a total of 36 permanent border traffic checkpoints nationwide (35 permanent checkpoints on the Southern border, 1 permanent checkpoint on the Northern border) and 182 tactical immigration checkpoints 4 including 972 canine units trained in the detection of humans and certain illegal drugs that a re concealed within cargo containers, truck trailers, passenger vehicles, and boats. In addition, agents perform line watch functions in targeted border areas that are frequent entry points for the smuggling of drugs and people into the United States. In addition to staffing and canine units, the USBP manages several programs focused on the acquisition and deployment of technology and tactical infrastructure to secure the Southern and Northern borders of the United States. Some examples of technology progr ams include the Remote Video Surveillance System program, Integrated Fixed Towers program, and Tactical Communications Modernization program. The Tactical Infrastructure program is responsible for the deployment and maintenance of infrastructure, including roads, fencing, lighting, and gates along the borders of the United States. These technology and infrastructure programs increase situational awareness and assist law enforcement personnel in identifying and resolving illegal activity. CBP estimates that 15 percent of the funding for these programs - both Procurement, Construction, and Improvements (PC&I) and O&S funding - supports drug interdiction activities. CBP is the lead agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for the development, de ployment, operations, and maintenance of border technology, tactical infrastructure, and border wall systems to secure America's borders. USBP also applies its 15 percent ratio of counter narcotics activity to all border technology, tactical infrastructure , and border wall system funding. In FY 2022, CBP is requesting $2 billion in PC&I funding for the border wall construction. Office of Training Development OTD calculates the portion of its budget attributable to drug control funding by issuing an annual data call for all projected National Training Plan (NTP) funded training courses to assess if courses contain any items related to drug enforcement material and activities. The curriculum of each course is reviewed, and subject matter experts determine cou rse hours delivered related to drug enforcement activities under interdiction and intelligence efforts for this report. If specific courses offered through the NTP contain drug enforcement -related material, a specific percentage for that course is defined (hours related to drug enforcement training divided by the total number of course hours). Specific training programs identified include the canine training programs and basic, specialized, and advanced training for CBP officers, agents, and intelligence an alysts. OTD's day -to-day operational resources (to include pay and general operating budgets) are attributed to drug enforcement activities at the same rate as the percentage of NTP course delivery costs attributable to drug enforcement activities for both interdiction and intelligence efforts, which are projected at 22.3% for interdiction and 0.42% for intelligence during FY 2022. These percentages vary during the year of execution depending upon the actual course delivery funding obligation rates. Office of Information and Technology 5 OIT's budget supports the drug enforcement mission through the acquisition, support, and maintenance of technology and through mission -critical targeting application systems. OIT estimates that 10 percent each of Automated Targeting Systems (Passenger, Narcotics, and Anti -Terrorism) and (TECS) software applications, as well as 10 percent of data center operations costs are in support of the drug enforcement mission, aligned to both intelligence and interdiction functions. Air and Marine Operations AMO's core competencies are air and marine interdiction, air and marine law enforcement, and air domain security. In this capacity, AMO targets the conveyances that illegally transport narcotics, arms, and aliens across our borders and in the Source, Transit, and Arrival Zones. In FY 2019, AMO P -3 aircraft flew 5,946 hours in drug control efforts, which represent 82 percent of all AMO P -3 hours. These hours were in support of Joint Interagency Task Force -South (JIATF -S) in the Source and Transit zones. AMO P -3's participated in the interdiction of 239,381 pounds of cocaine in the Source and Transit zones. This equates to 41.3 pounds of cocaine for every counternarcotic hour flown. CBP continues to deploy surveillance technology tailor ed to the operational requirements along the highest trafficked areas of the southwest border. Since September 11, 2001, AMO has steadily increased its support to counter -terrorism by developing a more cohesive and integrated response to national security needs, as well as placing more emphasis on illegal immigration. AMO is dedicating significant assets and personnel in support of U.S./Mexico interdiction initiatives, and in support of USBP in targeted southwest border areas that are frequent entry points for the smuggling of drugs and people into the United States. Using flight hours spent performing drug -related activities, AMO has determined that 80 percent of the budget resources that support AMO are considered drug -related. Of the total flight hours flown by AMO, 21 percent were related to intelligence and 79 percent were related to interdiction in FY 2019. The source data for the financial information/flight hour information is retrieved from Air and Marine's official system of record, TOMIS. TOMIS has undergone a verification and validation by DHS and has been referenced in several GAO and OIG reviews, which provides reliable source data for the drug methodology described above. Also managed under AMO, the Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS) prog ram is a national surveillance asset operating along the Southwest Border and other key locations for nearly 25 years. TARS provides detection and monitoring of suspicious (smuggling) traffic over air, maritime, and land corridors. CBP took ownership of th e TARS program in FY 2014 as part of a transfer from the DoD. TARS consists of fixed site, aerostat -based radar systems that provide air surveillance across the entire U.S. -Mexico border (approximately 2,000 nautical miles). The systems are designed to det ect compliant low - altitude aircraft and non -compliant low -altitude aircraft attempting to smuggle narcotics or other contraband into the United States. 7 transportation (land, air, and sea). This measure assists in evaluating CBP's success in disrupting domestic drug trafficking at the land border POEs, a key outcome for the Strategy . This measure provides an indicator of success for CBP's Outbound Enforcement Program in disrupting domestic drug trafficking at the land borders by stemming the flow of potential narcotics -related proceeds destined to criminal or transnational groups. The measure \"Percentage of JIATF -S Annual Mission Hour O bjective Achieved\" identifies the degree to which AMO meets its intended flight hours for JIATF -S in support of the Strategy , which is reported to DHS, ONDCP, and JIATF -S. AMO conducts extended border operations as part of CBP's layered approach to homelan d security. AMO deploys assets in the source and transit zones through coordinated liaison with other U.S. agencies and international partners. The National Interdiction Command and Control Plan (NICCP) sets the overarching operational architecture for org anizations involved in interdicting illicit drugs in keeping with the goals and objectives of the Strategy . In the source and transit zones, AMO coordinates with the larger law enforcement and interdiction community through its partnership with JIATF -S. JIATF-S is the tasking coordinator and controller for counter - drug missions within the transit and source zones. JIATF -S submits its resource allocation requirements through the NICCP. DHS responds to the requirements in a Statement of Intent, which details a baseline level of effort in terms of assets and resources. AMO typically supports JIATF -S requests with P -3 Airborne Early Warning and P-3 Long -Range Tracker aircraft, but has also supported JIATF -S with other aircraft, including its DHC -8 and C -12M fix ed-wing aircraft, Black Hawk rotary -wing aircraft, and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). The measure \"Rate of interdiction effectiveness (IER) on the Southwest border between the POEs\" is the percent of detected illegal entrants who were apprehended or tur ned back after illegally entering the United States between the Southwest Border POEs. Border Patrol agents detect and intercept any combination of threats that present themselves along the borders including: terrorists, weapons of terrorism, smuggling of narcotics and other contraband, and people who illegally enter the United States. The interdiction of people frequently coincides with the interdiction of drugs in the border environment; therefore, the IER can be associated with effectiveness in resolving all cross - border entries, including those involving persons transporting narcotics. This measure assists in evaluating CBP's success in disrupting domestic drug trafficking between the land border POEs, a key outcome for the Strategy . The measure, \"Perc ent of time TECS is available to end users,\" quantifies the availability of the TECS service to all end-users based on a service level of 24/7/365 service. TECS is a CBP mission -critical law enforcement application system designed to identify individuals and businesses suspected of or involved in violation of Federal law. TECS is also a communications system permitting message transmittal between the DHS law enforcement offices and other National, state, and local LEAs, access to the FBI's National Crime Information Center and the International Justice and Public Safety Network (Nlets). - This system provides direct access to state motor vehicle departments. This measure 8 assists in evaluating CBP's success in improving information systems for Analysis, Assessment, and Local Management, a key outcome for the Strategy . U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION Detailed Accounting Submission of Fiscal Year 2020 Drug Control Funds DETAILED ACCOUNTING SUBMISSION A. Table of Fis cal Year (FY) 2020 Drug Control Obligations Drug Resources by Budget Decision Unit FY 2020 Final ($ In Millions) Operations and Support (O&S) $2,862.586 Procurement, Construction, and Improvements (PC&I) $374.768 Total Resources by Drug Control Unit $3,237.354 Drug Resources by Drug Control Function Intelligence United States Border Patrol $20.974 Office of Field Operations $298.185 Office of Information and Technology $10.024 Office of Training and Development $632 Air and Marine Operations $160.956 Intelligence - Total $490.771 Interdiction United States Border Patrol $833.691 Office of Field Operations $1,242.860 Office of Information and Technology $6.645 Office of Training and Development $39.753 Air and Marine Operations $623 .634 Interdiction - Total $2,746.583 Total Resources by Drug Control Function $3,237.354 Total Obligations $3,237.354 High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) $0 Note: Drug resources broken down by unit and function as reflected in the budg et structure enacted in the FY 2019 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Appropriations Act (P.L. 115 -141). 1. Drug Methodology U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is a multi -mission agency that calculates obligations by budget decision unit and drug control function, pursuant to an approved drug control funds calculation methodology. There are six program offices within CBP that are tasked with drug -control responsibilities: the United States Border Patrol (USBP), the Offices of Field Operations (OFO) , Information and Technology (OIT), Training and Development (OTD), Acquisition (OA), and Air and Marine (AMO). In conformity with the requirements of ONDCP Circular: Accounting of Drug Control Funding and Performance Summary , dated May 8, 2018, each progr am office has developed a drug methodology to estimate the percentage of its obligations related to drug enforcement. USBP, OFO, OIT, Page 2 and AMO attribute their resources to both intelligence and interdiction functions while OTD and OA attribute the ir resources solely to interdiction. The Drug Control Obligations table is based on actual obligations for each decision unit and program office named above for FY 2018. The obligation reports are generated by data reported in CBP's Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing (SAP) system, which is a DHS -approved accounting system. SAP is a fully integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that CBP uses to record and report obligations. Each program office multiplies its drug control ob ligation percentages by its actual total obligations per SAP to estimate obligations related to drug enforcement activities. The drug methodology developed and applied by each program office is described below: UNITED STATES BORDER PATROL (USBP) The USBP is responsible for controlling almost 6,000 miles of land borders between ports of entry with Canada and Mexico, and nearly 2,700 miles of coastal waters surrounding the Florida Peninsula and Puerto Rico. There were 19,740 Border Patrol agents, as of Sept ember 30, 2020, assigned to the mission of detecting and apprehending illegal entrants between the ports -of-entry. These illegal entries include aliens, drug smugglers, potential terrorists, wanted criminals, and persons seeking to avoid inspection at the designated ports of entry due to their undocumented status. It has been determined that 15 percent of USBP's activities are related to drug activities. This percentage was determined based on a historical study of the hours worked by agents, canine officer s, and core personnel at various border check -points with narcotic -intensive activities. USBP resources come from (1) the Border Security Operations program, project, and activity (PPA) within CBP's Operations and Support (O&S) appropriation, and Border Se curity Assets and Infrastructure PPA within CBP's Procurement, Construction, and Improvements (PC&I) appropriation. Of the 15 percent of obligations related to drug enforcement activities, USBP determined through the historical study referred to in the ab ove paragraph that 3.5 percent of agents' efforts are related to intelligence and 96.5 percent are related to drug interdiction. Also, historically, the 15 percent of obligations are related to drug interdiction only. These activities include staffing perm anent border traffic checkpoints nationwide, including 888 canine units trained in the detection of humans and certain illegal drugs that are concealed within cargo containers, truck trailers, passenger vehicles, and boats. In addition, agents perform line watch functions in targeted border areas that are frequent entry points for the smuggling of drugs and people into the United States. This data comes from a historical study performed by USBP, which provides reliable source data for the drug methodology described above. CBP is the lead agency within DHS for the development and deployment of border technology and tactical infrastructure to secure America's borders. Prior to FY 2017, CBP's Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology (BSFIT) app ropriation provided multi -year funding for the CBP program office, USBP, to develop and install technology and tactical infrastructure solutions, enabling a more effective and efficient method for controlling border security. While CBP still has multi -year funds available from previously enacted BSFIT appropriations, CBP transitioned to the DHS Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) beginning in FY 2017. Consequently, the BSFIT appropriation has been discontinued and counterdrug funding is now appropriated t hrough CBPS O&S and PC&I appropriations. All anticipated and actual obligations Page 3 for drug control activities are now being accounted for through USBP. Obligations for FY 2020 BSFIT carryover funds were captured using the standard calculation of 1 5 percent of BSFIT obligations. OFFICE OF FIELD OPERATIONS (OFO) OFO estimates there were 3,316 CBP officer (CBPO) full -time equivalents related to drug enforcement on enforcement teams in FY 2020. Anti -Terrorism Contraband Enforcement Teams (A-TCET) wor k closely with the Passenger Enforcement Rover Team (PERT) and Passenger Analytical Unit (PAU) teams to coordinate all enforcement activities. Although the primary mission of A -TCET teams is anti -terrorism, they also focus on all types of contraband, inclu ding narcotics. CBP estimates that 69 percent of the A -TCET is devoted to drug enforcement. The smuggling methodologies and their indicators are similar for both narcotics and anti -terrorism activities. Of the funding that is devoted to enforcement teams, OFO estimates that 85 percent is dedicated to interdiction with 15 percent dedicated to intelligence. OFO had 25,484 CBPOs in FY 2020, who, in addition to the interdiction of contraband and illegal drugs, enforce hundreds of laws and regulations on behalf of many other Federal Government agencies. The other Federal agencies include, for example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, and Bureau of Export Administration, among many others. CBP subject matte r experts estimate that approximately 30 percent of these officers' time is devoted to drug -related activities. Of the funding that is devoted to general officer duties, OFO estimates that 80 percent is dedicated to interdiction with 20 percent dedicated t o intelligence. CBP uses a variety of Non -Intrusive Inspection (NII) systems and Radiation Detection Equipment (RDE) systems as part of its layered inspection strategy to achieve its primary mission of securing the Nation's borders and protecting America from the entry of dangerous people and goods. These systems are also used to facilitate the flow of legitimate trade and travel across U.S. borders. It is estimated that 77 percent of the funding for NII is associated with general contraband detection, whi ch would include narcotics. Of the total funding that is devoted to NII, OFO estimates that 70 percent is dedicated to interdiction with 30 percent dedicated to intelligence. Multiple types of NII and RDE systems are used to thoroughly and quickly inspect sea containers, rail cars, trucks, automobiles, pallets, and various packages and parcels for the presence of contraband without damaging the conveyance or its contents. These systems keep CBP officials from resorting to more intrusive and time -consuming manual inspections, such as unloading, drilling and dismantling. The Administration has announced a National Health Emergency to combat the Opioid crisis. Seizures of illicit fentanyl have risen substantially in the last three years. Despite increased enforcement actions, there has been a dramatic and disturbing increase in overdose deaths attributable to illicit fentanyl and other synthetic drugs. In response to this rise, OFO has begun to procure, deploy, and train employees in an effort to improve the a gency's capability to detect and interdict fentanyl and other opioids. Those resources were accounted for in this analysis. CBP has a limited number of narcotic detection devices deployed to its largest POE along the Southwest Border. Page 4 CBP also u ses three types of canine teams: narcotics/human, drug, and currency. CBP has 506 canine officers in the field. Of the funding devoted to these canine teams, 100 percent of their time is devoted to drug interdiction. CBP has established and deployed a worl d-class detector dog program to augment existing technology while establishing cutting edge detection capabilities. CBPOs use specially trained detector dogs in interdiction and to support specialized programs aimed at combating the terrorist threat at the Nation's borders, international airports, and seaports. This data comes from the Cost Management Information System (CMIS) and an internal CBP Canine Tracking System (Canine TS), which provide reliable source data for the drug methodology described above . OFFICE OF INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY (OIT) OIT's budget supports the drug enforcement mission through the acquisition, support, and maintenance of technology, and mission critical targeting application systems. Of OIT's spending, it is estimated that 1 0 percent of Automated Targeting Systems software application costs; TECS; and data center operations costs are in support of the drug mission. Of OIT's funding, it is estimated 40 percent is spent on drug interdiction and 60 percent is devoted to intellig ence. The determinations surrounding the percentage of OIT spending that related to drug enforcement activities, specifically interdiction and intelligence, was determined through professional judgment, which provides reliable source data for the drug meth odology described above. OFFICE OF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT (OTD) OTD calculates the portion of their budget attributable to drug control funding by issuing an annual data call for all projected National Training Plan (NTP) funded training courses to ass ess if courses contain any items related to drug enforcement material and activities. The curriculum of each course is reviewed and subject matter experts determine course hours delivered related to drug enforcement for this task. If specific courses offer ed through the NTP contain drug enforcement related material, a specific percentage for that course is defined (hours related to drug enforcement training divided by the total number of course hours). Specific training programs identified include the canin e training programs and basic, specialized, and advanced training for CBP officers and agents. OTD's day -to-day operational resources are attributed to drug enforcement activities at the same rate as the NTP course delivery which is 18.25% for interdiction and 0.29% for intelligence for FY 2020.These percentages vary during the year of execution depending upon actual course delivery obligation rates. AIR & MARINE OPERATIONS AMO is a critical component of CBP's border security mission and the DHS risk -based and multi -layered approach to homeland security. AMO applies advanced capabilities and employs unique skill sets to protect the Nation's borders and preserve America's security interests. AMO is the lead operational component within CBP responsible for air and maritime border security. AMO's mission areas include air, maritime, and land law enforcement; domain awareness; extended border and foreign operations; and contingency and national security operations. In this capacity, AMO targets the conveyances that illegally transport narcotics, arms, Page 5 and aliens across our borders and in the Source, Transit, and Arrival Zones. In FY 2020, AMO P - 3 aircraft flew 5,786 hours in drug control efforts, which represent 79 percent of all AMO P -3 hours. Thes e hours were in support of Joint Interagency Task Force -South (JIATF -S) in the Source and Transit zones. AMO P -3's participated in the interdiction of 111,134 pounds of cocaine in the Source and Transit zones. This equates to 19.2 pounds of cocaine for eve ry counternarcotic hour flown. AMO partners with USBP on land border security to provide close tactical ground support. Through operations such as wide -area surveillance, investigations, patrols and tactical response in diverse environments, AMO is effect ively able to perform counter -narcotics, prevention of imported and exported illegal merchandise or contraband, and other anti -smuggling/trafficking missions. AMO also operates the Air and Marine Operations Center (AMOC). The AMOC is a key element in CBP' s counter -network strategy, responsible for assessing and countering terrorism, transnational organized crime, and other illegal activities. The AMOC advises, guides, and directs the operational employment of sensor technologies for DHS and CBP, managing t he air and maritime domain awareness architecture. It integrates multiple sensor technologies, intelligence, law enforcement databases, open source information, and an extensive communications network. It monitors the airspace of major security events, and houses and collaborates with the Office of Intelligence via its Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination cell that collects and analyzes multi -domain intelligence from a variety of sources, including CBP and USCG aircraft. Using flight hours spent per forming drug -related activities, AMO has determined that 80 percent of the budget resources that support AMO are considered drug -related. Of the total flight hours flown by AMO, 21 percent were related to intelligence and 79 percent were related to interdi ction in FY 2020. The source data for the financial information/flight hour information is retrieved from Air and Marine's official system of record, TOMIS. TOMIS has undergone a verification and validation by DHS and has been referenced in several GAO an d OIG reviews, which provides reliable source data for the drug methodology described above. 2. Methodology Modifications The drug control methodology for obligations used in FY 2020 remained the same as the methodology used in FY 2019 for the reported prog ram offices. 3. Material Weaknesses or Other Findings CBP contributed to the Departmental material weaknesses in Information Technology Controls and Financial Reporting. However, CBP's control deficiencies did not impair CBP's ability to report complete and accurate obligation data in the Table of FY 2020 Drug Control Obligations. While control deficiencies surrounding CBP's accounting system, SAP, was attributed to access controls, CBP had sufficient compensating controls to ensure accounting records were a ccurate. CBP also contributed to the Department's significant deficiencies in Custodial Activities - Entry Processing, Refunds and Drawbacks, and Seized and Forfeited Property. The deficiencies are not relevant Page 6 with respect to information contai ned in this report, as there is not information presented that is reliant upon Property, Plant, and Equipment and Custodial Activities. 4. Reprogrammings or Transfers During FY 2020, CBP had reprogrammings and transfers. In FY 2020, CBP determined one repro gramming request materially impacted CBP's drug -related obligations reported in the Table of FY 2020 Drug Control Obligations. The reprogramming in the amount of $19.19M, entitled, \"Technical Adjustment - Wireless Services Program Division,\" moved funding from the FY 2020 Operations & Support Appropriation, Mission Support, Enterprise Services PPA to the FY 2020 Operations & Support, Border Security Operations US Border Patrol Operations PPA, to transfer the Wireless Services Program Division from the Offic e of Information & Technology to USBP. There was no mission or policy impact as a result of this reprogramming. 5. Other Disclosures There are no other disclosures that CBP has determined are necessary to clarify any issues regarding the data reported under ONDCP Circular: Accounting of Drug Control Funding and Performance Summary , dated May 8, 2018. B. Assertions 1. Obligations by Budget Decision Unit Not Applicable - As a multi -mission agency, CBP is exempt from reporting under this section as noted in the ON DCP Circular: Accounting of Drug Control Funding and Performance Summary , Section 6(b)(1), dated May 8,2018. 2. Drug Methodology CBP asserts that the methodology used to estimate drug enforcement related obligations is reasonable and accurate. The criteria associated with this assertion are as follows: a. Data The estimate of drug enforcement related obligations is based on the methodology described in section A.1 above. This drug methodology, and the systems used to support this methodology, such as TOMIS, C MIS, and the AMOC Integrated Information Database, present a fair and accurate picture of the CBP drug enforcement mission. b. Financial Systems Security CBP's financial system, SAP, yields data that fairly presents, in all material respects, aggregate obligations from which drug -related obligation estimates are derived. As stated in the IT general and application control weaknesses noted in section A.3, CBP's financial systems issues related to SAP are based on access control and CBP has compensating contr ols to ensure CBP is capable of providing data that fairly represent, in all material respects, aggregate obligations. The drug methodology described in section A.1 above is used to estimate Page 7 what portion of these obligations may reasonably be co nsidered to be associated with drug enforcement related activities. 3. Application of Drug Methodology The methodology described in section A.1 above was used to generate the Table of FY 2020 Drug Control Obligations 4. Reprogrammings or Transfers The data p resented are associated with obligations against a financial plan that properly reflects all changes in drug -related budgetary resources that occurred during the fiscal year, including reprogrammings or transfers. 5. Fund Control Notices The Director of Nat ional Drug Control Policy did not issue a Fund Control Notice for CBP for FY 2020. 1 U.S. Department of Homeland Security U.S. Customs and Border Protection Performance Summary Report Fiscal Year 2020 This Performance Summary Report contains the performanc e measures aligned to drug control decision units as required by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Circular: Accounting of Drug Control Funding and Performance Summary , dated May 8, 2018. Office of Field Operations Performance Measure - Amount of smuggled outbound currency seized at the ports of entry (in millions). (1) Performance Measures The performance measure \"Amount of smuggled outbound currency seized at the ports of entry\" provides the total dollar amount of all currency, in million s, seized during outbound inspection of exiting passengers and vehicles, both privately -owned and commercial. The scope of this measure includes all ports of entry on both the southwest and northern borders and all modes of transportation (land, air, and s ea). This measure assists in evaluating CBP's success in disrupting domestic drug trafficking at the land border ports of entry, a key outcome for the National Drug Control Strategy . This measure is tracked by CBP's Office of Field Operations (OFO). This measure provides an indicator of success for CBP's Outbound Enforcement Program (OEP) in disrupting domestic drug trafficking at the land borders by stemming the flow of potential narcotics -related proceeds destined to criminal or transnational groups. The OFO conducts risk -based Outbound operations at land border ports of entry and international airports, enabling CBP to enforce U.S. laws and regulations applying to the Outbound arena, including but not limited to immigration and drug laws. The OEP is pa rt of CBP's effort to effectively monitor and control the flow of goods and people leaving the United States. The goal of OEP is to keep the United States safe by preventing the illicit export of goods, ranging from firearms to components of weapons of mas s destruction, by individuals seeking to circumvent U.S. export control laws. This goal was developed in recognition of the fact that such goods could potentially fall into the hands of terrorists or criminal elements. The program also seeks to disrupt cri minal elements and terrorist organizations by interdicting the proceeds of criminal activity and arresting members of their organizations. A number of presidential strategies, including the President's National Export Initiative, the President's Export Co ntrol Reform Initiative, the National Drug Control Strategy, and the National Southwest Border Counter Narcotics Strategy, designate outbound enforcement as a crucial component on the war on drugs. The total amount of illegal currency being smuggled out of the United States that was seized upon exit in FY 2020 was $66.6 million. This money was potentially destined for criminal organizations. 2 (2) Prior Years Performance Targets and Results Fiscal Year: FY 2016 of individual seizures was somewhat lower, dropping from 983 in FY19 to 913 in FY20, however the average dollar value per seizure increased significantly from $33,135 in FY19 to $72,916 in FY20 due to an unusually large single seizure of $32.4M. In addition to regular risk -based outbound enforcement efforts, CBP also conducts limited special operations set up in support of collaborative enforcement efforts with the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as well as with other law enforcement agencies though the Border Enforcement Security Task Force. (3) Current Year Performance Targets Fiscal Year: FY 2021 Target: $30.0M CBP will continu e to conduct risk -based Outbound enforcement operations to identify and seize currency being transported out of the country illegally and work with these law enforcement agencies and both local and international partners to identify and disrupt outbound sm uggling activities. Currently, CBP conducts limited risk -based Outbound enforcement operations based on the availability of CBP Officers and funding, examining only departing goods and travelers identified as high -risk based on CBP Officer assessment at t he ports and/or automated system alerts triggered by available data. On -going CBP efforts at risk -based outbound enforcement and conducting limited special operations will continue in FY 2021, though availability of Officers may be impacted by assignments to POEs with major migrant activity or to coronavirus prevention or mitigation activity. The observed decrease in the total number of individual seizures during FY 2020 is not a significant indicator of any unusual fluctuation in seizure activity. CBP will retain the target of $30.0M for FY 2021. CBP will consider revising the target in FY 2022 if the FY 2021 results more clearly establish a long -term trend. (4) Quality of Performance Data The data underlying this measure is accurate, complete and unbiased. T his measure is calculated from outbound seizure -related enforcement action data entered into TECS, a computer -based tool used to support CBP operations, by the CBP Officer at the time the violation occurred. On a monthly basis, the detailed transaction dat a for each Field Office is compiled and extracted from TECS into BorderStat, the CBP system of record for capturing and reporting all enforcement and operations statistical data across its operational components. The extracted data is then summarized withi n the Operations Management Report module in BorderStat. The monthly 3 summary data is reviewed by OFO's Outbound Program Manager to verify accuracy and identify anomalies. 4 Air and Marine Operations Performance Measure - Percentage of Joint Interagency Ta sk Force -South (JIATF -S) annual mission hour objective achieved.1 (1) Performance Measures This performance metric is specific to CBP's Air and Marine Operations (AMO). AMO conducts extended border operations as part of CBP's layered approach to homeland sec urity. AMO deploys assets in the source and transit zones through coordinated liaison with other U.S. agencies and international partners. The National Interdiction Command and Control Plan (NICCP) sets the overarching operational architecture for organiza tions involved in interdicting illicit drugs in keeping with the goals and objectives of the National Drug Control Strategy. In the source and transit zones, AMO coordinates with the larger law enforcement and interdiction community through its partnership with JIATF -S. JIATF -S is the tasking coordinator and controller for counter -drug missions within the transit2 and source3 zones. JIATF -S submits its resource allocation requirements through the NICCP. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) responds to the requirements in a Statement of Intent, which details a baseline level of effort in terms of assets and resources. AMO typically supports JIATF -S requests with P -3 Airborne Early Warning and P -3 Long -Range Tracker aircraft, but has also supported JIATF -S with other aircraft, including its DHC -8 and C -12M fixed -wing aircraft, Black Hawk rotary -wing aircraft, and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). As a result of the 2003 Presidential Determination Regarding U.S. Assistance to the Government of Colombia Airb ridge Denial Program, AMO began receiving funding in FY 2005 to support JIATF -S as part of its base budget. The performance measure \"Percentage of JIATF -S Annual Mission Hour Objective Achieved\" identifies the degree to which AMO meets its intended flight hours for JIATF -S in support of the National Drug Control Strategy, which is reported to DHS, ONDCP, and JIATF -S. (2) Prior Years Performance Targets and Results The Percentage of JIATF -S Annual Mission Hour Objective Achieved was initially introduced as a measure in FY 2011. Fiscal Year: FY results are presented on a binary basis, where 0 percent represents that the ta rget was not met and 100 percent represents that the target was either met or exceeded. 2 The transit zone encompasses Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern Pacific Ocean. 3 The source zone includes the principal d rug producing countries of Bolivia, Columbia, and Peru. 5 In its annual Statement of Intent, DHS responds to the requirements in the NICCP. The FY 2020 DHS Statement of Intent included CBP's objective to provide 5,500 flight hours for detection and monitori ng activities with aircraft in support of JIATF -S operations. By the end of FY 2020, AMO flew a total of 6,245 hours in direct coordination with JIATF -S, of which 5,787 were flown by the P3 and 458 were flown by UAS. AMO met the augmented JIATF -S goal of 5 ,500 hours. (3) Current Year Performance Targets Fiscal Year: FY 2021 Target: Provide 100 percent of the 5,500 hours of JIATF -S support budgeted for the transit zone. AMO submitted its input for the FY 2021 DHS Statement of Intent to the DHS Office of Policy. This input was based on current anticipated budgets, flight crew availability, and planning estimates involving maritime patrol aircraft flight hours in the transit zone. The FY 2021 DHS Statement of Intent included CBP's objective to provide 5,500 fligh t hours in the transit zone with its P -3 and UAS. (4) Quality of Performance Data The data underlying this measure is accurate, complete and unbiased. AMO flight data is recorded using the Tasking, Operations, and Management Information System, which underwe nt a DHS verification and validation during FY 2016. The data from this system can be queried through any CBP computer with appropriate access. AMO ensures the data is complete and accurate through a quality assurance process, which includes annual reconci liation of data, and data entry error mitigation techniques established from the verification and validation assessment. 6 Office of Information and Technology Performance Measure - Percent of time TECS is available to end users. (1) Performance Measures This performance metric is for Automation Modernization, part of the Air and Marine Interdiction, Operations, Maintenance, and Procurement budget decision unit. The metric is managed and measured by CBP's Office of Information Technology (OIT). The measure, \"Percent of time TECS is available to end users,\" quantifies the availability of the TECS service to all end -users based on a service level of 24/7 service. TECS is a CBP mission -critical law enforcement application system designed to identify individuals a nd businesses suspected of or involved in violation of Federal law. TECS is also a communications system permitting message transmittal between the DHS law enforcement offices and other National, state, and local law enforcement agencies, access to the Fed eral Bureau of Investigation's National Crime Information Center and the National Law Enforcement Telecommunication Systems (NLETS). NLETS provides direct access to state motor vehicle departments. This measure assists in evaluating CBP's success in improv ing information systems for Analysis, Assessment, and Local Management, a key outcome for the National Drug Control Strategy. TECS availability is a collection of key performance indicators (KPI) gathered from off-the-shelf and custom monitoring tools. Th e tools monitor all components and sub -systems of three mission critical applications: Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, Traveler Primary Air Client, and U.S. Pedestrian. Synthetic transactions are performed on all three applications to simulate a use r. The results of these transactions are measured against defined performance standards. Breaches of the performance standards are transmitted as alerts to the Technology Operations Center and the application development team for review and resolution. TECS is deemed unavailable when all three applications are in a critical or unresponsive state simultaneously. Outages for systems maintenance are considered down time and affect TECS availability. (2) Prior Years Performance Targets and Results Fiscal Year: FY 2016 goal this year with an availability of 99.8 percent. 7 (3) Current Year Performance Targets Fiscal Year: FY 2021 Target: 99.0% The target is established based on the KPIs for the three applications that comprise the TECS Availability metric. Current trends and funding expectations point to a likelihood of achieving the FY 2021 target of 99.0 percent with no anticipated cha llenges to TECS system availability. This target is established via a negotiated contract with the TECS service provider. (4) Quality of Performance Data The data is accurate, complete, and unbiased. All data logged is reviewed for accuracy and comments are added by Computer Operations staff for the purpose of identifying discrepancies. Each business day, OIT Subject Matter Experts meet at the Significant Outages and Incidents meeting to review the Chief Information Officer Outage Report which is generated fo r the OIT Assistant Commissioner and other senior CBP management staff. The Subject Matter Experts review incidents and validate the information reported. The OIT Assistant Commissioner and senior CBP management review the report. 8 U.S. Border Patrol Performance Measure - Rate of Interdiction Effectiveness along the Southwest Border between the ports of entry. (1) Performance Measures Since FY 2014, the United States Border Patrol (USBP) has focused on and measured improvement in its Interdiction Effectivene ss Rate (IER) on the Southwest Border. The IER is the percent of detected illegal entrants who were apprehended under U.S.C. Title 8 (immigration law), encountered under U.S.C. Title 42 (expelled in the interest of public health), or turned back after ille gally entering the U.S. between the Southwest Border ports of entry. The IER focuses on positive outcomes (apprehensions/encounters or turnbacks) of recent entrants made in the immediate border area. This measure assists in evaluating CBP's success in disr upting domestic drug trafficking between the land border ports of entry, a key outcome for the National Drug Control Strategy. Border Patrol agents (BPAs) detect and intercept any combination of threats that present themselves along the borders including: terrorists, weapons of terrorism, smuggling of narcotics and other contraband, and people who illegally enter the United States. The interdiction of people frequently coincides with the interdiction of drugs in the border environment; therefore, the IER c an be associated with effectiveness in resolving all cross -border entries, including those involving persons transporting narcotics. Annual results have fluctuated since introducing this measure in FY 2014. The percentage increased for the first three year s, from 76 to 82.7 before falling short of the target at 78.9 in FY 2017. The FY 2018 result increased to 79.7 percent, still short of the target of 81 percent. In FY 2019, the result rose sharply to 86.3 percent as mass illegal migration activities pushed non-Mexican family units and unaccompanied children across the Southwest Border in large groups, which typically made little or no effort to evade detection or apprehension. U.S. Border Patrol interdicted 79.4 percent of known illegal entries on the South west Border in FY 2020, with entries declining by 40.7 percent when compared to the mass migration surge of FY 2019. Some of that decline can be attributed to a steep decline in quarters two and three as the COVID -19 pandemic evolved into a global -scale event. The enforcement advantage gained from fencing, other infrastructure, and technology, such as sensors and cameras, allows agents to more effectively and efficiently detect, identify, and intercept threats. CBP's enforcement posture over the past sever al years since 9/11 has benefitted from a build -up in resources and capabilities, including manpower. This improved enforcement posture has coincided with an overall decrease in apprehensions since FY 2005, the year when data integrity improved due to new mandatory reporting requirements, and an improvement in the IER since it was tracked in FY 2013. During FY 2020, the USBP seized 257,173 pounds of marijuana along the Southwest Border, a decrease of 937,254 pounds when compared to the FY 2005 total. As th e COVID -19 pandemic manifested in FY 2020, the Administration's efforts and Title 42 - related guidance to limit public -health risk resulted in changes to U.S. Border Patrol tactics and procedures. Those procedures included initial screening, biometric coll ection, and vetting to 9 determine whether the event supported apprehension under Title 8 of the U.S. Code (immigration law) or expulsion after the encounter from the United States under Title 42. Because of that, the data collected and included in the comp utation for the \"Rate of interdiction effectiveness along the Southwest Border between ports of entry\" now includes Title 8 Apprehensions, Title 42 Encounters, Turn -backs (TB), No Arrest (NA), and Got -Aways (GA), which together constitute entries. The scop e includes all areas of the Southwest Border that are generally at or below the northern most checkpoint within a given area of responsibility, but excludes aliens who have been apprehended or encountered more than 30 days after entering illegally. Terms - Apprehension: a deportable subject who, after making an illegal entry, is taken into custody and receives a consequence. Title 42 Encounter: An alien subject to the CDC Title 42 order who is encountered and processed under the CDC's order. No Arrest: A s ubject who is the result of a USBP non -border -zone tracking action that does not result in an Apprehension or Encounter but is determined by agents to involve illicit cross -border activity. Got -Away: a subject who, after making an illegal entry, is not tur ned back or apprehended and is no longer being actively pursued by BPAs. Turnbacks: a subject who, after making an illegal entry into the United States, returns to the country from which he/she entered, not resulting in an apprehension or gotaway. (2) Prior Y ears Performance Targets and Results Fiscal Year: FY 2016 initially introduced as a DHS strategic measure in FY 2014. The baseline data collection during FY 2013 coincided with an effort on part of the USBP to standardize the methods across Southwest Border sectors to record apprehensions, GA's, and TB's, the three key factors (until FY 2020) in the formula for calcul ating the IER. In FY 2020, Encounters under Title 42 entered the equation, as did No Arrests (to allow clarity in USBP data that does not alter the IER result). This measure reports the percent of detected aliens the Border Patrol apprehended under Title 8, encountered under Title 42, or turned back after illegally entering the United States between the ports of entry on the Southwest Border. Despite continued staffing shortages, agents work at stations along the Southwest Border to increase Operational Co ntrol by performing mission - essential tasks to impede and deny illegal entrants; gain situational awareness of the operating environment; and apply timely law enforcement resolutions against those making entries illegally. With the COVID -19 pandemic reach ing global proportions in late March 2020, and illegal entry events decreasing greatly for a few months, the USBP Interdiction Effectiveness Rate finished FY 2020 at 79.4 percent, with Title 42 actions constituting 30.2 percent of all USBP response efforts for the fiscal year. 10 (3) Current Year Performance Targets Fiscal Year: FY 2021 Target: 81.0% The USBP is working closely with CBP's Office of Human Resources Management to enhance recruiting efforts and assist in streamlining hiring of new agents. In addit ion, the implementation of USBP's Operational Control framework will allow leadership to ensure that Southwest Border commanders focus annual operational planning on efforts that support the framework with the intent of increasing Operational Control of th e border, including interdiction effectiveness. (4) Quality of Performance Data Apprehension, Title 42 Encounter, TB, NA, and GA data is captured by Border Patrol agents (BPAs) at the station level and entered into the following systems: Apprehensions and Ti tle 42 Encounters are entered into the e3 Processing (e3) system. All data entered via e3 resides in the Enforcement Integrated Database (EID), the official system of record, which is under the purview of USBP Headquarters' Statistics and Data Integrity (S DI) Unit. The physical database is owned and maintained by ICE. GA's, NA's, and TB's are entered into the Intelligent Computer Assisted Detection (ICAD) Tracking Sign -cutting and Modeling (TSM) application, which resides with the U.S. Border Patrol. TSM is under the purview of and is owned by USBP's SDI. Apprehension and Title 42 Encounter data is entered into TSM, and eventually e3 as warranted, by BPA's at the station level as part of the standardized processing procedure. Agents use standard definitions for determining when to report a subject as a GA or TB. Some subjects can be observed directly as evading apprehension or turning back; others are acknowledged as a GA or TB after BPA's follow evidence that indicate entries have occurred, such as foot sig n, sensor activations, interviews with apprehended subjects, camera views, communication between and among stations and sectors, and other information. Entry event -level data is entered continuously into TSM at the station level, and data integrity monitor s (agents) are assigned to assure that any data irregularities are corrected (inaccurate geospatial input or adjudication of one event linking to another like a subject who got away in one event who was apprehended soon after in another event). Calculation of the measure is done by SDI and is: (Title 8 Apprehensions + Title 42 Encounters + TB)/Total Entries. Total entries is the sum of Apprehensions, Title 42 Encounters, TB's, GA's, and NA's. Patrol Agents in Charge ensure all agents are aware of and use p roper definitions for apprehensions, GA, and, NA, TB at their respective stations and ensure accurate documentation of subjects. In addition to the station -level data -integrity efforts, SDI validates data integrity through various data -quality reports. Dat a issues are corrected at the headquarters level or forwarded to the original inputting station for correction. All statistical information requested is routed through the USBP Headquarters SDI Unit to ensure accurate data analysis and output.

Due to the intricate na these oper ations, CBP is unable to demarcat e the a mount applied toward counterdrug operations ; however, th ey estimate no more than 15 percent of OPSG funding and activity supports counter drug activities. As OPSG i s not specifically a drug enforcement grant program there is no statutory or programmatic requirement under OPSG to specifically delineate drug interdiction activities or expenditures. OPSG grant funds are primarily used for personnel costs, which are not reported by activity therefore the exact specific amount expended for drug enforcement cannot be determined. The intent of OPSG is to enhance cooperation and coordination among Federal, state, and local LEAs in a joint mission to secure the U.S. borders along routes of ingress from international borders, to include travel corridors in states bordering Mex ico and Canada, as well as in states and territories w ith international water borders. Recipients of OPSG funds are local units of government at the county level and federally recognized tribal governments. Recipients are in the states bordering Canada (including Alaska), southern states bordering Mexico, and states and territories with international water borders. OPSG funds are used for operational overtime, equipment, mileage, fuel, and vehicle maintenance and for operational activities that will enhance border security and are coordinated directly with the CBP. Funds are allocated competitively to designated localities within U.S. Border States based on risk analysis and the anticipated feasibility and effectiveness of proposed investments by the applicants. 5 A FEMA does not specifically request the funding for Operation Stonegarden, the funds are historically appropriated by Congress. The amount is notational and subject to change upon enacted legislation.

Sincerely, Sheronda DeRohn, CGFM Budget Officer Chief Financial Officer Directorate Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 20 21 Summer Budget and Performance Summary 3 Discussion FLETC supports the Strategy by providing drug investigations training for law enforcement agents and officers. The officers and agents who receive FLETC training in drug investigation activities are employed primarily by Federal agencies with a law enforcement role. These Federal agencies, which have formalized their relationship with FLETC as their trainer of choice through memoranda of understanding, are substantively involved in the strategic direction of FLETC and are referred to as Participating Organizations. FLETC measures its success by assessing the satisfaction of its Participating Organizations with the requested training that FLETC provided. In FY 2019, FLETC trained 67,810 students, equating to 174,081 student- weeks of training. The curriculum for about 20 percent of these students includes training in drug investigation activities. In FY 2012, FLETC established a metric to more accurately ref lect the satisfaction of Participating Organizations with the counterdrug -related training provided by FLETC to the ir officers and agents. In order to establish this performance goal (against which to set a baseline), FLETC examined its actual and targeted historical training -related performance measures. Additionally, discussions were held with a sampling of Partici pating Organizations to gauge their satisfaction with FLETC 's drug control -related training to date. For FY 2019 the target was set to 90 percent. Results of the 2019 Participating Organization Satisfaction Survey that FLETC conducted indicate that 94 pe rcent of Participating Organizations are satisfied with FLETC counterdrug- related training. Program Summary MISSION The Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) is an interagency law enforcement training institution that serves a leadership role as the Federal Government's principal provider of world -class, interagency law enforcement training to more than 95 Federal Participating Organizations, as well as training and technical assistance to state, local, tribal, territorial and international law enforcement entities. The FLETC provides premium training programs in support of drug enforcement activities, primarily in advanced programs that teach and reinforce law enforcement skills of investigation. FLETC supports the National Drug Control Strategy by providing drug investigations training for law enforcement agents and officers. METHODOLOGY The portion of FLETC's total budget considered to be drug resources is identified by historical trends of drug- related training relative to total student- weeks of training and the associated budget authority required to conduct that training. Advanced training programs with a drug nexus are considered to provide 100% support to drug enforcement activities. State and local training programs with a drug nexus are also considered to provide 100% support. All international training has a drug nexus and is also considered to provide 100% support. FLETC drug enforcement training support is in the following three training functions: Investigations, 96%; State and Local Training and Assistance, 3%; and, International Training and Technical Assistance, 1%. The percentage of th e Salaries and Expenses appropriation that supports drug enforcement activities remains constant at 20.4%; however, the percentage of FLETC's total budget authority in support of drug enforcement activities fluctuates. BUDGET SUMMARY The FY20 20 total drug resources were $ 47.0 75 million, which is 13.4% of FLETC's total budget. FLETC asserts that the methodology described above is the methodology utilized to prepare the Prior Year Drug Control Obligations Table. FLETC has no methodology modifications, material weaknesses, reprogrammings or other disclosures. 1. Performance reporting systems are appropriate and applied The FLETC POs are surveyed using the PO Satisfaction Survey. The survey was developed using contemporary survey methods comparable to those used by the military services and other major training organizations. Data is collected from mid- May through June. The measure uses an average of survey Statements 1 and 2. Statement 1 begins \"The FLETC's basic\" and Statement 2 begins \"FLETC's advanced.\" Each statement ends with \"training programs and courses of instruction address the right skills needed for my office rs/agents to perform their law enforcement duties.\" The survey uses a modified six -point Likert scale. Program personnel import the survey data as saved by survey respondents from Vovici into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences to generate descriptive statistics and then into Excel to generate data charts and tables. The percent is calculated as the average of the number of POs that responded \"Strongly Agree\" or \"Agree\" to Statements 1 and 2 divided by the number of POs that responded to each of the respective statements. POs that responded \"Not Applicable\" to either Statement were excluded from the calculations. Following release of the survey summary report, FLETC leaders conduct verbal sessions with Participating Organization key representatives to confirm and discuss their responses. Throughout the year other formal and informal inputs are solicited from the Participating Organization representatives by FLETC staff and used to validate the survey results. No known integrity problems exist. 2. Explanations for not meeting performance targets are reasonable FLETC exceeded both performance targets. 3. Methodology to establish performance targets is reasonable and applied The FLETC's ONDCP performance measure was developed and submitted for approval during FY 2012. In order to establish a performance goal (against which to set a baseline), the FLETC examined its actual and targeted historical performance for previously established training related measures. Additionally, informal discussions were held with a sampling of Participating Organizations to gauge their satisfaction with FLETC's drug control related training to date. When considered as a whole, these factors indicated that 81% was a realistic target to establish the baseline. As this performance measure matures, the target goals are evaluated and adjusted as necessary. 4. Adequate performance measures exist for all significant drug control activities FLETC has one acceptable ONDCP specific performance measure.

This mission is executed through the enforcement of hundreds of federal statutes a nd focuses on smart immigration enforcement, preventing terrorism and combating the illegal movement of people and goods. The Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) directorate is responsible for investigating a wide range of domestic and international activities arising from the illegal movement of people and goods into, w ithin and out of the United States. ICE-HSI supports U.S. drug control pol icy, specifically Office of National Drug Control Policy initiatives, such as 'Disrupt domestic drug trafficking and production' and 'Strengthen Law -Enforcement and International Pa rtnerships to Reduce the Availability of Foreign -Produced Drugs in the United States', and by supporting the overall ICE mandate to detect, disrupt, and dismantle smuggling organizations. The desired outcomes for the execution of DHS' action items are disruption of domestic drug traffic king and production; strengthening of international partnerships ; and reduction in the availability of foreign -produced drugs in the United States. Increased hours incurred on drug -related cases directly lead to increased detection, disruption and dismantlement of drug smuggling organizatio ns. METHODOLOGY ICE's approved drug methodology is based on investigative case hours recorded in the ICE Investigative Case Management System (ICM). ICE agents record the hours they wo rk, categorized by the type of investigation in ICM . Following the close of the fiscal year, a report is produced that aggregates investigative case hours with a general drug case coding and a money laundering drug case coding . A second report is produce d, showing all investigative case hours logged. Counternarcotics activity percentages are determined separately for each ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) program responsible for counter narcotics enforcement. The percentages for Domestic Invest igations, International Investigations, and Intelligence programs are determined by dividing the number of investigative case hours linked to drug control activities by the total number of investigative case hours logged by each program. In FY 2019, 31.11 percent of case hours were drug -related for HSI Domestic Investi gations, 10.36 percent for HSI International Investigations, and 46.70 percent for Intelligence. The ICE drug budget is projected by applying these ratios to the annual appropriations reques t for each ICE program executing counternarcotics activities. HSI utilizes the Significant Case Report (SCR) process to report on its impact on the mission. SCRs encompass the diverse categories investigated by HSI Special Agents, including illicit trade , travel, and finance (non -drug -related); illicit trade, travel, and finance national security; worksite enforcement; gangs; and child exploitation. SCRs demonstrate how HSI investigations have disrupted and disma ntled significant investigations of transnational criminal organiza tions. The primary measure that is derived from the SCR process for counternarcotics is the \" Percentage of significant drug related, illicit trade, travel and finance investigations that r esult in a disruption or dismantlement of a criminal organization .\" This measure is an aggregate of the number of disruptions or dismantlements, over the number NATIONAL DRUG CONTR OL STRATEGY: FY 20 22 Summer Budget and Performance Summary 3 of approved significant drug related illicit trade, travel, and finance transnational criminal investigations. Drug -related illicit trade, travel, and financ e investigations include the earning, laundering, moving, or preventing the movement of more than $10 million annually in drug proceed s; investigations of Consolidated Priority Organization T argets; or investigations of Regional Priority Organization subje cts. BUDGET SUMMARY In FY 2022, ICE requests million for drug control activities, an the FY 2021 President's Budget. Operations and Support The Operations and Support account contributes to the ICE mission of bringing a unified and coordinated focus to the enforcement of Federal immigration and custo ms laws. Salaries and Expenses resources are used to address terrorism and illegal immigration through the investigation, detention, and prosecution of criminal and non-criminal aliens, domestic gangs, transnational criminal organizations, and disruption of criminal trade and money laundering associated with illicit drugs. ICE investigative activities protect the infrastructure and persons within the United States by applying a wide range of legal authorities that support the goals and objectives of the Strategy to disrupt, dismantle, and destroy the pathways used by transnational criminal organizations to transport drugs and the proceeds of drug trafficking across our borders. Intelligence HSI Intelligence collects, analyzes, and shares criminal analysis with law enforcement partners to support efforts to disrupt the flow of illicit drugs. HSI Intelligence collects and analyzes information and data from multiple -sources, d evelops the information to enable investigative and enforcement actions and inform decision makers, and disseminates criminal analysis to th e appropriate fusion partners to coordinate and de -conflict intelligence and investigative actions. Investigations ICE Inves tigative activities protect the infrastructure and persons within the United States by applying a wide range of legal authorities that support the Strategy's goals and objectives to disrupt, dismantle, and destroy the pathways used by transnationa l criminal organizations to transport drugs and the proceeds of drug trafficking across our borders. 6 NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 2022 Summ er Budget and Performance Summary ICE supports the Strategy by attacking the vulnerabilities of drug traff icking organizations and disrupting key business sectors to weaken the economic basis and benefits of illicit drug trafficking. Much of the illegal drug market in the U.S. is supplied with illicit narcotics grown or manufactured in foreign countries and s muggled across our Nation's borders. ICE agents enforce a wide range of criminal statutes, including Title 18 and Title 19 of the U.S. Code to investigate transnational crimes. These statutes address general smuggling issues as well as customs viol ations . ICE also enforces Title 21, which covers the importation, distribut ion, manufacture, and possession of illegal n arcotics. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 authorizes the deployment of DHS officers to diplomatic posts to perform visa security activit ies and provide advice and training to Department of State (DOS) cons ular officers. This critical mission is accomplished through ICE HSI's Visa Security Program (VSP). VSP operations are presently functioning at 38 diplomatic posts in 28 countrie s. Through VSP, ICE HSI utilizes depl oyed special agents and the Pre -Adjudicated Threat Recognition Intelligence Operations Team ( PATRIOT) to investigate suspect travelers during the visa application process. VSP PATRIOT, administered by HSI International Opera tions in collaboration wit h Customs and Border Protection (CBP), conducts centralized screening and vetting in the National Capital Region (NCR) in support of VSP operations. At post, deployed special agents utilize available investigat ive resourc es - to include but not limited to PATRIOT analysis, interviews at post, and liaison with host and domestic partners - to identify, exploit and disrupt the travel of suspect applicants. Investigative findings , including those linked to illicit drug activity , by the HSI special agents are then shared for utilization by both HSI and its law enforcement and intelligence community partners. These efforts allow the VSP to operate as a counterterrorism tool that disrupts and investigates the travel of illicit actors m itigating threats posed by transnati onal terrorist and criminal networks. On September 27, 2011, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) HSI officially established the Transnational Criminal Investigative Unit ( TCIU ) Program. HSI TCIUs ar e compris ed of foreign law enforcement offic ials, customs officers, immigration officers, and prosecutors who undergo a strict vetting process to ensure that shared information and operational activities are not compromised. ICE HSI TCIUs facilitate in formatio n exchange and rapid bilateral inves tigation of weapons trafficking and counter -proliferation, money laundering and bulk cash smuggling , human smuggling and trafficking, narcotics trafficking, intelle ctual property rights violations, customs fraud, child e xploitation, cyber- crime, and many of the other 400 violations of law within ICE HSI's investigative purview. There are over 400 foreign law enforcement officers that comprise the eleven TCIU countries and two International Taskforce units in 13 c ountries . ICE HSI in collaboration with Cu stoms and Border Protection (CBP) and the U.S. Department of Defense, developed and manages the Biometric Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program (BITMAP). BITMAP is a host -country -led initiative in which I CE HSI trains and equips TCIU s and partner nations to collect biometric and biographic data by targeting high risk 8 NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 2022 Summ er Budget and Performance Summary transnational drug trafficking organizati ons or individuals. Cases are deemed high impact or high risk based on a pre-defined set of criteria and are reviewed monthly by a case panel. A disruption is defined as actions taken in furtherance of the investigation that impede the normal and effecti ve operation of the target organization or targeted criminal activit y. Dismantlement is defined as destroying the target organization's leadership, network, and financial base to the point that the organization is incapable of reconstituting itself. Agen ts submit enforcement actions that meet the definition of either a disruption or dismant lement, whic h are cases deemed high -impact or high -risk based on a pre -defined set of criteria and are reviewed by an SCR panel. The SCR panel reviews enforcement actions and examines each submission to ensure it meets the requirement of a disru ption or di smantlement . These investigations include HSI investigations directly related to the disruption and/or dismantlement of Consolidated Priority Organization Targets a nd Regional Priority Organization Targets in accordance with targets designate d by the O rganized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force. Percentages are calculated by dividing drug -related enforcement actions (deemed a disruption or disma ntlement) by the total number of enforcement actions within the domestic program. ICE's money laundering contr ol program investigates financial crimes and interdicts bulk currency shipments exported out of the United States. ICE tracks financial crimes related to the drug tra de and reports the dollar value of real or other property seized fro m drug ope rations. In FY 2019, ICE seized $ 529.8 million from currency and monetary instruments derived from drug operations. The seizure of currency and monetary instruments reduces the financial incentives for criminals OPIOIDS In the FY 2020 budget submission, ICE reques ted funding for Executive Order (EO) which was inclusive of Opioids. Summary of the enhancement below: HSI ($37.9M and 256 FTP): HSI plays a critical role in immigration enforcement and has prioritized worksite enforcement, gang inv estigations , and opio id EOs 13773, 13767, 13768, 13769, and 13776. Once trained, new HSI LEOs will ex pand efforts to combat the TCOs that attempt to illegally exploit America's trade, travel, and financial systems. HSI Intelligenc e EO hires (150 CIs a nd 106 supp ort staff) will serve as a force multiplier; special agents can cover 24% more cases with inves tigative support and produce more criminal arrests. For examp le, investigative support for gang investigations increases the likelihood of a criminal arrest from 25% to 57%. HSI seizures of illicit fentanyl and other opioids at International Mail Facilities (IMF) and Express Consignment Facilities ( ECC) have decreased over the last two years. Though fentanyl seizures made at land border ports of entr y along the southern border are higher in number and larger in volume , the fentanyl seizures from mail and ECC facilities are much higher in purity and are therefore much deadlier. Laboratory results of tested fentanyl has identified that the ma jority of illicit fentanyl seized in the international mail and ECC environments is shipped in NATIONAL DRUG CONTR OL STRATEGY: FY 20 22 Summer Budget and Performance Summary 9 concentrations of over 90%, whereas the majority of fentanyl in the lan d border port of entry environment is seized in concentrations of less than 10% percent. Purch asers can also access open source and Dark Web marketplaces directly for fentanyl and other illicit opioids, where they can be ea sily purchased. HSI BEST has been the primary vehicle used to carry out part of HSI's comprehensive, multi - layered strate gy to addr ess the national Opioid Epidemic. HSI has increased the number of BEST at Memphis, JFK, LAX and Northern Kentucky International Mail Facilities (IMF) and Express Consignment Courier (ECC) as part of HSI's comprehensive and multi- layered strategy to combat the Opioid Epidemic. This strategy facilitates the immediate application of investigative techniques on seized parcels, which aid in establishing probable cause needed to effect enforcement actions on individuals associated with fentanyl laden parce ls. Consequentially, these seizures and arrests disrupt the m ovement of illicit opioids and opioid precursors transiting through the mail and express consignment shipments, and aid in the dismantling of distribution networks. Recognizing that transac tions cond ucted on the Dark Web often involve the utilization of cryptocurrency, in FY 2017, to combat the fentanyl crisis and related financial crimes, the ICE HSI I llicit Finance and Proceeds of Crime Unit and Computer Crimes Unit instituted the Illicit Digit al Ec onomy Program (IDEP). IDEP is a concerted effort in cry ptocurrency and Dark Web training and outreach for our own internal investigators and analysts as well as federal, state, local, and international law enforcement partners to strengthen the globa l awar eness and knowledge needed to combat the emerging threa t. In FY 2018, IDEP conducted 87 presentations and trainings reaching approximately 5,166 law enforcement, government, and non-governmental attendees, and contributed to the initiation of a pprox imate ly 268 ICE HSI led investigations, 246 arrests, 55 convictions, 145 indictments and seizure of $23 million in cryptocurrency. The Executive Order enhancement includes Opioids among several other major investigative case categories including worksite enfor cement and gang investigations. In the event ICE receiv ed this EO enhancement, then ICE would continue to report on the drug budget using the current metho dology. U.S. Department of Homeland Security U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Detailed Accounting Report of Drug Control Funding Fiscal Year 2020 A. Table of Prior Year FY 2020 Drug Control Obligations Drug Resources by Budget Decision Unit and Function: HIDTA Funds represent total authorized and available during FY 2020 (multi-yea r funds: FY19/20 and FY 20/21) 1: Drug Methodology U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is a multi- mission bureau, and obligations are reported pursuant to an approved drug methodology. ICE's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Domestic Investigations , International Operations ( IO) and Office of Intelligence uphold U.S. drug control policy delegated amid the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP ) initiatives, by fully supporting the overall ICE mandate to detect, disrupt, and dismantl e smugglin g organizations. Therefore, separate calculations are formulated to determine obligation data for the three ICE HSI sanctioned programs that undertake counter- narcotic investigative activity, presented in the table above. Thereafter, the foll owin g three (3) sections cover each program in detail. Domestic Investigations The methodology for HSI Domestic Investigations is based on investigative case hours recorded in ICE's automated Case Management System. ICE officers record the type of inves tigative work they perform in this system in the form of case hours. These case hours can then be aggregated to show FY 2020 Final (In Millions ) Drug Resource by Drug Control Function Domestic Investigations $531.354 International Operations $10.269 Intelligence: Domestic $60.510 Intelligence: International $1.260 Total $603.393 Drug Resources by Budget Decision Unit Salaries and Expense s - Immigration Enforcement $0 Total $603.393 High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HID TA) Transfer $3.413 overall level of effort. Following the close of the fiscal year, ICE uses Investigative Case Management ( ICM ) reports to identify and report the total investigative case hours coded as general narcotics cases or money- laundering narcotics cases. A second ICM report shows the total Domestic investigative case hours logged. The percentage of Domestic investigative case hours logged is derived by dividing the number of investigative case hours linked to drug-control activities by the total number of Domestic investigative case hours. This percentage may fluctuate from year to y ear. For FY 20 20, the actual percentage for Domestic Investigation s was 30.03 percent . To calculate a dollar amount of obligation, the percentage is applied to the FY 20 20 enacted Domestic Investigations budget; excluding reimbursable authority. ICE uses the Federal Financial Management System (FFMS) , ICE's general ledger system, to identify the obligations incurred. International Operations (IO) The methodology for IO is based on investigative case hours recorded in ICE's automated Case Management System. ICE officers record the type of work and related case hours they perform in this system, which interfaces with ICM . Following the close of the fiscal year, an ICM report is run to capture investigative case hours coded as general narcotics cases or money -laundering narcotics cases. A second report is run to capture all investigative case hours logged for international law enforcement operations. The international investigative case hours logged percentage is derived by dividing the number of investigative case hours linked to drug-control activities by the total number of International investigative case hours. For FY 20 20, the actual percentage of hours that were general narcotics related was 9.22 percent . To calculate the dollar amount of obligations for the IO drug control function , the percentage is applied to the F Y 2020 enacted IO budget, excluding reimbursable authority. The FFMS is the system used to generate the actual obligations incurred. Office of Intelligence ICE Criminal Analysts provide intelligence services for Domestic Investigations and IO to support criminal investigations aimed at disrupting and dismantling criminal organizations involved in transnational drug trade and associated money-laundering crimes. The methodology for the Office of Intelligence is based on intelligence case hours recorded in ICE's automated Case Management System. ICE Criminal Analysts record the type of work and related case hours they perform in this system, which interfaces with ICM . Following the close of the fiscal year, a report in ICM is run to capture investigative c ase hours coded as general -narcotics cases or money-laundering narcotics cases. A second report is generated capturing all investigative case hours logged. The intelligence investigative case hours percentage is derived by dividing the number of inve stigative case hours linked to drug- control activities by the total number of Intelligence investigative case hours logged for the Office of Intelligence. For FY 2020, 65.64 percent of the total case hours for the Office of Intelligence were in support of drug-control activities. To calculate the dollar amount of obligations for the Office of Intelligence drug control function, the perc entage is applied to the FY 2020 enacted Intelligence budget , excluding reimbursable authority. The FFMS is the system used to generate the actual obligations incurred. The Office of Intelligence case hours recorded in ICM captures both domestic and international drug- related activity . The Office of Intelligence calculates the total percentage of case hours that support Dome stic and International drug enforcement activity by adding the end of the year total number of Intelligence Domestic and Intelligence Office of International Operations drug-controlled investigative hours in ICM and dividing these totals by the total number of Domestic drug-controlled investigative hours and IO drug-controlled investigative hours. The resulting percentage is used to determine the amount that Intelligence does for international activities (2.04 percent ) and domestic activities (9 7.96 percent) in FY 20 20. The respective percentages are applied to the total Office of Intelligence drug- related obligations as determined above to identify the relative international and domestic obligations expended by the Office of Intelligence for drug-cont rol activities. 2: Methodology Modifications There were no modifications to the drug methodology from the previous year to report. 3: Material Weaknesses or Other Findings In the Fiscal Year 20 20 Department of Homeland Security (DHS or the Department) Consolidated Finan cial Statement Audit, ICE contributed to material weaknesses for Information Technology (IT) Controls and System Functionality and Financial Reporting . ICE continues to focus heavily on controls for all financial rela ted systems, such as the systems used for financial management , invoice management, real property, time & attendance, bond management and procurement. ICE has completed a full assessment of application controls for all CFO designated systems, continues to execute corrective actio ns for existing weaknesses, is remedi ating new weaknesses identified and conduct routine verification and validation to ensure improvements are being sustained. ICE recog nizes weaknesses and will work to imp rove financial reporting related to manual footnote submissions, bond management, i nvoices, accou nts paya ble accrual, validation and verification of undelivered orders, record ing of obligations, PRISM to FFMS reconciliation, timely approval of Intra - governmental Payment and Collection transactions, and recording of seized or forfeited property. Additionally, ICE must contin ue to improve on ent ity level contro ls over performance reviews, personnel actions and time and attendance. While there wer e some Notices of Findings and Recommendations (NFR) related to the financial processes and s ystems, ICE continues to improve on financial reporting control deficiencies. The contributions to material weaknesses identified above, or the NFRs received for financial reporting, did not impair ICE's ability to r eport complete and accurate obligation data in the Table of Prior Year FY 20 20 Drug Control Obligations. 4: Reprogrammings or Transfers During FY 2020, ICE had no reprogrammings and transfers. As a component of DHS, ICE submits all reprogramming and trans fer requests through the Department for approval, and the impact of these changes is assessed b y the Department. In FY 2020, the Department determined there were no reprogrammings or transfers that materially impacted ICE's drug -related obligations reported i n the Table of Prior Ye ar FY 20 20 Drug Control Obligations. 5: Other Disclosures There are no othe r disclosures ICE feels are necessary to clarify any issues regarding the data reported. B. Assertions 1: Obligations by Budget Decision Unit Not Appli cable - As a multi -mission agency , ICE is exempt from reporting under this section as noted in the Offic e of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Circular : National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Revi ews, dated October 22, 2019. 2: Drug Methodology The methodology used to calculate obligations of budgetary resources by budget decision unit and function is reasonable and accurate regarding the workload data employed and the estimation methods used. The workload data derived from ICM, discussed in the methodology section above, is based on work performed between October 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020. There are no other estimation methods used. The financial system used to calculate the drug-related budget obligations is the FFMS, which is reliable and capable of yielding data that fairly presents, in all material respects, aggregate obligations. 3: Application of Drug Methodology The methodology disclosed in Section A, Disclosure No. 1 was the actual methodology used to generate the Table of Pri or Year FY 2020 Drug Control Obligations. 4: Reprogrammings or Transfers The data presented are associated wit h obligations against a financial plan that properly reflects all changes in drug- related budgetary resources that occurred during the fiscal ye ar, including reprogrammings or transfers. Although the Department determined there was no material impact to drug- related obligations, the ONDCP approved all reprogrammings or transfers in excess of $1 million in FY 20 20. 5: Fund Control Notices No Fund Co ntrol Notice was issued , as defined by the ONDCP Director under 21 U.S.C. Section 1703(f) and Section 9 of t he ONDCP Circular: Budget Execution , to ICE in FY 2020. U.S. Department of Homeland Security U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Performance Summary Report of D rug Control Funds during Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 International Operations (IO) Metric 1: Percentage of overseas investigative hours incurred on drug -related cases. (1) Description The performance metric for IO is the percentage of overseas investigative hours incurred on drug- related cases. This metric evaluates the percentage of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) total overseas investigations that impact counter -narcotics enforcement. ICE's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) I O supports U.S. drug control policy, specifically Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) initiatives , such as 'Disrupt domestic drug trafficking and production' and 'Strengthen Law -Enforcement and International Partnerships to Reduce the Availability of Foreign -Produced Drugs in the United States ', by supporting the overall ICE mandate to detect, disrupt, and dismantle smuggling organizations. The desired outcomes for the execution of DHS' action items are: disruption of domestic drug trafficking and production; and strengthen ing of international partnerships and reduction in the availability of foreign -produced drugs in the United States. Increased hours incurred on drug -related cases directly lead to increased detection, disruption and dismantlement of drug smuggling organizations. I O investigative resources are directed at organizations smuggling contraband (including narcotics) into the United States. The I O offices coordinate international investigation with foreign law enforcement counterparts and provide investigative support to HSI domestic offices in combatting transnational criminal operations and organizations. IO also partners with domestic ICE components and with U.S. law enforcement agencies overseas to leverage overseas resources, mitigating global narcotics threats to the United States. This includes utilizing investigative and intelligence techniques to support domestic cases and interagency cross-border initiatives. This counter -narcotics performance metric is evaluated on a consistent basis for IO. In some cases, it is included in Senior Executive Service (SES) performanc e plans and may be tracked at a high managerial level by way of processes such as HSI Transparency/Results/Accountability/Knowledge-sharing ( HSI TRAK) , programmatic monitoring, financial monitoring , and quarterly expenditure reports. (2) Prior and Current Year Performance Targets and Results Fiscal Year Target Year End Actual 2016 7.50% - 2 - In FY 20 20, the IO actual percentage was 9.22 percent; therefore exceeding the FY 2020 target of 9.20 percent. To calculate the dollar amount of obligations for the IO drug control function, this percentage is applied to the FY 2020 enacted IO budget, excluding reimbursable authority. It should be noted, during FY 2020, the actual IO percentage has been directly influenced by the pandemic and its effect on the ability of our foreign counterparts to conduct and support narcotics related operations and investigations. This action directly impacts the SCR process as well as the agency's ability to disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal organizations. (3) Performance Target for FY 2020 The performance target for FY 2020 is 9.20 percent, a target based on the average three prior years' actual data per prior year's methodology. HSI notes the drug enforcement environment can change significantly in a short period of time due to changes in drug enforcement strategy, including legislation. Thus, incorporating historical data beyond the prior three years would result in a less realistic performance target. In establishing this performance metric, IO plans to have sufficient resources to support the same level of effort on drug- related investigations. (4) Quality of Performance Data The database used to obtain HSI IO's performance data is the ICE Investigative Case Management System (ICM ), which is ICE's automated case management system that records investigative hours. International Operations relies on ICM to ensure the performance data is accurate, complete, and unbiased in presentation and substance. ICE also conducts quality control verification on all data received through ICM to ensure performance data is accurate, complete, and unbiased in presentation and substance. HSI has transition ed into the new web-based system (ICM) from Legacy T ECS, which has created interface migration issues . The first release took place in the summer of 2016, when nearly 11,000 HSI users were migrated over to ICM. As a result, some of the data used in this metric of the report has been impacted by an immaterial amount. Intelligence Metric 2: Number of counter- narcotics intelligence requests satisfied. (1) Description This p erformance metric is calculated by the sum of the amount of Intelligence Information Reports (IIR) and Analytical Framework for Intelligence (AFI) products. An IIR is a formal standardized method of disseminating raw unevaluated information, on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Intelligence E nterprise (IE) and other information providers, to elements of the Intelligence Community (IC) and the DHS IE, as appropriate. This is the primary vehicle through which the Reports Section shares this raw intelligence within ICE and throughout the DHS and the IC. - 3 - The AFI allows HSI Office of Intelligence (HSI Intel) to maintain visibility on all Intelligence products used by the HSI field offices and at HQ. This system allows HSI -Intel to run searches on specific mission areas, which include counter -narcotics and drug smuggling Intel -related products. HSI Intel supports its HSI Special Agents, Intelligence Analysts, Mission Support Specialists and all other personnel who support intelligence operations and the IC by providing AFI and IIR products and services that inform customers and close existing \"intelligence gaps.\" Customer requirements are formally documented and captured within the Analytical Framework for Intelligence (AFI). Published Intelligence products, known as AFI products , are a detailed written analysis on an intelligence development that can be shared with the IC . Levied requirements are then determined either \"satisfied\" by Intelligence, or not. In the latter case, an intelligence gap remains. Satisfaction of customer requirements represents the \"outcome\" of Intelligence production in those satisfying customer requirements, closes the gap in customer information needs , and allows customers to make inf ormed decisions about executing law enforcement actions. This counter -narcotics performance metric is evaluated on a consistent basis for Intelligence, and is in some cases put into SES performance plans. It is also tracked at a high managerial level via processes, such as HSI T RAK, programmatic monitoring, financial monitoring, and quarterly expenditure reports. (2) Prior and Current Year Performance Targets and Results Fiscal Year Target Year End Actual 2016 431 275 2017 275 312 2018 312 283 2019 283 182 2020 182 241 In FY 20 20, HSI Intel produced a total of 241 drug- related products; therefore exceeding the FY 2020 target of 182. Of the 241 drug-related products, a total of two hundred twenty -five (225) were IIR products and si xteen (16) w ere AFI products. (3) Performance Target for FY 20 20 The performance target for FY 20 20 is 182 counter- narcotics intelligence requests satisfied. The target is based on the prior year actual data. Actual production efforts, whether for finished intelligence or IIRs, are driven by resources and prioritization. Current departmental and ICE priorities are counterterrorism, counterintelligence, human smuggling and cybercrime. The p roduction of drug- related intelligence has declined since FY 2014 in counter -narcotics and may continue to decline pending the department's priorities ; however, ICE senior leadership has determined using the FY 2019 actual is reasonable, as it represents the current organizational priorities. - 4 - (4) Quality of Performance Data Databases used to validate HSI Intel's performance data are the AFI and the HSI Intel's shared drive hosting the IIRs. AFI is a generation analytical system that is separately operated by customers. The capabilities of AFI are used to gather analysis that is critical to the IC through collaborative reporting. Intelligence conducts quality control verification on the AFI data and the shared drive hosting the IIRs to ensure the performance data is accurate and unbiased in presentation and substance. Furthermore, ICE HSI Intel is implementing metadata items within AFI that will group data distinctly into either HSI Domestic or HSI International, increasing the speci ficity of the data provided. Domestic Investigations Metric 3 : Percentage of significant Homeland Security investigations that result in a disruption or dismantlement (1) Description ICE coordinated with the ONDCP and established new performance metrics in FY 2012 to better indicate the success of counter -narcotics enforcement across all investigative areas. This metric supports the National Counter Narcotics Strategy objectives and initiatives to disrupt and dismantle transnational and domestic drug-trafficking and money -laundering organizations. The new performance metric is \"the percentage of significant, high risk transnational criminal investigations that result in a disruption or dismantlement.\" This metric is incumbent on all investigative case categories and is not restricted to HSI counter -narcotic cases, contrasting from metric 4 (that is strictly involving ICM Categories directly related to drug activities/investigations ). This measure is a precise result of all investigative case s in the seven ICM Categories: 1) Illicit Trade, Travel and F inance (non-drug- related), 2) Illicit Trade, T ravel, and Finance (drug related), 3) Counter-proliferation, 4) National Security, 5) Transnational Gangs, 6) Transn ational Crimes Against Children, and 7) Worksite Enforcement. These measures articulate the impact of HSI investigations and the ir final outcomes by demonstrating the impediment of crime s directly. This allow s HSI to identify, categorize , and report significant investigations that target the greatest threats faced in the nation, while demonstrating HSI's commitment to disrupt and dismantle criminal activity. The Significant Case Review (S CR) process and their subsequent performance measures exhibit how HSI enhances national security and public safety by focusing on these high- risk priority investigations. In an effort to ensure long- standing viability , HSI special agents submit enforcement actions that meet the definition of either a disruption or dismantlement that involve criminal investigations of cases deemed significant or high -risk based on a pre -defined set of criteria reviewed by the SCR panel. The SCR panel reviews enforcement actions and examines each submissio n of the criminal investigative elements that are being presented to ensure the submission meets the requirement of a disruption or - 5 - dismantlement. A disruption is defined as actions taken in furtherance of the investigation that impede the normal and effective operation of the target organization or targeted criminal activity. Dismantlement is defined as destroying the target organization's leadership, network, and financial base so the organization is incapable of reconstituting itself. The performance measures for HSI for FY 20 20 were calculated using actual historical significant investigation performance results since program inception (FY 2011) using the following methodology: 1) The final calculation is derived by: Number of Unique SCRs with Type 2 and/or Type 3 Reports during the Reporting Period divided by the (Number of Approved and Open Type 1 SCRs at the Beginning of the Reporting Period + Number of Type 1 Reports Opened and Approved During the Reporting Period)1 (2) Prior and Current Year Performance Targets and Results2 Fiscal Year Target Year End Actual 2015 18.00% 15.83 % 2016 16.00% 16.10% 24.83 % In FY 20 20, the actual percentage for the reportable Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) metric is 24.83 percent; there fore, exceeding the FY 2020 GPRA target of 16.10 percent . It should be noted, during FY 2020, the actual percentage for the reportable GPRA metric has been directly influenced due to the pandemic events facing the United States. The United States Attorney's Offices throughout the United States have limited the criminal proceeding including the arrests and indictments process due to Covid- 19 exposures. This action directly impacts the SCR process as well as the agency's ability to disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal organizations. (3) Performance Target for FY 20 20 The performance target for FY 20 20 is 16.10 percent. Planning for responses to future criminal trends, while critical in assessing risk and threats, is difficult due to the inherent challenge of predicting future criminal activity. This makes the establishment of performance targets for enforcement statisti cs 1 Type 1 (Significant) - Is the initial Significant Case Report (SCR) Type 2 (Disruption) - SCR that indicates changes in organizational leadership or changes in methods of operation of the target organization. Type 3 (Dismantlement) - SCR which indicates that the target organization's leadership, network, and financial base are incapable of reconstituting itself. 2 HSI discovered a coding error at the beginning of FY 2015 within the information system that pulls data from TECs. This forced a revalidation of data and a rethinking of how the data is pulled and verified. HSI has since used a corrected data coding and validation for FY 20 15. HSI re -examined previous year's data using the new coding and methodology and those actual results are: FY13 16.28%, FY14 47.16%. The prior year actual results in the table have not been modified, so as to remain comparable to previously issued reports. - 6 - extremely difficult. Due to the high number of unknown variables, the FY 20 20 performance target was created using historical trends, future operational assumptions, attrition, and national security special event details. (4) Quality of Performance Data The database used to validate Domestic Investigations performance data is ICM . Domestic Investigations relies on ICM to ensure the performance data are accurate, complete, and unbiased in presentation and substance. ICE also conducts quality control verification on all data received through ICM to ensure performance data is accurate, complete, and unbiased in presentation and substance. Due to the migration noted in Metric 1 Section 4, some of the data used in this metric of the report has been i mpacted by an immaterial amount. Domestic Investigations Metric 4 : Percent of significant drug related illicit trade and illicit travel and finance investigations that result in a disruption or dismantlement (1) Description ICE coordinated with ONDCP and established performance metrics in FY 2012 to better indicate the success of counter -narcotics enforcement across all investigative areas. This is aligned with the 2016- 2020 HSI Strategic Plan, Goal: Protect the Homeland Against Illicit Trade, Travel and Finance, Objective 2.4 : Disrupt and Dismantle Drug Trafficking Organizations. The methodology used to calculate this measure remains consistent with the prior year. ICE supported ONDCP initiatives th at include the National Counter Narcotics Strategy objectives , such as disrupting and dismantling transnational and domestic drug- trafficking and money -laundering organizations. The performance metric is \"the percentage of significant high risk drug related illicit trade and illicit travel and finance investigations that result in a disruption or dismantlement.\" Agents submit enforcement actions that meet the definition of either a disruption or dismantlement, which are cases deemed high -impact or high -risk based on a pre -defined set of criteria and are reviewed by a n SCR panel. The SCR panel reviews enforcement actions and examines each submission to ensure it meets the requirement of a disruption or dismantlement. While Metric 3 focuses on all seven t ypes of ICM criminal investigations, this metric specifically relates to illicit trade, travel, and finance in investigations explicit to investigation s in transnational criminal enterprises that focus on schemes involving import and/or export or other trade, travel, finance, or immigration violations. These investigations include HSI investigational actions directly related to the disruption and/or dismantlement of Consolidated Priority Organization Targets and Regional Priority Organization Targets in ac cordance with targets designated by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force. Percentages are calculated by dividing drug -related enforcement actions (deemed a disruption or dismantlement) by the total number of enforcement actions within the domestic program. - 7 - (2) Prior and Current Year Performance Targets and Results3 Fiscal Year Target Year End Actual 2015 29.00% 9.55% percent of significant high -risk counter-narcotic , illicit trade, travel and finance investigations resulted in a disruption or dismantlement. Therefore, HSI did not m et the FY 2020 target of 15.50 percent. It should be noted, during FY 2020, the actual percentage for the reportable GPRA metric has been directly influenced due to the COVID -19 pandemic . As a result, the United States criminal court system has deferred prosecutions, indictments and criminal proceedings negatively impacting HSI's enforcement efforts to disrupt and dismantle TCOs. HSI did not meet FY2020 reporting and will likely not meet FY2021 as this pandemic continues. In order to meet the FY2021 target, HSI will count subcategory 06E (Child e xploitation enterprise) and 06F (RICO) towards its significant drug related, illicit trade, travel and finance investigations reporting metrics. (3) P erformance Target for FY 2020 The performance target for FY 2020 is 15.50 percent. Due to the high number of unknown variables, the FY 20 20 performance target was created using historical trends, future operational assumptions, attrition, and national security s pecial event details. In addition, this t arget was set before FY 20 20 actuals were finalized with the assumption that the patterns will continue into the near future. In establishing this metric, Domestic Investigations plans to have sufficient resources to support the same level of effort on drug related investigations into FY 2020. (4) Quality of P erformance Data The database used to validate Domestic Investigations performance data is ICM . As stated previously, Domestic Investigations relies on ICM to ensure the performance data are accurate, complete, and unbiased in presentation and substance. ICE also conducts quality control verification on all data 3 HSI discovered a coding error at the beginning of FY 2015 within the information system that pulls data from TECs. This forced a revalidation of data and a rethinking of how the data is pulled and verified. HSI has since used a corrected data coding and validation for FY 20 15. HSI re -examined previous year's data using the new coding and methodology and those actual results are: FY13 16.28%, FY14 47.16%. The prior year actual results in the table have not been modified, so as to remain comparable to previously issued reports. - 8 - received through ICM to ensure performance data is accurate, complete, and unbiased in presentation and substance.

Carroll, Jr. Director Commandant United States Coast Guard Office of National Drug Control Policy 750 17th Street, NW Washington, DC 20503 Dear Mr. Carroll, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave. SE Washington, DC 20593 Staff Symbol: CG-82 Phone: (202) 372-3501 7110 Jan 28, 2021 The United States Coast Guard is required by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Circular: National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews, dated October 22, 2019, to present information and assertions used in budget formulation, account for funds expended on ONDCP activities, and the described levels of performance achieved in execution of these activities. Enclosed are the Coast Guard's FY 2022 Summer Drug Budget, FY 2020 Detailed Accounting Report, and the FY 2020 Performance Summary Report. In compliance with the ONDCP Circular: National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews, dated October 22, 2019, I am writing to make the following assertions: The FY 2022 Summer Drug Budget was submitted to ONDCP on July 09, 2020, which contained an FY 2022 Summer Drug Budget Resource Summary Table. The DHS FY 2022 Summer Drug Budget and Resource Summary table were provided to ONDCP at the same time as that budget request was submitted to DHS. To the best of my knowledge, the Coast Guard provided the FY 2022 Summer Drug Budget submission to DHS without alteration or adjustment by any official at DHS. To the best of my knowledge, the drug control funding obligation assertions, budget formulation assertions, accounting assertions, and performance assertions detailed by the Coast Guard within each report and/or submission are accurate and complete. 1The Coast Guard has a comprehensive approach to maritime counterdrug law enforcement in the source, transit, and arrival zones. The key objectives of the Coast Guard strategy are to: (1)Maintain an interdiction presence based on the availability of assets, deny smugglers access to maritime routes, and deter trafficking activity; (2)Strengthen ties with source and transit zone nations to increase their willingness and ability to stem the production and trafficking of illicit drugs; and (3)Support interagency and international efforts to address drug smuggling through in creased cooperation and coordination. METHODOLOGY The Coast Guard does not have a specific appropriation for drug interdiction activities. All Coast Guard operations, capital improvements and acquisitions, and research and development activities targeted toward drug interdiction are funded out of the associated appropriations specified herein. Reflecting the multi -mission nature of Coast Guard units, the accounting system is keyed to operating and support facilities, rather than to specific missions. Consistent with that approach, personnel and other costs are administered and tracked along operational and support capability lines requiring detailed cost accounting techniques. The Coast Guard uses a Mission Cost Model methodology to compute its drug mission allocation. The Mission Cost Model allocates funding across Coast Guard missions in the Performance - Based Budget presentation. The Mission Cost Model allocates all direct and support costs to mission - performing units (e.g., National Security Cutter [NSC] or Long Range Surveillance [LRS] aircraft). Established baselines of operational activity are used to further allocate those costs to the various missions. Procurement, Construction & Improvements (PC&I) The Mission Cost Model is used to develop an allo cation of costs by mission areas for proposed PC&I projects based on the typical employment of assets germane to the project. For example, if a new asset is being proposed for commissioning through a PC&I project, costs would be applied to missions using t he operational profile of a comparable existing asset. The Coast Guard uses a zero -based budget approach in developing its request for PC&I funding. Program changes in the PC&I account may vary significantly from year- to-year depending on the specific platforms or construction projects supported. PC&I funding finances the acquisition of new capital assets, construction of new facilities, and physical improvements to existing facilities and assets. The funds cover Coast Guard -owned and operated vessels, airc raft, shore facilities, and other equipment, such as computer systems. Operations & Support (O&S) O&S funds are used to operate assets and facilities; maintain capital equipment; improve management effectiveness; and recruit, train, and sustain all active -duty military and civilian personnel. Budget presentations for current and future years use the most recent O&S asset cost data and systematically allocate costs in the following manner: Direct Costs: Ap plied directly to the operating assets that perform missions. Support Costs: Applied to assets for which cost variability can be specifically linked to operating assets (based on allocation criteria). Overhead Costs: Applied to assets based on proportion of labor dollars spent where cost variability cannot be specifically linked to operating assets. This is a standard industry approach to overhead allocation. 2nearly impossible to detect with radar and very difficult to observe visually, the Coast Guard stopped 24 of these specially -built trafficking vessels in Fiscal Year 2019, resulting in the removal of 53 metric tons of cocaine. This equates to preventing domestic drug dealers from distributing approximately 116.8 million doses on the streets of the United States. In June 2019 , the newest National Security Cutter, CGC MUNRO, took part in a dramatic SPSS interdiction. Video footage of the Eastern Pacific interdiction prominently elevated public awareness of the enforcement challenges associated with trafficking threats. The story trended in news feeds for weeks, with 50 individual interviews, all illuminating Coast Guard efforts to stop the flow of illicit narcotics at sea where s hipments are most vulnerable and represent the greatest value to drug cartels In addition to CGC MUNRO, CGC VALIANT, CGC MOHAWK, and Law Enforcement Detachment 405, while deployed aboard Her Majesty's Canadian Ship EDMONTON, also interdicted SPSS vessels in 2019. Together, the Coast Guard removed nearly 24 metric tons from these vessels. CGC VALIANT's 8,000 kilogram cocaine removal from an SPSS in September was the largest single interdiction removal in FY 2019. The removal equated to the interdiction of n ine go -fasts and was the largest Coast Guard cocaine removal in four years. Drug Cartels use of a variety of hull designs to produce vessels capable of partial submersion or extremely low freeboard has increased in recent years. This is largely due to their ability to successfully evade detection, increase capability of smuggling large quantities of narcotics, and the relatively inexpensive construction cost in comparison with SPSS vessels. Low profile vessels averaged 1,142 kilograms of cocaine per inter diction in FY 2019. CGC TAMPA is credited with the largest cocaine removal from a low profile vessel in FY 2019, with their February interdiction off the Ecuadorian coast yielding 2,742 kilograms. The Coast Guard exercised the U.S. and Costa Rica Counter Drug Bilateral Agreement thro ugh a joint shiprider operation, Operation Crested Eagle. This operation spanned multiple exercises from December 2018 through August 2019 , where the Costa Rica (CR) Maritime Interdiction Units, supported by USCG Deployable S pecialized Forces, enhanced CR's ability to conduct interdiction operations, particularly from the newly acquired Libertadors (former USCG 110 -foot patrol boats). This operation resulted in the seizure of over 6,804 kilograms of cocaine and apprehension o f nearly 30 suspects. OPIOIDS Coast Guard counter -drug operations target contraband of all types and is pilot testing opioid detection technology to improve the chances of interdicting a broader spectrum of illicit substances. While the Coast Guard interdicted heroin in the maritime environment in FY 2019 , the mission cost model does not separate operating funds by substance targeted. 51 DEPARTMENT OF HO MELAND SECURITY UNITED STATES COAST GUARD Detailed Accounting Report of FY 2020 Drug Control Funds DETAILED ACCOUNTING REPORT A.Table of FY 2020 Drug Control Obligations RESOURCE SUMMARY (Do llars in Millions) 2020 Actual Drug Resources by Drug Control Function: Obligations Interdiction $1,789.736 Research and Development $1.383 Total Resources by Function $1,791.119 Drug Resources by Budget Decision Unit: Operations and Support (O&S ) $1,270.637 Procurement, Construction, & Improvements (PC&I) $519.099 Research and Development (R&D) $1.383 Total Drug Control Obligations $1,791.119 1. Drug Methodology In fiscal year ( FY) 2000, a methodology known as the Mission Cost Model (MCM) was developed to present the United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard) missions using activity -based cost accounting principles. The MCM is an estimate of operational mission costs allocated across the Coast Guard's 11 mission s/program s consisting of: Drug Interdiction; Migrant Interdiction; Ports, Waterways and Coastal Security; Other Law Enforcement; Defense Readiness; Search and Rescue; Marine Ice Operations; Marine Environmental Protectio n; Living Marine Resources; and Aids to Navigation. The MCM output allocated to Drug Interdiction is allocated to the O ffice of National Drug Control P olicy (ONDCP) Drug Control Function 'Interdiction' for all decision units with the exception of R &D. R&D is allocated to ONDCP Control Func tion 'Research and Development'. The information reported is timely and derived from an allocation process involving the Coast Guard's financial statement information and operational employment data . The operating hour allocation, or baseline, is developed and modified based upon budget line item requests and operational priorities. The Coast Guard is required to report its drug control funding to ONDCP in three appropriations, categorically called decisio n units. The Coast Guard's drug control funding estimates are computed by examining the decision units that are comprised of: Operations and Support (O&S) ; Procurement , Construction, and Improvement (PC&I); and Research and Developm ent (R&D ). Each decision unit contains its own unique spending authority and methodology. For example, PC&I includes funding that remains available for obligation up to five years after appropriation, and R&D includes funding that ENCL (2) 2 remains available for obligatio n up to three years after appropriation. Unless stipulated by law, O&S must be spent in the fiscal year it is appropriated. The mechanics of the MCM methodology used to derive the drug control information for each decision unit's drug control data is derived as follows. Mission Cost Al locations O&S funds are us ed to operate Coast Guard facilities , maintain capital equipment, improve management effectiveness , and recruit, train, sustain, and compensate an active duty military and civilian workforce. The Coast Guard tracks resource hours spent on each of its 11 statutory missions . Obligations within the drug interdiction program are derived by allocating a share of the actual obligations of assets and activities based upon the reported percent age of time aircraft, cutters, and boats spent conducting drug interdiction activities. The two chief input dr ivers to the MCM are: The Coast Guard's Expanse Allocation Model (EAM) - The EAM model development , formerly known as the Standard Rate and User Fee Model , uses the SAS\u00ae Activity Based Model (ABM) and Enterprise Guide (EG) software solutions. The model inputs include expenditure data captured by the Coast Guard's three general ledgers : Core Accounting System (CAS), Naval and Electronics Supply System (NESSS ), and Aircraft Logistics Informat ion Management System (ALMIS). As such, this model calculates the total cost, including direct, support , and overhead, of operating the Coast Guard's assets, as well as missions or services that the Coast Guard performs b ut doe s not have related standard rates or user fees. Abstract of Operations (AOPS) and ALMIS - The Coast Guard tracks resource hours incurred on each of the 11 Coast Guard statutory missions using AOPS and ALMIS. This data is then used to determine the amount of time each asset class is employed in each Coast Guard mission as a ratio of total resource hours incurred on all missions. Using financia l data recorded in the three general ledgers (CAS, NESSS, and ALMIS) in combination with asset activity data recorded in AOPS and ALMIS, the Coast Guard allocates O&S costs to each of the 11 statutory missions. By design, the MCM is based on the O&S decision unit. PC&I and R&D decision units must be calculated separately, due to the structure of the PC&I and R&D decision units, which are presented as individual projects in the Coast Guard's budget submission. Within PC&I and R&D, individual projects are allocated to missions based on an established profile (largely based on utilization). The drug interdiction attributions of each of these projects are then combined to determine the total contribution to the drug interdiction mission. The program pe rcentages derived from the MCM are applied to O&S , PC&I and R&D decision units per the above methodology. Obligation data is derived from the final financial accounting Report on Budget Execution (SF-133). As previously dis cussed, because the Coast Guard budgets through congressionally established appropriations (rather than individual missions), the organization must rely on information contained within the activity based MCM. The Coast Guard uses this MCM data to determine financial obligations specifically related to statutory missions , including Drug Interdiction. This appropriation structure supports multi -mission requirements by allowing the Service to surge and shift resources across all missions. This level of resource fle xibility is critical to successful mission execution in the Coast Guard's 3 dynamic operational environment. However, such a structure makes it difficult to precisely determine the cost of a particular mission or the \"level of effort\" expended in carrying o ut in each mission. The MCM provides the Coast Guard with a reliable, repeatable system that forecasts future year spending and estimates previous year obligations by mission. 2. Methodology Modifications The methodology descri bed above is consistent with the previous year. 3.Material Weaknesses or Other Findings There were no audits in FY 2020, however, using previous fiscal years as a reference, the Coast Guard continued to implement corrective action plans to remediate long -standing internal control deficiencies related to Financial Reporting , IT Controls , and System Functionality. Coast Guard control deficiencies that contributed to the department -level material weaknesses did not impair Coast Guard's ability to report complete and accurate obligat ion data in the Table of FY 2020 Drug Control Obligations . It should be noted that in FY 2021, the Coast Guard is transitioning to the Common Appropriation Structure, which may positively impact some previously noted weaknesses in IT Controls and System Functionality in follow on years. 4.Reprogramming or Transfers As a component of DHS, C oast Guard submits all reprogramming and transfer requests through the Department for approval, and the impact of these changes to funding is assessed by the Department. In FY 2020, DHS determined there were no reprogramming or transfers that materially impacted Coast Guard's drug -related obligations reported in the Table of FY 2020 Drug Control Obligations. 5.Other Disclosures The following provides a synopsis of the Coast Guard's FY 2020 Drug Control Funds reporting which describes: The agency's overall mission and the role of drug interdiction efforts within the Coast Guard's multi - mission structure; and The Coast Guard's Drug Budget Submission. Coast Guard Mission The Coast Guard is a military service with mandated national security and national defense responsibilities , and is the United States' leading maritime law enforcement agency with broad, multi- faceted jurisdictional authority. Due to the multi- mission n ature of the Coast Guard and the necessity to allocate the effort of a finite amount of assets, there is a considerable degree of asset \"cross -over\" between missions. This cross -over contributes to the challenges the Coast Guard faces when reporting costs for its mission areas. 4 Coast Guard's Drug Budget Submission In the annual Nationa l Drug Control Strategy (NDCS) Budget Summary, all agencies present their drug control resources broken out by function and decision unit. The presentation by decision unit is the one that corresponds most closely to the Coast Guard's congressional budget submissions and appropriations. It should be noted and emphasized the Coast Guard does not have a specific appropriation for drug interdiction activities. As such, there are no financial accounting lines for each of the Coast Guard's 11 statutory missions. All drug interdiction operations, capital improvements, reserve support, and research and development efforts are funded through general Coast Guard appr opriations. The Coast Guard's dr ug control budget is generally an accurate reflection of the Coast Guard's overall budget. The Coast Guard's O&S appropriation budget request is incremental, focusing on the changes from the prior year base brought forward. The Coast Guard continues to present supplementary budget information through the use of the MCM, which allocates base funding and incremental requests by mission. This general purpose M CM serves as the basis for developing drug control budget estim ates for the O &S and appropriations and provides allocation percentages used to develop the drug control estimates for the PC&I and R&D appropriations and the process is repeatable. Similarly, this is the same methodology used to complete our annual submission to the ONDCP for the NDCS Budget Summary. Assertions 1)Obligations by Budget Decision Unit Not Applicable. As a multi- mission agency, the Coast Guard is exempt from this reporting requirement , as noted in the ONDCP Circular: Accounting of Drug Control Funding and Performance Summary , Section 6(A)(1), dated May 8, 2019. 2) Drug Methodology The methodology use d to produce the drug interdiction funding in this report is reasonable and accurate. This methodology is consistently used by the Coast Guard to develop annual budget yearsubmissions and mission related reports. The criteria associated to this assertion a re as follows: a) Data - The percentag e allocation results derived from its MCM methodology are based on the FY 2020 financial and AOPS /ALMIS data, as presented in the Coast Guard's FY 2020 OMB budget submission. b)Financial Systems - T he MCM uses costs fro m three general ledgers . These include CAS, NESSS, and ALMIS. These financial systems yield data that fairly presents, in all materialrespects, aggregate obligations from which drug- related obligation estimates are derived. 3) Application of Drug Methodology The methodology disclos ed in this section was the actual methodology used to generate the drug control obligation funding table required by ONDCP Circular: Accounting of Drug Control Funding5 and Performance Summary , issued May 8, 2019. Documentation on each decision unit is provided. 4)Material Weaknesses or Other Findings: Material Weaknesses o r Other Findings are noted in section three above. 5) Methodology Modifications: The methodology descr ibed above is consistent with the previous year. 6) Reprogramming or Transfers During FY 2020, the Coast G uard had no reports of transfers or reprogramming actions affecting drug related budget resources in excess of $1 million. 7) Fund Control Notices ONDCP did not issue the Coast Guard a Fund Control Notice for FY 20201 Drug Budget United States Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard Performance Summary Report FY 2020 ENCL (3) 2 PERFORMANCE INFORMATION NOTE: Although the Unite d States Coast Guard (Coast Guard) is apportioned along budget decision unit lines (i.e., Procurement, Construction & Improvements (PC&I), Operations and Support (O &S), and Research and Development (R &D)), the Coast Guard does not manage performance along decision unit lines. This is impractical due to the multi-mission performance of our assets, which transcends budget decision units. Thus, the Coast Guard received permission from the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to pres ent one metric for all four decision unit lines. This section is base d on Coast Guard data and DHS Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) documents. The Coast Guard's D rug Interdiction mission supports national and international strategies to deter and disrupt the market for illegal drugs, dismantle Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs), and prevent transnational threats from reaching the United States (U.S.). The Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for drug interdiction on the high seas, and shares the lead in U.S. territorial seas with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). In carrying out this mission, the Coast Guard coordinates with a variety of international and domestic partners including the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the Drug Enforcement Administration, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The objectives of the Coast Guard strategy are to: (1) maintain a strong interdiction presence to deny smugglers access to maritime routes and deter trafficking activity; (2) strengthen ties with source 1 and transit2 zone nations to increase their willingness and ability to reduce the production and trafficking of illicit drugs within their sovereign boundaries, including territorial seas; and (3) support interagency and international efforts to combat drug smuggling through increased cooperation and coordination. Coast Guard operations align with the President's National Drug Control Strategy and ONDCP's National Interdiction Command and Control Plan, which target the flow of cocaine and other illicit drugs toward the U.S. The Coast Guard's dr ug interdiction performance is best summarized by the program's performance measure, the Cocaine Removal Rate. This measure indicates how effective the program is at disrupting the flow of cocaine traveling via non- commercial maritime means toward the U.S. The more cocaine removed by the Coast Guard, the less cocaine available for consumption in the U.S. Performance Measure s Table 1 represents the percent of cocaine removed (seized by the Coast Guard, and jettisoned, scuttled, or destroyed as a result of Coast Guard law enforcement action) in relation to the non-commercial maritime movement of cocaine. Table 2 represents the non -commercial maritime cocaine flow and tonnage removed by the Coast Guard. The amount of cocaine removed by the Coast Guard is the sum of all cocaine that is 1 The source zone includes the principal drug producing countries of Bolivia, Columbia, and Peru. 2 The transit zone encompasses Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern Pacific Ocean. 4 Continuously changing modes, tactics and routes by TCOs (e.g. use of semi-submersible type vessels and logistic support vessels); The availability rate and allocation of the Coast Guard's cutter fleet to the counter narcotics mission ; The availability of aviation assets fr om Customs and B order Patrol, DoD, and Allied nations to support Detection and Monitoring in the transit zone; The availability of USN or Allied surface assets with embarked USCG L aw Enforcement Detachments to perform interdiction and apprehension activiti es; The availability, quality , and timeliness of tactical intelligence; The fielding of new capabilities (e.g. National Security Cutter, Fast Response Cutter, and Maritime Patrol Aircraft). At least annually, the Coast Guard's Maritime Law Enforcement Program and the Office of Program, Analysis, and Evaluation review assumptions that factor into the establishment of out-year cocaine removal targets, making adjustments as necessary. Revisions to the targets are reported via the DHS' Future Year Homeland Security Program (FYHSP) database. The Maritime Law Enforcement Program last updated its out- year performance targets in March 2019 in conjunction with normal target setting timelines. Coast Guard's removal rate target for fiscal year 2020 was 10 percent and remains the same into fiscal year 202 1. Due to increases in the capabilities provided by new Coast Guard assets and the improvement in intelligence and targeting , this is an aggressive, yet achievable performance target. Ever shifting smuggling trends , changes in TCO tactics, and the unforeseen impacts of COVID- 19 throughout the Western Hemisphere presented several notable differences to the counterdrug mission outcomes in fiscal year 2020. Despite reduced known drug flow across the transit zone, compared to fiscal year 2019, t he Coast Guard increased cocaine removals in the Caribbean by 65 percent. The Coast Guard cocaine removals in the Caribbean during fiscal year 2020 were also the highest total volume removed in the last seven years. In the eastern Pacific, the number of interdiction s containing both cocaine and marijuana tripled, and total volume of interdicted methamphetamines quadrupled, compared to fiscal year 2019. Covid-19 Impacts Against the backdrop of a global pandemic, the Coast Guard continued to maximize readiness, deliver mission success, and meet the needs of the American people. The adaptability and teamwork of the Coast Guard's dedicated workforce led to the interdiction of over 390,000 pounds of cocaine and other illicit drugs in fiscal year 2020. These interdictions deprived TCOs of more than $5.6 billion in profits and resulted in the apprehen sion 456 suspected smugglers for U.S. and foreign prosecution. Interagency cooperation via the Maritime Operational Threat Response Plan to attain standing concurrences, as well as the implementation of COVID-19 measures during law enforcement operations, enabled continuous operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Enhanced Counter -Narcotics Operations Beginning April 1st, 2020, U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) initiated enhanced counter- narcotics operations in the Western Hemisphere to disrupt the flow of illicit drugs in support of Presidential national security objectives. As a part of this effort, an d in collaboration with DoD, 5 the Coast Guard surged resources that included flight deck equipped cutters, maritime patrol aircraft, and Deployable Specialized Forces comprised of Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDET) with precision marksmen, and Maritime Saf ety and Security Teams (MSST) with surface use of force -capable pursuit teams. In support of the enhanc ed counter narcotics operation, the Coast Guard provided 643 more Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) hours in fiscal year 20 20 than in fiscal year 2019, and 347 more major cutter days in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 . Quality of Perform ance Data The Coast Guard continues to use the CCDB as its source for tracking cocaine movement estimates. The CCDB is the U.S. government's authoritative database for illicit drug movement in the Western Hemisphere. The Coast Guard and other federal government agencies use the CCDB to capture all known and suspected drug movement. During quarterly interagency conferences, CCDB partners develop and reconcile information about the quantity of cocaine flows and removals during drug interdiction operations. CCDB estimates permit the Coast Guard to objectively evaluate its performance. Assertions 1) Performance reporting system is appropriate and applied. The Coast Guard us es prescribed systems and business rules that capture and process performance data accurately and the same analysis parameters are reiterative from year toyear. 2) Explanations for not meeting performance targets are reasonable. The explanations for failing to meet the Coast Guard's performance goal are reasonable and correspond to available resources and the prevailing counter drug trends. 3) Methodology to establish performance targets is reasonable and consistently applied. The meth odology descr ibed above to establish performance targets for 2020 is reasonable given past performance and available resources. 4)Adequate performance measures exist for all significant drug control activities . The Coast Guard re ceived permission from the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to present one metric for all four decision unit lines; Removal rate for cocaine from non- commercial vessels in the maritime Transit Zone. This reflects the intended purpose of the Coast Guard Counter Drug mission.Tab G U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT WASHINGTON, DC 20410 -7000 OFFICE OF COMMUNITY PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT www hud.gov espanol.hud.gov February 1 , 2021 Mr. Jon Rice Deputy Director Office of National Drug Control Policy Office of Performance and Budget Dear M r. Rice : We are providing this letter in response to requirements pursuant to the Office of National Drug Control Circular: National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Review (October 22, 2019). The Department's Continuum of Care Homeless Assistance Grants program supports efforts to elimin ate homelessness by financing local solutions that provide housing and supportive services on a short or long -term basis to those experiencing homelessness. While the Continuum of Care (COC) helps support recovery by providing housing resources, HUD does not have a specific appropriation for drug-related activities. Although a COC can utilize funds to help people with chronic substance abuse, they are not required to do so.

Ther e was a decrease of 1,867 persons projected to be served between 2018 and 2019. QUALITY OF PERFORMANCE DATA HUD recently updated its data collection efforts across CoCs to improve the ability for HUD and CoCs to understand performance across their enti re CoC - not merely at the project level. HUD has collected data across the entire CoC for over three years now. This effort has improved the understanding of performance across an entire CoC and has resulted in higher data quality at the project level. CoCs are required to report their data quality information (such as, null and missing values in fields) to HUD and data quality benchmarks are included in the annual CoC Program competition to incentivize higher data quality. Also, for CoC -funded project s, HUD switched its data collection system to one that requires project recipients to upload their data from their local Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS). Previously, project recipients manually entered their data into our reporting system w hich took time and allowed for more opportunities for error. Data quality is improved because the new upload process does not accept imported data that has obvious errors. If an import of data is not accepted, the system alerts the recipient to the specif ic areas of concern and the recipient is required to update their local HMIS information to ensure the data are accurate. HUD is confident that this process has forced recipients to clean up their data, resulting in better data at the CoC level and nation ally.

Tab H United States Department of the Interior BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS Washington, DC 20240 SENT VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL - NO HARD COPY TO FOLLOW MEMORANDUM To: Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Performance Budget Coordinator From: Director, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Office of Justice Services Subject: ONDCP Summer Drug Budget and Performance Submission In accordance with ONDCP Circular : Budget Formulation, October 22, 2019 , the U.S. Department of the Interi or, Bureau of Indian Affairs hereby submits the attach ed report relaying the BIA Summer Budget Request to the Department of the Interior. The BIA budget does not include additional fun ding to increase the BIA's level of effort addressing the opioid epidemic as ONDCP recommended to Secretary Bernhardt in its transmittal letters accompanying 2022 ONDCP Formulation Guidance. When formulating its budget BIA protected the 2021 PB level of e ffort for BIA drug enforcement programs, but other priorities precluded proposing increases, including standing up the Task Force on Missing and Murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives established by President Trump in November 2019 through Executive Order 13898 which is a Tribal priority. Please note, t he amounts displayed were re -baselined as a result of Congressional language contained on page 58 of Senate Report 116 -123 to the FY 2020 Department of the Interior appropriations bill. The language r emoved a previous Opioid Initiative designation on $3.0 million that is recurring annual funding distributed to local BIA and tribally operated law enforcement agencies. Absent the designation, BIA cannot certify that the $3.0 million is spent solely on dr ug enforcement activities , thus the amount is not reflected in the budget table . If you have questions, please contact Charles Addington, Director, BIA - Office of Justice Services at (202) 208-5787 . Attachment Federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement organizations to ensure we are leveraging the full capabilities of multi -jurisdictional task force programs. The amounts displayed above were re -baselined as a result of Congressional language contained on page 58 of Senate Report 116 -123 to the FY 2020 Department of the Interior appropriations bill. The language removed a previous Opioid Initiative designation on $3.0 million that is recurring annual funding distributed to local BIA and tribally operated law enforcement agencies. Absent the designation, BIA cannot certify that th e $3.0 million is spent solely on drug enforcement activities. The BIA summer budgets did not include performance targets for budget year 2022. The following changes have been made to 2020 BIA drug performance measures, targets, or data since the pr evious budget submission to OMB: 2020 targets have been established for performance measures 1 and 4.

In addition, BIA collects and analyzes monthly drug and crime reports provided by each tribal and direct service law enforcement agency. b)Financial Systems - The BIA utilizes the FBMS financial system to determine spending by costcenter for drug control efforts. (3) Application of Drug Methodology The BIA asserts that the drug methodology described above was the actual methodology used to generate the accounting table provided. (4) Material Weaknesses or Other Findings NA (5) Methodology Modifications NA (6) Reprogrammings or Transfers NA (7) Fund Control Notices The BIA asserts that the data presented are associated with obligations against a financial plan that fully complies with ONDCP requirements. This submission follows the requirements for alternative reports allowed under the Unreasonable Burden Exception in Section 10 of the Circular. The Director, BIA - Office of Justice Services, attests that the Bureau's drug control obligations are under $50 million, and full compliance with the Circular would constitute an unreasonable reporting burden. Pursuant to the Unreasonable Burden Exception, the alternative report meets the statutory requirement to provide an annual accounting of funding obligations and performance associated with BIA drug control activities. ___________________________________ __ 2/9/2021___ Director, BIA Office of Justice Services Date JASON O'NEALDigitally signed by JASON O'NEALDate: 2021.02.09 Law Enforcement Special Initiatives; the Indian Police Academy; Tribal Justice Support; Program Management; and Facilities Operations and Maintenance. Within BIA's Law Enforcement sub activity, funding is provided for initiatives involving drug enforcement. Ensuring the safety of tribal communities is at the heart of Indian Affairs' law enforcement mission and fully supports the Secretary's commitment to the protection of Indian Country. In FY 2020, $11.919 million supported drug enforcement efforts that allowed BIA Drug Enforcement Officer's (DEOs) to manage investigations and implement interdiction programs focused on reducing the effects of drugs and related crime in Indian Country. The activities performed by DEOs include: eradicating marijuana cultivation; conducting criminal investigations; directing criminal surveillance operations; infiltrating drug trafficking networks; confiscating illegal drug supplies; and establishing and maintaining cooperative relationships with other Federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement organizations in the efforts against drug-related activity. Although FY 2020 increases were received for new agents, getting new agents hired and trained will take until late to FY 2021. New hires producing additional cases and seizures should be expected then. During the year, $1.0 million in funding continued to support the School Resource Officer (SRO) program, which has proven to be an important part of the OJS drug initiative. SROs provide instruction in drug awareness and gang resistance, using nationally recognized and adopted curriculum to educate students on the negative aspects of illegal drug use and gang activity. The SRO program allows interaction of officers and students in the student's environment, where these SROs play key roles in providing a visual deterrent to and identifying potential threats of school violence. Another $1.0 million was used to fund the Victim/Witness Services (VWS) program, which provides needed support to cooperative witnesses and victims of violent and drug crimes. The protection of witnesses and victims is essential during drug investigations, and VWS can provide this needed attention to victims and witnesses at the local level when ot her resources are not available. Additionally, VWS staff provides guidance to tribes in developing their own VWS programs. VWS also includes an effort to assess existing victim/witness programs and expand them to all BIA law enforcement districts. The 2020 budget also provided $500,000 to support the Intelligence group tasked with intelligence gathering, reporting, and investigative support needed in all parts of Indian Country for assistance in drug investigations. With this component, national, regional, and local threat assessments can be established in real time and presented to law enforcement agencies working on or near Indian Country. Approximately $500,000 of the Indian Police Academy (IPA) budget plays a critical role in BIA drug enforcement efforts as well. Through the academy, BIA provides advanced training courses with content specific to drug enforcement to law enforcement officers that assist in drug investigations throughout the nation. Also, students that graduate from Basic Police and/or Criminal Investigator Training have completed an introduction to drug awareness and investigations component. The requested funding will continue to address the highly visible drug crisis in Indian Country through anti-drug efforts and training for BIA and Tribal officers. MANAGEMENT ASSERTIONS 1. Performance reporting systems are appropriate and applied - The DDE continues to experience challenges gathering accurate data from tribal field programs. Information gathered for this report and the subsequent verification process again highlighted the need for an automated data collection system. In FY 2015 , BIA began utilizing the new DOI IMARS for all BIA direct service programs . This system allows BIA to collect and analyze crime statistics in an automated manner and is reducing our risk of human error by eliminating multiple entry of the same crime statistics. 2. Explanations for not meeting performance targets are reasonable - This year was challenging for all law enforcement within Indian Country. This reporting year, BIA Division of Drug Enforcement was also impacted by the COVID-19 nationwide pandemic. This resulted in numerous tribes closing their reservation boundaries. Like nearly all federal agencies, this change affected how we conducted our daily business. We have seen staff quarantined for their health and the safety of others, in some cases multiple times for 14-day periods. Federal and Tribal courts were also impacted by the pandemic which resulted in modified schedules, delayed caseloads and stopped grand jury hearings. Most jurisdictions continue to limit the intake of prisoners for the safety of other inmates and staff. 3. Methodology to establish performance targets is reasonable and applied - The targets were projected for FY 2020 based upon statistical data reviewed over the past four years in addition to the complexity of new drug trends identified within Indian Country. 4. Adequate performance measures exist for all significant drug control activities- The agency has four (4) acceptable performance measures that adequately cover each of the decision units. Each measure considers the intended purpose of the ONDCP activity. ___________________________________ ____2/9/2021____ Director, BIA Office of Justice Services Date JASON O'NEALDigitally signed by JASON O'NEALDate: 2021.02.09 10:43:00 -05'00'United States Department of the Interior BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT Office of Law Enforcement and Security 440 West 200 South, Suite 500 Salt Lake City, UT 84101 February 4, 2021 Memorandum To: ONDCP Performance Budget Coordinator Office of National Drug Control Policy From: Cassie Sandberg Budget Officer, Office of Law Enforcement and Security Subject: Fiscal Year 2022 Budget and Performance Submission In accordance with ONDCP Circular: Budget Formulation , October 22, 2019 , the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is hereby submitting the attached Budget and Performance Submission for Fiscal Year 2022 . The FY 2022 submission has no significant changes the FY 2021 request. In FY 2022, the BLM will continue to 1) direct significant funding to address large scale marijuana cultivation activities by drug trafficking organizations on BLM -managed public lands in California and Oregon; 2) direct funding to public lands in Idaho, Nevada, Ut ah and other States as needed to combat the expansion of marijuana cultivation activities in those areas; and 3) direct funding to public lands in Arizona, California, and New Mexico to address resource impacts and public safety concerns stemming from mari juana smuggling activities occurring along the Southwest Border.

Under its Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Performance Plan , the Bureau utilizes specifically defined Pr ogram Element designations to calculate and track expenditures associated with its patrol, investigative, and drug enforcement activities. BUDGET SUMMARY . The budget directs resources to the identification, investigation, disruption, and dismantling of marijuana cultivation and smuggling activities on public lands; the seizure and eradication of marijuana plants; and the clean -up and restoratio n of public lands affe cted by marijuana cultivation and smuggling. Resource Protection and Law Enforcement Resource Protection and Law Enforcement Program strategies in support of the National Drug Control Strategy include : (1) directing significant funding to address large scale marijuana cultivation activities by drug trafficking organizations on BLM -managed publ ic lands in Cal ifornia ; (2) directing funding to public lands in Idaho, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, and other States as needed to combat the expansion of marijuana cultivation activities into those areas; and (3) directing funding to public lands in Arizona and New Mexico to address resource impacts and public safety concerns stemming from marijuana smuggling activities occurring along the Southwest Border. Associated activities include: Conducting p roactive uniformed patrol s to deter and detect cultivation activities. Focusi ng on investigations likely to result in the arrest of drug trafficking organization leadership . Utilizing Federal, S tate, and local partners to conduct multi -agency investigation and eradication efforts target ing illegal activities at all levels of drug trafficking organizations.

Establishing interagency agreements, partner ships, and service contracts with State and local law enforcement agencies to support counter -drug efforts on public lands. Partnering with non -law enforcement personnel/entities to rehabilitate cultivation and drug s muggling -related environmental damage in an effort to deter re -use of those areas. PERFORMANCE Introduction Bureau of Land Management - Drug Control Budget and Performance Summary FY 20 22 4 Active participation of BLM law enforcement personnel in Federal, State, and local task forces , including California and Oregon HIDTA task forces , DEA-led Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, and a number of State and local task forces. The BLM is also an active participant on county -level interagency teams focused on marijuana investigations. Prosecution of individuals at all levels of multi -State drug trafficking organizations is disrupting organizational structures and reducing their cultivation and distributio n capabilities. Shifting weather patterns are altering the length of the growing season and the availability of natural water sources. Several State medical marijuana laws provide for the lawful cultivation of marijuana on private lands. Quantities of thi s lawfully cultivated marijuana are known to be diverted to sale for non -medical use. This unlawful sale of legally cultivated marijuana, combined with the public's ability to lawfully cultivate marijuana for personal recreation and medicinal purposes, ma y be altering levels of market supply and demand, thereby prompting fluctuations in the quantity of marijuana being cultivated on public lands. 2)directing funding to public lands in Idaho, Oregon, Nevada, Utah and other States as needed to combat the expansion of marijuana cultivation activities into those areas; and 3)directing funding to public lands in Arizona, New Mexico, and California to addr ess resource impacts and public safety concerns stemming from marijuana smuggling activities occurring along the Southwest Border. Associated activities include: Conducting proactive uniformed patrol to deter and detect cultivation activities. Focusing on investigations likely to result in the arrest of drug trafficking organization leadership. Utilizing Federal, state, and local partners to conduct multi -agency investigation and eradication efforts targeting illegal activities at all levels of drug tra fficking organizations. Collecting and disseminating intelligence among cooperating agencies to maximize interdiction, eradication and investigative efforts.

These efforts included : 1)directing significant funding to address large scale marijuana cultivation activities by drug trafficking organizations on BLM -managed public lands in Ca lifornia ;Management Assertions Performance Reporting System is Appropriate and Applied Since 1998, the BLM has utilized electronic incident reporting systems (i.e., LAWNET, IMARS , ICMS ) to document all law enforcement incidents and activities on public lands, to include drug - related enforcement actions (e.g., marijuana cultivation incidents, marijuana plant s eizures, processed marijuana seizures, etc.) These electronic reporting systems, in combination with incident reporting, review, and data validation requirements established through agency policy, afford the BLM the ability to reliably capture and accurate ly report performance data. Methodology to Establish Performance Targets is Reasonable and Applied Due to the fact there is currently no data on the total number of marijuana plants subject to seizure that are grown in the U nited States , in FY 2016 the ONDCP permitted the BLM to gauge performance using a single measure, specifically \"number of marijuana plants seized.\" Given the significant year -to-year fluctuation seen in public lands marijuana seizures over the past several years, and the number of variables believed to affect large scale public lands cultivation operations, the BLM set its FY 20 20 target at 2% over on the preceding fiscal year's seizure level. Adequate Performance Measures Exist for All Significant Drug Control Activities The BLM has traditionally utilized a single measure (i.e. marijuana seizures) to capture performance considered to be reflective of its respective National Drug Control Program activities. In light of the fact there is currently no data on the total number of marijuana plants subject to seizure that are grown in the United States , the ONDCP permits the BLM to gauge performance using a single measure, specifically \"number of marijuana plants seized.\" In accordance with ONDCP Circular: \"National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews, October 22, 2019\", the BLM is hereby submitting this alternative report of drug control funding and performance for FY 2020. Per the Circular, this report is being submitted in lieu of the standard \"Detailed Accounting Submission and Performance Summary Report\" otherwise required for agencies with drug control obligations of $50 million or greater. The BLM, Director of the Office of Law Enforcement and Security attests that the Bureau's drug control obligations are under $50 million, and full compliance with the Circular would constitute a n unreasonable reporting burden. Eric A. Kriley Director, Office of Law Enforcement and Security and data validation requirements established through agency policy, IMARS provides the NPS with the ability to reliably capture and accurately report performance data. Performance Reporting - Assertions (1) Performance reporting system is appropriate and applied Yes (2) Explanations for not meeting performance targets are reasonable Yes (3) Methodology to establish performance targets is reasonable and consistently applied Yes (4) Adequate performance measures exist for all significant drug control activities Yes SENT VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL - NO HARD COPY TO FOLLOW MEMORANDUM To: Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Performance Budget Coordinator From: Chief, Investigative Services Branch -Law Enforcement, Security and Emergency Services Subject: ONDCP Summer Drug Budget and Performance Submission In accordance with ONDCP Circular: Budget Formulation, October 22, 2019, the U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service hereby submits the attached Summer Budget Request to the Department of the I nterior.

A concurrence of these desirable attributes supports a predictive analysis of where future grow sites may be suitable and/or attempted. b) leveraging recent wildland fire damage to identify previously undetected sites as well as learn and understand some of the historical patterns and infrastructure needs of the growers, and c) deploying resources as part of high visibility patrols to make it as difficult as possible to operate undetected. Monitoring and Detection: with the goal of identifying clandestine activity and adjusting patrols and presence as an effective deterrent, staff are implementing the following techniques and activities: a) deployment of trail cameras and surveillance equipment on remote road and trail systems to monitor activity, b) performing water testing to look for dangerous chemical compounds that are consistent with fertilizer frequently used in grow operations. Based upon geography, staff can then work upstr eam of a positive test to identify the source of the contamination. c) frequent and high visibility patrols to monitors trends, suspicious persons, activity or vehicles, and overall reinforce the \"ubiquitous ranger\" concept. Early Eradication : with the g oal catching clandestine grow operations during their incipient stages and before sites have become well established, staff are implementing the following techniques and activities: a) eradicating sites early in the grow season while plants remain relatively small, sometimes when still in a \"seedling\" state. This not only prevents the possibility of mature plants, but also results in other positive benefits such as reducing damage to fragile soil and terrain types, less water consumption (waste) which thr eatens native vegetation and species, fewer resources required and less risk involved for plant removal, and improved time and cost of site restoration efforts. Rangers are not always able to intercept sites before they become well established, but through aggressive and pro -active techniques we have achieved a significant reduction in the overall number of mature plants indicating forward progress. C. Interdicting the Flow of Drugs across the Physical Borders and into the United States In Washington state, Law Enforcement Rangers continue to work effectively with a variety of state, local and federal partners including: Customs and Border Protection (Border Patrol, Office of Field Operations, Air and Marine Division), Homeland Security Investigations , Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Agency, US Forest Service, Washington State Fish and Wildlife, Washington State Patrol, and local Sheriff's departments to combat smuggling activities that occur along the International Border with Canada. The remote wilderness terrain of the North Cascades Complex makes this an ideal location for clandestine activities given the natural cover and concealment that is available. The efforts of all law enforcement agencies are amplified through joint infor mation and intelligence sharing which guides and directs joint operations as well as organic missions on the ground. Rangers perform patrols by vehicle, vessel, air and on foot to combat both smuggling of methamphetamine moving south and cocaine moving north. In addition to smuggling, the area experiences illegal border crossings into the United States as well as some clandestine cultivation sites. Additional techniques and activities include maintaining remote camera and surveillance systems that monitor a network of high use smuggling areas and routes along the physical border. Performance Reporting (1) Performance Measures Due to the fact there is currently no data on the total number of marijuana plants subject to seizure that are grown in the U.S., the NPS has traditionally utilized a single measure - \"Number of marijuana plants seized in the Pacific West region\" to capture performance considered to be reflective of its respective National Drug Control Program activities.

Once Job Corps students return to campus, drug testing will be reinstated. MATERIAL WEAKNESSES OR OTHER FINDINGS The Department has no information to report for this section. REPROGRAMMINGS OR TRANSFERS The Department has no information to report for this section. OTHER DISCLOSURES The Department has no information to report for this section. PERFORMANCE MEAS URES The Job Corps program performance is outcome oriented, primarily focused on ETA's Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and other agency goals. This program, because of its authorization and appropriation, operates on a program year (PY) basis. Funds appropriated in FY 201 9 are available from July 1 , 201 9 through June 30 , 2020. In PY 201 9, Job Corps provided training to both students and staff on drug -related requirements in the workplace, including employer drug testing policies and the effects of drug and alcohol use on employability. Since Job Corps is not a drug -treatment program, its measures are not r elated to drug education program success. The table s below include selected Job Corps performance measures, targets and achievements related to education, and employability for the most recent program year s for which data are available. The percent of students tested for drugs upon entry to campus is 100%. Job Corps provides drug testing to every new enrollee to ensure adherence to the Job Corps Zero Tolerance policy, relating to drugs and violence. 78% of students are placed in employment, military or higher education at exit. This is Job Corps' primary performance measure on how successfully Job Corps' academic education, career technical training and social skills development programs have influenced students' progression towards labor market participation. It is one of the common measures used by all the training programs in ETA. 8 The $974,000 and 5 FTE provided i n FY 2020 was used to manage the acquisition and use of Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) services. PBM services implemented drug controls that improved the safety, quality, and cost -effectiveness of prescription care provided to claimants across the four agency programs. Additionally, the drug controls offered by a PBM reduced the costs of treatment to all federal agencies covered by the FECA, and for other OWCP programs as well. This initiative continues to support the PMA priority of sharing quality s ervices. This initiative enabled the program to approve medically appropriate use of opioid medication and provide beneficiaries assistance in transitioning to alternative treatments as appropriate. Decreasing opioid use has assisted in return -to-work eff orts for instances where medication usage limits activity, leading to greater savings on wage -loss compensation payments. It will also assist the program in certifying the necessity of payments made for medical treatment under the FECA.

UNCLASSIFIED -2- UNCLASSIFIED Please reach out if you have any questions. Sincerely, Erin M. Barclay Executive Director Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Attachments Tab 1) INL Accounting and Authentication of Drug Control Funds and Related Performance Report Tab 2) INL FY 2022 ONDCP FY 2022 ONDCP Summer Budget and Performance Summary Report ** The FY 2020 level is an estimate based on FY 2019 levels that does not reflect decisions on funding priorities. Allocations are not yet available for the enacted FY 2020 appropriation. Section 6(b). Assertions Section 6(b)(1 ). Timeliness of Summer Budget Submission I assert tha t INL submitted the summer drug budget to ONDCP for FY 2022 under the attached cover letter provided in response to section 6.a.(1) in response to ONDCP Circular: Budget Formulation, section 9.a.(1) was provided to ONDCP at the same time the request being submitted to superiors in accordance with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703 (c)(1)(A). Section 6(b)(2 ). Funding Levels Represent Bureau- Level Request I assert the INCLE funding request submitted to ONDCP provided in section 6.a.(2) of this circular represent the funding levels in the budget submission made by the bureau to the Department without alteration or adjustment by any official at the Department . SECTION 7. Detailed Accounting Report The Department is providing a Detailed Accounting Report on the drug control program obligations of the Bureau of Internationa l Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) in accordance with Section 7(a) of the ONDCP Circular: National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews . The Detailed Accounting Report consists of this report , which includes (a) a table highlighting prior year drug control obligations data , and (b) a narrative section making assertions regarding the prior year obligations data. Section 7(a). Drug Control Funding Obligations Section 7(a)( 1). Table of Prior Year Drug Control Obligations The followi ng table presents the obligations of the drug control budgetary resources appropriated and available in FY 2020 by Drug Control Function and Budget Decision Unit. Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Drug Control Obligations ($Millions) FY 2020 Actual Drug Resources by Drug Control Function * International 618.680 Total 618.680 Drug Resources by Decision Unit International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) 618.680 Total 618.680 Total INCLE Budget 2,976.573 * Includes total of all FY 2020 obligations for all fiscal years. Section 7(a)(2). Drug Methodology The Department' s accounting system tracks obligations through a combination of the appropriation , point limitation, function code, allotment code, and project code. This arrangement separates all the drug control obligations being reported from other funds managed by INL. The accounting reports reflect net negative amounts when obligations and their associated expenditures and deobligations occur in different fiscal years. Thus, all expenditures and deobligations that occurred in the current year (FY 20 20) that are associated with original obligations that occurred in a prior year (e.g. , FY 201 9), woul d result in a negative obligation. The report required in Section 6.a. Summer Budget Formulation Information Submission requests the Drug Personnel Summary. Section 7(a)( 3). Methodology Modifications There were no modifications to the drug methodology from the previous year. Section 7(a)(4). Material Weaknesses or Other Findings The Department received an unmodified (\"clean\") audit opinion of its FY 2020 Financial Statements , with no material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting identified by the Independent Auditor. The Department maintains a robust system of internal controls that are validated by senior leadership. For FY 2020, no material weaknesses in internal controls were identified by senior leadership and no material weakne sses in internal controls over financial reporting were identified by the Senior Assessment Team or the Management Control Steering Committee. As a result, the Secretary was able to provide reasonable assurance on the effectiveness of the Department's over all internal controls and the internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act. Section 7(a)(5). Reprogrammings or Transfers For this reporting period, INL and the Department processed a total of 20 reprogramming actions that resulted in a net increase of drug- related budgetary resources during FY 2020 by a total of $55,823,900, comprising an increase of $78,457,000 and a decrea se of $ 22,633,100 in FY and FY 2019 INCLE and INCLE -OCO funds . This net increase is based on reprogramming actions between the drug -related program areas, i.e., C ounternarcotics (PS.3) and the non-drug -related program areas, i.e., Transnational Threa ts and Crime (PS.4), Citizen Security and Law Enforcement (PS.9), and Rule of Law (DR.1) . All reprogramming instances for FY 2015 and 2019 are delineated in the table below. The \"Source Program\" and \"Recipient Program\" column s show the country or regional operating unit affected by the reprogramming and the \"Program Area\" and \"Amount \" column s reflects whether that country gained (\"to PS.3\") or lost (\"from PS.3\") Counternarcotics funds. Section 7(a)(6). Other Disclosures All drug rel ated reprogramming actions are included in the table above, however the Department is only required to obtain approval from ONDCP for actions that exceed $5,000,000 or 10 percent of the program requirements. There are no other disclosures to report .

Obligations by Budget Decision Unit I assert that o bligations reported by budget decision unit are the actual obligations from the bureau's accounting system of record for these Budget Decision Units. Section 7(b)(2 ). Drug Methodology I assert that t he drug methodology used to calculate obligations of prior year budgetary resources is reasonable and accurate, that the data presented is complete and reliable, and that the financial systems supporting the drug methodology yield data that fairly present, in all material respects, aggregate obligations presented in the Table of Prior Year Obligations. Section 7(b)(3 ). Application of Drug Methodology I assert that t he drug methodology disclosed in Section 7 (a)(2) was the actual methodology used to generate the table required by Section 7(a) (1), that the calculations are sufficiently documented to independently reproduce these data, and the calcu lation provides a means to ensure consistency of data between reporting years. Section 7(b)(4 ). Material Weaknesses or Other Findings I assert that al l material weaknesses or other findings by independent sources, or other known weaknesses which may affect the presentation of prior year drug -related obligations as required by Section 7.a.(4) have been disclosed. Section 7(b)( 5). Methodology Modifications I assert that no modifications were made to the methodology for reporting drug control resources from the previous year's reporting. Section 7(b)(6). Reprogrammings or Transfers I assert that the data presented are associated with obligations against a financial plan that was approved by ONDCP for all drug- related resources in accordance with their policy to approve counternarcotics -related reprogramming actions above $5,000,000 or more than 10 percent of the program . This is in addition to other reprogramming actions that do not require ONDCP approval included in the table in section 7(a)(5). Section 7(b)( 7). Fund Control Notices ONDCP did no t issue any Fund Control Notices to the Department in FY 2020. SECTION 8. Performance Summary Report The performance data for Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)'s attestation on the reduction of illegal narcotics such as the number of Poppy Free and Poppy Reducing Provinces in Afghanistan, hectares of c oca in Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and our Drug Demand Reduction program (DDR) ,which seeks to professionalize the drug prevention, treatment and recovery workforce through the development and dissemination of evidence -based trainings and technical assistance. The data captured and provided in this report is collected either on a calendar year (CY) basis or by fiscal year (FY). In the case for Afghanistan, the number of Poppy Free and Poppy Reducing Provinces in Afghanistan, is collected and measured by fisca l year (FY). The Hectares of Coca Eradicated in Colombia and Peru, in addition to the hectares of opium poppy cultivated in Mexico and increasing the number of credentialed professionals over prior year totals for our Drug Demand Reduction program, are collected and measured on a calendar year (CY) basis. This presents some challenges when trying to provide data for the most recent Fiscal Year (FY), which is FY 2019 for the purposes of this report. Section 8 (a) Performance Reporting: Afghanistan Sectio n 8 (a)(1). Performance Measures Measure Descrip tion: Reduce cultivation of opium poppy in Afghanistan by increasing the number of Poppy -Free Provinces and Provinces Reducing Cultivation. Purpose of t he program: Afghanistan consistently produces over 80 percent of the world's opium. Anti- government actors derive significant financial benefit from poppy cultivation, production, and trafficking. Narcotics -derived revenue increases corruption, undercuts the licit economy, damages trust in public inst itutions, and creates a major health crisis. Domestic drug use severely undermines Afghanistan's economic growth and societal development. Utilizing new and existing funding, INL's counternarcotics program in Afghanistan addresses these issues through a ho listic combination of supply side and demand side programming, including interdiction, alternative development, drug demand reduction, public information, and capacity building. INL programs reinforce Afghan government effectiveness and increases pressure on the insurgency by denying revenue generated from the illicit narcotics trade. Contribution to National Drug Control Strategy: The program contributes to the National Drug Control Strategy's goal of collaborating with international partners to disrupt the drug trade by partnering with the Afghan government to support interdiction and eradication, build institutional capability , support economic alternatives to drug cultivation, and promote collaborative efforts in prevention, treatment, and research, thereby assisting global partners in acquiring the capabilities to overcome the consequences of drug abuse. How is this me asure outcome -oriented? The measure tracks the number of Poppy Free Provinces and Provinces Reducing Cultivation in Afghanistan , which can be a reflection of the Afghan government 's capacity to reduce illicit crop cultivation , drug trafficking, and drug consumption , thereby disrupting a key source of funding to the insurgency and promoting security and governance in Afghanistan. Afgha nistan's poppy crop is quite large and its farmers respond to price signals e.g., planting less when the market is glutted. How is this me asure used by program managers? This measure is used as a general guide in annual program planning and targeting, by program managers focusing on reducing cultivation UNCLASSIFIED 2 NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 2022 Budget and Performance Summary improve foreign government institutional capabilities to implement their own comprehensive national drug control plans that will reduce trafficking in illicit drugs and money laun dering activities. Training and assistance also supports drug use and demand reduction, prevention and treatment programs , and projects designed to increase public awareness of the drug threat to strengthen the international coalition against drug trafficking. INL's aviation program assists with drug crop eradication, surveillance, and counterdrug enforcement operations. Projects funded by INL are also directed at sustainably improving foreign partners' capabilities in law enforce ment and intelligence ga thering, increased drug interdictions; effective investigations, prosecutions , and convictions of major narcotics criminals; and breaking up major drug trafficking organizations. These activities enable foreign governments to serve as stronger partners wi th U.S. law enforcement and criminal justice agencies in investigating and prosecuting transnational crime. INL is responsible for foreign policy formulation and coordination to advance diplomatic initiatives in counternarcotics and transnational crime in the international arena. Methodology The Department of State - through INL - supports c ounter drug activities through foreign assistance appropriated f or the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) foreign assistance account and, where appropriated for such purposes, the Assistance for Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia (AEECA) account. The Department allocates all foreign assistance funding according to the Foreign Assistance Standardized Program Structure. INCLE and INL- implemented AEECA resources are allocated to achieve the Peace and Security and the Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance program objectives. Within the Peace and Security objective, INCLE and INL-implemented AEECA resources support the Civilian Security a nd Law Enforcement , Counternarcotics, and Transnational Threats and Crime program areas. The Department scores as drug control everything that is allocated under the Counternarcotics program area. INL track s the performance activity of various programs a cross the world that are either counternarcotics programs or have other direct or indirect links to the counternarcotics capacity of that host nation. Budget Summary In the FY 2022 Bureau Resource Request, the Department requested from the FY 202 1 Request of $427.289 million . In support of the President's agenda that prioritizes the well -being of Americans, bolsters U.S. national security, secures our borders, and highlights U.S. economic interests, the FY 20 22 INCLE request concentrates resources where they offer the most value and impact to U.S. national security priorities. INCLE resources for counternarcotics will focus on programs that directly de ter the flow of illegal drugs, including fentanyl and other opioids as well as cocaine , to the United States. To this end, Colombia remains INL's top priority with particular focus on supporting the Colombian government's integrated eradication program. In addition to Colombia, INL's major drug control priority remains addressing the opioid epidemic . In 2018, more than 46,802 drug overdose deaths in the United States involved an opioid. Two out of three opioid -involved overdose deaths involved a synthet ic opioid such as fentanyl and more than 15,000 deaths UNCLASSIFIED NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 2022 Budget and Performance Summary 3 involved heroin. INL leads the Department's contribution to the Comprehensive Opioid Crisis Response Initiative through INL's Drug Supply Reduction program . These programs address national security i nterests and align with long -term strategic goals to build the capacity of partner nations . Other INL funding that is not specifically designated for counternarcotics supports and reinforces this mission. Strong criminal law enforcement and justice systems are essential to counternarcotics efforts and in minimizing transnational crime. In addition to traditional counternarcotics activities, such as disrupting the overseas production and trafficking of illicit drugs, INL supports the developm ent of capable police and competent judicial officials. In order for counternarcotics efforts to be sustainable, the United States must support effective partner state criminal justice systems. Similarly, minimizing transnational crime requires both spec ialized assistance and the overall development of criminal justice systems. Programs Western Hemisphere Colombia the FY 2021 request . Colombia remains the world's largest producer of cocaine and the source of approximately 92 percent of the cocaine seized in the United States. In March 2018, the United States and Colombia agreed to a joint goal to reduce coca cultivation and cocaine production to 50 percent of 2017 levels by the end of 2023. In support of this strategic goal, INCLE assistance will continue to help Colombia combat the nearly 330 percent increase in potential pure cocaine production from 2012 to 2017 by supporting implementation of Colombia's whole -of-government counternarcotics strategy, which was released in December 2018. The strategy outlines actions to reduce growing domestic consumption, decrease the supply of drugs, dismantle criminal organiza tions, and disrupt illicit financial flows and features a crosscutting pillar that seeks to increase state presence and economic opportunity in poor, rural areas where criminal organizations and coca cultivation thrive. INL supports implementation of Colombia's counternarcotics strategy on multiple fronts, including interdiction, eradication, countering financial crimes, counter ing transnational organized crime (TOC) , rural security, and efforts to strengthen Colombia's capacity to investigate, prosecute, convict, and incarcerate criminals. FY 2022 INCLE funds will increase support for the Colombian integrated eradication efforts, including support for institutional capacity building through strategic planning, training, equipment, and operational suppor t for manual eradication. Funds may also support a targeted, Colombian -led aerial eradication effort in the event the Colombian government resolves the legal prohibition on the aerial application of glyphosate on coca. Funds will continue to maintain and improve the interdiction capacity of Colombian security forces through support to maritime, land, air, and riverine interdiction operations; investigations and intelligence; and at Colombian ports of entry. Programs will focus on combating drug trafficki ng to and along Colombia's Pacific and Atlantic coasts from which most of Colombia's U.S. -bound drugs depart via maritime routes. To meet a dynamic narcotics threat UNCLASSIFIED 4 NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 2022 Budget and Performance Summary that is increasingly shifting from rural to urban environments, funds will also continue to support land interdiction operations and capacity building, including for the Colombian National Police (CNP) Antinarcotics Directorate (DIRAN). Efforts include training, equipment, infrastructure, and operational support. Given Colombia's vast and rugged geography and poor road infrastructure, aviation support will remain a crucial element in supporting manual eradication and interdiction efforts, as well as backing up the expansion of the police presence in former conflict zones. Assistance to th e joint INL-Colombian Police Aviation (Area de Aviaci\u00f3n - ARAVI) program, which supports a fleet of U.S.- and Colombian -titled aircraft in Colombia, enables eradication, interdiction, and law enforcement efforts throughout Colombia, by providing aviation training, technical assistance, and commodities. Efforts include support for the development and operation of an aviation intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability to detect and monitor coca cultivation and eradication and support other law enforcement requirements. INL will also continue to support an increase in Colombian capacity to investigate and prosecute other crimes, with a n exus centered on drug production and trafficking, illegal mining and logging, and other illicit drug -related issues. INL will continue to support targeted, evidence- based public health approaches designed to prevent and reduce drug use among children, ado lescents, and young adults, as well as support professionalization of Colom bia's drug treatment system. Funds may also be used to continue support for Colombia's effort to establish a drug court system. Mexico from the FY 2021 request of $20.0 million. INL's strategic objective in Mexico is to reduce national security threats to the United States posed by transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) that traffic illicit drugs, undermine border security, and fuel corruption. The FY 2022 Request for U.S. assistance supports our partnership with Mexico to stem the opioid crisis, as well as to achieve the objectives under the President's Executive Orders on \"Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements\" (E.O. 13767) and \"Enforcing Federal Law With Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations and Preventing International Trafficking\" (E.O. 13773). Heroin -related overdose deaths in the United States increased five- fold since 20 10 to over 15,000 deaths in 2018. Mexico remains the primary source of heroin and methamphetamine seized in the United States and is a strategic partner for addressing global proliferation of synthetic drugs. There were 31,000 deaths involving synthetic opioids (other than methadone) in the United States, which is more deaths than from any other type of opioid. Synthetic opioid -involved death rates increased by 10 percent from 2017 to 2018 and accounted for 67 percent of opioid -involved deaths in 2018. The FY 2022 r equest for counternarcotics activities in Mexico will strengthen Mexico's capacity to disrupt the business model of TCOs and reduce the production and trafficking of heroin, UNCLASSIFIED NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 2022 Budget and Performance Summary 5 fentanyl, methamphetamine, and other illicit drugs. Funds will train and equip Mexican law enforcement and security agencies to identify and dismantle clandestine drug laboratories; disrupt the production of drugs including through improved opium poppy eradication and the interdiction of precursor chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl and other drugs. The FY 2022 r equest complements Mexico's own counternarcotics investments and builds on efforts to address national security priorities for the United St ates. Projects along the U.S. -Mexico border will complement existing U.S. interagency collaboration at key ports of entry by supporting synchronization of training and technology for Mexican officials with their U.S. counterparts at key ports and targeted areas between the ports of entry. The FY 2022 request will focus on improving coordination between U.S., Mexican, and regional law enforcement and security institutions to counter shared transnational threats. Peru from the FY 2021 request of $37.9 million. Peru is the second largest producer of cocaine and cultivator of coca in the world. Peruvian cocaine is transported to South American countries for domestic consumption or for onward shipment to the United States, Mexico, Europe, and East Asia. Supporting Peru in combatting the production and sale of illicit narcotics is essential to U.S. national interests, as threats from transnational criminal networks affect U.S. and Pe ruvian security. INCLE assistance supports the Government of Peru's multi -prong ed counternarcotics strategy that includes eradication, interdiction, and alternative development. The majority of the FY 20 22 request for Peru will remain focused on counternarcotics. The increase of f unds will provide operational support for the labor -intensive manual eradication program managed under Peru's Coca Monitoring and Reduction Agency (CORAH), in particular as the government of Peru commits to increased eradication and interdiction efforts in the high yield areas of the Valley of Apurimac, Ene, Mantaro Rivers (VRAEM) and Puno. These regions present not only security risks but are difficult to access as they are remote and jungle terrain . INCLE funds also cover personnel, infrastructure, and logistical assistance required to provide air support for eradication, interdiction, and other law enforcement operations, including training for pilots, aircrews, and additional pe rsonnel needed to operate and maintain a fleet of U.S. government -owned Huey -II helicopters and fixed -wing aircraf t. INCLE funds are essential to reduce transnational criminal activity by enhancing the capacity of Peruvian Customs, Police, Immigration, an d others to interdict and deter the smuggling of narcotics, bulk currency, humans, precursor chemicals, and illegally mined gold. Funds will be used for training and field exercises designed to enhance the capabilities and operational effectiveness of these units. Limited support is also provided to the Government of Peru to increase efforts to prevent and reduce drug use among vulnerable populations. UNCLASSIFIED 6 NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 2022 Budget and Performance Summary State Western Hemisphere Regional - Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) relative to the 2021 request of $1.561 million. The FY 2022 r equest for counterdrug activities in the Caribbean includes funds to combat illicit narcotics through the provision of training, equipment, and subject matter expertise, including on maritime and land -based interdiction, vetted units, and investigations. Resources will continue to be used for activities in the Caribbean countries with the highest drug flows , such as the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the Bahamas. INL programs will address U.S. national security concerns by promoting regional cooperation on the shared threat of TOC and drug trafficking. Activities will facilitate information sharing, joint operations, and coordination among CBSI partne r nations. State Western Hemisphere Regional - Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) the FY 2021 request . CARSI INCLE funding addresses the security -related drivers of migration from Central America and combats drug -trafficking, TOC , gangs, and human smuggling before it reaches the U.S. border. The FY 2022 r equest will provide targeted training and advisors f rom the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), other U.S. government agencies, and INL subject matter experts to build intelligence and interdiction capacity of partner country vetted units and specialized task forces. These units and task forces are comprised of the most highly qualified members of the law enforcement and justice sector and they conduct specialized investigations in areas such as counternarcotics, gangs, bulk cash smuggling, human trafficking and smuggling, extortion, corruption, and money laundering. To reduce narcotics usage and narcotics - related crime, assistance will support training, prevention, alternative sentencing, s chool resource officers, and treatment programs to address growing drug use throughout Central America, in particular among gang members and at -risk youth. CARSI programming will strengthen the capab ility of Central American coast guards, border patrols, and police units, as well as support specialized maritime and mobile interdiction units, bolstering coordination regionally. Efforts include training riverine police units and specialized naval inter diction services, providing spare parts and boat maintenance, retrofitting seized boats, providing equipment and logistics support to sea - and land -based interdiction forces, and supporting maritime and land interdiction advisors to strengthen partner coun try capacity for operations and ensure sustainability through self -maintenance. CARSI expects to continue to provide advisory support for maritime law enforcement and maritime interdiction investigations and prosecutions through a regional United States C oast Guard program. State Western Hemisphere Regional - Emerging Opportunities the FY 2021 request , and if approved, a new line item in the State WHA Regional budget . UNCLASSIFIED NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 2022 Budget and Performance Summary 7 INL will establish a new regional line to respond to emerging needs and opportunities in the region. For example, there may be an opportunity to re -establish counternarcotics engagement with the new government of Bolivia , which is the third largest coca producer i n the world, a major transit zone for Peruvian cocaine. This could also position the United States as the partner of choice over malign influences, particularly China which has significant economic interests in Bolivia. INL engagement would prioritize actions to re -engage with key Bolivian criminal justice sector actors and enhance public discourse on narcotics and crime issues; enhance Bolivian capabilities to conduct law enforcement operations, investigations, and prosecutions of narcotics, corruption, and TOC cases; enhance coordination with U.S. law enforcement partners; and increase narcotics seizures and ongoing eradication operations. This new regional line may also support other emerging priorities in the region, including work in the Tri -Border region of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. South and Central Asia Afghanistan from the FY 2021 request of $23.0 million . Afghanistan consistently produces over 80 percent of the world's opium. Anti- government actors derive significant financial benefit from poppy cultivation, production, and trafficking. Narcotics - derived revenue increases corruption, undercuts the licit economy, and damages trust in public institutions. Domestic drug use severely undermines Afghanistan's economic growth and societal development as well. According to the 2015 Afghanistan National Drug Use Survey , conducted by the U.S. Department of State and the Afghan Ministry of Public Healt h Institutional Review Board, 11 percent of Afghan istan's rural population uses drugs, one of the highest drug use rates in the world. INCLE funding in FY 2022 will support, , holistic counternarcotics programming to reinforce Afg han government effectiveness and increase pressure on the insurgency by denying revenue generated from the illicit narcotics trade. INL partners with the DEA and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to build the capacity of the Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan (CNPA), with a special focus on the specialized units \u2014 the Sensitive Investigative Unit (SIU) and the National Interdiction Unit (NIU). Evidence gathered by the SIU's wire intercept unit through court -ordered surveillance operations supports hundreds of drug trafficking cases brought to the Counter Narcotics Justice Center each year. Our support will bolster the ability of specialized units to perform independent operations nationwide, targeting the production and trafficking of opium, heroin , and methamphetamine, with a focus on Afghan -led, warrant -based operations. INL also supports on -going efforts to promote alternatives to poppy cultivation , messaging campaigns to raise public awareness about the threat of illicit narcotics to Afghanistan, and is transitioning responsibilit y for drug treatment centers to the Government of Afghanistan. As always, INL aims to maximize return on its funding by leveraging its efforts with interagency partners and other like- minded international don ors. UNCLASSIFIED 8 NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 2022 Budget and Performance Summary The FY 2022 r equest for counterdrug activities in Pakistan focuses on initiatives that improve regional stability, combat transnational crime, and advances U.S. national security interests by supporting efforts to combat the production and trafficking of illicit narcotics in the world's largest opium producing region. Pakistan continues to face challenges in countering large flows of opiates originating from Afghanistan to meet demand in major markets around the globe. INL's counternarcotics program develops the capab ility of Pakistan's counternarcotics law enforcement agencies, such as the Anti -Narcotics Force (ANF) and Customs, to disrupt narcotics trafficking. INCLE assistance will be targeted towards Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and their newly merged districts (i.e. t he former FATA), and Balochistan, to combat trafficking along the Afghanistan - Pakistan border and Makran Coast. Interdiction assistance directly supports the Administration's South Asia Strategy by denying revenue to militant groups that pose direct threats to U.S. forces serving in Afghanistan. The FY 2022 r equest will primarily support interdiction efforts by providing training, mentorship, equipment, and material support in coordination with the DEA. It will also support bolstering law enforcement agencies' presence along Pakistan's porous border and maritime channels to prevent Afghan -sourced opiates from enter ing global markets. Additionally, resources will be used to enhance Pakistan's capability to conduct cross -border operations and stem illicit financial flows. In the long -term, INL seeks to improve Pakistan's capacity to stem large -scale drug trafficking, and increase the number of arrests and successful prosecutions of major traffickers. INL also supports decreasing the demand for drugs through training for drug treatment and prevention professionals, standardization of drug treatment and prevention thr oughout Pakistan through direct government assistance, and drug treatment facilities that provide outreach and rehabilitation to addicts. Furthermore, INL supports reducing drug supply through promoting alternatives to poppy cultivation to include agricul tural training, seed donations, and targeted infrastructure support . Central Asia Regional from the FY 2021 r equest . Organized criminal groups often operate with impunity across Central Asia, trafficking narcotics and using the proceeds to further their illicit activities. Some p rofits from drug trafficking fund terrorist organizations in the broader region and some regional drug trafficking organizations maintain links to these extremist groups. INL's counternarcotics programming seeks to disrupt the illicit narcotics economy through law enforcement cooperation in order to deter, disrupt , and dismantle drug trafficking organizations. Funding enables the U.S. DEA to support and expand highly specialized units, interagency drug task forces, intelligence- led investigations, and regional cooperation , such as through the Central Asia Regional Information and Coordination Ce nter (CARICC), a seven -member body that serves as a hub for operational drug and crime intelligence UNCLASSIFIED NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 2022 Budget and Performance Summary 9 sharing with counternarcotics units both inside and outside the region, and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC )/World Customs Organization Container Control Program. East Asia and the Pacific Burma from the FY 2021 request. Burma is the third largest illicit opium poppy cultivator in the world and is t he largest producer of amphetamine -type stimulants (ATS). ATS produced in Burma is flooding the Indo- Pacific region and destabilizing communities. U.S. assistance will continue to support the Government of Burma's ability to interdict and investigate drug trafficking, production, and cultivation through training, technical assistance, and non -lethal equipment donations primarily through the U.S. DEA. This assistance has been credited by the Government of Burma for recent seizures, including Asia's largest seizures to date that occurred from late February to early April 2020. Indonesia from the FY 2021 request . The Indonesian government faces challenges in ensuring cross -border cooperation on counternarcotics, due to extensive and porous maritime borders and a large number of ports. The FY 2022 request will provide specialized technical training and equipment to counternarcotics officers to increase their ability to investigate drug -trafficking cases and to combat narcotics and precursors trafficking. U.S. assistance will also increase the Government of Indonesia's ability to reduce demand and rehabilitate drug users. Philippines the FY 2021 r equest of $600,000. The Philippines faces serious problems related to drug abuse and drug trafficking. In 20 19 Philippines President Duterte continued to implement a domestic antidrug campaign that has resulted in widespread allegations of human rights abuses and extrajudicial killings. Given concerns over these allegations and the need for engagement on the dema nd side, the United States is providing assistance for drug demand reduction at a slightly reduced level due to an increase in funding for rule of law programs, which focus on systemic issues with the justice system . U.S. assistance supports Philippine ef forts to reduce drug demand by strengthening drug prevention, treatment, and recovery services, as well as evidence- based policy development. Programs may provide training and professionalization of the treatment workforce across all sectors, provide mentorship and technical assistance to expand treatment capacity and community - based rehabilitation resources, strengthen drug prevention education, and support community anti-drug coalitions. The funds may also support counternarcotics projects focused speci fically on transnational interdiction, such as units focused on drug trafficking across international borders. Laos UNCLASSIFIED 10 NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 2022 Budget and Performance Summary the FY 2021 requ est of $500,000. Laos is the fourth largest producer of illicit opium poppy in the world, and a major transit route for methamphetamine, amphetamine -type stimulants, and precursor chemicals across mainland Southeast Asia. In addition to record levels of drug trafficking , the level of d rug abuse in Laos has skyrocketed. U.S. assistance will continue to support drug demand reduction programs that aim to improve the quality of drug treatment services . The reduction in counternarcotics funding is due to an increase in law enforcem ent fund s and border security funds, which , through police professionalization and enhanced border controls, will help combat narcotics trafficking in Laos . The funds may also support counternarcotics projects focused on interdiction by adding a coutnernarcotics element to broader border security projects. Africa State Africa Regional - West Africa Regional Security Initiative (WARSI) the FY 2021 r equest FY 2022 request for counternarcotics will support West African countries ' ability to disrupt and combat drug trafficking. West Africa serves as a transshipment point for drugs including marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine from South America, heroin fr om Southwest Asia, pharmaceuticals (e.g. tramadol) as well as precursor chemicals to markets in Europe and a lesser extent the United States. INL funds , to include the increase, will be used to provide training, technical assistance, and material/equipment support to enable key West African countries to disrupt drug trafficking networks through effective and efficient land and maritime seizures, investigations, and criminal prosecutions; support specialized units (e.g. in Benin, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Senegal, and Sierra Leone); and promote information sharing with U.S. law enforcement agencies like DEA and the U.S. Coast Guard. Centrally Managed INL Programs Interregional Aviation Support the FY 2021 r equest. With FY 2022 funds, INL will continue to provide core -level services necessary to operate a fleet of fixed - and rotary -wing aircraft supporting INL 's aviation activities in Panama, Costa Rica, and temporary locations . Interregional Aviation Support will provide safe, professionally operated and maintained aircraft that support eradication, interdiction, surveillance, and reconnaissance efforts. Aircraft will also provide other support such as transportation of personnel and cargo, search and rescue, medical evacuation, and security . Drug Demand Reduction (DDR) the FY 2021 r equest. With FY 2022 funds, INL will support demand reduction programming that has been validated through outcome evaluations to reduce drug use, drug -related crime, violence, and gang activity, UNCLASSIFIED NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 2022 Budget and Performance Summary 11 while strengthening security. INL's programs improve the effectiveness of drug treatment by professionalizing the workforce with training that disseminates effective methods to prevent and reduce drug use and related violence. The program utilizes an inn ovative training model that holistically develops the government, university and civil society workforce through training, mentoring and a universal examination and credentialing system. Training materials, which have also been adopted by U.S. universitie s, will target opioid addiction and overdose reversal, intravenous heroin use that leads to increased prevalence of HIV/AIDS, cocaine use (especially crack addiction among juveniles), methamphetamines, rising adolescent drug use, drug use within criminal g angs and recovery systems . INL will support the implementation of the International Standards to Treatment to improve the quality of services along with training the addictions workforce through innovative online tools and mentoring programs. A consorti um of international experts and medical universities develop and pilot test psycho- social and pharmacological (for detoxification) protocols and related training curricula, and provide follow -up, on -site technical assistance. INL will also support effect ive drug-free communities coalition programs (in Mexico, Latin America, Asia, and Africa) that bring citizens together to prevent and reduce drug use and crime among youth. Coalitions connect multiple sectors of the community (businesses, parents, media, law enforcement, schools, and government) to collaborate and develop plans, policies, and strategies to achieve reductions in the rates of drug use and crime at the community level. Drug Supply Reduction (DSR) the FY 2021 r equest. Funds will support global and regional programs to combat and reduce illicit supplies of drugs, particularly synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, and precursor chemicals that are fueling the deadly U.S. opioid crisis. The funds will support Adm inistration priorities to stop opi oid abuse and reduce drug s upply. Programs will build the capacity of foreign partners to share information on emerging drug threats; accelerate the imposition of treaty -mandated international d rug and chemical controls on dangerous substances; support multilateral and partner -nation efforts to disrupt global illicit drug and precursor chemical supply chains; develop tools and the capacity to disrupt sales of illicit drugs over the internet and b etter detect and interdict illicit supplies of drugs distributed through the global mail and express consignment courier systems. Funding will also support the development of programming designed to build partner capacity to target investigations into the use of virtual currencies in illegal synthetic drug sales and support ongoing U.S. interagency efforts to synchronize global anti -money laundering responses with those targeting the illicit financing methods fueling online drug trafficking. Additionally, the funds will support new projects to identify industry leaders in responsible management practices to prevent the manufacture, sale, and movement of synthetic drugs and export best practices to developing countries. Global Crime and Drugs Policy (GCDP) (previously \"International Organizations\" ) the FY CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 2022 Budget and Performance Summary INL has mobilized large multilateral forums to react quickly to the U.S. opioid crisis, including the threat posed by illicit fentanyl and its analogues. The global rules for all cross -border law enforcement cooperation to prevent, investigate, prosecute, and dismantle drug trafficking and transnational crime groups are codified under the three UN drug treaties, the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), and the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), all of which are based on U.S. law and practice. INL's GCDP funding to UNODC and the Organization of American States (OAS) will provide unique support for international treaty -based and policy -making institutions that are critical to ensuring foreign governments carry out their legal o bligations and policy commitments. The FY 2022 request for counterdrug programs will continue assistance to UNODC and the OAS Inter -American Drug Abuse Control Commission (OAS/CICAD) . Broadly, UNODC and the OAS deliver technical assistance programming that protects U.S. citizens by enabling greater operational cooperation between international law enforcement agencies and strengthens foreign government capacity to dismantle drug trafficking and transnational crime groups and seize their assets. OAS p rogramming promotes information exchange on trafficking routes and drug sample identification, as well as monitoring the impact of international controls and international cooperation to reduce illegal drug supplies, a critical effort in addressing the U.S. opioid challenge. Programs through UNODC and the OAS also enhance international cooperation among states to help eliminate safe havens for TCOs , and enable greater burden -sharing through contributions from a wider array of donors. Activities under this line item are limited to global and regional programs that enable UNODC and the OAS to operate a network of field offices and central Secretariat services; ensure internal accountability and oversight; and deliver technical guidance, research, and analysis on treaty and policy obligations in the field of drug control and TOC . Support to UNODC and the OAS under this line item benefits all other INCLE line items that utilize on these institutions to deliver U.S. foreign assistance at the country, regional, and global levels. Program Development and Support In the FY 2021 CBJ, INL requested to centralize its program development and support ( PD&S ) reporting lines into a single PD&S budget, allowing INL to readily and quickly respond to th e Administration's priorities. INL's FY 2022 budget request reflects the consolidation of all PD&S into the central PD&S budget. This will allow INL to be much more responsive to the Administration's priorities as well as urgent and emerging needs arou nd the world. By consolidating the Bureau's PD&S, INL will have increased flexibility to administer and oversee programmatic requirements as well as receive accelerated access to the funding. This initiative will also allow INL to be able to positively r espond to changes in the field and provide increased flexibility to continue operating and fund the administrative costs required to properly manage the Bureau, under changing and evolving conditions. The level of PD&S for counternarcotics is proportionate UNCLASSIFIED 14 NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 2022 Budget and Performance Summary look to begin a 5 -year demonstration project in one country to evaluate the effects of various drug demand reduction programming. Andean Programs Purpose of the Program: The long -term goal of INL's counternarcotics efforts in Colombia and Peru is to reduce the number of hectares of coca under cultivation, thereby reducing the supply of processed cocaine that is shipped to the United States. The program accomplishes this through support for integrated eradication efforts, including manual eradication; increased drug interdiction; and strengthening rule of law and alternative livelihood efforts. Eradication is a critical component of the U.S. government's counternarcotics strategy in the Andean region and is a metric used by managers to handle day -to-day operations. Contribution to National Drug Control Strategy: The program contributes to the National Drug Control Strategy's goal of collaborating with international part ners to disrupt the drug trade by working with international partners to reduce illicit drug use, production, trafficking, and associated violence. How is this measure outcome -oriented? INL program managers in the field use this measure for operational planning and day -to-day program management. The eradication measure is available daily rather than six months following the close of the calendar year, allowing managers the flexibility to adjust program operations to meet annual targets. Furthermore, th e measure conforms to Department policy regarding standardized performance metrics for foreign assistance programs. How is this measure used by program managers? INL program managers in the field use this measure for operational planning and day -to-day p rogram management. The eradication measure is available daily rather than six months following the close of the calendar year, allowing managers the flexibility to adjust program operations to meet annual targets. Furthermore, the measure conforms to De partment policy regarding standardized performance metrics for foreign assistance programs. CY 2018 Performance Target: Colombia's 2018 performance target for manual eradication by the Ministry of Defense was set at 50,000 hectares. Additionally, Colomb ia expected to eradicate 20,000 via the crop substitution program that originated from the peace agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC. The total eradication goal for Colombia was 70,000 hectares. The 2018 eradication target for Peru wa s 25,000 hectares. CY 2018 Performance Results: The government of Colombia eradicated a total of nearly 85,000 hectares in 2018, exceeding its goal by more than 20 percent and demonstrating the dedication of the police, military, and civilian eradicators to achieving results. Peru's manual eradication of illicit coca has prevented significant amounts of cocaine from reaching global markets, denying profits to TOC on the global and regional scale. Peru's eradication operations for 2018 went from February through December 2018 and exceeded the goal by eradicating 25,106.67 hectares. UNCLASSIFIED NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 2022 Budget and Performance Summary 15 CY 2019 Performance Target: The overall 2019 eradication performance target for Colombia was set at 100,000 hectares, including 80,000 hectares through manual eradication by the Ministry of Defense. The 2019 eradication target for Peru remained at 25,000 hectares. Afghanistan Purpose of the Program: The purpose of the program is to build the capacity of the Afghan government to reduce illicit crop cultivation, drug traffick ing, and drug consumption in order to disrupt a key source of funding to the insurgency and promote security and governance during and beyond transition in Afghanistan. Contribution to National Drug Control Strategy: The program contributes to the Nati onal Drug Control Strategy's goal of collaborating with international partners to disrupt the drug trade by partnering with the Afghan government to support interdiction and eradication, build institutional capability, support economic alternatives to drug cultivation, and promote collaborative efforts in prevention, treatment, and research, thereby assisting global partners in acquiring the capabilities to overcome the consequences of drug abuse. How is this measure outcome -oriented? The measure tracks the number of Poppy Free Provinces and Provinces Reducing Cultivation in Afghanistan, which is a reflection of the Afghan government's capacity to reduce illicit crop cultivation, drug trafficking, and drug consumption, thereby disrupting a key source of funding to the insurgency and promoting security and governance in Afghanistan. How is this measure used by program managers? This measure is used as a general guide in annual program planning and targeting, by program managers focusing on reducing cu ltivation throughout Afghanistan. CY 2018 Performance Results: The goal was for 15 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces to be poppy - free and for an additional 10 provinces to reduce cultivation by 10 percent. The number of Poppy Free Provinces (PFP) was 13, K apisa, Takhar, and Samangan all gained poppy -free status. There were 21 Province Reducing Cultivation (PRC). Over half of the total national cultivation occurred in Helmand province, with a cultivation of 90,727 hectares. The UNODC Afghanistan Opium Survey states that opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan covered 163,000 hectares, which represented a 38 percent decrease from the 263,000 hectares recorded the previous year. Potential opium production remained level at 6,400 tons. A total of 21 hectares of verified poppy eradication was carried out under the Governor -Led Eradication (GLE) program, representing a decrease of 95 percent, when 406 hectares of poppy were eradicated. CY 2019 Performance Target: Eradication efforts have had no impact on curbing opium -poppy cultivation. The Afghan government has struggled to perform eradication due to the security challenges in poppy -growing areas, namely that these areas are predominantly under Taliban control. This year, the MCN's dissolution coincided with the eradication -planning period, leading UNCLASSIFIED 16 NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 2022 Budget and Performance Summary to minimal eradication in FY 2019. No eradication took place in Helmand, the highest poppy - cultivating province in Afghanistan. Demand Reduction Drug consumption represents a threat to the future of Afghanistan. The country faces a significantly higher rate of domestic illicit narcotic use. Drug consumption drains human capital, placing a burden on civil society and social services. Addressing drug use in Afghanistan also serves a counter -insurgency mission by deny ing revenue to the insurgents and safeguarding a vulnerable segment of the population that is prone to exploitation. Drug demand -reduction programs also rescue the vital human capital that will be needed to build a self -sustained public and private sector for generations to come. Since 2003, outcome evaluations of INL's treatment training program have consistently shown that the targeted user population that remained drug -free exceeded the goals established by the U.S. National Drug Control Strategy. The training programs that were evaluated were highly successful in transferring knowledge to treatment providers and the techniques learned were implemented with a high degree of fidelity, resulting in efficiently operated treatment centers that delivered hi gh quality services. It has also been hypothesized that treatment is more effective based on time spent in treatment. An independent study of INL -funded treatment programs was released in 2015 by the Government of Afghanistan's Ministry of C ounternarcoti cs in collaboration with the UNODC. The study interviewed a total of 465 former clients of INL programs in Kabul, Nangarhar, Badakhshan, Balkh, Herat, and Kandahar provinces, 30 days after completing treatment. More than 95 percent of these clients were opiate users. At the 30 -day post-treatment period, 70 percent of the clients (i.e. 326 clients) were drug- free, exceeding the target goal of 15 percent. Although many treatment and recovery facilities established in Afghanistan show great promise, the 2015 Afghanistan National Drug Use Survey conducted by the Department of State and the Afghan Ministry of Health Institutional Review Board found an 11 percent drug positive rate in Afghanistan.

INL met these goals during FY2019 with the following results: 163,000 hectares of illicit crops cultivated, 213 DEA/NIU operations, 311 key narcotics arrests, 226,385 kilos of illicit narcotics seized, 27 INL-supported drug treatment centers in Afghanistan. Evidence gathered by the SIU's wire intercept unit through court -ordered surveillance operations supported hundreds of drug trafficking cases brought to the INL -supported Counter Narcotics Justice Center each year. Our support bolstered the ability of specialized units to perform independent operations nationwide, targeting the production and trafficking of opium, heroin, and methamphetamine, with a focus on Afghan- led, warrant -based operations. INL also supported on -going efforts to promote alternatives to poppy cultivation, messaging campaigns to raise public awareness about the threat of illicit narcotics to Afghanistan, and continued transitioning responsibility for drug treatment centers to the Government of Afghani stan. As always, INL aimed to maximize return on its funding by leveraging its efforts with interagency partners and other like -minded international donors. Section 8 (a) (3). Current Year Performance Target CY 2020 Perform ance Target: INL has set t he following targets for FY2020: 134,400 hectares of crops cultivated, 120 DEA/NIU operations, 150 key narcotics arrests, and 60,000 kilos of illicit narcotics seized. The status of ongoing Intra -Afghan Negotiations may impact INL performance targets. Section 8 (a)( 4). Quality of Performance Data Data Collection and Validation: Data Source: Inte rdiction numbers are provided to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration by the Afghan Specialized Units. All other data comes from implementing partners, including UNODC. Methodology for S etting Targets and Reporting Results: The out -year target shows an increase from actual 2017 results . The deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan continues to create obstacles for achieving the yearly target ; nevertheless , INL believes that greater engagement from Department of Defense enablers combined with possible decrease in farm -gate prices after four consecutive high -yielding harvests, keep out -year targets within reach. Process for V alidating Performance Information: The UNODC Afghani stan Opium Survey is released approximately at the end of each year and is used to inform U.S. counternarcotics policy and programmatic decision making . There is an oversight and management board for this survey, convened jointly by UNODC and two Afghan government entities. The trends and data in the UNODC survey are compared against the official U.S. government estimate published by the Office of Natio nal Drug Contro l Policy in late winter or early sp ring of each year. In a previous su bmission the figure of 163,500 ha of illicit poppy cultivated (the correct figure is 163,000 ha) appears to be a transcription error. The figure of 317 DEA/NIU operations conducted (vice 213) appears to be the result o f a transposition with the figure for 2019 arrests \u2014 vice operations reported in 20 KABUL 630, attached. DEA does not track a category of \"narcotics seized\"; the figure supplied to ONDCP is the sum total of a number of different types of seizures including heroin, morphine, opium, hashish, and methamphetamine. DEA reported seizures of Oman bush, a methamphetamine precursor, went from \"negligible\" in FY 2018 and prior years to 124 metric tons in FY 2019, which could have skewed the figures. Moving forward, INL will footnote the \"narcotics\" figures to specify their constituent parts i.e., heroin, morphine, opium, hashish, methamphetamine, and marijuana (if any). Section 8 Cont inued Performance Reporting: Peru Section 8 (a)(1). Performance Measures Measure Descrip tion: Peru eradication data is provided by the Government of Peru's Special Project for Control and Reduction of Illegal Crops in the Alto Huallaga (CORAH). Data in Peru is collected per calendar year. Purpose of t he program: The long -term goal of INL's counternarcotics efforts in Peru to reduce the availability of illicit drugs in the United States is to reduce the number of hectares of coca under cultivation, encouraging the Peruvians to eradication in high yield coca areas such a Puno and the Valley of Apurimac, Ene, and Mantaro Rivers, thereby reducing the supply of processed cocaine that is shipped to the United States. The program accomplishes this through a strategy of support for the labor intensive manual eradication efforts, increased drug interdiction; and strengthening rule of law to counter transnational criminal organizations. A key aspect in INL Lima's s upport is funding the personnel , infrastructure, and logistical assistance required to provide air support for eradication, interdiction, and other law enforcement operations. Contribution to National Drug Control Strategy: The program contributes to the National Drug Control Strategy's goal of collaborating with international partners to disrupt the drug trade by working with international partners to reduce illicit drug use, production, trafficking, and associated violence. How is this me asure outcome -oriented? Coca eradication data comes from the Government of Peru's eradication agency, CORAH, and totals incl ude the amount of coca leaf that is manually eradicated. The government of Peru collects this data throughout the year and reports the annual results at the end of the calendar year. Eradicating coca under cultivation, reduces the supply of processed co caine that is shipped to the United States and other parts of the world. How is this me asure used by program managers? INL program managers in the field use this measure for operational planning and day -to-day program management. The eradication measure is available daily rather than six months following the close of the calendar year , allowing managers the flexibility to adjust program operations to meet annual targets. Furthermore, the measure conforms to Department policy regarding standardized performance metrics for Foreign Assistance programs . Section 8 (a) (2).

In CY 2019 Peru's performance results showed that the Peruvians uprooted more 25, 526 ha of illicit coca plants, removing an estimated 220 metric tons (MT) of potential cocaine from the illicit market - or 40 percent of Peru's estimated cocaine production potential. After more than a decade of strong U.S. advocacy, the Peruvian government on November 1 started to eradicate coca for the first time in the VRAEM and slashed 7,000 ha in Puno. Eradication in Puno alone accounted for half the total potential cocaine eliminated in 2019, 110 MT. Section 8 (a)(3). Current Year Performance Target CY 2020 Performance Target: The COVID- 19 pandemic has greatly affected Peru, which has some of the world's highest infection and death rates. After months of quarantine, the Minister of Interior in early September formally authorized eradication to resume. Peru's plans for 2020 are 5,400 ha but we'll have a better idea at the end of the calendar year on what is able to be accomplished. Section 8 (a)(4). Quality of Performance Data Data Collection and Validation: Data Source: Coca eradication data comes from the Government of Peru's eradication agency, CORAH. Totals are based off of the total hectares of coca leaf manually eradicated. Methodology for Setting Targets and Reporting Results: The embassy country teams consult subject area experts in Washington and in the field and consider past performance and trends, policy priorities and long term goals, relevant conditions on the ground, and resource levels in setting perf ormance targets. The targets are set and results are reported for each country in the Foreign Assistance Performance Plan and Report. The results are also reported in the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report and are aggregated in Washington for the purposes of performance reporting to other stakeholders. The government is responsible for setting their annual eradication goals; INL supports these goals once they are established. Process for Validating Performance Information: Eradication data provided by embassies is the best data available to the U.S. government regarding host gove rnment coca eradication. INL receives this data from embassies and it is our understanding that this information has undergone a Data Quality Assessment (DQA) and is accurate, complete, and unbiased. Section 8 Continued Performance Reporting: Colombia Section 8 (a)(1). Performance Measures Measure Description: This performance measure tracks the amount of coca leaf that is forcibly or voluntarily eradicated in Colombia annual basis. The coca cultivation metric is the number of hectares eradicated. Purpose of the program: The long -term goal of INL's counternarcotics efforts in Colombia is to reduce the availability of illicit drugs in the United States by decreasing the number of hectares of coca under cultivation, thereby reducing the supply of processed cocaine that is shipped to the United States. The program accomplishes this through a strategy of support for integrated eradication efforts, including manual eradication and increased drug interdiction Contribution to National Drug Control Strateg y: The program contributes to the National Drug Control Strategy's goal of collaborating with international partners to disrupt the drug trade by working with international partners to reduce illicit drug use, production, trafficking, and associated violence. How is this measure outcome -oriented? Coca eradication data comes from the Government of Colombia and totals include voluntary and involuntary eradication and crop substitution. The Government of Colombia reports and collects this data throughout the year and reports annual results on a calendar year basis. How is this measure used by program managers? INL program managers in the field use this measure for operational planning and day -to-day program management. The eradication measure is available da ily rather than six months following the close of the calendar year , allowing managers the flexibility to adjust program operations to meet annual targets.

CY 2019 counternarcotics performance results showed that Colombia exceeded the goal, destroying more than 104,000 hectares of coca through forced eradication and crop substitution in 2019, surpassing its overall eradication target by more than 4,000 hectares. Section 8 (a)(3). Current Year Performance Target CY 2020 Performance Target: The Colombia performance target goal for CY 2020 is for 130,000 hectares of coca to be eradicated. Section 8 (a)(4). Quality Performance Data Data Collection and Validation: Data Source: The data for complied for Colombia's coca eradication statistics is derived from three sources. The first source is (1) forced manual eradication, (2) land tiling, and finally (3) National Comprehensive Illicit Crop Substitution Program, known as PNIS. In an effort to support the eradication of coca in partnership with the Colombian Government, INL directly funds forced eradication, while indirectly funding land tiling and the PNIS crop substitution program. Coca eradication data comes from the Government of Colombia and totals include voluntary and involuntary eradication and crop substitution. Data related to voluntary eradication through the National Comprehensive Illicit Crop Substitution Program, known as PNIS, is reported by UNODC, in collaboration with the Government of Colombia. Methodology for Setting Targets and Reporting Results: The embassy country team consults subject area experts in Washington and in the field and consider past performance and trends, policy priorities and long term goals, relevant conditions on the ground, and resource levels in setting performance targets. The targets are set and results are reported for each country in the Foreign Assistance Performance Plan and Report. The results are also reported in the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report and are aggregated in Washington for the purposes of performance reporting to other stakeholders. The government of Colombia is responsible for setting its annual eradication goals; INL supports these goals once they are established. Process for Validating Performance Information: Eradication data provided by embassies is the best data available to the U.S. government regarding host government coca eradication. INL receives this data from embassies and it is our understanding that this information has undergone a Data Quality Assessment (DQA) and is accurate, complete, and unbiased. Section 8 Continued Performance Reporting: Mexico Section 8 (a)(1). Performance Measures Measure Description: To date the United States and Mexico have not set defined, measurable counternarcotics targets . Within the Office of the Prosecutor General (FGR), the National Center for Planning, Analysis, and Information to Combat Crime (CENAPI) publishes drug eradication and seizure statistics for civilian law enforcement agencies in Mexico. INL tracks Mexico's counternarco tics measures to include: o According to CENAPI, in the second half of calendar year 2019, Mexico eradicated 7,626 ha of opium poppy. o Also during the second half of 2019, Mexico reportedly seized 9.1 metric tons (MT) of cocaine (a 25 percent decrease compared to 2018); 349 kg of opium gum (73 percent increase); 18.45 MT and 8,700 liters of methamphetamine (7 percent increase); 275 kg of heroin (43 percent decrease); 45 clandestine drug laboratories (13 fewer than 2018); and 189,422 pills of fentanyl. o Durin g the first six months of 2020, Mexico reported it eradicated 9,963 ha of opium poppy - a 30 percent increase compared to 2019. Also during the first six months of 2020, Mexico seized 11.4 MT of cocaine (a 25 percent increase compared to 2019); 40.21 kg of opium gum (88 percent decrease); 10,947 liters of methamphetamine (25 percent increase); 198 kg of heroin (28 percent decrease); 26 clandestine laboratories (19 fewer than 2019); and 152 kg of fentanyl. Mexico does not have a reliable comprehensive reporting system for eradication and seizure data. The United States continues to work with the Government of Mexico to establish protocols for reporting all seizures to Mexico's central data repository for crime statistics in CENAPI to improve national data collection on illicit drug seizures. The Mexican government demonstrated progress in 2020 on measuring poppy cultivation, yield, and eradication through programs supported by the United States through the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). T he Mexican Army (SEDENA) engaged U.S. government agencies to enhance its counternarcotics capacity in 2020 and increased use of, but has not yet fully maximized, a U.S.-funded poppy eradication verification program. On March 26, the Government of Mexico and UNODC published the results of the Mexican - funded MEXK -54 poppy monitoring project for 2017 to 2018. The report covers estimated cultivation area of poppy fields, the opium gum yield and production estimates, and morphine concentration in the opium gu m. According to the report, between 2017 and 2018, poppy cultivation in Mexico was reduced by 9 percent compared to the previous period of 2016 to 2017. T he yield estimate of opium gum was 16.1 kilograms per hectare harvested. The concentration of morphine in the opium gum production was 16.2 per cent. INL donated technical equipment and provided logistical support for Mexican government participation in the study to advance a shared understanding of the Mexico's heroin production challenges. Purpose of the program: Mexico remains the primary source of heroin and methamphetamine used in the United States and is a transit country for cocaine from Colombia. Mexico also faces risk from criminals' emerging ability to produce illicit fentanyl domesti cally. INL supports Mexico's efforts to eradicate poppy, dismantle clandestine drug laboratories, control precursor chemicals used to produce illicit drugs, and interdict drugs before they enter the United States. INL seeks to support Mexico's effective implementation of its counternarcotics strategy and, over the long term, to help Mexico increase its ability to conduct counternarcotics operations, collect evidence, and use that evidence in court to bring transnational criminal organizations to justice. Contribution to National Drug Control Strategy: INL's counternarcotics programming contributes to the National Drug Control Strategy line of effort to reduce the availability of illicit drugs in the United States by building Mexico's capacity to reduce drug cultivation and production. How is this measure used by program managers? Once the United States and Mexico set outcome measures, program managers in the field will track and use data to inform program plans and monitor impact of assistance. Section 8 (a)(2) Prior Years Performance Targets and Results Decision Unit 1: International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement Measure 4: Mexico hectares of opium poppy cultivated Table 4 CY 2015 Actual CY 2016 Actual CY 2017 Actual CY 2018 Actual CY 2019 Target CY 2019 Actual CY 2020 Target 44, 100 hectares poppy cultivated 41,800 hectares poppy cultivated Not defined. 30,400 hectares poppy cultivated Not yet defined. CY 2019 Performance Results: Mexico passed asset forfeiture reforms, increased extraditions of dangerous drug traffickers to the United States, made progress in completing its first poppy yield study in 17 years (as part of MEXK -54), expanded detection of fentanyl precursor chemicals at internation al key international mail facilities, and produced a counterdrug strategy. Mexico's poppy eradication program is not yet tied to sustainable alternative development. Section 8 (a)(3). Current Year Performance Target CY 2020 Performance Target: Determining bilaterally agreed upon counternarcotics performance targets requires continued engagement with the Government of Mexico to reach agreement. For example, a prospective goal to see Mexico cut poppy cultivation in half by 2024 (from 30,400 hectares in 2019 to 15,200 hectares in 2024), could be a measure of improved strategic poppy eradication using intelligence and validated data, but to date the United States and Mexico have not set a defined cultivation target. The United States continues to address drug policy goals through the bilateral High -Level Security Working Group and will pursue agreement on performance measures based on verifiable data for reducing poppy cultivation; reducing production and improving interdiction of heroin, methamphe tamine, fentanyl, and cocaine; securing borders and ports against trafficking of illicit goods; prosecuting illicit finance; and reducing impunity for transnational crime. Section 8 (a)(4). Quality Performance Data Data Collection and Validation: Data Source: UNODC, Host Government - Current poppy cultivation estimates come from ONDCP, which in calendar year 2019 was estimated at 30,400 hectares; poppy eradication estimates come from the Government of Mexico. INL supports UNODC verification studie s of Mexico's poppy (MEXW -34) and poppy cultivation its fourth MEXK -54 study, for 2017 - 2018, in March 2020. Methodology for Setting Targets and Reporting Results: Once Mexico shares verified eradiation data, the United States and Mexico can set targets against which to report results. Section 8 Continued Performance Reporting: Drug Demand Reduction Section 8 (a)(1). Performance Measures Measure Description: Increase the number of credentialed drug treatment professionals globally based on the number of professionals that have passed the Colombo Plan's Global Centre for Credentialing and Certification (GCCC) International Certified Addiction Professional (ICA P) exams, compared with the prior year number. Purpose of the program: INL's drug demand reduction program seeks to professionalize the drug prevention, treatment and recovery workforce through the development and dissemination of evidence -based trainings and technical assistance. Research confirms that the use of evidence- based practices in prevention, treatment and recovery support results in better drug use outcomes for those in need of services as well as contributes to reductions in crime and violence. Similar to other professional fields, drug demand reduction -related certification, licensing, and credentialing are tools used to determine knowledge, skill, and experience. Training and credentialing increase the ability of professionals to deliv er the best interventions to achieve positive outcomes. With the limitations of COVID INL will focus on remote proctoring in order to continue credentialing treatment, prevention and recovery workers across the health and criminal justice systems primaril y in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Contribution to National Drug Control Strategy: This program contributes to the National Drug Control Strategy's goal of collaborating with international partners to promote evidence - based practices for drug preventi on, treatment, and recovery efforts for persons with substance use disorders to reduce drug use as well as associated drug related crime and violence. How is this measure outcome -oriented? INL supports the development and training of professionals in prevention, treatment and recovery efforts. The number of credentialed professionals is the outcome that reflects the effectiveness of the trainings, through an exam process where individuals are tested on their knowledge and skills in order to secure the credential. How is this measure used by program managers? INL has access to GCCC's database, which captures the number of credentialed drug treatment, prevention and recovery professionals on a real time basis so that managers can track the progress towards professionalizing the workforce needed to reduce drug use. Access to this information informs INL decision making about what additional programming is needed to support reductions in drug use in countries INL is working with. Section 8 (a)(2). Prior Years Performance Targets and Results Decision Unit 1: International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement Measure 5: Drug Demand Reduction: Increase the number of credentialed professionals over prior year totals. Table 5 CY 2015 Actual CY 2016 Actual CY 2017 Actual CY 2018 Actual CY 2019 Target CY 2019 Actual CY 2020 Target - - - - 15% 29% 15% CY 2019 Performance Results: The performance target was achieved for 2019, with an increase of 29 percent from 1293 total credentialed professionals in 2018 to 1715 total credentialed professionals at the end of 2019. (Note this is different from ONDCP Sep report of 1671 totaled pr ofessionals in 2019 and now takes into account final examinations that were validated at the end of 2019) In 2019, 63 countries, from primarily Latin America, Africa and Asia, as well as the United States, participated in the GCCC credentialing of drug tr eatment professionals up from 56 countries in 2018. The number of exam candidates has also grown exponentially in the last four years as more trainings were conducted and those working in the field recognize the value of the credential. In 2019, 28 exams were conducted (up from 26 in 2018) covering all levels of credentialing. For CY 2020 it is anticipated that the target will not be met due to limitation of COVID -19, despite work to move to remote proctoring. Section 8 (a)(3). Current Year Performance Target CY 2020 Performance Target: Increase the number of credentialed professionals by 15 percent per year. Section 8 (a)(4). Quality of Performance Data Data Collection and Validation: Data Source: The number of drug treatment professional who have passed their International Certified Addiction Professional (ICAP) exam during the course of the calendar year are tracked in a database by Colombo Plan's Global Centre for Credentialing and Certification (GCCC). Methodology for Setting Targets and Reporting Results: The target has been set for an increase of 15% in the number of credentialed drug treatment professionals based on the number of exams that can be administered in a year and the pipeline of professionals who qualify to sit for the exam. In order to sit for an exam, a professional must have both a threshold number of training hours completed as well as experience in the field of addiction. INL will re- evaluate the target as INL develops more opportunities for training online and GCCC increases its ability to conduct exams remotely. Process for Validating Performance Information: GCCC provides a year -end total of credentialed professionals to INL by country to measure the percentage increase by year. GCCC also provides the number of exams given for the year. Furthermore, GCCC adheres to a standardized application process documented in an online application form that requires applicants to provide career history, credentials, and submission of training certificates, University transcripts, and other doc uments. Since many of the training certificates are associated with INL -supported Universal Curriculum trainings the completion of the course can be verified by the individual applying for the exam. INL also has ongoing access to the database of the numb er exams given to include the number of participants that have passed the exam by country. Section 8 (b). Assertions Section 8 (b)(1).

January 28, 2021 Regina LaBelle Acting Director Office of National Drug Control Policy Washington, D.C. 20503 Dear Ms. LaBelle: In accordance with the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Circular, National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews, dated October 22, 2019, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is submitting its Budget Formulation Compliance package. In accordance with Section 6 on Budget Formulation Compliance, I certify that USAID's FY 2022 Summer Budget Submission was submitted to ONDCP on a timely basis and that the funding levels therein represent USAID's request provided to OMB on September 14, 2020. Please reach out if you have any questions. Sincerely, Tricia Schmitt Tricia Schmitt Director, Office of Budget and Resource Management U.S. Agency for International Development Enclosures: Budget and Performance Summary Associate Director for Policy, Research and Budget Office of National Drug Control Policy 750 17th Street, N.W. Washington, DC 20503 The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) submits the attached FY 2022 ONDCP Budget and Performance Summary, which represents the Agency's FY 2022 foreign assistance resource request to address counter-narcotics efforts around the world. USAID advances U.S. foreign policy objectives by supporting economic growth, agriculture, trade, health, democracy, conflict prevention, and providing humanitarian assistance. USAID's programs support the U.S. Government's counter-narcotics objectives by helping countries develop economically viable alternatives to coca cultivation. Specifically, USAID implements alternative livelihoods programs that focus on licit job creation, improve commercial agricultural production, and market linkages in drug production-prone areas, facilitate access to financial services for small businesses and farmer associations, and offer farmers incentives to discontinue planting poppy and other illicit crops. USAID also works to improve transportation systems, develop agricultural processing facilities and storage networks, and expand irrigation in targeted areas to create and grow a viable agribusiness industry. This support incentivizes and facilitates participation in the licit economy rather than in illicit drug production, with the objective of reducing the cultivation and production of illicit drugs that contribute to crime and instability in key U.S. partner countries. In the FY 2022 USAID Development Budget, the Agency requested $100.3 million in Economic Support and Development Fund ( ESDF) for drug control activities, an increase of $21.3 million from the FY 2021 President's Budget Request of $79.0 million. The FY 2022 USAID Request for Colombia will continue to target the flow of illicit drugs to the United States by supporting implementation of the 2016 peace accords. Assistance will strengthen legal economies in rural, conflict-affected areas by increasing the competitiveness of licit producers and the value of licit products. These efforts will include catalyzing public and private sector investments in key regions and strengthening farmer producer associations, cooperatives, rural microcredit organizations, agricultural enterprise value chains, and facilitating market linkages. Support for expanded land titling will provide additional incentives for participation in the licit economy. Programming will also help former combatants' and conflict victims' social reintegration into their community, further reducing the appeal of illicit activities. Close collaboration with the U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC) will deepen results and sustainability of counter-narcotics efforts in Colombia. In Peru, the FY 2022 USAID Request will refocus USAID's alternative development programs from farmers in areas with prior success and expand into new geographic areas, as well as continue to leverage greater resources and buy-in from Peru's private and public sectors to sustain reductions in coca cultivation. USAID is leveraging $100 million in private sector investments, linking hundreds of communities harvesting alternative crops with private supply chains, and catalyzing increased lending and financial services in post-eradication areas. Key performance indicators that USAID Missions and implementing partners in Colombia and Peru have tracked over several years are: hectares of alternative/licit crops under cultivation, dollar value of sales generated by supported agricultural producers, and number of benefiting individuals/households. USAID Missions' annual performance reports have noted sustained performance in recent fiscal years, while also highlighting contextual and other factors limiting expansion of these results. The most recent annual performance report covering FY 2019 results, compared to targets for the same time period, are included in the attached Budget and Performance Summary. In keeping with the Department of State and USAID's annual performance reporting schedule, in December 2020, Colombia and Peru will consolidate and report on FY 2020 results data and establish FY 2021 targets. These data, along with completed and ongoing independent evaluations of USAID's alternative development programs, will be used to assess progress and make adjustments as needed. We are committed to plan and execute an efficient and effective drug control budget within a constrained budget environment. We look forward to working with you on the FY 2022 ESDF Drug Control budget request and please reach out if you have any questions. Sincerely, Tricia Schmitt Director, Budget and Resource Management U.S. Agency for International Development UNCLASSIFIED offering farmers incentives to discontinue planting poppy and other illicit crops. USAID also works to improve transportation systems, develop agricultural processing facilities and storage networks, and expand irrigation in targeted areas to create and grow a viable agribusiness industry. This support incentivizes and facilitates participation in the licit economy rather than in illicit drug production, with the objective of reducing the cultivation and production of illicit drugs that contribute to crime and instability in key U.S. partner countries. METHODOLOGY For programs related to counter-narcotics, USAID receives appropriated foreign assistance funds from the Economic Support Fund and Development Assistance accounts. Consistent with the FY 2020 and FY 2021 Requests, the FY 2022 Request eliminates the DA account and provides economic and development assistance through a new, consolidated Economic Support and Development Fund (ESDF) account that replaces the ESF account. In preparing the annual foreign assistance budget request, the USAID and the Department of State allocate all funding according to the Foreign Assistance Standardized Program Structure, which contains a Program Area for counter-narcotics. All USAID-managed counternarcotics programming is for alternative development and alternative livelihoods programs, which support economic development that is not reliant on the cultivation, production, and sale of illicit drugs. BUDGET SUMMARY The FY 2022 USAID Request level for drug control efforts , million from the FY 2021 Request. The Economic Support and Development Funds (ESDF) - Andean Region Colombia The The FY 2022 USAID Request for Colombia will continue to target the flow of illicit drugs to the United States by supporting the transition to peace. Countering illegal drugs in Colombia is a difficult challenge since although the overall amount of cocaine seized in Colombia during the last few reporting periods increased, the increase in the overall cocaine production outpaced these gains. However, in geographic areas where USAID counternarcotics programming has intervened, there has been proven success in sustaining low levels of coca production. Assistance will continue to fund programs to improve the conditions necessary for inclusive, licit, rural economic growth\u2014an important counterpart to the Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) counternarcotics programs. Geographically, USAID programming will concentrate on post-conflict areas and advance implementation of the peace accord that was ratified in 2016. Assistance will strengthen legal economies in rural, conflict-affected areas by increasing the competitiveness of licit producers and the value of licit products. Funding will support Government of Colombia initiatives to2 NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 2022 Budget and Performance Summary UNCLASSIFIED better integrate security and alternative livelihood programs to further reduce drug production, consolidate security, promote licit economic alternatives, ensure more equitable and secure land tenure, increase public and private investment, and improve economic infrastructure in target regions. These efforts will include catalyzing public and private sector investments in key regions and strengthening farmer producer associations, cooperatives, rural microcredit organizations, agricultural enterprise value chains; and facilitating market linkages. Peru The FY 2022 Request of from the FY 2021 Request of $27.0 million. The Government of Peru (GOP), along with coordinated assistance from the United States Government, has been able to sustain reductions in the numbers of hectares of coca in large swaths of Peru's central jungle through a three-pronged approach focusing on alternative development (AD), eradication, and interdiction. Once a community gives up coca, USAID's AD programs complement the GOP's efforts to help farmers acquire the assets, skills, and basic services needed to become part of the licit economy (e.g., new crops, improved roads, farming knowledge, and improved local governance). In line with leveraging Peruvian resources, USAID has progressively transferred many aspects of AD assistance to the GOP , including negotiating post-eradication assistance agreements with communities that give up coca, and delivering on those plans. In time, USAID links assisted farmers with higher value markets by helping them secure the volume and quality demanded by buyers and credit to invest in their farms.

Performance Summary Report Decision Unit: The Andean Region - 6 - ANDEAN PERFORMANCE SECTION OF THE FY 2020 ACCOUNTING REPORT Measure I: Number of families benefiting from alternative development (AD) activities in USG-assisted areas (Peru) (1) Describe the measure: This measure applies to Peru. Our objectives are achieved as families and communities in target areas adopt an integrated and sustainable development model built on viable licit economic opportunities. This indicator helps track progress toward that end. (2) Discuss performance results for FY 2020: In partnership with the Government of Peru (GOP) and private sector actors, USAID has scaled up its assistance to help thousands of families transition out of the drug trade and into the licit economy. USAID is in the midst of phasing out assistance to consolidated areas (where licit development has taken root and families are unlikely to return to coca cultivation), and shifting resources to other, high-priority areas where interventions are more nascent and/or less robust. The increase in the number of families covered by the program is explained by the fact that DEVIDA, the GOP partner implementing assistance activities, doubled its estimated number of assisted families in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2020 to 100,000 families, due to an expansion of its geographical scope. By the second quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic made it impossible for DEVIDA to reach its new annual target, but nevertheless it surpassed the original target of 53,000 families. FY 2018 result FY 2019 result FY FY 2020 result 61,792 60,000 64,000 - 7 - (3) Discuss the appropriateness of the target for FY 2021: USAID does not expect to see major increases in the number of families assisted over the next two years, though that could change depending on the progress of GOP-led eradication operations in the Valley of the Rivers Apurimac, Ene, and Mantaro (VRAEM). (4) Discuss the procedures for collection of valid data and targets: USAID implementing partners are required to keep track of and report on the number of families benefiting from alternative development activities. USAID and its partners regularly conduct monitoring and verification exercises to maintain quality data and establish annual targets. Moreover, USAID participates in an annual verification exercise led by DEVIDA, Peru's counter-narcotics agency, that involves randomly selected household surveys. This verification exercise gives us added confidence in the accuracy of the data. Measure II: Total sales of licit farm and non-farm products in USG assisted areas (Peru) (1) Describe the measure: This measure applies to Peru. USAID assistance in Peru sustains the reduction of coca after forced eradication by helping farmers acquire the assets, skills, links to markets, and basic services needed to earn a decent living and become part of a licit economy. An adequate and FY 2018 result FY 2019 result FY 2020 target FY 2020 result FY target $70 million $83 million $80 million $85 million - 8 - reliable income from licit crops is an essential factor in a farmers' decision to give up coca cultivation. This indicator helps track progress toward that end. (2) Discuss performance results for FY 2020: Progress is on track. The amount of sales in FY 2020 exceeded the target by 19 percent. This deviation stems from: (1) a 19 percent increase over the previous year, in the number of hectar es of cacao and coffee under production; and (2) a higher than expected commodity prices for cacao and coffee with 8 percent and 14 percent annual price increases respectively. (3) Discuss the appropriateness of the target for FY 2021: Sales of licit crops are projected to increase over the next several years as a result of USG-supported improvements in farmer productivity. The increase in sales will likely occur at a lower rate than seen over previous years, however, as improvements in productivity generally produce a relatively smaller gain in sales as compared to expanding hectares under cultivation. (4) Discuss the procedures for collection of valid data and targets: USAID implementing partners are required to keep track of and report on sales generated through USAID assistance to farmers and farmer organizations. USAID and its partners regularly conduct monitoring and verification exercises to maintain quality data and establish annual targets. Moreover, USAID participates in an annual verification exercise led by DEVIDA, Peru's counter-narcotics agency, that involves randomly selected household surveys. This verification exercise gives us added confidence in the accuracy of the data. Measure III: Hectares of alternative crops targeted by USG programs under cultivation (Peru) FY 2018 result FY 2019 result FY 2020 target FY 2020 result target # hectares 75,620 70,853 85,000 83,815 90,000 90,000 - 9 - (1) Describe the Measure : This measure applies to Peru. It includes all hectares of alternative crops that receive USG assistance. USAID works with the Government of Peru and its counter-narcotics agency, DEVIDA, to increase alternatives to illicit coca production and improve state services in areas formerly dominated by coca and narco-terrorism . In collaboration with DEVIDA, USAID assists former coca farmers to plant and maintain alternative crops, as well as to improve their productivity and cooperation around both social and economic ends. USAID also partners with the private sector (including U.S. cacao and coffee companies, as well as agricultural equipment and input suppliers), to improve production and post-harvest practices, and to help meet the quality standards that the market demands. (2) Discuss performance results for FY 2020: Progress was sustained due to the work of DEVIDA and alternative development private sector alliances, especially during the first two quarters of FY 2020, fourth year of implementation of the program. The Peru Cacao Alliance did not meet its FY 2020 goal because of the government-mandated social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which did not allow the project to assist as many families and hectares as planned in the new intervention areas in the Pasco region. (3) Discuss the appropriateness of the target for FY 2021: USAID does not expect to see major increases in hectares assisted in the coming years, as the focus will continue to be on improving productivity and sales generated from existing hectares under cultivation. (4) Discuss the procedures for collection of valid data and targets: USAID implementing partners are required to keep track of and report on the new hectares that are planted and those where new production techniques are applied. USAID and its partners regularly conduct monitoring and verification exercises to maintain quality data and establish annual targets. Moreover, USAID participates in an annual verification exercise led by DEVIDA that involves randomly selected household surveys. This verification exercise gives us added confidence in the accuracy of the data. - 10 - Measure IV: Total number of clients benefiting from financial services provided through USG-assisted financial intermediaries, including non-financial institutions or actors (Colombia) (1) Describe the measure: This indicator included the number of new clients that have an active financial product or service (e.g. loans, savings, insurance) with a USAID assisted financial institution. Savings account clients only include those that are active (have performed some transactions in the last 6 months, according to the Colombian Financial Superintendence's definition). An institution is considered to receive USAID assistance when it has received technical assistance, training and/or grants. Clients counted under this indicator live in geographies affected by conflict, high socio -economic vulnerability and/or illegal economies. (2) Discuss performance results for FY 2020: Two USAID-funded activities contributed to this indicator in FY 2020: Rural Finances Initiative (RFI) and the Empropaz public-private partnership. Through these two activities, USAID fosters rural economic development by increasing micro, small-, and medium-sized business's access to financial services. These activities seek to address the impact of decades of internal conflict on rural communities in Colombia, preventing rural and agricultural sectors from accessing financial services, and limited rural families' abilities to fully participate in the economy. By increasing citizen access to financial services, USAID is contributing to reducing vulnerability and facilitating economic inclusion. The significant performance this year was related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the negative economic impact in Colombia with high unemployment, growing food insecurity, and low economic performance, stakeholders concentrated on accelerating the expansion of financial services to mitigate these impacts and FY 2018 result FY 2019 result FY 2020 target FY 2020 result 11 - assist those in need. USAID's RFI activity received greater interest from local financial institutions than anticipated, leading to a higher uptake of its offered interventions. The EMPROPAZ public-private partnership also surpassed its targets for its productive finance and entrepreneurship development components. Through RFI's technical assistance and support to financial institutions, 513,586 new clients benefited from financial services during FY 2020. In addition, 28,068 new clients received financial services for productive finance, entrepreneurship development, and businesses strengthening through the EMPROPAZ activity implemented by a local bank. These results not only demonstrate the contribution of USAID in expanding financial services in rural zones of Colombia, but also illustrate that financial services are profitable in target municipalities. This profitability will enhance the long-term sustainability of financial institutions' presence as rural financial services providers and is expected to lead to continued services after both activities have ended -- a permanent, market-based solution. (3) Discuss the appropriateness of the target for FY 2021: RFI's target for FY 2021 is 40,000 clients. The activity will be shifting populations to target migrant populations in a new geography. Based on past investments and experience, EMPROPAZ's estimated target for FY 2021 is 28,096 . (4) Discuss the procedures for collection of valid data and targets: Financial institutions supported by USAID send reports with financial information to USAID implementing partners. USAID then reviews and validates the data reported by these partners. USAID staff conduct data quality assessments (which include verification of sources and supporting documentation), per Agency policy. Measure V: Number of rural households benefiting directly from USG interventions (Colombia) FY 2018 result FY 2019 result FY 2020 target FY 2020 result FY 12,100 - 12 - (1) Describe the measure: This indicator tracks contributions to improve conditions for inclusive rural economic growth in Colombia, a key development objective in USAID/Colombia's five-year strategy. The long-lasting civil conflict in Colombia has marginalized generations of citizens from the benefits of development. With the signing of the peace agreement, transitioning towards a sustainable and inclusive peace will require Colombia to promote a more inclusive society with opportunities for those that have been historically marginalized. (2) Discuss performance results for FY 2020: Five USAID-funded activities contributed to this indicator during FY 2020: Producers to Markets Alliance (PMA); Community Development and Licit Opportunities (CDLO); Land for Prosperity (LfP); Cacao for Peace; and Legal Gold, an artisanal gold mining environmental impact reduction activity. Taken together, 27,973 households benefited through these activities. Under PMA, the implementation of field activities required to identify and incorporate new beneficiaries was negatively affected by COVID-19 quarantine restrictions. As such, the activity did not achieve expected results. Field work resumed in the last quarter of FY 2020. It is expected that performance will improve in FY 2021. While USAID's Community Development and Licit Opportunities activity did not meet its FY 2020 target, the activity's accumulated progress to date is 99% of its multi-year target. While LfP benefitted 647 households through either assistance with land ownership rights and/or agricultural technical assistance, it did not achieve the expected results due to COVID-19 quarantine restrictions. This activity is part of a comprehensive approach that works to not only assure durable land rights, but also improve the licit economic benefits from the sustainable management of that land. USAID's \"Cacao for Peace activity surpassed its FY 2020 target as it identified and benefited 64 farms, 220% above the target. Legal Gold benefited 266 families with improved alternative livelihoods, such as annatto (natural food additive) production in Choco, beekeeping in Antioquia, and rehabilitation of degraded mining lands. This annual result was under target as the activity overestimated the potential impacts of its Integrated Watershed Management activities; targets had been established based - 13 - on an assumption that mostly medium and large watersheds would be addressed in implementation, but the activity has focused primarily on smaller watersheds. Results data from USAID's Acumen Development Credit Authority loan guarantee activity were not included in the report this year due to questions about data quality standards identified during a data quality assessment. USAID/Colombia will continue to work with the implementing partner to address the data quality issues and expects to be able to include data from this activity in next year. (3) Discuss the appropriateness of the target for FY 2021: The FY 2021 and CfP activities' targets. PMA has a goal of reaching 7,500 farmers and CDLO will expand its services to 7,750 households by strengthening their communities to be more reliable and effective partners to implement local-level social and economic development. LfP's estimated target is 8,680. CfP and Legal Gold are winding down as their activities are scheduled to end. The ACUMEN Activity has a target of 1,000 beneficiaries, although this will be reviewed once the data quality issues identified in FY 2020 are resolved Targets are supported by the budget and interventions outlined in annual work plans for FY 2021. (4) Discuss the procedures for collection of valid data and targets: The six contributing USAID activities provide data from activity interventions directly to USAID. USAID staff conduct data quality assessments (which include verification of sources and supporting documentation), per Agency policy. Measure VI: Value of smallholder incremental sales of licit agricultural products with USG assistance (Colombia) FY 2018 result FY 2019 result FY 2020 target FY 2020 result FY target $7.9 million $28.9 million $13.7 million $2.2 million - 14 - (1) Describe the measure: This indicator contributes directly to improved conditions for inclusive rural economic growth and sustainable development. Incremental sales for smallholders are a proxy measurement of their increased income as a result of technical support, strengthened capacity, and increased yield from key value chains. Vulnerable groups in rural, conflict-affected areas have suffered disproportionately. Transitioning towards a sustainable and inclusive peace will require that Colombia promote a more inclusive society with opportunities for those that have been historically marginalized. (2) Discuss performance results for FY 2020: Five activities contributed to this indicator in FY 2020: Producers to Markets Alliance (PMA); Community Development and Licit Opportunities (CDLO); Connected Landscapes (CLA); Conservation and Governance (CCA); and Paramos and Forests (PF). Increasing farmer sales and net income is crucial to demonstrating to rural producers that there are viable licit economic alternatives to coca production. PMA activity's incremental sales increases in FY 2020 were driven primarily by productivity increases across value chains, which have been above target. With a recovery in FY 2020, despite COVID-19, market prices are now contributing to increased smallholder sales. Increases in market prices are a reflection both of international supply and demand trends as well as price premiums in recognition of improved product quality which has been a key focus of PMA interventions. CDLO activity also reported outstanding results against established targets. The activity has worked extensively to improve business practices of producer organizations, many of which did not have sales records at the beginning of the activity. Now all participating organizations have the capacity to understand and report key financial data. Similarly, CLA greatly exceeded its target due to an underestimated baseline and expansion of value chain activities. The original target estimate was derived from 33 surveys that did not constitute a representative sample (initially the calculation was based on livestock and cheese sales only). Furthermore, given the strategies implemented in 2019 and 2020, it was possible to expand activities beyond livestock and cheese to also include cocoa, vegetables, and sugar cane products. - 15 - CCA achieved only 19.2% of its FY 2020 target, supporting sales of $100,272. Sales were negatively affected by COVID-19 and the national quarantine. It is expected that during the last quarter of calendar year 2020, the activity will see increased sales of cacao and coffee in the Andean Amazon foothills. In association with the private sector, the activity also seeks to promote dairy products generated in a sustainable way to reduce Amazon deforestation. The activity is promoting a designation of origin for these dairy products as a joint effort by USAID, the Regional Cattle Ranching Association of Caquet\u00e1, the Takami Group of luxury restaurants, and the Sierra Nevada SAS fast food company of Colombia. Finally, in FY 2020 USAID's PF started implementing small grants to dynamize the sales of sustainable products in dairy, meat, potato and plantain, to name a few. (3) Discuss the appropriateness of the target for FY 2021: According to estimates of the number of producer beneficiaries and market conditions, the following are the estimated FY 2021 targets for the USAID-funded activities reporting $11,918,000; CDLO $612,500; and PG $1,200,000. CLA and CC will be closing in the first months of FY 2021; as such, they do not have targets for this indicator. The Mission is exploring replacing this indicator in FY 2021 with a new State-USAID standard indicator EG.3.2-26, Value of annual sales of producers and firms receiving USG assistance. The target for FY 2022 is low with respect to the previous fiscal years since PMA, the activity mainly reporting this indicator, will end in the first quarter of FY2022. The target will be adjusted once the scope of new designs under the economic growth portfolio is established. (4) Discuss the procedures for collection of valid data and targets: Data are reported by the contributing USAID activities mentioned above. PMA uses specific annual representative surveys of the organizations and farmers supported for data on sales and income. For the other activities, the implementing partners collect the data directly from all beneficiaries. USAID staff conduct data quality assessments (which include verification of sources and supporting documentation), per Agency policy. Measure VII: Number of additional hectares of licit crops under improved technologies or management practices as a result of USG assistance (Colombia) FY 2018 result FY 2019 result FY 2020 target FY 2020 result FY 2021 target FY 2022 target - 16 - (1) Describe the measure: This indicator contributes directly to improve conditions for inclusive rural economic growth and sustainable development. In Colombia only 4.8 million out of a potential 22 million hectares are farmed. Farmer producer associations in conflict zones are weak or non-existent. They neither possess the market power needed to influence policies that affect them, nor benefit from economies of scale in their engagement with the marketplace. Most of the illicit economic activities are concentrated in conflict zones. The transfer of knowledge and technology contributes to the improvement of inclusive economic opportunities and reducing poverty, which is key to addressing the root causes of conflict. (2) Discuss performance results for FY 2020: During FY 2020, USAID supported management practices and technology improvements in 122,841 hectares. Most of this support was delivered through USAID's Producers to Markets Alliance (PMA) activity, which supported 119,803 hectares. The main reason for the result being over target was due to a PMA oversight. Originally this activity did not include interventions that improved livestock management practices under this indicator. Upon clarification, these interventions are now counted towards annual results. These producers improved basic agriculture practices, farm management systems, and new technologies through PMA demonstration sites and individual farm visits on production-related topics such as plant nutrition, pruning, weed control, and pasture management. Three USAID public-private partnerships also contributed to this indicator. The Bitter Cassava for a Sweet Milk activity contributed to the improvement of 910 hectares (46 percent above target). It was able to negotiate forward contracts for cassava purchases. This, along with technology improvement investments and pasture renovation allowed the activity to exceed expectations. USAID's Fear to Trust activity contributed to the improvement of 1,234 hectares and is in its final year. USAID's Cocoa Effect activity did not reach its target (64% deviation) due to pandemic restrictions, which limited its planned support for cacao planting. Nevertheless, the activity was able to provide technical guidance on fertilization, pruning, irrigation, and sanitary controls. The technical assistance of these activities builds the capacity of farmers for # hectares 11,347 76,628 22,481 122,841 20,209 2,409 - 17 - future crops and is a sustainable contribution to their ultimate economic success and graduation from development programs. - 18 - (3) Discuss the appropriateness of the target for FY 2021: Based on estimates of investments for improved technologies and management practices in coffee, cacao, dairy, latex, and blackberry crops, the following are the estimated FY 2021 targets of the activities CE 1,922; and BCSM 471. Hectares under interventions that improved livestock management practices are not included in this target. The inclusion of these hectares in the target is under discussion and may be included next year. The target for FY 2022 is low with respect to the previous fiscal years since PMA, the activity mainly reporting this indicator, will end in the first quarter of FY2022. The target will be adjusted once the scope of new designs under the economic growth portfolio is established. (4) Discuss the procedures for collection of valid data and targets: This data is collected from the contributing USAID activities. USAID staff conduct data quality assessments (which include verification of sources and supporting documentation), per Agency policy. Geographic Information System (GIS) information is used for estimating the data reported in this indicator. GIS files were reviewed in the data quality assessment for this indicator. - 19 - Decision Unit: Afghanistan AFGHANISTAN PERFORMANCE SECTION OF THE FY 2020 ACCOUNTING REPORT Table 1: Number of individuals who have received USG supported short-term agricultural sector productivity training or food security training. Number of households benefited by agriculture and alternative development interventions in targeted areas. FY 2016 Target FY 2016 Actual FY 2017 Target Actual Target Actual FY 2019 Target FY 2019 Actual FY Actual Target Actual FY 2019 Target FY 2019 Actual FY - 20 - (1) Describe the measure: The performance indicators in Tables 1 and 2 measure the extent to which activities are reaching a critical mass of beneficiaries in targeted areas. The Afghan Value Chains - High Value Crops, Afghan Value Chains - Livestock, Agricultural Marketing Program, Catalyzing Afghan Agricultural Innovation, Grain Research And Innovation (GRAIN), Promoting Value Chains - West, Regional Agriculture Development Program - East (RADP-E), Commercial Horticulture and Agricultural Marketing Program (CHAMP), and Strengthening Watershed and Irrigation Management (SWIM) activities contribute to this indicator. The number of individuals who have received USAID training is the number of individuals to whom knowledge or skills have been imparted through formal or informal means as a result of USG supported programs. This includes in-country and off-shore training, as well as knowledge or skills gained through technical assistance activities. The numbers of households benefiting from agriculture and alternative development interventions are residents of a common dwelling who pool expenses and regularly live together. A household is a beneficiary if it contains at least one individual who is a beneficiary. An individual is a beneficiary if s/he is engaged with a project activity and either already has shown benefit from the activity or has a high likelihood of gaining one of those benefits due to his/her significant level of engagement with the project. This indicator gives insight into the scope of USAID agriculture and alternative development programs and whether they are likely to significantly impact target areas. (2) Discuss performance results in FY 2020: These indicators have consistently met or over-achieved targets. However, it must be noted that the shift in emphasis in agricultural programming to the higher ends of agricultural value chains may have an impact on the performance of these indicators in the future. (3) Discuss the appropriateness of the target for FY 2021: USAID is no longer undertaking alternative development interventions, and these results will be reported under new indicator language in the future. The CHAMP activity contributed to alternative development interventions only in the first quarter, and it was a small amount relative to the FY19 result. There is no target for FY21, as all of the contributing programs have expired. (4) Discuss the procedures for collecting of valid data and targets: - 21 - USAID has streamlined our own multi-tiered monitoring program in Afghanistan to three tiers that require: 1) either direct USAID observation or direct third party monitoring, 2) implementing partner data, and 3) other sources that corroborate the previous two tiers, such as local beneficiaries, other donors, and civil society to ensure that data collection methodologies and procedures are sound and to conduct periodic data quality assessments. Targets are established by considering current and future planned activities, budget levels, cost estimates for implementation and consultations with groups or associations of farmers in targeted areas. 9.

USAID's obligations exceed the $50 million threshold level for simplified reporting. Tab L Inspector General Review of the Federal Aviation Administration's Fiscal Year 2020 National Drug Control Program Activities Report No. FI2021019 February 17, 2021 Inspector General Re view o f t he F ederal A viatio n Administration's Fiscal Y e ar 2020 N ational D rug Control P rogram A cti vities What We Looked At Under the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Circular, National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews , when drug -related obligations total less than $50 million and a full compliance with the Circular would constitute an unreasonable reporting burden, agencies may submit alternative reports. T he Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) submitted alternative Budget Formulation Compliance, Detailed Accounting, and Performance Summary reports. We reviewed the report s and related management assertions to determine the reliability of those assertions in compliance with the Circular. We conducted our review in acco rdance with generally accepted Government auditing standards for attestation engagements. W e limited our review to inquiries and analytical procedures appropriate for an attestation review according to the Circular's criteria. What We Found We were not ab le to validate the budget amounts in FAA's Budget Formulation Compliance Report because FAA did not provide sufficient supporting documentation to allow a review. As a result, we were not able to conclude that the funding levels in the budget submission pr ovided by the budget decision units to FAA were without alteration or adjustment. We were not able to verify the reasonableness of FAA's reported Air Traffic Organization (ATO) obligations because FAA did not provide documentation to support the obligations. We also noted that the estimation method FAA use d to determine its ATO obligations included a baseline full-time equivalent level last updated in 2003. Because FAA did not provide a signed assertions letter related to performance with its Performance Summary Report, as required, we were unable to perform procedures related to performance assertions. Based on our review of FAA's fiscal year 2020 Budget Formulation Compliance, Detailed Accounting, and Performance Summary reports , we were not able to conclude on the reliability of FAA's management assertions . Required by the Office of National Drug Control Policy Circular, National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews FI2021019 | Febr uary 17, 20 21 All OIG audit reports are available on our website at www.oig.dot.gov .

FI2021019 1 U.S. Department of Transportation February 17, 202 1 Director, Office of Policy, Research, and Budget Office of National Drug Control Policy 750 17th St., N.W. Washington, DC 20503 Dear Director : This report presents the results of our independent review of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) 's fiscal year 2020 Budget Formulation Compliance, Detailed Accounting, and Performance Summary report s to the Office of National Drug Contr ol Policy (ONDCP). The report s and our review are required by 21 U .S.C. \u00a7 1704(d) and ONDCP Circular Nati onal Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews , dated October 22 , 201 9. Our objective is to express a conclusion about the reliability of each assertion made in each report. FAA was required to submit its reports along with our authentication of those reports to ONDCP by February 1, 2021. We requested that FAA provide its reports to us by December 11, 2020 , but we did not receive the reports unti l January 13, 2021. Because of this delay, we were unable to authenticate the reports prior to FAA's submission deadline. The Circular states that when prior year drug- related obligations are less than $50 million and compliance with the Circular would con stitute an unreasonable burden, agencies may submit alternative reports. Because its drug -related obligations for fiscal year 20 20 totaled less than $50 million, FAA submitted alternative reports. We reviewed FAA's reports and related management assertions to determine the reliability of those assertions in compliance with the Circular in all material respects. We conducted our review in accordance with generally accepted Government auditing standards for attestation engagements. An attestation review is substantially more limited in scope than an examination, which would express an opinion on the accuracy of FAA's fiscal year 2020 Budget Formulation Compliance, Detailed Accounting , and Performance Summary reports. Because we conducted an attestation review, we do not express such an opinion. FI2021019 2 Budget Formulation Compliance Report We performed review procedures on FAA's fiscal year 20 20 Budget Formulation Compliance Report (see encl osure 1 ) according to the Circular's c riteria. We limited our work to inquiries and analytical procedures appropriate for an attestation review. Specifically, we performed procedures to determine whether FAA submitted the summer budget timely and funding levels represented bureau- level request. Based on our review, we determined FAA timely submitted its summer budget. Additionally, we noted that FAA reported drug resources totaling $34.235 million on its fiscal year 2020 budge t formulation compliance report . However, we were unable to validate the budget amounts because FAA did not provide sufficient supporting documentation . As a result, we were una ble to conclude that the funding levels in the budget submission to FAA by the budget decision units were with out alteration or adjustment by FAA officials. Detailed Accounting Report We performed review procedures on FAA's fiscal year 2020 Detailed Accounting Report (see enclosure 2 ) according to the Circular's criteria. We limited our work to inquiries and analytical procedures appropriate for an attestation review. Specifically, we performed procedures for the purpose of expressing a conclusion about the reliability of each of the seven assertions made in FAA's drug control obligations summary report . We reviewed $2 1.290 million in obligations from two of FAA's drug control decision units \u2014Aviation Safety/Aerospace Medicine (AVS/AAM) and Security and Hazardous Materials Safety (ASH) \u2014and traced those obligations to the Department of Transportation's accounting system without exception. Additionally, FAA reported drug c ontrol obligations totaling $11.965 million for its Air Traffic Organization (ATO) decision unit. However, because FAA did not provide documentation to support the obligations reported, we were unable to verify the reasonableness of its reported ATO obligations. We also noted that the estimation method FAA use d to determine its ATO obligations included a baseline full- time equivalent (FTE) level last updated in 2003. Using an outdated baseline can result in an estimate that does not reasonably reflect a current level -of-effort related to drug control activities. We reviewed FAA 's drug methodologies , including a modification made to ASH's methodology, and did not identify any issues with the reasonableness and FI2021019 3 reliability of the AVS/AAM and ASH's accounting methodology. Also, n othing came to our attention indicating that a methodology other than the two disclosed in the report was used to generate the fiscal year 2020 drug control obligations summary table or that material weaknesses or other findings may have impacted the prior year drug -related obligations existed. FAA asserted that there was no reprogramming or transfer of drug control funds. Based on our review, we identified a difference between the fiscal year 2020 total enacted amounts and the total amounts reported. The difference identified did not exceed $5 million or 10 percent of the FAA drug control program 's enacted amount. As a result, there was no indication that drug control funds were reprogrammed or transferred. Also, FAA did not issue any fund control notices during the fiscal year. Performance Summary Report FAA's performance targets for fiscal year 20 20 were to ensure the aviation indust ry conducts random drug and alcohol testing of safety sensitive employees with results not exceeding 1 percent positives for drugs and 0.5 percent positives for alcohol ; and initiate regulatory investigations on 95 percent of airmen involved in the sale or distribution of illegal drugs within 30 days of knowledge of a conviction or notification by law enforcement . FAA indicated that it met its performance targets. However, FAA did not provide a signed assertions letter related to performance with the Performance Summary Report (see enclosure 3) , as required. We were therefore unable to perform any procedures related to performance assertions . Conclusion We were unable to conclude on the reliability of FAA's management assertions based on our reviews of FAA's fiscal year 2020 Budget Formulation Compliance, Detailed Accounting, and Performance Summary reports. We appreciate the cooperation and assistance of the Department of Transportation's representatives. If you have any questions about this report, please call me at (202) 329- 0694.

ARIDE In 2019, ARIDE training was conducted in all 50 states. A total of 881 ARIDE classes were held in the U.S. in 2019, an increase of 211 classes from the previous year, resulting in the training of 16,976 police officers, prosecutors, and toxicologists. Since the inception of the ARIDE training program in 2009, 118,219 police officers, prosecutors, and toxicologists have received the training. DRE Since 2010, 876 DRE schools have been conducted in the U.S. There were 96 DRE schools conducted in 2019, training 1,636 officers as DREs. These results represented one more school and 23 more students than in 2018. Additionally, there were 37 DRE instructor schools conducted, training 216 DRE instructors in the U.S. , an increase of nine schools and 64 more students than in the previous year. In 2019, 49,905 DRE drug influence evaluations were reported. o Of those, 36, 306 were enforcement evaluations and 13,599 were training evaluations. o The 36,306 enforcement evaluations represent an increase of 5,059 evaluations from 2018. By the end of December 2019, there were 9,878 DREs in the U.S. NEMSIS The 2020 NEMSIS Public -Release Research Dataset included 48,376,809 EMS activations submitted by 11,257 EMS agencies serving 49 states and territories. Furthermore, in 2020: 117 requests for Public- Release Research Datasets were filled, 125 scientific journal articles wer e published, and 34 interactive dashboards were a vailable for stakeholder use. Countermeasures Publications NHTSA's Countermeasures That Work is a basic reference to assist state highway safety o ffices and other professionals interested in highway safety in selecting effective, evidence -based countermeasures f or traffic safety problem areas including drug -impaired driving. The 10th edition will expand several sections, including enforc ement of drug-impaired driving and education regarding 2 https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/50941 medications, and will augment the discussion of drug-impaired driving characteristics in the chapter and section overviews . A separate document, Countermeasures At Work , will feature countermeasures demonstrati ng higher effectiveness ratings. (4) Quality of Performance Data Prevalence Research NHTSA contracted Dunlap and Associates, Inc. to conduct this project, obtaining data from Level 1 trauma centers and medical examiners' offices. Data collection began in the fall of 2019 and will continue through 2021. The study plans to collect up to 10,000 samples. ARIDE and DRE Training Via cooperative agreement with NHTSA , IACP maintains, supports and coordinates an annual training calendar for the delivery of ARIDE and DRE classes nationwide. The ability to observe, identify and articulate evidence of impairment by drugs, other than alcohol, is complex. ARIDE and DRE training is the best resource available to the criminal justice system to remove from the roadway, adjudicate , and reduce recidivism of drug-impaired drivers. Every state and DC employs a DRE State Coordinator, who is responsible for: The daily operations of the state's DECP; Ensuring the program complies with the IACP DECP International Standards or equivalent state standards; Acts as an information clearinghouse and central communications point f or the program with the state; Assists in the coordination of DRE training and other support activities for all agencies participating in the program within the state, including the assignment of DRE School Course Managers and instructors; and Provides justification and reports on the effectiveness of his/her state's program.

Sincerely yours, Cynthia Parker Chief Financial Officer NHTSA Enclosures Tab /9 /19 /15 /11 /18 /11 Statement of Disclosures and Assertions for FY 2022 Budget Formulation Compliance Report Submitted to Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) for Fiscal Year Ending September 30, 2020 In accordance with ONDCP's Circular, National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews, dated October 22, 2019, the Veterans Health Administration asserts that the VHA system of accounting, use of obligations, and systems of internal controls provide reasonable assurance that: Obligations are based upon the actual expenditures as reported by the Decision Support System (DSS), which is the designated Managerial Cost A ccounting (MCA) System of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The methodology used to calculate obligations of budgetary resources is reasonable and accurate in all material respects and as described herein was the actual me thodology used to generate the costs. Accounting changes are as shown in the disclosures that follow. 4 of 14 during the week and on weekends and all facilit ies must provide same-day access for emergent need for SUD treatment. In the four quarters ending in Q2 of FY 2020, 257,961 Veterans who received services within VHA were diagnosed with a drug use disorder. Of these Veterans, VA provided services by mental health clinicians in a variety of outpatient setting s to nearly 85 percent (219,193) of Veterans with any diagnosis of a drug use disorder. Among Veterans receiv ing treatment within VA through FY 2020 Q2, approximately 17 perc ent (43,458) used amphetamines, around 28 percent (72,070) used cocaine, around 27 percent (70,609) used opioids, and around 53 percent (136,943) used cannabis. (These categories are not mutually exclusive.) VHA continues to improve service delivery and effici ency by integrating services for mental health disorders, including SUD, into primary care settings. Veterans from Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn/Operation Inherent Resolve (OEF/OIF/OND/OIR) and Veterans from other eras are served in primary care teams (Patient Aligned Care Teams: PACTs) that have co-located mental health staff to identify and address potential mental health and substance use trea tment needs. Secondary prevention services include diagnosis and assessment of possible substance use disorders in patients presenting medical problems that suggest elevated risk of substance use disorders (e.g., treatment for Hepatitis C, prescribed opioid medications). Recognizing the importance of team-based care, VHA is implementing the Behavioral Health Interdisciplinary Program - Collaborative Chronic Care Model (BHIP-CCM) at every VA facility. Implementation of BHIP - CCM teams within general mental hea lth further supports VA's commitment to providing access to chronic disease management and treatment for substance use disorders beyond specialty SUD treatment settings. Most Veterans with substance use disorders are treated in outpatient programs. Outpatient withdrawal management is available for patients wh o are medically stable and who have sufficient social support systems to monitor their status. Standard outpatient programs typically treat patients one or two hour s per session and patients are generally seen once or twice a week. Intensive SUD outpatient programs provide at le ast three hours of service per day and patients attend three or more days per week. Considering the frequent co-occurrence of subs tance use disorders with posttraumatic stress disorder, VHA has also assigned a SUD specialist to each of its hospital-level posttraumatic stress disorder services or teams. The staff person is an integral member of the posttraumatic stress disorder clinical services team and works to integrate substance use disorder care with all other aspects of posttraumatic stress disorder- related care. Among the specialists' responsibilities are identification and treatment of Veterans with co-o ccurring SUD and posttraumatic stress disorder. Specialists also promote preventive services for Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder who are at risk for developing a substance use disorder. VHA provides two types of 24-hou r care to patients with severe, complex, or acute substance use disorders. These include inpatient withdrawal management and stabilization in numerous medical and general mental health units an d provision of care in Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs (otherwise referred to as Domiciliary beds). VHA offers care in Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs (MH RRTPs) to Veterans with complex, co- occurring mental health, substance use, medical, and psychosocial needs. Specialty Domiciliary SUD programs provide treatment equivalent to Leve l 3.7, Medically Monitored Intensive Inpatient Services as specified by the American Society of Addiction Medicine Patient Placement Criteria. At the end of FY 2019, 67 Domiciliary SUD program s were in operation with 1,845 beds focused 5 of 14 specifically on intensive, medically monitored resi dential SUD treatment. In addition to those MH RRTPs formally designated as Domiciliary SUD programs, additional SUD specialized services are offered through tracks in other MH RRTPs and the majority of Veterans served by MH RRTPs are diagnosed with a substance use disorder. Programs to end homelessness among Veterans ar e encouraged to have SUD specialists as a part of their multidisciplinary teams. There are SUD specialists working in the Department of Housing and Urban Development - VA Supportive Housing (HUD -VASH), Grant and Per Diem (GPD) and the Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) programs; however, the use of SUD specialists can vary locally based on site-spe cific needs. These specialists emphasize early identification of substance use disorders as a risk for maintaining permanent housing, promote engagement or re-engagement in SUD specialty care programs and serve as linkages between homeless and SUD programs. Methamphetamine VA recognizes the emerging threat that meth amphetamine poses to our nation's Veterans. Specific data on the rates of methamphetamine use disorder are not available. However, the overall rates of amphetamine use disorder have been increasing with over 43,000 Veterans who received care in VA during FY 2019 having an amphetamine use diso rder diagnosis. This reflects a 17 percent increase from FY 2018 (6,430 Veterans). VA's commitment to provision of evidence- based treatment has positioned VA well to re spond to this emerging threat. Contingency Management (CM) is an evidence-based treatm ent with demonstrated efficacy in treating stimulant use disorder. VA implemented CM in 2011, and through September 2019, VA has provided contingency management services to ov er 4,800 Veterans with over 92 percent of the greater than 63,000 urine samples testing negative for the target drug(s) (e.g. stimulants or cannabis). Opioid Use Disorder Slightly more than 70,600 Veterans with an opioid use disorder (OUD) diagnosis were seen in VA in the four quarters ending in FY 2020 Q2. Medication for OUD (M-OUD) has historically been provided in SUD specialty-care clinics, but the ma jority of Veterans with clinically diagnosed OUD do not access SUD specialty care. By dissemina ting evidence-based models for delivery of M- OUD in primary care, mental health, and pain management clinics, Veterans are expected to have timely access to the right treatment at their preferred point of care. VA launched the Stepped Care for Opioid Use Disorder Train the Trainer (SCO UTT) initiative in August 2018 with the intent of supporting the expansion of M-OUD in Level 1 clinics (primary care, general mental health and pain management clinics). Pilot sites in each VISN implemented th is expansion during FY 2019. From August 2018 through May 2020 there has be en a 153 percent increase in the number of patients receiving buprenorphine in the initial pi lot Level One clinics and 163 percent increase in the number of providers prescribing buprenorphine in these clinics. Further, Veterans are being retained in care with 70 percent of Veterans retained on buprenorphine for more than 90 days. Plans for regional conferences to support further dissemination have been modified in response to the current pandemic with a vi rtual national conference now planned for late September. VHA continues to expand the availability of M- OUD for Veterans. VA monitors the percent of patients with OUD who receive M- OUD (41.5 percent during the 2nd quarter of FY 2020) as part of the Psychotropic Drug Safety Initiative (PDSI). PDSI is a nationwide psychopharmacology quality improvement (QI) program that supports fa cility-level QI through quarterly quality metrics, clinical decision support tools, technical assist ance for QI strategic impl ementation, and a virtual learning collaborative. Since 4th quarter FY 2019, VA has seen a 2 percent increase in the number of Veterans that received M-OUD (total of 27,011, Q2 FY 2020). The number of providers 6 of 14 with a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) X-waiver also has continued to increase since the 4th quarter FY 2019 with an addi tional 216 providers through the end of May 2020. In FY 2019, evidence-based M-OUD, including office-based treatment with buprenorphine and extended- release injectable naltrexone, was accessible to patients seen at 100 percent of VA medical centers. Including VA medical centers, Community-Based Outpatient Clinics, and other sites of care separate from the medical centers, over 680 total sites of service provided at least some M-OUD an increase of approximately 50 sites from FY 2018. VA operates federally regulated opioid treatment programs that can provide methadone ma intenance on-site at 32 larger urban locations and at a growing number of VHA facilities that ma intain contractual arrang ements or arrange non- VA care for providing care through community-based licensed opioid treatment programs. VA has realized that it will be critical to go beyo nd providers obtaining a waiver that allows them to prescribe buprenorphine. The number of pr oviders with a DEA X-waiver that prescribed buprenorphine during FY 2019 wa s significantly lower than the number of providers with an X- waiver. While this number is increasing, VA is focusing efforts to remove barriers to prescribing and to support the initiation of buprenorph ine when indicated. VHA Notice 2019-18, Buprenorphine Prescribing for Opioid Use Disorder was published in October 2019 with the intent of clarifying national policy and tasking facilities to remove potential barriers to prescribing if present. In support of interprofessional team-based mode ls of care, VA is leveraging Clinical Pharmacy Specialist (CPS) providers to deliver compre hensive medication management services and improve Veteran access to SUD care. In partners hip with the VA Office of Rural Health, the VA Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Clinical Pharmacy Practice Office launched a nationwide initiative in FY 2020 to expand the CPS provider workforce focused on SUD care. A total of 35 CPS provider positions have be en awarded since initiation with a primary focus of expanding access to OUD and alcohol use disorder (AUD) care for rural Veterans. As part of this project, train the trainer clinical pharmacy boot camps be gan in June 2020 and will virtually train over 250 CPS providers in OUD and AUD care. The goal of th e training is to advance CPS provider practice in SUD care and risk miti gation across level 1 clinics, in alig nment with the SCOUTT initiative. All boot camp participants have completed 24-hour D EA X-waiver training prior to the boot camp in anticipation that future legislat ion may include pharmacist practiti oners as potential providers of buprenorphine-based therapy, furthe access to M-OUD. As of Q2 FY2020, 167 CPS providers are delivering OUD care with 53,466 encounters over the past year and significant practice growth expected for SUD care overall. National Treatment Plan 2 VA has developed a comprehensive plan in respon se to the National Drug Control Strategy - National Treatment Plan (NDCS- NTP) for SUD. VA's plan builds on the efforts described in detail earlier in this document with focus on expansion of SUD services for difficult to reach populations using a range of technologies, expansion of the Addiction workforce to in clude an expansion of peer support services targeted to SUD services, and broad implementation of a stepped-care model to ensure there is \"no wrong door\" for Veterans requiring SUD treatment. 2 Additional budget detail and estimates will be incl uded in VA's FY 2022 Annual Budget Submission . 7 of 14 Opioid Safety Initiative3 VA continues to pursue a comprehensive strategy to promote safe prescribing of opioids when indicated for effective pain management. The purpose of the Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI) is to ensure pain management is addressed thoughtfully, compassionately, and safely to make the totality of opioid use visible at all levels in the organization. Based on comparisons of national data between the quarter beginning in Quarter 4, FY 2012 (beginning in July 2012) to Quarter 2, FY 2020 (ending in March 2020), many aspects of the OSI continue to show positive results. Despite an increase of 329,356 Veterans who were dispensed any medication from a VA pharmacy, 275,571 fewer Veterans were on long -term opioids. The average dose of selected opioids has continued to decline as 46,543 fewe r patients were receiving morphine equivalent daily doses greater than or equal to 100 milligrams, demonstrating that prescribing and consumption behaviors are changing. The desired results of the Opioid Safety Initiative have been achieved during a time that VA has seen a 7.7 percent increase in Veterans that have utilized VA outpatient pharmacy services. Chronic pain is a national public health problem as outlined in the 2011 study by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). At least 100 million Americans suffer from some form of chronic pain. The IOM study describes in detail many concerns of pain management, including system-wide deficits in the training of our Nation's health care professionals in pain management an d substance use disorders prevention and management, and the pr oblems caused by a fragmented health care system. The over-use and misuse of opioids for pain management in the United States is a consequence of a health care system that until recently was less than fully prepared to respond to these challenges. VHA has identified and broadly responded to the many challenges of pain management through policies supporting clinical monitoring, education and training of health professionals and teams, and expans ion of clinical resources and programs. VA's Pain Management Directive defines and describes policy expectations an d responsibilities for the overall National Pain Management Strategy and Stepped Care pain model, which is evidence-based and has been adopted by the Department of Defense (DoD) as well. Our approach to managing opioid over-use fits into this plan, and the VA has employed broad strategies to address the opioid epidemic: education, pain management, risk mitigation, an d addiction treatment. First, the VA addressed the problem of clinically inappropriate high- dose prescribing of opioids through the VA's national program, the Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI). Second, VA developed an effective system of interdisciplinary, patient-aligned pain management with the competen cy to provide safe and effective pain control and quality of life for Veterans for the remainder of their lives. VA has reduced the reliance on opioid medication for pain management by more than 58 percent since 2012, largely by starting fe wer patients newly on long-term opioid therapy and by offering pain care options that are safer an d more effective in the long run. The majority of the decline in VA opioid prescriptions is not due to Vete rans \"getting by\" with fewer opioids, b ut by following a Stepped Care Model for Pain treatment addressi ng the causes of pain with fewer Veterans requiring the initiation of long-ter m opioid therapy. VA has been recognized by many as a leader in the pain management field for the responsible use of opioids. Notably, VA has organized many types of interdisciplinary pain care teams to help with medication safety, patient education, pain schools, cognitive behavioral therapy and helpin g patients transition from a biomedical to a biopsychosocial model of pain care. As VA contin ues its efforts to address opioid over-use, non- 3 Additional budget detail and estimates on VA's Opioid Safety Initiative, including VA's efforts to address P. L. 114- 198, tile IX, the Jason Simcakoski Memorial and Promise Act, are included in VA's FY 2021 Annual Budget Submission, Vol. II, Medical Programs and Information Technology Programs. 8 of 14 opioid treatments and complementary and integr ative medicine treatments (such as massage therapy, yoga, meditation, occupational ther apy, physical therapy, recreational therapy, acupuncture, tai chi, etc.) are an important component to VA's Pain Management Strategy. To further strengthen OSI and keep this trend moving in the right direction, VA has deployed state-of-the-art tools to help protect Veteran pati ents using high doses of opioids or with medical risk factors that put them at an increased risk of complications from opioid medications including overdose. These tools, referred to as the Opioid Therapy Risk Report (OTRR) and the Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Mitigation (STOR M), are available to all clinical staff in the VHA. These tools include information about the dosages of narcotics and other sedative medications, significant medical problems that could contribute to an adverse reaction and monitoring data to aid in the review and management of complex pati ents. The OTRR allows VA providers to review all pertinent clinical data related to pain tr eatment in one place, providing a comprehensive Veteran-centered and more efficient level of management not previously available to primary care providers. The STORM allows VA providers to vi ew information about risk factors for opioid overdose, suicide-related events and other ha rms and recommends patient-specific risk mitigation strategies. Both tools are part of VA's broa der efforts to prevent opioid overdose deaths. Additionally, VHA has formalized a system-wide Academic Detailing program that is in process of being implemented throughout the organization. Ac ademic Detailing provides specialty teams to visit facilities and provide on-site support and ed ucation to providers to further enhance pain management efforts. The Academic Detailing program is another important step to improve mental health, substance use disorder, and pain management medication therapy across all VA medical centers. As of March 31, 2020, spec ially trained VA pharmacists had over 56,000 outreach visits with VA staff abou t opioid safety, opioid overdo se and naloxone distribution, suicide prevention, and opioid use disorder. As VA continues its efforts to address opioid ov er-use, complementary and integrative medicine treatments are an important component to VA's Pain Management Strategy. VA currently offers many complementary and integrative medicine tr eatments, many of which may be useful in chronic pain. These treatments include acupre ssure, acupuncture, biofeedback, chiropractic services, exercise, heated pool therapy, hypnosis/hypnotherapy, massage therapy, meditation, occupational therapy, ph ysical therapy, recreational therapy, relaxation, tai chi, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, yoga and other services. VA has several other programs that are complementa ry to the Opioid Safety Initiative and include: State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP): 49 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico are activated for VA data transm ission. From Quarter 3, Fiscal Year 2013 (ending in June 2013) to Quarter 2, Fiscal Year 2020 (ending March 2020), VA providers have documented over 6.8 million queries to State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs to help guide trea tment decisions. Medication Take-Back Program: VA offers free medication take back services to Veterans through mail-back envelopes and on-site recept acles compliant with DEA regulations. As of March 31, 2020, Veterans have returned over 185.7 tons of unwanted or unneeded medication using these services. Opioid Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution The VA Opioid Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND) program aims to decrease opioid-related overdose deaths am ong VHA patients by providing education on opioid overdose 9 of 14 prevention, recognition of opioid overdose, an d training on the rescue response, including provision of naloxone. Food and Drug Administ ration-approved layperson naloxone formulations (nasal spray and auto-injector) are on the VA National Formulary and ar e currently available through every VHA facility. VHA recommends offering OEND to Veterans prescribed or using opioids who are at increased risk for opioid ov erdose or whose provider deems it clinically indicated. Academic Detailing has promoted OEND through individualized, evidence-based educational outreach visits and co nsultation for clinicians by clinicians. In July 2016, Congress took the important step of eliminating copaymen t requirements for opioid antagonists (e.g., naloxone) furnished to Veterans at high risk fo r overdose and for education on their use (per P. L. 114-98, title IX, the Jason Si mcakoski Memorial and Promise Act). This change has been implemented throughout VHA. Since implementatio n of the OEND program in 2014, over 26,300 VHA prescribers, representing all VHA facilities, have prescribed naloxone, and more than 415,900 naloxone prescriptions have been dispense d to over 242,700 Veterans (as of the end of June 2020). In an effort to ensure timely access to nalo xone for emergency responding, VHA launched the Rapid Naloxone Initiative in September 2018 consisting of three elements: (1) OEND to VA patients at-risk for opioid ov erdose, (2) VA Police Naloxone, and (3) Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Cabinet Naloxone . As of April 2019, 116 facilities have equipped their Police with naloxone and 56 facilities have deployed na loxone in AED Cabinets. Across VA this has accounted for at least 693 AED Cabinets and 2,785 VA Police Officers equipped with naloxone. The impact of these efforts is apparent acro ss VHA. As documented through spontaneous reporting of overdose reversal events as well as through a national medica l record note, at least 911 lives have potentially been saved, with an additional 126 reversals reported from AED Cabinet and VA Police naloxone (6 and 120 reversals, resp ectively). VA has dispensed a naloxone kit for 1 in 5 patients on high dose opioids, as compared to 1 in 69 patients in the private sector. Finally, as part of the broader OEND effort, VH A has established a community of practice for sharing innovative and promisin g practices which has included discussion of post-overdose engagement in treatment. During FY 2019 , VHA implemented a process for documenting accidental and severe adverse effect overdoses as a component of suicide prevention efforts. Implementation of the Suicidal Behavior and Over dose Report (SBOR) note template provides a foundation for VHA to implement strategies design ed specifically to engage Veterans in timely treatment following a non-fatal over dose (opioid and non-opioid related). Veterans Justice Programs 4 The Uniform Mental Health Services Handbook affirmed that \"Police enco unters and pre-trial court proceedings are often missed opportunitie s to connect Veterans with VA mental health services as a negotiated alternative to incarceration or other criminal sanctions.\" VA medical centers provide outreach to justice-involved Veterans in the communities they serve. VA services for justice-involved Veterans are prov ided through two dedicated national programs, both prevention- oriented components of VA's Homeless Programs: Health Care for Reentry Veterans (HCRV) and Veterans Justice Outreach (VJO). Known collectively as the Veterans Justice Programs (VJP), HCRV and VJO facilitate access to needed VA health care and other 4 Additional budget detail and estimates on VA's Veterans Homelessness Programs, including VA's Justice Outreach Programs, will be included in VA's FY 202 2 Annual Budget Submission, Vol. II, Medical Programs and Information Technology Programs. 10 of 14 services for Veterans at all stages of the criminal justice process, from initial contact with law enforcement through community reentry following extended incarceration. HCRV Specialists provide outreach to Veterans approaching release from state and Federal prisons. They briefly assess reentry Veterans' prob able treatment needs, help Veterans plan to access responsive services upon release, and provide post-release follow-up as needed to ensure that Veterans are engaged with needed services. Most HCRV Specialists are based at VA medical centers, but they typically serve Veterans across a large area, often conducting outreach to prison facilities in at least one entire state, and someti mes an entire VISN. VJO Specialists serve Veterans at earlier stages of the criminal justice process, with a three- pronged focus on outreach to community law enfo rcement, jails, and courts. VJO Specialists at each VA medical center work with Veterans in the local criminal courts (including but not limited to the Veterans Treatment Courts, or VTCs), conduc t outreach in local jails, and engage with local law enforcement by delivering VA-focused training sessions and other informational presentations. Each VA medical center has at least one VJO Specialist, who serves as a liaison between VA and the local criminal justice system. Public Law 115-240, The Veterans Treatment Co urt Improvement Act of 2018, signed September 17, 2018, required VA to hire 50 new Veterans Justice Outreach Specialists to serve in VTCs, in addition to their other outreach duties. Following an announ cement of new position awards on December 26, 2018, VA medical centers are acti vely recruiting and hi ring additional VJO Specialists in response to this legislation. As of June 2020, 49 new VJO positions have been filled. Veterans who are seen by HCRV and VJO Specialists access VA mental health and substance use treatment at high rates. Most Veterans seen in the VJO program have a mental health (77 percent), substance use disorder (71 percent) diagno sis, or both (58 percent). Within one year of their VJO outreach visit, 97 pe rcent of Veterans with mental health diagnoses had had at least one VHA mental health vi sit, and 78 percent had at least six visits. Within the same timeframe, 72 percent of Veterans with substance use di sorder diagnoses had had at least one VHA substance use disorder visit, and 54 percent had had at least six. Veterans seen by HCRV Specialists have a similar profile, with 56 percent with a mental he alth diagnosis, 55 percent with a substance use disorder diagnosis, and 39 pe rcent with both. Veterans in HCRV access VA care at high rates, but slightly lower than those in VJO with 93 percent of those with a mental health diagnosis having at least one vi sit, and 64 percent ha ving at least six visits. For those with a substance use disorder, 57 percent had at least on e visit, and 37 percent had at least six. Improving access to treatment and care for this segment of the Veteran population is in direct alignment with the identified agency goals. In communities where justice programs relevant to Veterans exist (Veterans courts, drug courts, mental health courts, and police crisis interventio n teams), VA has taken the initiative in building working relationships to ensure that eligible justice-involved Veterans get needed care. In communities where no such programs exist, VA has reached out to potential justice system partners (judges, prosecutors, police, and jail ad ministrators) to connect eligible justice-involved Veterans with needed VA services including addi ction treatment. VJO specialists currently serve Veterans in 561 Veterans Treatment Courts and other Veteran-focused courts, with more planned. Their duties in a Veterans Treatment Court include linkage to VHA treatment services. In communities without Veterans Treatment Courts, VA medical centers have established relationships with a range of j ustice system and community partners, including police and sheriffs' 13 of 14 removal of access barriers this has included an emphasis on sustained engagement in treatment. It is important to note that the percent of Ve terans for whom performance data are available continues to increase, reflectin g VHA's commitment to provision of evidence -based, outcome- informed quality care. Over 9,750 Veterans were assessed at the beginning of substance use disorder specialty care during the 4th quarter of FY 2019. Research and Development The resources VHA invests in research helps ai d efforts to improve substance use disorder prevention, diagnosis, and treatment while improv ing the effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility, and quality of Veterans' health care. In FY 2019, VHA exceeded targets for the numbers of studies relevant to substance use (28) or alcohol use (49) disorders and increased opioid use disorder research from 12 studies to 24 studies in progress. This distinction of a new ca tegory for opioid research aligns with heightened focus activity on management of opioid use and abuse. Two areas of specific focus are prevention and treatment. Prevention. Research on prevention include prescription drug monitoring programs (prescribing within and outside of the VA), safe opioid tapering, identi fying those at risk for adverse effects of opioids, changes in prescribing practice, and its effect on patients. There are 7 projects in the realm of preventi on of adverse events associated with opioid therapy. In addition, ORD has funded several projects examining genetic vulnerability to substance abuse, response to opiate agonis ts (Medication Assisted Treatment; MAT), and pain resilience to determine why some indi viduals are more susceptible to opioid addiction, response to treatment, and why so me individuals can live with higher levels of pain while others cannot. Genetic approaches take advantage of VA's Million Veteran Program genomic data that is providing VA with a wealth of information on addictive risk and behaviors. Treatment. Studies on treatm ent focus on the efficacy of care delivery (Stepped Care for OUD) and implementation of evidence-based treatment programs (Stepped Care for OUD Train the Trainer, MAT delive ry, and non-pharmacological ap proaches to treat pain in patients with OUD) within the VA Health Care System. Many of the projects address access to care, including the use and expa nsion of telehealth to provide treatment alternatives to patients with OUD living in rural areas. This includes making MAT available at Community-Based Outpatient Clinics and determining where telehealth should be prioritized. Other areas of research include co-existing conditions such as mental health (PTSD) and/or SUD, with OUD. In all, ther e are 13 projects on treatment approaches. National Drug Control Strategy Goals (NDCS) VHA has previously provided data on initiatives that support br oader goals outlined by the NDCS Performance Reporting System with information provided in support of NDCS Goals 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6. NDCS Goal 3, \"Evidence -based addiction treatment, including Medication-Assisted Treatment for opioid addiction, is more accessibl e nationwide\" defines a national target for the percent of providers certified to certified to administer, prescribe, and dispense buprenorphine for opioid use disorder to 10 percent within 5 year s (FY 2022). During FY 2019, 7.8 percent of providers with a DEA number eligible to obtain an X-waiver had done so exceeding the national target of 5.6 percent for this same time period. At the end of quarter 2 FY 2020, 9.5 percent of providers with a DEA number eligible to obtain an X-waiver had done so. 14 of 14 B. Assertions 1.

The methodology used to calculate obligations of budgetary resources is reasonable and accurate in all material respects and as described herein was the actual methodology used to generate the costs. Accounting changes are as shown in the disclosures that follow. 2 of 17 DEPA RTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION Annual Reporting of FY 2020 Drug Control Funds DETAILED ACCOUNTING SUBMISSION A. Table of FY 2020 Drug Control Obligations 1. Drug Control Methodology The obligation tables for the FY 2020 Drug Control Obligations ( above ) and the Resource Summary (page 17) showing obligations and FTE (Full -Time Equivalent) for substance use disorder (SUD) treatment in Veterans Health Administration ( VHA) are based on specific patient encounters. The specific patient encounters include all inpatient and outpatient episodes of care either provided by VHA staff or purchased in the community. The source data for VHA inpatient care is the Patient Treatment File (PTF). For outpatient care, it is the National Patient Care Database Encounter file (SEFILE). For contract care, it is either the PTF or the hospital payment file. For traditional outpatient medical care in the Community (MCC) and Provider Agreement s (PA), it is the Provider Payment file. For Third Party Agreements (TPA) Choice, it is the expedited payments from the Office of Community Care (OCC) that are stored in the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW). All patient encounters have an associated diagn osis. The primary diagnosis is considered the reason the patient is being treated and is used to determine whether the treatment provided is a substance use disorder treatment and which type of substance use disorder . A list of the Diagnostic and Statist ical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification ( ICD- 10-CM) Diagnosis groups used for substance use disorders are shown in the following table : FY 2020 Description Actual Drug Resources by Budget Decision Unit: Medical Care.................................................................... $835.571 Medical & Prosthetic Research..................................... $19.320 Total.................................................................................. $854.891 Drug Resources by Drug Control Function: Treatment.......................................................................... $835.571 Research & Development.............................................. $19.320 Total.................................................................................. $854.891(In Millions) 3 of 17 Diagnosis Code Description ICD /Anxiolytic Related Disorders F14xx Cocaine Related Disorders F15xx Other Stimulant Related Disorders F16xx Hallucinogen Related Disorders F19xx Other Psychoactive Substance Related Disorders It should be noted that Prescriptions and Lab tests do not have linkages to a specific diagnosis and are not included in the report. The cost of VHA provided services is calculated by the Managerial Cost Accounting (MCA) System of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). MCA cost data is used at all levels of the VA for important functions, such as cost recovery (billing), budgeting and resource allocation. Additionally, the system contains a rich repository of clinical information, which is used to promote a more proactive approach to the care of high risk (i.e., diabetes and acute coronary patients) and high cost patients. VA MCA data is also used to calcu late and measure the productivity of physicians and other care providers. The basic unit of MCA cost is the product. For VHA a product can range from a prescription fill made through a mail -out pharmacy, to an outpatient dental exam, to a bed -day of ca re in an Intensive Care Unit. Every product that is delivered is fully costed. This means that all direct labor, direct supply , and associated indirect costs (to include local and national overhead costs) are applied. Once they are fully costed, product s are then assigned to the applicable patient encounter. MCA costs are the basis for the obligations displayed in the ONDCP report. The Allocation Resource Center (ARC) develops ARC cost, which is computed by taking the MCA cost and removing the non -patient specific costs, such as Operating costs for Headquarters, Veterans Integrated Service Network ( VISN ) Support, National Programs, and Capital and State Home costs, and adding in the community care payments. For budget purposes, ARC costs are transforme d into obligations to account for the entire VHA Budget. It is a multi -step methodology that is implemented to compute obligations. The ARC costs are divided into their appropriations using cost centers identified in their Monthly Program Cost Report (MPCR), which is a MCA Account Level Budget (ALB) based report that accounts for all the costs that comprise the MCA system. A facility specific ratio of obligations to ARC cost for non -capital costs is created and multiplied by the expenditures to create medical center specific obligations. Assign the medical center capital obligations to VHA services proportional to cost. Aggregate th e national overhead obligations by cost center into their appropriations and assign them to patient services proportional to cost. Balance the final obligations nationally to the SF133 Report on Budget Execution total proportionately . 4 of 17 MEDICAL CARE Year in Review During FY 2020, 243,254 Veterans who received services within VHA were diagnosed with a drug use disorder. Of these Veterans, VA provided services by mental health clinicians in a variety of outpatient settings to nearly 82 percent (198,444) of Veterans with any diagnosis of a drug use disorder. Among Veterans receiving treatment within VA in FY 2020, approximately 16 percent (39,240) used amphetamines, around 27 percent (65,717) used cocaine, around 28 percent (68,174) used opioids, and aroun d 52 percent (127,671) used cannabis. (These categories are not mutually exclusive.) Data for FY 2020 reflect a decline in utilization of VHA services by Veterans experiencing substance use concerns believed to be related to the pandemic. The decrease in the number of Veterans with a SUD diagnoses served is not believed to be reflective of a change in demand for SUD services. VHA moved rapidly to ensure sustainment of treatment services, rapidly transitioning SUD specialty services to telehealth platforms . VHA also worked closely with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to ensure continued access to medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder (M -OUD). In reviewing available data on utilization of SUD specialty s ervices, Veterans are gradually re - engaging with SUD services. Since the start of the pandemic, VHA has seen a significant increase in the utilization of telehealth (telephone only and audio/visual) to support provision of SUD specialty treatment with the overall number of telehealth SUD specialty encounters increasing from slightly more than 12,000 in October 2019 to slightly more than 108,000 in October 2020. As requested, VHA is exploring available data that would allow for more precise information related to Veteran requests for SUD treatment and subsequent engagement in care. At the current time, this information is not available. Development of SUD specific content for the new electronic health record is continuing with the expectation that this in formation will be available in the future. VHA continues to improve service delivery and efficiency by integrating services for mental health disorders, including SUD, into primary care settings. Veterans from Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn/Operation Inherent Resolve (OEF/OIF/OND/OIR) and Veterans from other eras are served in primary care teams (Patient Aligned Care Teams: PACTs) that have co -located mental health staff to identify and addre ss potential mental health and substance use treatment needs. Secondary prevention services include diagnosis and assessment of possible substance use disorders in patients presenting medical problems that suggest elevated risk of substance use disorders ( e.g., treatment for Hepatitis C, prescribed opioid medications). Recognizing the importance of team -based care, VHA is implementing the Behavioral Health Interdisciplinary Program - Collaborative Chronic Care Model (BHIP -CCM) at every VA facility. Implementation of BHIP - CCM teams within general mental health further supports VA's commitment to providing access to chronic disease management and treatment for substance use disorders beyond specialty SUD treatment settings. Most Veterans with substa nce use disorders are treated in outpatient programs. Outpatient detoxification is available for patients who are medically stable and who have sufficient social support systems to monitor their status. Standard outpatient programs typically treat patien ts one or two hours per session and patients are generally seen once or twice a week. Intensive 5 of 17 substance use disorder outpatient programs provide at least three hours of service per day and patients attend three or more days per week. Considering the fr equent co -occurrence of substance use disorders with posttraumatic stress disorder, VHA has also assigned a substance use disorder specialist to each of its hospital - level posttraumatic stress disorder services or teams. The staff person is an integral me mber of the posttraumatic stress disorder clinical services team and works to integrate substance use disorder care with all other aspects of posttraumatic stress disorder -related care. Among the specialists' responsibilities are identification and treatm ent of Veterans with co -occurring substance use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Specialists also promote preventive services for Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder who are at risk for developing a substance use disorder. VHA provides two types of 24 -hour care to patients with severe, complex, or acute substance use disorders. These include inpatient withdrawal management and stabilization in numerous medical and general mental health units and provision of care in Mental Health Resid ential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs (otherwise referred to as Domiciliary beds). VHA offers care in Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs (MH RRTPs) to Veterans with complex, co -occurring mental health, substance use, medical, a nd psychosocial needs. Specialty Domiciliary SUD programs provide treatment equivalent to Level 3.7, Medically Monitored Intensive Inpatient Services as specified by the American Society of Addiction Medicine Patient Placement Criteria. At the end of FY 20 20, 68 Domiciliary SUD programs were in operation with more than 1,800 beds focused specifically on intensive, medically monitored residential SUD treatment. In addition to those MH RRTPs formally designated as Domiciliary SUD programs, additional SUD spe cialized services are offered through tracks in other MH RRTPs and the majority of Veterans served by MH RRTPs are diagnosed with a substance use disorder. Programs to end homelessness among Veterans are encouraged to have SUD specialists as a part of t heir multidisciplinary teams. There are SUD specialists working in the Department of Housing and Urban Development - VA Supportive Housing (HUD -VASH), Grant and Per Diem (GPD) and the Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) programs; however, the use of SUD specialists can vary locally based on site -specific needs. These specialists emphasize early identification of substance use disorders as a risk for maintaining permanent housing, promote engagement or re -engagement in SUD specialty care programs and s erve as linkages between homeless and SUD programs. Methamphetamine VA recognizes the emerging threat that methamphetamine poses to our nation's Veterans. Specific data on the rates of methamphetamine use disorder are not available. However, the overall rates of amphetamine use disorder have been increasing over the past several years. The number of Veterans who received care for amphetamine use disorder decreased somewhat due to the pandemic with 39,240 Veterans who received care in VA during FY 2020 having an amphetamine use disorder diagnosis. VA's commitment to provision of evidence - based treatment has positioned VA well to respond to this emerging threat. Contingency Management (CM) is an evidence -based treatment with demonstrated efficacy in treating stimulant use disorder. VA implemented CM in 2011, and through September 2020, VA has provided contingency management services to over 5,400 Veterans with over 92 percent of the greater than 7,000 urine samples testing negative for the target drug(s) (e.g . stimulants or cannabis). 6 of 17 Opioid Use Disorder Slightly more than 68,100 Veterans with an opioid use disorder (OUD) diagnosis were seen in VA in FY 2020. Medication for OUD (M -OUD) has historically been provided in SUD specialty -care clinics, but a signi ficant number of Veterans with clinically diagnosed OUD do not access SUD specialty care. By disseminating evidence -based models for delivery of M - OUD in primary care, mental health, and pain management clinics, Veterans are expected to have timely access to the right treatment at their preferred point of care. VA launched the Stepped Care for Opioid Use Disorder Train the Trainer (SCOUTT) initiative in August 2018 with the intent of supporting the expansion of M -OUD in level 1 clinics (primary care, gene ral mental health and pain management clinics). Phase 1 sites in each VISN implemented this expansion during FY 2019. From August 2018 through September 2020 , there was a 136 percent increase in the number of patients receiving buprenorphine in the initi al Phase 1 level One clinics and 163 percent increase in the number of providers prescribing buprenorphine in these clinics. Further, Veterans are being retained in care with 71 percent of Veterans retained on buprenorphine for more than 90 days. Phase 2 of the SCOUTT initiative was launched in FY 2020 with planned regional conferences converted to a National Virtual SCOUTT conference that took place in September 2020 with over 300 attendees. Phase 2 teams from new facilities in each VISN are beginning imp lementation efforts. Further, the infrastructure developed to support the SCOUTT initiative also supports efforts by facilities across the country to expand access to M -OUD in level 1 clinics with a 51 percent increase in the number of Veterans receiving buprenorphine in any level 1 clinic between August 2018 and September 2020 and an 82 percent increase in the number of providers prescribing buprenorphine in those clinics. In FY 2020, evidence -based M -OUD, including office -based treatment with buprenorphine and extended -release injectable naltrexone, was accessible to patients seen at 100 percent of VA medical centers. VA operates federally regulated opioid treatment programs that can provide methadone maintenance on -site at 33 larger urban lo cations and at a growing number of VHA facilities that maintain contractual arrangements or arrange non -VA care for providing care through community -based licensed opioid treatment programs. VHA continues to expand the availability of M -OUD for Veterans. V A monitors the percent of patients with OUD who receive M -OUD (44.4 percent during FY 2020) as part of the Psychotropic Drug Safety Initiative (PDSI). PDSI is a nationwide psychopharmacology quality improvement (QI) program that supports facility -level QI through quarterly quality metrics, clinical decision support tools, technical assistance for QI strategic implementation, and a virtual learning collaborative. Since 4th quarter FY 2019, VA has seen a 4 percent increase in the number of Veterans that recei ved M -OUD (total of 27,571, 4 FY 2020). The number of providers with a Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA) X-waiver has also continued to increase since the 4th quarter FY 2019 with over 5,500 providers who have written any prescription issued to the VA pharmacy (VA employed and community providers serving Veterans) in September 2020 holding an X -Waiver. This reflects an increase of 27 percent from the same time point in FY 2019. VA has realized that it will be critical to go beyond providers obtainin g a waiver that allows them to prescribe buprenorphine. The number of providers with a DEA X -waiver that prescribed buprenorphine during FY 2020 was significantly lower than the number of providers with an X -waiver with only 24 percent of those providers w ith an X -waiver issuing a prescription for buprenorphine in September 2020. While the number of providers is increasing, VA is focusing efforts to remove barriers to prescribing and to support the initiation of buprenorphine when indicated. VHA Notice 201 9-18, Buprenorphine Prescribing for Opioid Use Disorder was published in October 2019 and re - 7 of 17 issued in September 2020 by the Undersecretary with the intent of clarifying national policy and tasking facilities to remove potential barriers to prescribing if present. In addition, in July 2020, VA formalized efforts to provide training for providers to support efforts to ensure that all providers eligible to obtain an X -waiver have access to the training. Between July and November 2020 , VA offered trainings to providers with over 180 providers trained. Seven additional trainings are planned with 2 trainings planned for December 2020 with over 150 providers registered. VA recognizes the importance of capturing more detailed information on providers most likely to prescribe buprenorphine for OUD and has developed tools that will allow for improved understanding of availability of X -waivered providers by practice setting. In support of interprofessional team -based models of care, VA is leveraging Clinical Pharmacy Specialist (CPS) providers to deliver comprehensive medication management services and improve Veteran access to SUD care. In partnership with the VA Office of Rural Health, the VA Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Clinical Pharmacy Practice Offi ce launched a nationwide initiative in FY 2020 to expand the CPS provider workforce focused on SUD care. Since initiation, 51 VA facilities have been awarded funding to hire 64 CPS providers across Mental Health, Pain Management, Primary Care , and Special ty Care settings with a focus of expanding access to OUD and alcohol use disorder (AUD) care for rural Veterans. As part of this project, three regional train -the-trainer clinical pharmacy boot camps were held virtually in June and July 2020 and trained 234 VA -CPS providers in OUD and AUD care. The training focused on advancing CPS provider practice in SUD care and risk mitigation across level 1 clinics, in alignment with the SCOUTT initiative and offered subsequent office hours to further support CPS pract ice growth in SUD care. All boot camp participants completed 24-hour DEA X-waiver training prior to the boot camp in anticipation that future legislation may include pharmacist practitioners as potential providers of buprenorphine -based therapy, furthering access to M -OUD. As of the 4th quarter FY 2020, 141 VA CPS providers are routinely delivering OUD care with 32,566 encounters in FY 2020. This represents a 35.6 percent growth in CPS provider practice in OUD care delivery since the implementation of the SCOUTT initiative ; significant CPS practice growth in SUD care is expected in FY 2021. National Treatment Plan VA has developed a comprehensive plan in response to the National Drug Control Strategy - National Treatment Plan (NDCS -NTP) for SUD. VA's plan builds on the efforts described in detail earlier in this document with focus on expansion of SUD services for difficult to reach populations using a range of technologies, expansion of the Addiction workforce to include an expansion of peer support s ervices targeted to SUD services, and broad implementation of a stepped -care model to ensure there is \"no wrong door\" for Veterans requiring SUD treatment . Collaboration with Federal Partners VHA is committed to working collaboratively with other Federal Partners in support of the National Drug Control Strategy and will explore additional opportunities to share insights of VHA efforts to address SUD. With the support of ONDCP, VHA provided an update on VHA peer support services through a webinar in Septemb er 2020. Further more, VHA recently worked with Health and Human Services in FY 2020 to provide access for staff from Indian Health Services and the Bureau of Prisons to join the Clinical Pharmacy Boot Camps to support expansion of SUD services supported by Clinical Pharmacy Specialists with 32 Public Health Service partners participating in this virtual program. VA is currently working collaboratively with the Department of Defense (DoD) to share lessons learned across the agencies to support access to M -OUD, particularly for transitioning service members. 8 of 17 Opioid Safety Initiative VA continues to pursue a comprehensive strategy to promote safe prescribing of opioids when indicated for effective pain management. The purpose of the Opioid Safety Initiative ( OSI) is to ensure pain management is addressed thoughtfully, compassionately, and safely to make the totality of opioid use visible at all levels in the organization. Based on comparisons of national data between the quarter beginning in Quarter 4, FY 201 2 (beginning in July 2012) to Quarter 4, FY 2020 (ending in September 2020), many aspects of the OSI continue to show positive results. Despite an increase of 230,286 Veterans who were dispensed any medication from a VA pharmacy, 349,388 fewer Veterans we re on long -term opioids. The average dose of selected opioids has continued to decline as 58,123 fewer patients were receiving morphine equivalent daily doses greater than or equal to 90 milligrams, demonstrating that prescribing and consumption behaviors are changing. The desired results of OSI have been achieved during a time that VA has seen a 5.8 percent increase in Veterans that have utilized VA outpatient pharmacy services. Chronic pain is a national public health problem as outlined in the 2011 stu dy by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). At least 100 million Americans suffer from some form of chronic pain. The IOM study describes in detail many concerns of pain management, including system -wide deficits in the training of our Nation's health care pr ofessionals in pain management and substance use disorders prevention and management, and the problems caused by a fragmented health care system. The over -use and misuse of opioids for pain management in the United States is a consequence of a health care system that until recently was less than fully prepared to respond to these challenges. VHA has identified and broadly responded to the many challenges of pain management through policies supporting clinical monitoring, education and training of health professionals and teams, and expansion of clinical resources and programs. VA's Pain Manag ement Directive defines and describes policy expectations and responsibilities for the overall National Pain Management Strategy and Stepped Care pain model, which is evidence -based and has been adopted by the DoD as well. Our approach to managing opioid over-use fits into this plan, and the VA has employed broad strategies to address the opioid epidemic: education, pain management, risk mitigation, and addiction treatment. First, VA addressed the problem of clinically inappropriate high -dose prescribing of opioids through the VA's national program, OSI. Second, VA developed an effective system of interdisciplinary, patient -aligned pain management with the competency to provide safe and effective pain control and quality of life for Veterans for the rema inder of their lives. VA has reduced the reliance on opioid medication for pain management by more than 60 percent since 2012, largely by starting fewer patients newly on long -term opioid therapy and by offering pain care options that are safer and more effective in the long run. The majority of the decline in VA opioid prescriptions is not due to Veterans \"getting by\" with fewer opioids, but by following a Stepped Care Model for Pain treatment addressing the causes of pain with fewer Veterans requiring the initiation of long -term opioid therapy. VA has been recognized by many as a leader in the pain management field for the responsible use of opioids. Notably, VA has organized many types of interdisciplinary pain care teams to help with medication safety, patient education, pain schools, cognitive behavioral therapy and helping patients transition from a biomedical to a biopsychosocial model of pain care. As VA continues its efforts to address opioid over -use, non -opioid treatments , and complementary and integrative medicine treatments (such as massage therapy, yoga, meditation, occupational therapy, 9 of 17 physical therapy, recreational therapy, acupuncture, tai chi, etc.) are an important component to VA's Pain Management Strategy. To further strengthen OSI and keep this trend moving in the right direction, VA has deployed state -of-the-art tools to help protect Veteran patients using high doses of opioids or with medical risk factors that put them at an increased risk of complication s from opioid medications including overdose. These tools, referred to as the Opioid Therapy Risk Report (OTRR) and the Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Mitigation (STORM), are available to all clinical staff in the VHA. These tools include information about the dosages of narcotics and other sedative medications, significant medical problems that could contribute to an adverse reaction and monitoring data to aid in the review and management of complex patients. The OTRR allows VA providers to review a ll pertinent clinical data related to pain treatment in one place, providing a comprehensive Veteran -centered and more efficient level of management not previously available to primary care providers. The STORM allows VA providers to view information about risk factors for opioid overdose, suicide -related events and other harms and recommends patient -specific risk mitigation strategies. Both tools are part of VA's broader efforts to prevent opioid overdose deaths. To address overdose and suicide risk, VHA r equired that patients identified as very high risk per the STORM predictive model receive a case review by an interdisciplinary team including pain, addiction and mental health expertise. Preliminary findings from a randomized policy evaluation of this ne w clinical program found that patients targeted for case review had lower rates of all -cause mortality and medical record documented adverse events, such as motor vehicle accidents and overdose. Additionally, VHA has formalized a system -wide Academic De tailing program that is in process of being implemented throughout the organization. Academic Detailing provides specialty teams to visit facilities and provide on -site support and education to providers to further enhance pain management efforts. The Acad emic Detailing program is another important step to improve mental health, substance use disorder, and pain management medication therapy across all VA medical center s. As of September 30, 2020, academic detailers (specially trained VA Pharmacists) have h eld 61,627 outreach visits related to Opioid Safety, Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution, opioid use disorder, and suicide prevention. As VA continues its efforts to address opioid over -use, complementary and integrative medicine treatments are a n important component to VA's Pain Management Strategy. VA currently offers many complementary and integrative medicine treatments, many of which may be useful in chronic pain. These treatments include acupressure, acupuncture, biofeedback, chiropractic services, exercise, heated pool therapy, hypnosis/hypnotherapy, massage therapy, meditation, occupational therapy, physical therapy, recreational therapy, relaxation, tai chi, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, yoga and other services. VA has s everal other programs that are complementary to the Opioid Safety Initiative and include: State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP): 49 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico are activated for VA data transmission. From Quarter 3, Fiscal Year 2013 (ending in June 2013) to Quarter 4, Fiscal Year 20 20 (ending September 20 20), VA providers have documented over 7.9 million queries to State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs to help guide treatment decisions. 10 of 17 Medication Take -Back Program: VA offers free medication take back services to Veterans through mail -back envelopes and on -site receptacles compliant with DE A regulations. As of September 30, 2020, Veterans have returned over 203.5 tons of unwanted or unneeded medication using these services . Opioid Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution The VA Opioid Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND) program aims to decrease opioid -related overdose deaths among VHA patients by providing education on opioid overdose prevention, recognition of opioid overdose, and training on the rescue response, including provision of naloxone. All three Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - approved forms of naloxone (injectable, nasal spray and auto -injector) that the FDA states can be considered as options for community distribution were added to the VA National Formulary as soon as they were available. The nasal spray formulation is currently available through every VHA facility. VHA assembled injectable (intramuscular) naloxone kits as part of its initial OEND program. These were replaced by the auto -injector \u2014specifically designed for layperson use \u2014when that formula tion became available. However, the auto -injector was abruptly discontinued by the pharmaceutical manufacturer on September 30, 2020. In response, VHA is currently working on re -assembling the injectable (intramuscular) naloxone kits. VHA recommends off ering OEND to Veterans prescribed or using opioids who are at increased risk for opioid overdose or whose provider deems it clinically indicated. Academic Detailing has promoted OEND through individualized, evidence -based educational outreach visits and c onsultation for clinicians by clinicians. In July 2016, Congress took the important step of eliminating copayment requirements for opioid antagonists (e.g., naloxone) furnished to Veterans at high risk for overdose and for education on their use (per P. L. 114 -98, title IX, the Jason Simcakoski Memorial and Promise Act). This change has been implemented throughout VHA and a proposed rule has been published in the Federal Register to amend two of VA's copayment regulations, 38 CFR 17.108 and 17.110, to a ccurately implement these changes into law. The proposed rule also defines who VA considers to be at high risk for overdose. This definition will assist in the implementation of the public law and to facilitate the identification of such Veterans. Early identification of these Veterans can facilitate provision of lifesaving opioid antagonist medication. Since implementation of the OEND program in 2014, over 28,100 VHA prescribers, representing all VHA facilities, have prescribed naloxone, and more than 450 ,000 naloxone prescriptions have been dispensed to over 254,800 Veterans (as of the end of September 2020). Through the end of FY 2020, as documented through spontaneous reporting of overdose reversal events as well as through the national note, over 1,5 00 overdose reversals with naloxone have been reported. In an effort to ensure timely access to naloxone for emergency responding, VHA launched the Rapid Naloxone Initiative in September 2018 consisting of three elements: (1) OEND to VA patients at -risk for opioid overdose, (2) VA Police Naloxone, and (3) Autom ated External Defibrillator (AED) Cabinet Naloxone. As documented through spontaneous reporting of overdose reversal events as well as through a national medical record note, over 1,500 overdose reversals with naloxone have been reported through FY 2020. In 2018 VA dispensed a naloxone prescription for 1 in 5 patients on high dose opioids, as compared to 1 in 69 patients in the private sector. Finally, as part of the broader OEND effort, VHA has established a community of practice for sharing innovative a nd promising practices which has included discussion of post -overdose 11 of 17 engagement in treatment. Materials developed in support of the OEND initiative also are available to Veterans, their family members, and the broader public. During FY 2019, VHA implemen ted a process for documenting accidental and severe adverse effect overdoses as a component of suicide prevention efforts. Implementation of the Suicide Behavior and Overdose Report (SBOR) note template provides a foundation for VHA to implement strategie s designed specifically to engage Veterans in timely treatment following a non -fatal overdose (opioid and non -opioid related). During FY 2021, VHA plans to build on that foundation to require use of the SBOR with a focus on continuing efforts to improvemen t post - overdose engagement in care Veterans Justice Programs The Uniform Mental Health Services Handbook affirmed that \"Police encounters and pre -trial court proceedings are often missed opportunities to connect Veterans with VA mental health services as a negotiated alternative to incarceration or other criminal sanctions.\" VA medical centers provide outreach to justice -involved Veterans in the communities they serve. VA services for justice -involved Veterans are provided through two dedicated national programs, both prevention -oriented components of VA's Homeless Programs: Health Care for Reentry Veterans (HCRV) and Veterans Justice Outreach (VJO). Known collectively a s the Veterans Justice Programs (VJP), HCRV and VJO facilitate access to needed VA health care and other services for Veterans at all stages of the criminal justice process, from initial contact with law enforcement through community reentry following exte nded incarceration. HCRV Specialists provide outreach to Veterans approaching release from state and Federal prisons. They briefly assess reentry Veterans' probable treatment needs, help Veterans plan to access responsive services upon release, and provi de post -release follow -up as needed to ensure that Veterans are engaged with needed services. Most HCRV Specialists are based at VA medical centers , but they typically serve Veterans across a large area, often conducting outreach to prison facilities in at least one entire state, and sometimes an entire VISN. VJO Specialists serve Veterans at earlier stages of the criminal justice process, with a three - pronged focus on outreach to community law enforcement, jails, and courts. VJO Specialists at each VA medical center work with Veterans in the local criminal courts (including but not limited to the Veterans Treatment Courts, or VTCs), conduct outreach in local jails, and engage with local law enforcement by delivering VA -focused training sessions and other informational presentations. Each VA medical center has at least one VJO Specialist, who serves as a liaison between VA and the local criminal justice system. Public Law 115 -240, The Veterans Treatment Court Improvement Act of 2018, signed September 17, 2 018, required VA to hire 50 new Veterans Justice Outreach Specialists to serve in VTCs, in addition to their other outreach duties. VA medical centers have filled all of these positions, as well as an additional 15 added in FY 2020. Veterans who are seen by HCRV and VJO Specialists access VA mental health and substance use treatment at high rates. Most Veterans seen in the VJO program have a mental health (77 percent) or substance use disorder (71 percent) diagnosis, or both (58 percent). Within one year of their VJO outreach visit, 97 percent of Veterans with mental health diagnoses had had at least one VHA mental health visit, and 78 percent had at least six visits. Within the same timeframe, 72 percent of Veterans with substance use disorder diagnoses had had at least one VHA substance use disorder visit, and 54 percent had had at least six. 12 of 17 Veterans seen by HCRV Specialists have a similar profile, with 56 percent with a mental health diagnosis, 55 percent with a substance use disorder diagnosis and 39 p ercent with both. Veterans in HCRV access VA care at high rates, but slightly lower than those in VJO with 93 percent of those with a mental health diagnosis having at least one visit, and 64 percent having at least six visits. For those with a substance u se disorder, 57 percent had at least one visit, and 37 percent had at least six. Improving access to treatment and care for this segment of the Veteran population is in direct alignment with the identified agency goals. In communities where justice pro grams relevant to Veterans exist (Veterans courts, drug courts, mental health courts, and police crisis intervention teams), VA has taken the initiative in building working relationships to ensure that eligible justice -involved Veterans get needed care. In communities where no such programs exist, VA has reached out to potential justice system partners (judges, prosecutors, police, and jail administrators) to connect eligible justice -involved Veterans with needed VA services including addiction treatment. V JO specialists currently serve Veterans in 561 Veterans Treatment Courts and other Veteran - focused courts, with more planned. Their duties in a Veterans Treatment Court include linkage to VHA treatment services. In communities without Veterans Treatment Courts, VA medical centers have established relationships with a range of justice system and community partners, including police and sheriffs' departments, local jail administrators, judges, prosecutors, public defenders, probation officers, and community mental health providers. Performance During FY 2020, VHA continued implementation of clinical symptom monitoring using the Brief Addiction Monitor that transmits responses to the national database. The Brief Addiction Monitor assists substance use disorder specialty care clinicians in initial treatment planning and monitoring the progress of patients while they are receiving care for a substance use disorder. This also serves as a basis for giving feedback to enhance each patient's motivation for c hange and informing clinical decisions, such as the intensity of care required for the patient. In addition to items addressing risk and protective factors for recovery, the Brief Addiction Monitor assesses self -reported substance use in the prior 30 days , which includes the use of any illicit and non -prescribed drugs, as well as specific substances. VHA has supplemented its current suite of internal indicators of substance use disorder care processes using administrative data related to a patient reporte d outcome measure derived from the Brief Addiction Monitor: abstinence from drug use at follow -up in a substance use disorder specialty treatment population. During the first three quarters of FY 2020 (allowing time for follow -up assessment during Quarter 4), VHA substance use disorder specialty outpatient programs assessed self -reported abstinence among 1,892 Veterans with drug use disorder diagnoses documented at admission. Among the Veterans who remained engaged in care and were reassessed 30 -90 days a fter admission, 79.1 percent reported abstinence from drugs during the previous 30 days, a level of performance that is largely unchanged from the prior year. Despite not reaching our stretch goal of 88 percent, current performance represents a high level of performance success in light of the chronic nature of substance use disorders and the challenges associated with use of abstinence as the primary indicator of success. As VHA has focused on removal of access barriers this has included an emphasis on sustained engagement in treatment. It is important to note that the percent of Veterans for whom performance data are available continues to increase, reflecting VHA's commitment to provision of evidence -based, outcome -informed quality care. Over 3,400 Vet erans were assessed at the beginning of SUD specialty care during the 4th quarter of FY 2020, a drop from the over 9,750 assessments in FY 2019. The drop likely is due both to a decrease in 13 of 17 SUD care during the COVID -19 pandemic and difficulty in completing the B rief Addiction Monitor virtually as care rapidly transitioned to use of telehealth modalities to ensure continuity of services. The accompanying Department of Veterans Affairs Resource Summary (page 15) was prepared in accordance with the following ONDCP circulars (a) National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews dated October 22, 2019 , (b) Budget Formulation, dated October 22, 2019 , and (c) Budget Execution, dated October 22, 2019 . In accord ance with the guidance provided in the Office of National Drug Control Policy's letter of September 7, 2004, VA's methodology only incorporates Specialized Treatment costs.

MEDICAL & PROSTHETIC RESEARCH The resources VHA invests in research helps aid efforts to improve substance use disorder prevention, diagnosis, and treatment while improving the effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility, and quality of Veterans' health care. In FY 2020, VHA exceeded targets for the numbers of studies relevant to substance use (28) or alcohol use (49) disorders and increased opioid use disorder research from 12 studies to 24 studies in progress. This distinction of a new category for opioid research aligns with heightened focus activ ity on management of opioid use and abuse. Two areas of specific focus are prevention and treatment. Prevention. Research on prevention include prescription drug monitoring programs (prescribing within and outside of the VA), safe opioid tapering, identif ying those at risk for adverse effects of opioids, changes in prescribing practice, and its effect on patients. There are 7 projects in the realm of prevention of adverse events associated with opioid therapy. In addition, ORD has funded several projects examining genetic vulnerability to substance abuse, response to opiate agonists (Medication Assisted Treatment; MAT), and pain resilience to determine why some individuals are more susceptible to opioid addiction, response to treatment, and why some indivi duals can live with higher levels of pain while others cannot. Genetic approaches take advantage of VA's Million Veteran Program genomic data that is providing VA with a wealth of information on addictive risk and behaviors. Treatment. Studies on treatme nt focus on the efficacy of care delivery (Stepped Care for OUD) and implementation of evidence -based treatment programs (Stepped Care for OUD Train the Trainer, MAT delivery, and non -pharmacological approaches to 14 of 17 treat pain in patients with OUD) within th e VA Health Care System. Many of the projects address access to care, including the use and expansion of telehealth to provide treatment alternatives to patients with OUD living in rural areas. This includes making MAT available at Community -Based Outpat ient Clinics and determining where telehealth should be prioritized. Other areas of research include co -existing conditions such as mental health (PTSD) and/or SUD, with OUD. In all, there are 13 projects on treatment approaches .

Methodology Modifications - In accordance with the guidance provided in the Office of National Drug Control Policy's letter of September 7, 2004, VA's methodology only incorporates Specialized Treatment costs and no longer takes into consideration Other Related Treatment costs. D rug control methodology detailed in A.1 was the actual methodology used to generate the Resource Summary. 3. Material Weaknesses or Other Findings - CliftonLarsonAllen LLP provided an unmodified opinion on VA's FY 2020 consolidated financial statements. They identified five material weaknesses as well as certain conditions regarding noncompliance with laws and regulations. The material weaknesses relate to: 1) Controls over Significant Accounting Estimates (Modified repeat); 2) Community Car e Obligations, Undelivered Orders (UDOs), and Accrued Expenses (Modified repeat); 3) Financial Systems and Reporting (Repeat comment); 4) Information Technology (IT) Security Controls (Repeat comment); and 5) Entity Level Controls including CFO Organizatio nal Structure (Repeat comment). The conditions regarding noncompliance with laws and regulations included findings of noncompliance in : a) Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) (repeat comment); b) Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) (repeat comment); c) Noncompliance with 38 USC 5315 - collection of interest on debt owed by Veterans to VBA (repeat comment); d) Anti -deficiency Act (repeat comment); e) Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA), as reported by th e Office of Inspector General (repeat comment). 4. Reprogrammings or Transfers - There w ere no reprogramming of funds or transfers that adjusted drug control -related funding because drug control expenditures are reported based on patients served in vario us VA clinical settings for specialized substance abuse treatment programs. 5. Other Disclosures - This budget accounts for drug control -related costs fo r VHA Medical Care and Research. It does not include all drug -related costs for the agency. VA incur s costs related to accounting and security of narcotics and other controlled substances and costs of law enforcement related to illegal drug activity; however, these costs are assumed to be relatively small and would not have a material effect on the repor ted costs. 15 of 17 B.
