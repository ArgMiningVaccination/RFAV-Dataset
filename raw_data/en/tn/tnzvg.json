August 30 Meets weekly - 8 Wednesdays: SEP 6 - Oct 25 Different emotional states affect the physical body and its systems differently. Trauma is not about the size or severity of what happens to you. Trauma is what occurs when you don't feel safe, or feel too overwhelmed to feel emotional sensations due to an event that occurred. Through an Integrative Yoga Therapy program one learns how to slowly and safely feel these states and allow the trapped emotional memory (i.e. energy) to move its way through and out somatically, thus finding balance and equanimity again. In this Integrative Yoga Therapy and Support Group for Trauma, you will learn an in-depth understanding of the effects of trauma on the brain, nervous system, and the body on all levels (physical, energetic, mental, and spiritual). You will be guided through holistic practices to help navigate what's been trapped and stuck within your body and find freedom and release through yoga, somatic practices, breathwork, sound healing, and meditation and deep relaxation techniques to integrate and balance your mind, body, and spirit, leaving the group with the tools to feel empowered, strong, and capable in your life. *space is limited to 10 participants. *This is a confidential yoga therapy group.
