[Dr. Bruce Lipton](/topic/bruce-lipton) is a cellular biologist and leader in the field of epigenetics, which holds that external factors can affect our gene expression. Lipton's research over many decades has suggested that it is our environment, and even more importantly how we perceive it, that determines our gene behavior. \"Less than one percent of disease is connected to genes,\" Lipton said. \"Over 90 percent of illness is stress, which means you're not living in harmony with the environment, and the function of the cells is to adjust their biology to the environment. But I say, 'But wait, the brain is the interface between the environment and the genes.' So, my cells don't know what the real environment is, my cells only respond to my perception of the environment. Well, positive thoughts can heal you of any disease, that's placebo (effect).\" \"Negative thinking can cause any disease, regardless of what genes you have, because negative thinking through epigenetics can rewrite healthy genes and turn them into cancer. You're creating the good, but you also have to recognize you are participating in creating the negative things as well,\" he said. The biggest roadblock to exerting a positive influence over our genes, Lipton says, comes from faulty programming. \"All of us got programmed the first seven years of our life. We play the program 95 percent of the day,\" Lipton said. \"The conscious mind, which is the creator mind, is separate from the subconscious mind, which is the programmed mind. The significance is that subconscious is on autopilot, and if 95 percent of your life is coming from the subconscious, then you are playing programs and you're not playing creator. The issue is the programs we got in the first seven years, up to 60 percent of those programs are beliefs, they're things that are disempowering, they're self-sabotaging, or limiting behaviors, and therefore, we're losing power in the program that says, 'Who do you think you are? You don't deserve that. You're not that smart.' These are things we acquired when "}
