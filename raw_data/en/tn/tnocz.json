Meaghan Clemens, DC, CCAc is a chiropractor and certified chiropractic acupuncturist. She's also the owner of Natural Health Chiropractic & Wellness, serving patients throughout Naperville, Illinois, and the surrounding area. Dr. Clemens is a second-generation chiropractor and one of three practicing chiropractors in her family. Because of her upbringing, she's always been passionate about chiropractic as a means of health care. She was adjusted immediately at birth and has been adjusted regularly ever since as a means of staying healthy. There have been multiple occasions in her life that were defined by the extraordinary benefits of chiropractic care and ultimately led to her becoming a doctor of chiropractic. She'll be happy to tell you the stories, just ask! Dr. Clemens was born and raised in Michigan. She attended Michigan State University and double majored, earning a Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology and a Bachelor of Arts in Business Management. While at MSU she was a scholarship athlete on the Women's Rowing team. During her second year on the team, her boat became the first in school history to place in the finals at the NCAA national championship for crew. She firmly believes that receiving regular chiropractic care contributed to her athletic success. After graduating from college, Dr. Clemens moved to Iowa, where she attended the oldest and most renowned chiropractic school in the world: Palmer College of Chiropractic. She completed the five-year Doctorate of Chiropractic program in just a little over three years. She also took multiple elective courses to increase her knowledge and enhance her skills, particularly related to nutrition and extremity adjusting. Prior to graduating, she traveled as part of a 25-doctor mission team to Manaus, Brazil to provide chiropractic care to the underserved people in the community. Dr. Clemens finished her schooling by completing an internship at one of the most successful chiropractic clinics in Chicago. After graduating from chiropractic school, Dr. Clemens was hired at another of Chicago's most prominent chiropractic clinics before moving to Naperville to open her own office. Dr. Clemens uses a whole-person approach to chiropractic care. It's her belief that the body can't simply be viewed as a back, arm or an illness. Each part must come together in the same manner as pieces of a puzzle would. This approach to health means looking for and treating the underlying causes of a problem, which may or may not be causing symptoms. After identifying the underlying factors responsible for your problems, she then works with you to create a treatment plan and lifestyle adjustments that optimize the conditions for healing and normal function. Through this unique approach, Dr. Clemens is able to help you restore wellness and/or maintain your journey to good health. Please contact Natural Health Chiropractic & Wellness today!
