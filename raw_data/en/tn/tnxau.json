To forgive is not to condone, and not to forget. It is said that holding onto resentment is like holding onto a hot stone, expecting it to burn another person when in truth, it is burning you. When you forgive, you let go of the stone. We feel it is important to discuss the wisdom of forgiveness to get a more holistic and rooted understanding of how forgiveness can change not only lives, but entire communities. You are invited to join us in a powerful, relaxing & healing movement! There are Thousands of Circles around the world gathering on the full moon unifying with the intention of healing. The full moon in Cancer is a positive time for personal transformation around blockages of our energies. What would life look like if you trusted your voice, asked for what you wanted, and shared the full spectrum of your gifts with the world. In this ceremony YOU will unearth what holds you back. We will practice deep listening and honoring the self. This four stages of healing ceremony will include workshop, ritual and meditation. - Forgiveness Journaling Exercise Where are you currently holding onto resentments, anger, or blame towards others, or yourself? As we observe these areas we begin to take steps to move forward in the direction of forgiveness and liberating yourself. - Thai Partner Massage Workshop Forgiveness is the essence of releasing resentment, and relaxing into your natural state of being which cultivates an open heart and compassion. In this workshop, we will hold space for our fellow brothers and sisters through sacred touch, offering forgiveness and loving our bodies and souls - Forgiveness Ritual The intention of this ritual is to release areas where we have felt hurt, left out, judged and uncared for. We will work on forgiving those that have hurt us and also those we have hurt. Choosing to forgive brings radical relief and growth. - Signature Heart Yoga Nidra Meditation We will end the evening with a relaxing sound bath guided meditation to move the brain deep into delta brainwave states where we let our subconscious do the work.
