There are the documents to gather, the Statement of Net Worth to complete, the countless conversations to endure negotiating the terms, maybe even, the selling of the house \u2014 that signing that final document must mean the end of the divorce, right?

A divorce ritual is a symbolic event that marks the end of a marriage. It will likely look different to every woman, for there is no set definition or ceremony that constitutes a divorce ritual. It is unique and special to each individual. Divorce rituals step away from the logical and rational thought accompanying the divorce's legal process. Instead, divorce rituals play on the abstract, like emotions and spirituality, to mark the completion of your divorce and transition into a new life. A divorce ritual allows you to find closure in your heart in a way that the legal process does not. Divorce rituals can also serve multiple, important purposes, like helping you let go of the difficult past and set the stage for your new life. In this way, they celebrate an ending and a new beginning. Divorce rituals allow you to acknowledge your previous suffering and turn those pains into wisdom as you move forward. As they are unique to each individual, it is essential when considering your divorce ritual to think about what would be best for you. How will you acknowledge and let go of your past relationship?

But for those who are dealing with or recovering from divorce, the need to address this major shift in your life is obvious. There is a yearning to address the tugging of your heart that is almost indescribable. So, to honor you, and what you've been going through, we have identified a few ideas and common examples of divorce rituals to inspire and to help guide you as you embark on your new path. Symbolism and Cleansing Elements If you don't know where to begin in creating your divorce ritual, you might consider focusing your energy on a specific symbol of your marriage. This might be a classic item like your ring or wedding license, or something unique that represents your marriage, like a wedding picture or photo album. As you think about your divorce ritual, what it will entail, and perhaps focus on, it [ can be helpful to connect with the elements of the earth.](https://www.divorcemag.com/articles/rituals-of-divorce) For example, you might consider fire, a transformative energy that relates to anger and power, to burn your divorce papers and melt down your ring. This might help release your heart from some feelings of rage and hatred. You might also connect with the element of water, which can be associated with sadness, longing, and grieving. You might release your wedding symbol or a letter to your Ex into the water, either in a bottle, or sinking it with a thread and stone, or in its own [Viking funeral boat](https://www.history.com/news/how-did-the-vikings-honor-their-dead), thus releasing yourself and your story with this person. Reversal of Marriage Ceremony Some women may convert an aspect of their original marriage ceremony into a divorce ritual. For example, a common Christian wedding tradition is the lighting of the unity candle. This is when the bride and groom take two individual candles representing themselves and light one candle in the middle representing their marriage. They then blow out their candles to symbolize the end of their individuality and the start of their commitment to each other and unity. A divorce ritual based might reverse the unity candle idea. You might snuff out the symbolic shared candle and light your individual candle while visualizing what this independent version of yourself looks like. This can be done on your own or as part of a larger gathering of loved ones who witness you. This type of ritual flips the notion of marriage into the energy needed to start your new, independent life.

This allows both spouses to end the marriage in a more positive light. This kind of divorce ritual might involve sharing one last special meal together, or one last toast while listening to music or songs that were symbolic of their marriage. Other couples choose to share a bed one last time. This is to mirror the end of the relationship with the beginning, and help you embrace your newfound life as a single person. Not all divorce rituals need to be planned out. They can be spontaneous. You might feel in your gut that something must be done to mark your transition, like an impromptu prayer, or a long trek or pilgrimage where you will get in touch with yourself. If you are called to do something, or feel a ritual is needed deep in your heart, then not only is it valid and important, it will probably make you feel freer afterward.
