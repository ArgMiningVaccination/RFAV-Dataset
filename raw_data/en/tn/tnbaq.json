Social prescribing is a key element of NHS England's Long Term Plan, where Primary Care Networks as part of the GP contract in 2019 will receive funding to employ one social prescriber. There has been much debate about the effectiveness of social prescribing as a mechanism , but it is vital to move beyond any direct and immediate benefits that can arise from effect ive social prescribing practice. Too ofte n the focus on the se direct and often very immediate impacts of social prescribing is at the expense of exploring the longer -term benefits of sustained engagement in activities or sustained behaviour change to which individuals have been referred through s ocial prescribing mechanisms . These arguments may not be used by commissioners and voluntary or community organisations to inform models, evaluations, grant applications and business cases. To address this, a rapid mapping review has been undertake n to identify evidence on the relative strength of selected activities that typically have been used as part of social prescribing , such as referral t o group based social activities, community volunteering and development activities, life-long learning and use of welfare / debt advice services. 131 systematic reviews of interventions in the last 5 years were identified; 26 examples of empirical studies published in the UK and Ireland since 2017 were also found. While the review is only intended to provide a snapshot of the evidence base it does highlight some of the dilemmas to be faced by social prescribers and their funders in respect of the long term evidence base. While there is a reasonably robust evidence on the benefits of sustained participation in a range of sport s and other physical health related activities , including dance, the evidence base for group based social interaction activities is more mixed, while that for some of the creative arts is largely qualitative in nature and generally considere d insufficient for investment by the health care system . The evidence on befrie nding appears particularly weak. 5 Much of the literature we identified is focused on health related activities. Social prescribing potentially can refer individuals to other typ es of activities. There is a small albeit encouraging evidence base exists for some non-health focused interventions, and we highlight UK specific evidence base on welfare and financial advice services. Another challenge is that few systematic reviews we identified looked at the economic benefits or even the relative c osts of interventions. This may be because many of these interventions have not been traditionally funded by health care systems, and thus there has been less incentive to look at their cost effectiveness. T his represents a potential gap that might be addressed rapidly by retrospectively taking areas where evidence on effectiveness is most promising and then considering the economic return on investment and cost effectiveness from different p erspectives, including the NHS, local authorities and society. Return on investment models might also be created to look at the potential case for action where there is more uncertainty about the strength of evidence; this can help identify the level of benefits that would need to be achieved in order for the action to be considered a sound investment. The added value of effective social prescribing practices in encouraging and sustaining uptake of effective interventions could also be embedded into this a pproach. Such evidence would help ensure that resources are allocated t o those activities that are more likely to benefit their target populations. These m odels could be designed in such a way that the impact of actions on social and health inequalities can also be made . 6 1. Introduction There is considerable interest in the use of social prescribing as a way of improving health, wellbeing and other outcomes in the population. Social prescribing is a key element of NHS England's Long Term Plan, where each Primary Care Network as part of the GP contract in 2019 will receive funding to employ one social prescriber. Even before this announcement more than 69,000 people in England had an NHS -related social prescribing referral in 2018 and the ambition is now to rapidly scale up to reach 0.9 million people with long -term conditions and complex needs by 2023/24 (1). To do this and sustain social prescribing it will also be essential to work with many different organisations in the public, private, voluntary and community sectors who will deliver a wide range of activities. This commitment by NHS England to social prescribing comes with an expectation that the use of social prescribing may also reduce contact wit h primary and secondary care services. However, the robustness of the evidence on the effectiveness (and cost effectiveness) of social prescribing remains contested, with cal ls for longer term and larger scale studies to strengthen the evidence base (2, 3) . One of the challenges in doing this is that social prescribing can be used to refer to a range of different mechanisms, and not just the link worker model put forward by NHS England. Regardless however of debates on what mechanisms are used for social prescribing it is vital to go beyond considering whether there are direct and immediate benefits from effect ive social prescribing practi ces. Too often the focus on potential short term impacts is at the expense of exploring the longer -term benefits of sustained engagement in activities or sustained behaviour change to which individuals have been referred through social prescribing mechanis ms. These arguments appear to be seldom used by commissioners and voluntary or community organisations to inform models, evaluations, grant applications and business cases. This means that when assessing the case for social prescribing it is important to a ssess the strength of the evidence base around the different activities to which clients may be referred. A challenge here is the potential myriad of different activities, but some of the more typical activities include community volunteering and developme nt activities, sports participation, physical activity and other social engagement , life-long learning, vario us intergenerational activities and use of welfare / debt advice services. 7 In order to address this gap, we have undertaken a rapid mapping review to identify evidence on the relative strength of selected activities that typically can be associated with social prescribing. This has included documenting whether there is evidence on effectiveness, cost effectiveness and return on investment for these activities. The focus in the review has not just been on impacts on health and wellbeing, but has also sought to identify impacts and value that go beyond health and wellbeing such as impacts on levels of independence, and participation in volunteering, em ployment or education. Where social prescribing is used as a referral mechanism to these activities we have also sought to identify whether any additional impacts of social prescribing on the rate of uptake and sustained engagement have been documented . Our aim is therefore to collate an evidence base to support commissioners in making the case for social prescribing and its importance in increasing participation in activities that are known to have benefits for individuals a nd society. In making the case f or social prescribing it is also helpful to look at evidence on the economic case. Many health promoting activities, including participation in social activities have been associated with a positive return on investment (ROI) to the public purse and/or soc iety (4). This can be due not only through improved health and wellbeing, but also through increased partici pation in volunteering, employment and education, as well as through a reduction in the need for social services and in the need for informal and residential care. As part of our review we have also looked at the extent to which economic arguments have bee n incorporated into evaluation, and in the discussion section at the end of this report we suggest ways in which this evidence base may be strengthened further. 8 2. Methods A rapid systematic mapping review of reviews has been conducted. This has been rest ricted to published systematic reviews (both narrative and quantitative) published in the last 5 years (January 1 2014 to January 31 2019) on effectiveness, impact and return on investment of selected activities to which individuals may be referred by GPs or others through a social prescribing mechanism . In addition to systematic reviews we also mapped evidence from additional relevant UK or Ireland based empirical studies published in 2017 and 2018, as well as from studies and reports in governmental, aca demic and third -sector reports over this two year time period. We have also separately collated some new interventions delivered outside the UK/Ireland that potentially may be helpful because of a similar delivery context. For both the search for systemat ic reviews and empirical studies we have restricted the search to the Medline and CINAHL databases, plus a structured search of Google Scholar for relevant additional literature, as well as identifying other materials from reference lists of published pape rs. To keep this task manageable we excluded reviews specifically focused on children, as well as any reviews of interventions delivered by health care professionals, including allied health professionals such as music, dance or physio therapists. We have also excluded studies that focused solely on online / web -based interventions as a way of fostering behavioural change. In addition, we excluded studies looking at interventions being delivered in hospitals, long -term care or nursing homes. The detailed se arch strategies are provided in the Appendix to this report. Two systematic maps of evidence have been prepared and these in turn used in more in -depth analysis for selected topics . This has included reference to material o n challenges and success in the uptake and sustained engagement with these activities. We have aimed to set out key strengths and gaps in this evidence, as well as reflecting on the extent to which social prescribing is noted as a mechanism to foster greater rates of engagement and partic ipation in these activities. 9 3. Review Results 2,696 Records were identified in Medline and 2,228 in CINAHL. 294 Duplicate records were identified electronically and a further 81 records manually. This left 4,5 61 records to examine. We initially identifi ed 214 systematic reviews that potentially look at the effectiveness of community interventions. These records w ere then further screened and separated into different types of activity that potentially be activated via social prescribing and two matrices ( Matrices 1 and 2). Figure 1 shows the literature flow chart, indicating th at 131 systematic reviews and 2 6 recent empirical studies were included in the analysis. A further 3 UK & Ireland empirical studies pre 2017 were included for illustr ative purposes. Overall the revi ew included 19 relevant studies we re ad ded from citation searches. Figure 1: Literature Search Flow Chart References identified: 4, 936 Duplicates removed: 375 References screened : 4,561 References excluded: 4,283 Full text references screened: 214 reviews 64 empirical studies References excluded: Including 51 non -UK / Ireland 2017 -2019 empir ical studies Final references included: Reviews: 131 UK & Ireland studies: 29 References added from citation searches: 16 Additional illustrative UK and Ireland studies pre 2017: 3 10 Our final list of included lite rature is provided in Appendix 2. As Matrix 1 indicates 131 reviews were finally included in the matrix; we broke this up into 9 categories of types of activity1, including a general activity grouping and a group for reviews not focused on health. Around o ne third of all reviews include some cost / resource information and half contain at least one study from a UK context. Very few explicitly mention social prescribing as a concept. The most common focus of reviews included were physical activity related pr ogrammes and also actions to tackle / prevent social isolation and loneliness (particularly in older people). We also found reviews focused on participation in music/singing or dancing, non - professional support groups, befriending, as well as a range of co mplementary movement / exercise regimens such as Tai Chi, Yoga and Qi -Gong . We only identified one review focused on a non -health related outcome (prevention of tenancy evictions), perhaps reflect ing our use of health -related databases in this rapid scopin g review. Matrix 2 has 29 further empirical controlled studi es from the UK or Ireland; 18 of these included some cost / resource information and seven included social prescribing delivery mechanisms. We also have collated a further 51 intervention stu dies from outside the UK which also fall into these categories, including some studies that use social prescribing mechanisms. 1 (Note : individual reviews could appear in more than one category so the columns will not add up) 11 Matrix 1: Systematic reviews and meta -analyses (2014 - 2019) Theme Number of reviews Reviews containing cost / resource info Mentions social prescribing Includes UK studies Befriending 2 2 1 2 Creative Arts 8 6 2 5 Dance 22 7 0 5 General 29 17 1 12 Social Activity / Loneliness Alleviation 29 13 3 15 Music Participation & Singing 13 4 0 6 Other Non Health 3 2 0 2 Physical Activity 37 13 0 23 Support Groups 7 3 1 3 Yoga, Tai Chi and similar complementary medicine approaches 17 6 0 4 Total* 131 45 7 61 *Individual reviews could appear in more than one category, so totals are not the sums of columns 12 Matrix 2 : UK & Irelan d Intervention Studies (2017 - 2019) Theme Number of studies Contains cost / resource info Mentions social prescribing Befriending 5 2 0 Creative Arts 2 0 0 Dance 3 2 0 General 6 4 4 Social Activity / Loneliness Alleviation 6 1 1 Music Participation & Singing 2 0 0 Other 3 0 0 Physical Activity 3 1 0 Support Groups 0 0 0 Welfare and Financial Advice 7 7 1 Yoga, Tai Chi and similar complementary medicine approaches 0 0 0 Total* 29 18 5 *Individual reviews could appear in more than one category, so totals are not the sums of columns 3.1 Brief overview of review findings We look in more detail at welfare and financial advice, group -based activities to promote physical and mental health , as well as reduce loneliness and social isolation in the next section of this report. Here we briefly summarise the direction of evidence for some of the other thematic areas covered in the review. There are overla ps between some of these themes and it is also important to stress that this scoping review will only repr esent a very partial view of the evidence base and will not capture all economic evaluations; our aim however by referring to recent reviews is to indicate potential effective (and ineffective) areas that are promising to link to social prescribing , rather than provide a comprehensive mapping of all literature . 13 3.1.1 Befriending Evidence on the effectiveness of befriending interventions remains limited. Two systematic reviews of befriending interventions were identified. One focused on 14 studies of indivi duals identified to have physical or mental health difficulties (5), while the other focused on four studies of volunteer mentoring provided to informal carers (6). Examples of UK based evaluations and some analysis of costs were identified in both reviews, but in both cases only weak positive associations between be friending and improvements in health outcomes for participants were identified , and interventions did not appear cost effective. In both cases the need for further evaluations to better quantify impacts was noted. It is also possible that there may be addi tional non -health related outcomes that arise from befriending, but evaluations have not covered these. We also identified several recent UK evaluations on befriending as well as peer support. Two of these were largely qualitative in nature (7, 8) focusing more on the process of being a volunteer befriender rather than on outcomes. One study drawing on data from four unspecified London boroughs and three counties in southern England, looked at impact of carers beco ming volunteer peer supporter s to other carers of people with dementia (9). The study found some small improvements in the personal growth, mental wellbeing and self - efficacy of volunteers; but these results were b ased on data from just 21 of the 87 volunteers originally enrolled in the stud y. More promisingly an uncontrolled observational study of a combined home help / befriending service delivered by volunteers to more than 700 older people in Shropshire did sugg est mean potential savings to local government over one year of than \u00a31500 (10). Participants in the evaluation were asked to indicate whether they believed institutionalisation had been prevented by participant in the home help / befriending scheme; these cases of possible prevented institutionalisation account for the costs savings in the programme, but this still needs to be confirmed empirically. Another uncontrolled evaluation of an English programme which inv olved volunteer runners befriending older people, suggested that there was a reduction in social isolation and improvement in life satisfaction for older people; the intervention would be considered cost effective from an NHS perspective when looking at th e benefits for the runners - the impacts on older people were not considered in the economic analysis (11). Although out of scope (because it was published in 2016 ), a social r eturn on investment analysis of befriending services in Derbyshire calculated an annual benefit of 9:1; this was 14 based largely on survey responses from 26 befriending organisations in Derbyshire rather than observed evidence of effect (12). This estimate of benefits is problematic. It involved major assumptions on impacts of the use of health care services that are not obviously supported by empirical data a nd probably lead to an overestimate of any potential benefits. There is a need for e mpirical evidence on the actual economic impacts of services, such as those in Derbyshire and their consequences for health, social ca re and other sectors . 3.1.2 Arts , Danc e and Music Participation Arts on prescription as an approach has been implemented in many different ways in different UK and other contexts (13). We identified eight reviews on the use of the creative arts. These included a review of reviews of arts interventions for people with dementia highlighted randomised controlled trials in different country contexts pointing to both music and general arts interventions having positive impacts on depression and mood (14); many of these interventions were delivered however by allied health professionals rather than by artists. Other reviews , for instance looking at a rts based interventions as a way of promoting mental wellbeing in young people , have largely collated findings from qualitative studies without also being linked to quantitative analyses (15). Again, while individual qualitative findings in this review , for instance on improvements in self -esteem or confidence , as well as lower levels of stress are encouraging, no assumptions can be made about their effectiveness in London. Another scoping review on arts interventions for older people in acknowledging the limitations of the existing evidence base stated that \" there is a need for programs of research (instead of teams conducting only one study), the development and application of conceptual frameworks, and multiple perspectives in order to build knowledge about how the arts contribute to health and quality of life for older adults \" (16). We identified 22 reviews looking at the role of dance. While so me of these reviews primarily were focused on dance as part of a therapeutic rehabilitation programme after illness or injury, such as for people living with Parkinson's Disease , cancer or fibromyalgia, a number of reviews focused more on the role of dance as a medium for promoting health and wellbeing. For example, a meta -analysis of the physical health benefits of 23 experimental and randomised controlled trials of structured dance classes of at least 4 weeks duration found dance to be at least, if not mo re effective compared to other structured physical activity interventions (17). Only one of these studies was undertaken in the UK, but the types of dance classes provided are all available in the UK . Moreover , adherence and attrition rates 15 favoured dance or were no different to other structured exercise interventions. In saying this some of the studies were solely for women and dance may not have as much appeal to men. Another meta -analysis of six dance studies in the review also concluded that dance was equally effective compared to other types of exercise in promoting cardiovascular health (18), whilst a narrative systematic review of 18 dance interventions all conducted outside of the UK reported that all but one had some positive impacts on physical health (19). Participation in dance in the UK has also been argued to reduce both the fear of falling and its consequences. However, evidence on the impact of participation in dance on fall related injuries s till remains limited; we identified two systematic revie ws specifically on this issue. One was of 6 trials, none of which were conducted in the UK (20). Of these, only one from Brazil was demonstrated to reduce the incidence of falls (21), while two others in the United States and Taiwan had significant positive impacts on the fear of falling but no impact on falls incidence (22, 23) . A second review looking at dance and fall -risk relate d factors, with seven studies all outside the UK, concluded that \" there were some aspects of the studies that do not enable us to confirm that dance has significant benefits on these factors based on the scientific evidence. These aspects include the metho dological quality, the small sample size, the lack of homogeneity in relation to the variables and the measurement tools, and the existing diversity regarding the study design and the type of dance \" (24). Two recen t very small UK evaluations of ballroom/Latin dancing for people with Parkinson's disease were cautiously suggestive of positive impacts but recommended large scale evaluation (25, 26) , while another feasibility st udy in Ireland suggests that Irish dancing may also have quality of life benefits that should be explored in a larger scale study (27). Evidence on the cost effectiveness of arts -based interventions is very limited (28) and there have been calls to strengthen this evidence base (29). Some examples of modelling and trial - based interventions can be found; creative arts on prescription programmes that can achieve only a modest effect been shown to be potentially cost effective initial alternative to psychological therapies for people with moderate to severe levels of depression (28), but robust evaluation on effect size in such programmes is a gap in the literature. 3.1.3 Multi -focused reviews Several wide ranging and broad reviews of interventions, including dance, arts, intergenerational activities, training in the use of computers, v olunteering and mentoring and have indicated many different examples of interventions that have been shown to have some 16 positive impacts on physical and mental health, wellbeing and independence (30, 31) . Some of these interventions have been evaluated through randomised controlled trials and others through quasi experimental studies. The challenge however is that most of these studies are very small scale in size and highly context specific; findings from any one individual study may not easily translate to different settings in London and elsewhere. We also identified return on investment analys es of social prescribing scheme s in Rotherham (32, 33) . This scheme targeted individuals living with long term conditions and their carers, linking them with voluntary and community sector services. This included organisations providing befriending and reablement services, peer adv ocacy and a range of group activities, as well as opportunities to volunteer in the community. 87% of participants in the scheme were over the age of 60, with almost half (47%) over the age of 80. Qualitative information was explicitly collected on impacts on social isolation and loneliness from interviews with service providers and participants but there was no formal measure of changes in loneliness. Hospital Episode Statistics were used to identify changes in use of health services in the 12 months follo wing participation in the social prescribing scheme; NHS tariffs were attached to service use in order to estimate changes in costs to the health service. Overall there was a reduction of \u00a3265 per person in health system costs for the 12 months post interv ention compared to the 12 months before intervention. Compared to the costs associated with implementing the programme there was a ROI of \u00a30.50 for each \u00a31 invested. Extrapolation was used to estimate a potential long term ROI of \u00a33.38 if benefits could be sustained for five years; estimates under different scenarios with a gradual reduction in long term benefits were also calculated. Further monetary benefits were attached to wellbeing gains to generate a SROI, but the method for valuing benefits is not we ll described. After 12 months the SROI would be \u00a30.84. 17 4. Selected thematic areas for further analysis Following this literature revi ew we focused on the evidence for some specific selected types of action in a UK / Ireland context since 2014 . This involve d some additional searches for further evidence from evaluations in the grey literature that meet our inclusion criteria, and from references from relevant UK/Ireland studies included in our review of reviews. Our aim here is again to look in more detail a s to whether there is also an economic case for action. Spec ifically we decided to focus on: Welfare / financial advice / financial literacy services Group based activities (including sports) specifically intended to tackle loneliness and social isolation Face to face life long and continuing education courses (including courses on how to use the internet and computers) These sub -themes reflect different areas of interest and different adult population groups. They also cover activities whose primary purpos e may not be to improve health, but rather to tackle other goals that can have an impact on health such as loneliness and financial insecurity . Our aim was to provide exemplars of evidence, including assessment of its strengths and weakness, outcomes and impacts recorded (including effect size where feasible), resource and cost impacts (including economic evaluations and return on investment where this is feasible ). 4.1 Welfare /financial advice services There has been growing attention in the UK placed o n the links between financial debt and insecurity , not only with poor physical (34) and mental health (35-37), but also with an increased risk of suicidal behaviours (38). There are various financial and welfare advice services that are available across the UK and Ireland; the impacts of some of these services on health and poverty allevi ation has been undertaken. Much of this evaluation has been for quasi -experimental or before and after intervention evaluation rather than controlled experimental studies so caution must be exercised when interpreting results. Nonetheless this evidence bas e supports referral to such services and indicates that they have both short and mid -term positive impacts. Unlike some other potential activities to which referrals may be made by social prescribers, these services 18 do not necessarily require long standing contacts in order to make a difference. Indeed, if advice and other supports available are successful then contact with these services may be limited. Our scoping review identified a systematic review of interventions to reduce the risk of eviction of te nants from rental properties (39). This review included a UK evaluation of the provision of debt advice services to tenants (40).This study reported that debt arrears reduced by 37% for tenants who made use of the advice service over 12 months compared with a 14% increase in debt arrears for tenants who did not make use of the service. The analysis did not consider whether these results were statistically different, but it include d a simple financial analysis which indicated that after taking account of the cost of debts advice services there was a net be nefit of \u00a3239 per client in debt arrears averted. A quasi -experimental study looked at the co -location of Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) welfare benefits and debt advice services in GP surgeries in London (41). It also included an economic analysis comparing the costs of the service with financial gains to clients who made use of the service. Use of the service was associated with reduced financial stress, as well as reduced use of credit cards if clients were unabl e to make payments . From the perspective of the client there were average financial gains of nearly \u00a32,700 over the eight month study period, with financial benefits to clients overall outweighing the costs of running the programme by 15:1. There was also some association between receipt of advice and better mental health, where advice was perceived to have positive outcomes. The authors concluded that such welfare advice services potentially can help reduce the workload on GP primary care practices. As par t of work to estimate the economic case for investing in measures to protect and or improve mental health commissioned by Public Health England, a return on investment model looking at increased access to not -for-profit debt advice services was created (42). This brought together e vidence on the effectiveness of debt management services from a previous English randomised controlled trial, together with the benefits to the health care and legal systems, as well as to society as a result of a reduction in debt -related depression. Usin g very conservative assumptions on costs and benefits a return on investment of \u00a32.60 for every \u00a31 would be achieved over five years. This excludes other benefits such as improved quality of life and physical health. An earlier analysis, using the much les s conservative social return on investment methodology which relied heavily on clients perceptions of potential problems 19 avoided rather than empirical observation of outcomes, estimated that the return on investment of supporting Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) debt advice services in Bath and North East Somerset could be in excess of \u00a333 per \u00a31 investment (43). The CAB nationally also produce their own annual modelled estimates of the return on investment suggesting a return of \u00a31.96 in fiscal savings related to h ealth, housing and out of work benefits, with another \u00a311.98 in what they term wider economic value and \u00a313.06 in improved incomes of people in debt (44). A largely qualitative review in Manchester also highlighted the potential economic as well as personal health benefits of debt alleviation of debt counselling and other CAB advice (45). Another example concerns a referral programme from GP practices to a warm homes services for older people in Wiltshire (46). The service Warm and Safe Wiltshire (WSW) was offered by Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service and Wiltshire Council to reduce fuel poverty in the county and make its residents' homes warmer, healthier and safer places to live. The service provided advice and support in keeping a warm home. Individuals on GP practice lists could be flagged up as those who would potentially benefit from the service through a computer algorithm. While the experiences of individuals supported by WSW were positive, referrals through GP practices were much lower than anticipated - only 71 from a target of 750 individuals were actually referred to the service. This suggested that despite the low cost (from the GP perspective) of this service, a lack of time and a lack of recognition of the importance of this type of service hampered uptake; the service was most effective where additional individuals e.g. care coordinators and pra ctice nurses were also involved in the referral process. 4.2 Group -based loneliness alleviation Another area that we have explored in more depth concerns the use of group -based activities as a way of reducing loneliness in the population. This is another a rea of considerable policy interest in the UK with the government's strategy on tackling loneli ness published in October 2018 and t here is a growing evidence base on a range of group -based social activities for loneliness alleviation , as well as physical a nd mental health promotion. Group -based social participation interventions were recommended by NICE in their guidance on promoting the mental wellbeing and independence of older people (47); this guidance was supported by an evidence review which included a number of interventions that had been delivered in a UK context (30); moreover a further mapping review indicated that a range of 20 group -based activities to which individuals could be referred were available all over the country (48), although one problem is that many programmes are operated in specific localities a nd therefore are very small in scale. This has meant that evaluations that have taken place have tended to be very limited in scope because of resource constraints. Appendix 3 provides detailed summary information from systematic reviews that in part looke d at interventions to tackle loneliness. Nearly all of these take the form of narrative reviews rather than meta -analysis, in part because of the heterogeneity of interventions; very few included any mention of the economic costs or cost effectiveness of p rogrammes. Social prescribing (or social prescribing -like mechanisms were mentioned in a small minority of these reviews. To building on our review of reviews and identify more on the economic case for action, we extended our search for UK or Ireland empir ical based studies to go back to 2014. We focused on evaluations that included a formal economic evaluation or return on investment analysis. The process meant that we were able to identify a number of relevant studies to illustrate that from a cost effectiveness perspective actions to tackle isolation or loneliness may be suitable programmes to refer individuals to via social prescribing mechanisms. However , as the discussion below indicates these studies were generally small in s cope and size and there are inconsistencies in approa ches used to measure economic outcomes. Table X summa rises the evaluations that we use in these illustrations .

Community dwelling older people age not specified Not evaluation but did look at 13,000 contacts with service Partial return on investment analysis ROI for all aspects of Vill age Agent scheme is \u00a31.90: \u00a31 from a health and social care perspective increasing to \u00a33.10 when benefits to clients included . These include an economic evaluation, carried out alongside a multi -centre RCT of a lifestyle support programme (Lifestyle Matters), des igned to improve the mental wellbeing of people aged 65 years and above in England and Wales (49, 50) . Outcomes were measured at baseline, 6 and 24 months. Loneliness at 24 months, measured with the de Jong Giervel d Loneliness Scale, showed a significant decrease compared to standard care . The economic evaluation collected information about health and social care use covering each three month period prior to data collection. The average cost of the intervention per person was: \u00a3430 (North England) and \u00a3575 (North Wales). The intervention was also less costly than usual suppor t, although this difference was not statistically significant. Another recent randomised controlled trial focused on group singing activities a s a way of reducing loneliness and improving the mental health and wellbeing of older people (51). This trial evaluated the impact of active engagement in a 14 -week professionally led community choir group on menta l wellbeing. 131 people with divided into 5 singing groups delivered in community venues in east Kent. A waiting -list control group of 127 people received no active intervention. The study found a significant improvement in SF -12 (a quality of life instrum ent) mental health component scores for the intervention at six months compared to the control group. Participants in the singing group also had small but significant gains in quality of life expressed as Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained . These better outcomes were achieved without any significant difference in overall health and social care service utilisation. The economic case for investing in singing groups is promising; while the intervention was likely to have at least a 60% chance of costi ng less than \u00a320 000 per QALY gained. This may be a conservative estimate if mental wellbeing benefits are in fact sustained beyond six months. Other recent analysis in Wales also indicate that group participation in 22 choirs can also help to promote the men tal health and wellbeing both of people living with cancer and participating family members (52). Another example concerns a social return on investment (SROI) study focused on the impact of two 'Craft Caf\u00e9s' in Gl asgow; a pilot programme from Impact Arts that 'sought to reduce the isolation and loneliness experienced by older people, to enable them to make positive lifestyle changes associated with ageing and, ultimately, to bring about a better quality of life' (53). The analysis captured in -contributions to the delivery of C raft Caf\u00e9 service and generated a very positive return on investment of \u00a38.27 per \u00a31 invested , although the methods for placing a value on some of these benefits, such as the monetary value of being less lonely are partly value judgements; this study was n ot able to measure potentially more tangible impacts such as changes in the use of health or social care services. Services that help 'signpost' or facilitate links to community and voluntary organisations that can help individuals address issues such as p oor health, loneliness and social isolation have also been evaluated . The evidence on the economic case for signposting is encouraging, although it should be stressed that effectiveness data are taken mainly from a few very small observational studies (42). An intervention to addr ess loneliness in older people was one of eight interventions included in a return on investment (ROI) tool developed for Public Health England (42). The intervention modelled examined the provision of a signposting service for people aged 65 and older who were not in paid work and who perceived themselves to be lonely. Such signposting services have been put in place in different areas of England; they might be located in GP surgeries, others in local focal points such as shopping centres or libraries. Drawing on observed experien ce in small scale studies in England the model estimated the likelihood that individuals would self -refer themselves to a community -based service that would seek to match them with suitable local social activities to reduce the risk of social isolation and loneliness. The impacts of subsequent participation in regular group activities on mental health and loneliness over the next five years were then considered. Costs averted included GP and GP nurse contacts, risk of hospital presenting self -harm, and avoi dance of psychological therapy to treat depression. The benefits to society of an increase in the number of individuals contributing their time as volunteers as a result of coming into contact with signposting and navigation services were also considered. 23 The model estimated that over a five year period there is a ROI of at least \u00a31.26 from every \u00a31 invested in this service. This however is a highly conservative estimate as the model explicitly was limited to looking at mental health benefits alone. It did not take account of broader additional health benefits, such as improved physical health, as well as potential benefits if cognitive health is protected. Any avoidance or delay in physical health decline would mean that local authority social services can avoid substantive costs linked with both community and residential care. Nor does it include any estimate of wider benefits associated with social participation and more healthy ageing. Another analysis using the same approach but including these wider be nefits increases the ROI substantially. Another ROI analysis of a signposting service operating in Gloucestershire was estimated to have a return of \u00a31.90 for every \u00a31 invested. This ROI however covers more than actions to address loneliness or isolation, such aa fuel poverty and fall prevention (54). Gloucestershire Village and Community Agents provide d a wide ra nge of information and refer individuals to services and supports in the local area. A very simple economic analysis was undertaken. This reported the overall return on investment from the scheme, which not only were thought to include reducing loneliness and social isolation, but also reducing falls, increasing independence, tackling fuel poverty and supporting people living with cancer. The analysis assumed that every one of the 291 contacts either with befriending services or community activities as a re sult of agent signposting would have a cost offset of \u00a3270. This figure is based on the economic benefits gained per individual as a result of avoiding depression in a previous economic modelling study. An estimate of the value of volunteer time (including volunteer time provided by clients) was also included in the analysis. Overall , while the results are positive , the analysis is very limited as it did not measure actual outcomes related to loneliness or depression, simply assuming that these would follow on from contact with the service. 4.3 Education and training activities There is evidence from outside the UK and Ireland of the benefits of partic ipating in life -long learning programmes (30). Some of these programmes are fully focused on pursuing academic goals, in Spain , for instance , specific university courses aimed at older people have been associated with improvements in health and wellb eing (55, 56) , whereas others are more about the enjoyment to be gained from learning. While lifelong education is popular across the UK we found few examp les of evaluation of its impact, none of which considered t he 24 economic benefits of supporting programmes. One institution which has been subject to some evaluation is the University of the Third Age (U3A). U3As exist all across the UK; they rely on volunteers to guide and co -ordinate learning efforts. The emphasi s is on social interaction and help in guiding on a range of activities varying from language and computer classes to theatre visits, knitting, tai chi and yoga. It has been the subject of mainly qualitative evaluation in the UK . A survey for U3A of 801 pa rticipants indicated that 91% ad made new friendships, 59% were more confident and 55% felt healthier (57). We also ide ntified studies that look at the benefits of developing computer and other IT skills, for all population groups . Previous systematic reviews of different types of training for older people, including group -based training, produce mixed results, with some h ealth and wellbeing improvements where recorded with more inconclusive results when looking at impacts on social isolation and loneliness (58-60). In the UK we mainly identified qualitative studies, and while resul ts therefore need to be interpreted with great caution as they do not include comparative evaluation , these studies suggest that there is a positive impact from widening digital inclusion in society. For instance, providing training and support for individ uals so as to make more use of digital health tools, is associated with reduced use of primary care health services but no assessment was made of the impact on the health of survey participants (61). A later evaluation of general (rather than health specific) digital skill development for people who were eit her homeless, were caring or had poor mental health, produced by the same organisation stated that 84% of respondents had indicated an improvement in wellbeing following training. It was not clear what measure of w ellbeing was used. No economic analysis wa s included but they study also indicated some positive economic benefits including that 6% of respondent moved into employment, 7% became volunteers and 18% were subsequently seeking employment (62). 25 5. Discussion 131 systematic reviews of interventions in the last 5 years were identified; 22 examples of empirical studies published in the UK and Ireland since 2017 wer e also found and a further 7 studies added subsequently between 2014 and 2017. While the review is only intended to provide a snapshot of the evidence base it does highlight some of the dilemmas to be faced by social prescribers and their funders in respect of the long term evidence base. While there reasonably robust e vidence that sustained participation in a range of sport and other physical health related activities including dance, the evidence base for group based social interaction activities is more mixed, while that for some of the creative arts is largely qualit ative in nature. The evidence on befriending appears particularly weak. Much of the literature we identified focused on health related activities, which in part reflects our concentration on health dominated bibliographic databases but a small but encourag ing evidence base exists for some interventions focused on other outcomes, and we highlight the UK specific evidence base on welfare and financial advice services. 5.1 Strengthening the economic evidence base In all cases few systematic reviews focused on economic benefits or even the relative costs of interventions; this represents a potential gap that might be addressed rapidly by retrospectively taking areas where evidence is most promising and also considering the return on investment and cost effectiv eness from different perspectives, the NHS, local authorities and society. Cost effectiveness and/or return on investment analyses were however more evident in recent empirical UK studies that we have included. This included the recent Connected Communitie s evaluation which was able to generate useful information on health and non -health related benefits of group social activities for a small scale but valuable social activity programme targeted at single mothers in the north of England (63). Our review also identified a number of different examples of modelling approaches to return on investment. Return on investment models might also be created to look at the potential case for action where evidence is less robust; this c an help identify the level of benefits that would need to be achieved in order for the action to be considered a sound investment. The added value of effective social prescribing practices in encouraging and sustaining uptake of effective interventions cou ld also be embedded into this approach. Such evidence is needed to help ensure that resources are allocated to those activities that are most likely to benefit their 26 target populations. Such models could also consider the impact of actions on social and health inequalities. One example of this is the publicly available tool recently developed for Public Health England which allows local government to calculate the short and mid -term return on investment associated with various mental health promotion activi ties including referrals to group -based social activities to tackle loneliness and referrals to financial/debt management advice (McDaid et al 2017). This general approach might also be applied to social prescribing mechanisms and the activities to which individuals are link ed. 6. Recommendations In concluding this brief report w e set out four recommendations: 1. It is important not just to look at the effectiveness and appropriateness of social prescribing mechanisms, but crucially the activities to which individuals are being referred via social prescribing . 2. The evidence base on activities to wh ich individuals potentially may be referred by social prescribing mechanisms is very varied; commissioners need to be mindf ul of strength of this evidence when looking at activities to which individuals referred by social prescribing 3. It is important to also look at cost effectiveness, budgetary impact and return on investment not just of social prescribing mechanisms, but also the interventions to which individuals are referred through prescribing. In doing this it is also critical to recognise that there are many potential impacts outs ide as well as within health care systems, e.g. poverty alleviation, strengthening civil society, increased volunteering and employment. 4. Economic modelling techniques might be used to synthesis information on the effective of social prescribing plus activities to which individuals referred, with the costs and potential costs averted of these activities. Economic models can also be used to look at what level of engagement and behaviour change needs to be achieved by social prescribing in order for investment in social prescribing to be considered cost effective. 27 References 1.

The aim of the SR was to investigate how technology is being used to combat social isolation and increase social participation for older adults Inclusion criteria: - smaller design studies and prototype evaluations from human -computer interaction (HCI) - Technology referred to ICTs and include devices (hardware), applications (software) and websites - Adults 65+ - social participation and social isolation (search terms) Exclusion criteria: - theoretical and descriptive studies - Medical Information systems - telemedicine - information management Papers included use of any technology targeted at older people aimed at supporting social participation and/or reducing social isolation .

A Systematic Review and Meta -Analysis . Range: 60+, UK: yes To evaluate the effect of physical exercise interventions on participation in life roles in older adults. To explore possible parameters of successful programs and the impact of the measurement method on results. Inclusion criteria: In this review we focused broadly on any type o f physical exercise intervention given to adults over the age of 60 that included an explicit measure of participation. - RCT - 60+ years - any non -pharmacological intervention that included exercise or physical activity (def: any planned activity or serie s of movements undertaken to increase fitness or health) either alone or as a component of a multifaceted intervention, compared with usual care - Explicit measure of participation participation Outcomes: --aspect of participation (e.g. ICF or Nagi) --mea surement instruments need to have more than 1/2 of the items devoted to participation Exclusion criteria: - conference abstracts Most programmes: - mainly lower -extremity ex ercise targeting 1 or 2 impairments or activities (e.g. balance, strength, walking) Some interventions: - education and behavioural support - multi -faceted interventions including project -based activities to promote social engagement as well as exercise se ssions - stroke rehabilitation intervention - modified tai-chi programme - Agentine tango class - Wii Fit programme Generic patient -reported instruments designed to measure some aspect of participation based on an existing conceptual framework (ie, ICF or Nagi). In this study, we operationalized participation as involvement in life situations involving complex behavio urs that can be accomplished using a variety of tasks or component actions (rather than activities that require only basic physical tasks). Measured used in order of frequency: - Late -Life Disability Instrument (LLDI) - Frenchay Activities Index (FAI) - Reintegration to Mornal Living Index (RNLI) - Adelaide Activities Profile (AAP) - Activity Card Sort (ACS) - London Handicap Scale (LHS) C: No SP: Yes Random -effects meta -analysis of 16 studies (2,132 participants) showed no over -all effect of the exercise interventions on participation Sub analysis of 6 studies (894 participants) showed favourable effect of long -duration programmes on participa tion. - Benefits of exercise do not necessarily extend to participation in life roles for older adults presenting with a wide range of chronic disease and mobility limitations. - small positive effect on long -term exercise programme (>=12months) on partic ipation 50 - non-English language publications - measures of QOL, ADL and physical activity Main study question Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria Main Interventions Principal Outcome Measures Cost SP Summary of Findings Chen (60) The Effect of Information Communication Technology Interventions on Reducing Social Isolation in the Elderly: A Systematic Re view. 2016. 25 studies Narrative review UK: Yes To gain a synthesis of the evident effects of ICT interventions on so cial isolation in the elderly. Inclusion criteria: - publications in English - studies must empirically investigate the effects of ICT on one or more attributes of social isolation among the elderly - study participants much be 55 years or older Most resea rch: - Internet or web -based apps on a computer (e.g. search, email, online chat rooms, videoconferencing, social networking apps, and web - based telehealth systems) 1 study: - telephone befriending intervention 1 study: - mobile phone/smartphone 1 study: - iPad 1 study: - Nintendo Wii 1 study: - visual pet companion app (pet avatar in real time via a tablet) Outcomes of ICT use: - 4 studies: effect on social isolation (in general) - remaining studies: specific aspects of social isolation only Social isola tion: Cotton et al self -developed scale: - not having a close companion - not having enough friends - not seeing enough people they feel close to 3 studies did not quality term - but social isolation and loneliness interrelated/interchageable Catton et al: - being forgotten and not belonging Kahbaough et al; Karimi and Neustaedter: - not being connected to family, friends and existing contact 7 single attributes of social isolation: - loneliness (most tested) - social support -social contact - number of con fidants C: No SP: No Relationship between ICT usage and social isolation in general: 4 demonstrated a positive result: the use of telephone befriending programs, computer and I nternet, and ICT in general lessened social isolation. The reported effect of ICT use on the individual dimensions of social isolation was consistent across studies, except for that on loneliness. ICT interventions significantly fostered social support, social contacts, social connectedness/social connectivity, and social networks among the participants, but no effect was found on number of confidants or social well - being. Of the studies examining loneliness, 15 of 18 revealed a significant reduction of loneliness among the elderly using ICT. Studies using communication programs (using landline phones, smartphones, iPads, emailing, and online chat rooms or forums) and high -technology apps (Wii, the TV gaming system, and 51 - social connectedness/social connectivity - social networks - social wellbeing Gerijoy, a virtual pet companion) consistently reported a positive effect on alleviating loneliness. ICT use consistently affected social isolation in general, social support, and social connectedness positively, but the positive ICT effect on social connectedness and social support rar ely lasted for more than 6 months after the intervention. The results for loneliness were inconclusive. The results for self -esteem and control over life were consistently nonsignificant. After triangulating the quantitative and qualitative data of the included studies: elderly's employment of ICT reduces their social isolation through the following mechanisms: - connecting to the outside world, - gaining social support, - engaging in activities of interest, and - boosting self -confidence. ICT helps t he elderly stay connected with their family members (especially grandchildren), friends, former colleagues, acquaintances, and new contacts of shared interests or needs across temporal and geographical boundaries via digital interactions. Connections lea d to social inclusion and foster social support. ICT also allows elderly people to renew their hobbies or competence and participate in enjoyable activities without the time 52 constraint. Most importantly, ICT use boosts self -confidence among the elderly by making them \"connected to information,\" \"help others online.\" The results reveal the interplay between the ICT -med iated activity and the effect of such behavior on particular types of loneliness and social support.

UK: ? 62 The aim of this study was to conduct an integrative review of literature on interventions that target social isolation and/or loneliness in older people. - Literature relating to interventions with a primary or secondary outcome of reducing or preventing social isolation and/or - loneliness - Literature relating to older adults - Empirical research articles reporting primary resear ch, published in full, including all research methodologies (but excluding reviews) - English language articles - Published since 2003 - all methodologies were included. - As the term 'older adult' is inconsistently defined in the literature, the term was determined by the criteria set out in the identified studies. Methodological quality was evaluated by examining the quality of each study using the hierarchy of evidence as a guide (Evans 2003), and its execution thereof. Methodological relevance was eva luated by assessing the appropriateness of each study's design for addressing its research question. Topic relevance Social facilitation interventions - facilitating social interaction with peers or other who may be lonely - group -based activities - charity -funded friendship clubs - shared inter est topic groups - day centres - friendship enrichment programmes - cultural identity - ICT solutions: videoconferencing and social networking Psychologica l therapies - delivered by trained therapists or health professionals - humour therapy - mindfulness - stress reduction - reminiscence group therapy - cognitive and social support interventions Health and social care provision - interventions involving he alth, allied health and/or social care professionals - involvement of health and social care professionals and enrolment in a formal programme of care (e.g. care home, community care) - community network of trained gatekeepers - CARELINK (university -commun ity partnerships) nursing students visited older people to aid socialisation - Eden alternative model (residential care) - Reducing social isolation or loneliness - Supportive environment - Sense of companionship - keeping occupied - creating a Sense of belonging - number of friendships - boredom - helplessness - maintaining social contacts - spend ing time constructively - having interaction with others C: No SP: No Significant diversity and heterogeneity were evident in intervention design and implementation, with evidence suggesting the scope and purpose of interventions varies widely. - majorit y of activities are at least moderately successful in reducing social isolation and/or loneliness - approaches to measuring social isolation vary but often involve recording levels of social contact, enumerating social participation and quantifying social networks. The nature of person's social network has been identified as key to the level of social isolation that they experience - This study did not report group interventions as being more effective than solitary or one -to-one interventions - Solitary p et interventions and solitary interventions involving technology such as videoconference and computer/internet use were successful in reducing the experience of loneliness - effective interventions ar not restricted to those offered in group settings. 63 assessed how well matched each study was to the focus of our review in terms of topic (Gough et al. 2012).

What are the reasons given for sing these models? - people who had been marginalised or were in danger of marginalisation from school and work life, and with mental and/or drug -related problems. - Green Care services are often associated with farm work, but Green Care and nature -based activities are also offered independently of a farm setting (Nordh, Grahn, & W\u00e4hrborg, 2009; Souza & Lexander, 2007). We chose to include literature that described services offered, with a focus on plants, nature and animals, both on farms and in farm -independent settings. Exclusion criteria: - studies that only dealt with the physical benefits of Green Care or nature, or general pedagogical services such as farm kindergartens. - Both green services for elderly and people with dementia and green services for people with physical impairments were also excluded. The reason for this is that the project is restricted to the field of mental health 4 groups: - farms where working with animals and t raditional farm work represent the core activities - services that could be situated at a farm, but one where the activities were restricted to animal -assisted interventions - services connected to gardens and gardening: focus on plants and horticulture - activities that took place in nature, primarily in the forest 2. Positive effects on mental health - mental wellbeing - new positive attitude - self-acceptance - self-insight 3. Physical activity - improved physical health/streng th 4. Structure and meaningfulness - out of passivity/structure of the day - meaningfulness 5. Feeling of dignity produced by performing a decent ordinary job - real work experience 6. Social gains - farmer as a significant important other - social support - a tendency towards increased social activity after intervention 7. Animals and nature - nature experienced as a rewarding and supportive environment - unique experience of accept ance in the company of animals 1. Mastery and coping: - participants could master different tasks a nd gain a stronger belief in their own coping abilities - experiencing a supportive leader and group fellowship described as important factors in gaining confidence in one's own coping abilities 2. +ve effects on mental health - decline in depression and anxiety - positive connections between supporting dialogues with the service leader and improved mental health - stress levels declined during participation in Green Care services - quant studies did NOT report significant findings but qual studies reporte d decline in symptoms - +ve effects were difficult to derive 3. Physical activity - opportunity of PA emphasised in several studies - +ve health and wellbeing experiences due to PA - +ve effects on mood and sleep patterns - +ve effects on mental condition s 4. Structure and meaningfulness - having a place to go and meeting expectations - made everyday more meaningful - gave new joy of life 5. Dignity - seeing the results of their efforts, contributing to the community and being useful 82 and has a recovery focus, meaning that the target groups are those wh o by some help could have the opportunity to return to school or working life. - masters' and bachelors' theses (or other written assignments on a lower level). - literature that did not provide any new information because they were more like status reports on Green Care in the different countries - experiencing that you were needed - earning a living and giving something back: experience dignity and equal status 6. Social gains - share experiences and be accepted for who you are - not being \"judged\" - group work strengthened solidarity and self -efficacy - led to a mo re active social life outside of the service 7. Animals and nature - pleased with having a chance to be outside in nature - being part of something \"greater\" - being with animals therapeutic Main study question Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria Main Inter ventions Principal Outcome Measures Cost SP Summary of Findings Webber (86) A review of social participation interventions for people with mental health problems . 2017. 19 studies. Narrative. UK & Ireland: Yes This review aims to summarise social participation intervention models which have at least some evidence of positive social network outcomes. Its purpose is to illustrate the diversity of approaches which practitioners use, highlight gaps in the evidence bas e and Inclusion criteria: - Only psychosocial interventions - Intervention was neither with individuals or groups - Studies with or without a comparison intervention - Group interventions which measured social functioning and relationships within groups 6 categories: 1. Individual social skills tra ining 2. Group skills training - Community reintegration programme for adults with severe chronic brain injury and depression -Groups for Health to increases connectedness (social identity theory and self -categorisation theory) Outcomes of interest: - social ne tworks or social participation C: No SP: Yes Mental health services: - require developing stronger connections with local community networks and activities - professionals needs time and flexibility to devlope local relationships and increase their knowle dge of community engagement opportunities Interventions not delivered by mental health services: - more limited evidence of their effectiveness 83 suggest future directions for research. Exclusion criteria: - The population was people with any diagnosed mental health problem, though those with a primary diagnosis of substance misuse - Pharmacological, physical or psychological interventions with n o social components - online interventions which did not involve any face to - face contact - studies using participants' subjective appraisal or satisfaction with networks as outcomes - not written in English - Social Cognition and I nteraction Training (schizophrenia) 3. Supported community engagement - Volunteer befriending (Ireland) - Mental health professionals working with people who are difficult to engage with MH service, but more successful at engaging them with community and recreation facilities (Italy) - Connecting People Intervention (UK): engages people in activities, organsaiton and groups in local communities - Open Dialogue Approach (Finland) mental health prof engage with social worker 4. Group -based community activit ies - develop skills and increase confidence support the development of relationships with and beyond groups - Horticulture and arts -based projects - Ecotherapy in urban space - art projects 5. Employment interventions - matching people with enduring ment al health problems with competitive jobs without extensive preparation - social enterprises 6. Peer Support Interventions 1. Individual social skills training - evidence suggests that it is effective in improving social functioning and social relations, particularly in community settings - social skills training increased participants' social network size and their care utlisation decreased - structured nature of skills training did not suit everyone Group skills training - improve ment in emotional wellbeing, QOL, level of community integration and employability - positive effects on soical cognition and social functioning Supported community interventions: - exposes people to new social connections through mainstream opportunities within communities. - people need to be able and confident to engage - communities need to accept people with stigmatised identities and occasional behaviour challenges - potential to increase the number of weak ties within networks Group -based community activities - group activities resulted in stronger relationships within the group and more diverse connections beyond it. - higher levels of social inclusion over time and stronger mutuality within groups - help people build supportive, trusting relations hips 84 - building stronger ties with people of shared identity and experience - intensive case management0 - provide a supportive context for social engagement - build social networks unless they actively and purposively engage people in community activities alongside the general population - reductions in loneliness and i mproved social functioning for yo ung people with depressions and anxiety Employment interventions - significantly increase levels of employment obtained during the trials - social network outcomes rarely evalu ated - improvements in social life, social contacts and networks, but difficult ies in maintaining close relationships Peer support interventions - minimally facilitated by a psychi atric nurse improved peer contact but no impact on relationships beyond mental health services - did not find significant differences across intervention conditions 85 "}
