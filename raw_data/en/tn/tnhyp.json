It is located between Palm Beach and Miami- Dade counties, forming the heart of Florida's largest metro politan area with more than 6 million residents. Within Florida, Broward County has Florida's most diverse population, with a diversity index rating of 71.8%. A community needs assessment aids the county in identifying and addressing the specific healthcar e needs and/or gaps of residents. The main purpose of the assessment is to improve the health status of Broward County residents and increase access and availability of healthcare services. The main goals of the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) are to: Improve the health status of Broward County residents Address socioeconomic factors that have a negative impact on community health Increase access to preventive healthcare services, especially within at -risk-sub- populations. Summary of CHNA Proce ss A CHNA Advisory Committee was convened with the purpose to: Guide the assessment process Act as a sounding board and assist in obtaining community input Participate with the Advisory Council in evaluating health issues and priorities once the assessment is completed Engage in collaborative action planning on an ongoing basis Members of the Committee included representatives and collaborative partners from the community. These included: The Department of Health -Broward County, Broward Housing Author ity, Y MCA of South FL, The Urban League of Broward County, Hope South FL, South FL Hunger Coalition, Broward County Medical Association, T he United Way, the United Way Commission on Substance Abuse, the Children's Services Council, SunServe, Broward Health y Start Coalition, Bro ward Sheriff's Office -Community Programs, Meals on Wheels of South FL, Clinica Luz del Mundo (Light of the World Clinic), Living Waters Clinic, American Cancer Society, Women in Distress, Jack and Jill Children's Center, Christine E.

Together, this diverse group of individuals represented numerous populations that live, play, and work in the Broward community. Holy Cross Health (HCH) contracted with Broward Regional Health Planning Council (BRHPC) for assistance in conducting the FY 2023 - 2025 Community Needs Assessment (CHNA) including the 5 | Page collection of quantitative and qualitative da ta regarding health needs, and facilitation of community advisory committee presentations , con sumer and provider focus groups . In conducting the CHNA, the following steps were completed: 1) the community served was defined; 2) the health needs of the commu nity served were defined; and 3) input from persons who represent the broad interests of the c ommunity were solicited and considered. All relevant facts and circumstances were considered in defining the community served including geographic areas and targe t populations (including medically underserved, low -income, and minority populations). Additio nally, all patients were considered without regard to whether (or how much) they or their insurers pay for care received. Primary data was collected through key informant interviews and focus groups. Key informants and focus groups were purposefully chos en to represent diverse populations, medically underserved, low -income, or minority populations in our community. Qualitative data was collected from a broad ran ge of community stakeholders (including the community served and their representatives) throug h the following activities: 1) BRHPC Broward CHNA Survey, 2) Community and Provider Focus Groups (4 of each), 3) Key Informant Interviews, 4) input gathered during committee forums and 5) the identification and ranking of needs. Their input provided insigh ts on how to better direct our resources and form partnerships. Due to limitations experienced as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, in -person interviews and focus groups were limited by design in size and scope to ensure open conversation in a safe enviro nment. Significant Health Needs Identified An initial list of identified needs was developed based on the quantitative and qualitative data collected throughout the CHNA process including the input by stakeholders. The identified needs were separated into two categories: health needs and socioeconomic needs (adopted from Johns Hopkins model). Where feasible, needs were organized to correspond with Healthy People 20 30 categories. Members reviewed the identified needs and identified any items needing modifications (edits, additions, and/or deletion). Modifications by the group to the list of needs were reflected on the prioritization spreadsheet.

Those needs were then prioritized based on based on total response volume for individual health needs/issue using a single vote by clicker method. Votes were tabulated and priorities established accordingly by rank order. The significant health needs identified, in order of pri ority include: Community Ed Preventative Care Access to Care Social Determinants of Health Cultural Sensitivity Mental Health & Substance Abuse Dental Care Our Response Holy Cross Hospital resources and overall alignment with the hospital's mission, goals , and strategic priorities were taken into consideration of the significant health needs identi fied through the most recent CHNA process. Holy Cross Hospital acknowledged the wide range of priority health issues that emerged from the CHNA process and determ ined that it could effectively focus on only those health needs which it deemed most pressing, under -addressed, and within its ability to influence. HCH decided not to take action on the following health needs and chose not to plan to directly address these particular need s because they are being addressed by other partner community - based organiza tions in the community. Holy Cross recognizes that it must set priorities and, therefore, community investment was directed toward the five issues where impact is most likely within our service area, target population, collaborative partne rs, and expertise Improve access to Dental Care Substance Abuse / Mental Health Over the past three years, HCH has implemented action plans designed to fulfill these significant community needs. Written Comments Received on the Prior CHNA and Implementat ion Strategy The prior CHNA ( FY2019) and implementation strategy were made available for public review and comment on the hospital's website. In addition, input was solicited via the Holy Cross Health website, and via the Community Health and Well -Being Department. To date , no comments have been received by the hospital. Impact Evaluation Since Previous CHNA 14 | Page Community Education & Preventative Ca re Holy Cross Hospital's Community Health and Well- Being (CHWB) department and other hospital departments, including the wellness c enter, home health, and nursing, responded to requests from the community for health screenings. In addition, Holy Cross continued making several navigators available to assist the community, including navigators for breast, lung, orthopedics, and COPD. The hospital also hosts a heart failure , COPD , and cardiometabolic clinic and a continuously growing accountable care organization with an active population health nurse team. In FY21, the CHWB department programs focused on COVID -19, preventative health edu cation, continuation of breast screening services, tobacco prevention, the National Diabetes Prevention Program and the inc eption of the Diabetes Self- Management Program and a Peer Program in the Emergency Department. 15 | Page 16 | Page Preventative Care In FY19 and part of FY20 , the CHWB department programs focused on preventative health education, childhood immunization, decreasing childhood obesity, breast screening services, tobacco prevention childhood literacy, and the National Diabetes Prevention Program. Advocacy topics included Tobacco 21, Florida's healthiest weight, and health equity and justice. The department's messages, programs, and interventions were targeted to serve some of Broward's most vulnerable populations. The objectives and activities in t his Priority Area were perhaps most impacted by COVID -19. In early 2020, all clinical staff were d iverted from routine activities and instead provided telephonic and virtual community education and preventative care to individuals, families, and small groups. Discussions and presentations were made available to churches, schools, community -based agenci es, and businesses requesting information and education regarding COVID -19 and preventative care and well -being. 17 | Page Access to Healthc are During FY19 - 21 Holy Cross Hospital continued to provide in -person and then virtual support to seniors , providing them assistance with health insurance claims, comparisons of various prescription plans, and assistance with long -term care options via an agreement with th e 18 | Page Agency on Aging of Broward County. Florida continues to be a non -Medicaid expansio n state and Holy Cross Hospital strives to provide affordable, coordinated health care. The two resident clinics have assisted in providing increased access to primary care services for low -income, uninsured and underinsured individuals. The Advanced Practice Registered Nurses and RNs provide direct health care services at a partner volunteer clinic in the community that serves the most vulnerable, uninsured Broward resident s. The CHWB clinical team provided virtual and telephonic care management to all uni nsured positive COVID- 19 clients diagnosed in the ED and Urgent Care Centers, linking them to primary care thereby increasing access to convenient care at minimal cost and monitoring for ED and hospitalization avoidance. Holy Cross Hospital continues to se ek new opportunities to become an integrated partner in the transition of care for vulnerable populations and continues to explore alternate models for its current mission clinic. Social Influencers of Health CHWB health services and education are prov ided to augment community agencies and seeks to serve individuals and families experiencing limited income, constrained earnings, evictions, job loss, and single -headed households contributing to economic hardship. Food security was identified as a major o utstanding need and continues to be a major focus for the hospital. Efforts to address these issues over the past 3 fiscal years were heightened by the COVID- 19 pandemic. C HWB continued (virtual) committee participation on South Florida Hunger Coalition, Summer Breakspot, and Mobile Food Pantry; and awarded both the John C. Johnson food security and Pat E. Taylor housing grants to community agencies. Additionally, direct services were provided in FY21 to the homeless population in partnership with local soc ial 19 | Page service agencies. The hospital also continued to provide a just wage for its associates, increasing in 2021 to a minimum of $15.00/hour. 20 | Page As the COVID -19 pandemic continued, its impact on social determinants of health was felt by both the same and emerging populations. Working extended hours under very stressful conditions, Holy Cross staff were fortunate to receive food donations from the community. More than 10,2 50 meals for healthcare providers were coordinated with local churches, restaurants, and private donors for distribution Cultural Sensitivity During this CHNA cycle, marked strides have been made in this area: the Holy Cross S.E. Regional Director of Culture and Inclusion established a Diversity and Inclusion Council which community and colleagues participate on Unconscious bias training has been provided to the leadership group and all board members, with the intent of training all employe es in upcoming ye ars A LGBTQ Business Group has been formed comprised of community members and employees and is working on addressing diversity and inclusion specific to LGBTQ healthcare issues In addition, Holy Cross has had numerous leaders participating in Trinity Healt h's Diversity and Inclusion webinar series, \"Advancing Together.\" In the community, Holy Cross continues to form alliances and partnerships with LGBTQ social services agencies and welcomes all members of our diverse community. We have als o provided suppor t to and sponsorships to LGBTQ events as well as the South Florida Transgender Medical Conference. 21 | Page History of Community Health Needs Assessment To conduct a CHNA, a hospital facility must complete the following steps: Define the community it serves Assess the health needs of that community In assessing the community's health needs, solicit and take into account input received from persons who represent the broad interests of that community, including those with special knowledge of or e xpertise in publi c health Document the CHNA in a written report (CHNA report) that is adopted for the hospital facility by an authorized body of the hospital facility Make the CHNA report widely accessible to the public Prioritize significant health needs in the community A hospital facility is considered to have conducted a CHNA on the date it has completed all these steps, including making the CHNA report widely available to the public. The passage of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 required hospitals with a 501c3 designa tion to complete a community health needs assessment (CHNA) every three years. Outlined in section 501\u00ae(3)(A) of the Federal IRS Code, a hospital organization must conduct a CHNA and adopt an implementation strategy to meet the community health needs ident ified through the CHNA. This CHNA represents our commitment to improving health outcomes in our community through a rigorous assessment of health status in our region, incorporation of stakeholders' perspectives and adoption of related im plementation stra tegies to address priority health needs. The CHNA is conducted not only to satisfy legal requirements, but also to partner for improved health outcomes. The goals of this FY2022 Community Health Needs A ssessment are to: Engage public health and community stakeholders representing low -income, minority, and other underserved populations Assess and understand the community's health issues and needs Understand the health behaviors, risk factors, and social determinants that impact health Identify community res ources and collaborate with community partners Use findings to develop and adopt an implementation strategy based on the collective prioritized issues 22 | Page Community Profile Geographic Area Served and Identification of Community Served Broward County is in the southeastern portion of the state of Florida with Miami -Dade County to the south and Palm Beach County to the north.

The data was then reviewed and studie d by the Community Health Advisory Committee and Council to identify unmet needs/service gaps and prioritize needs. When data is collected by an externa l source for a purpose other than the current project and the data has already undergone the statistical data analysis process, it is called Secondary Data. Data Sources CHNA Advisory Council members participated in on-line community forums from August 25, 2021 through November 10, 2021. During these meetings, the Advisory group reviewed a mixture of primary and secondary data to identify and prioritize community health ne eds in Holy Cross Health's primary service area. Secondary data sources included q uantitative data describing community demographics, social determinants of health (SDOH), health access, maternal and infant health, leading causes of death, disability and disease, health behaviors, mental health, and substance use, and hospital utilization were collected and presented. Data sources included: U.S. Census American Community Survey American Comm unity Survey Broward County FL | Data USA Florida Charts U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Trinity Health Data Hub BRHPC Florida Health Data Warehouse Florida, Broward and Holy Cross Health data: o Hospital Utilization o Chronic Diseases o Prevention Quality Indic ators o Diagnoses Related Groupings Contracted P arties Broward Regional Health Council (BRHPC) was contracted to gather health indicator data, analyze quantitative and qualitative data, conduct focus groups and key informant interviews, and assist ed in esta blishing methodology for ranking health need data. 29 | Page Community Input Received Community Health Needs Assessment Primary data was collected through key informant interviews and focus groups. Key informants and focus groups were purposefully chosen to repres ent medically underserved, low -income, or minority populations in our community. Qualitative data was colle cted from a broad range of community stakeholders (including the community served and their representatives) through the following activities: 1) BR HPC Broward CHNA Survey, 2) Community and Provider Focus Grou ps (4 of each), 3) Key Informant Interviews, 4) input gathered during committee forums and 5) the identification and ranking of needs. Their input provided insights on how to better direct our re sources and form partnerships. Due to limitations experienced as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, in -person interviews and focus groups were limited by design in size and scope to ensure open conversation in a safe environment. Input from the Local Health Department Renee Podolsky, MBA, director of community Healt h at the Florida Department of Health in Broward County participated as a valued member of the Holy Cross Hospital CHNA Advisory committee. She provided her expertise in community health data analysis to ensure that a diverse segment of the population was reached in the qualitative data collection process and that the quantitative data discussed and studied was comprehensive. She also discussed efforts in addressing immunization outcomes, COVID- 19 vaccine and the areas that the Florida Department of Health in Broward County is focusing on in its current action plan. She also participated in the ranking process of the health needs as identified by the CHNA Advisory Council and committee membership.

This was followed by a review of a complementary geospatial model, the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) comprised of 15 -census tract social and economic factors, organized into four \"themes\" which are analog ous to SDOH: Socioeconomic Status, Household Composition & Disability, Minority and English Proficiency Status, and Housing and Transportation within a community (shown below) . 47 | Page Based on the quantitative and qualitative data collected throughout the CHNA process, an initial list of identified needs was deve loped. Identified needs were then separated into two categories: socioeconomic needs and health needs ( adopted from the model utilized by Based on quantitative and qualitative data collected throughout the CHNA proces s, an initial list of identified needs was developed. Identified needs were then separated into two categories: socioeconomic needs and health needs (adopted from Jo hns Hopkins model). Where feasible, needs were organized to correspond with Healthy People 2030 categories. Participants were asked whether the identified needs reflected the main items from the quantitative and qualitative data collected through the curre nt CHNA process. Participants suggested items to add a nd discussed how best to reflect the additional items in the list(s) of needs. The final needs identified by the participants are included in the graphic below. The purpose of the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) is to identify communities that will most likely need support before, during and after a hazardous event such as a pandemic. The SVI scale goes from zero (0) to one (1) with 1 being the most vulnerable. A score of 0.58 indicates moderate to high vulnerability. Broward County has an SVI of 0.54. 48 | Page Prioritization Process and Identifie d Needs Prior to the Prioritization meeting, a survey was developed using Alchemer , an online survey platform listing identified needs by category and provided three criteria (equity, severity, and impact) for rating each need. The survey was updated to reflect the additional needs identified during the pres entation. The participants we re then provided with a link to complete the ranking process and asked to rank each criterion on a scale from one to five with five being the most important. Advisory council members identified subcategories for each priority a nd ranked the priorities and subcategories based on the following criteria: Prevalence - key indicator factor in achieving health equity Severity - urgency for addressing need / severity of need Health NeedsMaternal & Infant HealthPrenatal Care Infant Deaths Maternal Deaths Behavioral HealthSocial/Emotional Mental Health Substance Use Domestic ViolenceHeart Disease & Stroke Diabetes/Obesity HIV/AIDS Asthma Alzheimer's Disease Cancer Sickle Cell Disease Socioeconomic NeedsHealth Care Access & QualityUninsured Undocumented High Out -of-Pocket Costs Language Barriers Care & Insurance Navigation Culturally Competent Care Domestic Violence Health Communication Lack of TransportationEconomic Stability Food EnvironmentHealthy Food Food Security Housing / Homelessness Safety & Crime49 | Page Intervention feasibility, and potential to achieve outcomes - potential impact on greatest number of people Advisory Council Members ranked each identified need by category.

This data covers all occupied housing units, which are classified as either owner occupied or renter occupied. These data are used to aid in the distribution of funds for programs such as those involving mortgage insurance, rental housing, and national defense housing. Data on tenure allows planners to evaluate the overall viability of housing markets and to assess the stability of neighborhoods. The data also serve in understanding the characteristics of owner occupied and renter occupied units to aid builders, mortgage lenders, planning officials, government agencies, etc., in the planning of housing programs and services. OwnerOccupied Housing A housing unit is owneroccupied if the owner or coowner lives in the unit, even if it is mortgaged or not fully paid for. The unit also is considered owned with a mortgage if it is built on leased land and there is a mortgage on the unit. Mobile homes occupied by owners with installment loan balances also are included in this category.

The SVI scale goes from zero (0) to one (1) with 1 being the most vulnerable. A score of 0.58 indicates moderate to high vulnerability. Broward County has an SVI of 0.54.The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) comprised of 15-census tract social and economic factors , organized into four \"themes\" which are analogous to SDOH: Socioeconomic Status, Household Composition & Disability, Minority and English Proficiency Status, and Housing and Transportation within a community.

After they turn 18 or 21, they lack access to insurance through most of their young adult life, and that could be for reasons such as not qualifying. Their parents don't have insurance , ACA Plans are too expensive, or the youth may not qualify. After they turn 18 or 21 and then they lack access to insurance through most of their young adult life, don't qualify. Transportation: Access sometimes for the patients and when they do make their appointment for the pickup, often come very late or they don't come at all. The patients get very frustrated, particularly our special needs kids who have to come in with basic life support.\"The number one barrier that I come across is insurability\".Source: Children's Diagnostic & Treatment Center (CDTC) -Children w/ BRHPC 20215810/18/21 30 Barriers Encountered 59Access to careAccess to a physician who will see children who are uninsuredChallenges with our external Early Steps providers being locked out of insurance panels. They provide do early intervention services (OT, PT, and speech) for kids with developmental delays. That's an ongoing challenge for us to get insurance companies to understand the value of early intervention and to allow our excellent providers into their networks. That's only for birth to three, so after three, they no longer have CDTC as their second option. I'm working on a case now where the family just moved here. They do not have legal immigration status, a physician or insurance. They came in for an eligibility evaluations for Early Steps. The child was displaying significant delays and OT, PT, and speech were recommended. Yet we were able to find a provider, but they don't have any insurance and they can't even get a script from someone for them to start services, even if we were to be a payer. Source: Children's Diagnostic & Treatment Center (CDTC) -Children BRHPC 202159 Barriers Encountered 60As the pharmacist, one of the major issues is that patients get dropped by their insurance plan so that causes gaps in their medication adherence. Families need better education on how to maintain their insurance plans. For example, they were not aware of communication from the insurer that they needed to respond to and as a result their care is interrupted. This can severely limit access to care for our young adult population. For the medically complex, intellectually delayed population, once they turn 18, they need guardianship in place for their parents to continue making health care decisions and to access and help manage their disability benefits.Transportation access is sometimes an issue. Sometimes the transportation arrives very late or not at all and the patients get very frustrated.

Moms may be more inclined to \"trust\" her family than the doctor. There is a huge issue with trust between the non-Hispanic black population and medical providers. Undocumented families are not seeking health care for the fear of deportation and are not seeking pre-natal care until it is time for delivery. Language Barriers.

Black folks do not feel that the doctor can relate to them or understand where they are coming from, lack of cultural competence. *7th avenue clinic closed and this changed accessibility within the community. Hispanic Population: Struggle not just with co-pays and also with navigating the system. Cultural Issues: Families will listen however, the terminology often used leaves them with confusion. Meeting clients where they are, in a language they understand is important. Long wait lists/delays for appointments. If you are fortunate to have insurance you may still have to wait 60-days to see a provider. When clients miss appointments due to transportation or work they are told they can no longer go to that specific provider for services. Prescriptions may take up to 30-days (Thyroid) when waiting to see primary doctor prior to receiving the script. * Health care providers and community members have an assumption that by relaying information is enough and that persons then need to choose to be healthy. When clients reside within food deserts even eating healthy becomes challenging.\" I don't think any community chooses to not be healthy\".

Client's may not have employment / do not have insurance/ have insurance that requires co-pays at the time of the medical visit. In this community we have grandparents/parents raising multiple children/grandchildren and there is a fear of what \"could happen to them\". The process: primary care sends you to lab work, specialists, x-rays, treatment plan, interference with child's school and work. Major costs are associated. One of the fears in the Hispanic population is status and costs involved are preventing persons from receiving care. Not all providers speak the language of the client. Clients who are starting a new job or were offered additional hours have a fear of taking off work to go to a medical visit. A participant shared their personal journey with Thyroid Cancer and having to ask family to help and watch her son as a single mother while going through radiation. Health needs often timescome secondary to rent, utilities and food needs of the family. Translators take time to scheduleSource: YMCA Certified Community Health Workers (CCHW), BRHPC 202171 Quality of Healthcare 72Participants shared that families feel like they are being \"talked at\" and that doctor's do not present information in a non-judgmental way. Clients will not go back to the doctor and do not want to go through the process of paperwork to find a new doctor. The first impression and delivery of messages is extremely important. Clients do not always share with the doctor changes with medication/amount being taken/ clients who feel they no longer need the medication. Some clients miss the face-to-face interaction with their physician. They are not used to utilizing technology for their care. Clients also face challenges with the pharmacy-prescriptions are not sent in, waiting for prescriptions to be filled/finding out later they are not covered by insurance (time consuming process).If trust is not there the information is not retained\".

Biggest barrier is the lack of \"LGBTQ competence\" in the medical field, our kids being misgendered and their chosen names not being used, which leads them to not want to engage in medical care. LGBTQ Competence. If there were more providers in the community that we were aware of that provide high quality LGBTQ competent and proficient care, the wait times wouldn't be as long and would eliminate one of the barriers.Staff assist clients with medical care through case management and links them to medical care if they are without insurance. 7th avenue clinic and most hospitals funded by the city are utilized because to access Holy Cross you need to have insurance.

Lack of using their preferred pronouns and misgendering them is an issue. Certain facilities are separated by gender, and this results in at times a humiliating experience.Source: SUNSERV, BRHPC 202177 Health Insurance Impact 78Most of the youth have access to healthcare through their parents and does not seem to be the issue.\"LGBTQ competency\" is the major problem, especially for us, we have a majority of trans youth in our services (90-100+). Depending on the insurance, it can be difficult to find providers that accept their insurance which limits their options. Finding a provider that is LGBTQ competent and accepts their insurance creates a large barrier. When parents call us for services, it is because they probably have gone through all of the available folks. Especially for counseling services, they are told there is a very long wait list, there are fees for service, or that the provider doesn't provide LGBTQ therapy. It'snot LGBTQ therapy \"we provide therapy\" we \"just happen to be LGBTQ competent as well\". There are not many Medicaid providers now accepting Medicaid because it has a low reimbursement, clients are not able to access services. One of the other things (slowly improving) is parents having their child's legal gender changed and worrying that they may no longer be able to provide health coverage and prostate exams/mammograms may no longer be covered. This has been historically a barrier for many trans folks with insurance and when they can access care, they are having to wait to receive therapy.\"Waiting for therapy has a major impact on the youth. The fact that they have to wait for services, it's horrible\". \"It's putting lives in danger\". \"Waiting for therapy has a major impact on the youth.
