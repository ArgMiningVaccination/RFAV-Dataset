Independent ConsultantBaltimore, MD x . What Is a TIP? Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs) are developed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) within the U.S. Department of Health and HumanServices (HHS). Each TIP involves the development of topic -specific best practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of substance use and mental disorders. TIPs draw on the experience and knowledge of clinical, research, and administrative experts of various forms of treatment andprevention. TIPs are distributed to facilities and individuals across the country. Published TIPs can be accessed via the Internet at http://store.samhsa.gov . Although each consensus -based TIP strives to include an evidence base for the practices it rec\u00ad ommends, SAMHSA recognizes that behavioral health is continually evolving, and research fr e\u00ad quently lags behind the innovations pioneered in the field. A major goal of each TIP is to convey \"front -line\" information quickly but responsibly. If research supports a particular approach, cit a\u00ad tions are provided. xi . Foreword The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is the agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that leads public health efforts toadvance the behavioral health of the nation. SAMHSA's mission is to reduce the impact of sub\u00adstance abuse and mental illness on America's communities. The Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) series fulfills SAMHSA's mission to improve pr e\u00ad vention and treatment of substance use and mental disorders by providing best practices guidance to clinicians, program administrators, and payers.TIPs are the result of careful consideration of all relevant clinical and health services research findings, demonstration experience, and imple\u00admentation requirements. A panel of non -Federal clinical researchers, clinicians, program admi n\u00ad istrators, and patient advocates debates and discusses their particular area of expertise until they reach a consensus on best practices. This panel's work is then reviewed and critiqued by field reviewers. The talent, dedication, and hard work that TIP panelists and reviewers bring to this highly pa r\u00ad ticipatory process have helped bridge the gap between the promise of research and the needs of practicing clinicians and administrators to serve, in the most scientifically sound and effectiveways, people in need of behavioral health services. We are grateful to all who have joined with us to contribute to advances in the behavioral health field. Pamela S. Hyde, J.D.

Harding Director Center for Substance Abuse Paolo del Vecchio , M.S.W. Director Center for Mental Health Center for Substance Abuse Prevention Services Treatment Substance Abuse and Mental Substance Abuse and Mental Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Health Services Administration Health Services Administration xiii How This TIP Is Organized This Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) is divided into three parts: Part 1: A Practical Guide for the Provision of Behavioral Health Services Part 2: An Implementation Guide for Behavioral Health Program Administrators Part 3: A Review of the Literature Part 1 is for behavioral health service providers and consists of six chapters. Recurring themes include the variety of ways that substance abuse, mental health, and trauma interact; the i m\u00ad portance of context and culture in a person's response to trauma; trauma -informed screening and assessment tools, techniques, strategies, and approaches that help behavioral health professionals assist clients in recovery from mental and substance use disorders who have also been affected by acute or chronic traumas; and the significance of adhering to a strengths -based perspective t hat acknowledges the resilience within individual clients, provider s, and communit ies. Chapter 1 lays the groundwork and rationale for the implementation and provision of trauma - informed services. It provides an overview of specific trauma -informed interv ention and trea t\u00ad ment principles that guide clinicians, other behavioral health workers, and administrators inbecoming trauma informed and in creating a trauma -informed organization and workforce. Chapter 2 provides an overview of traumatic experiences. It covers types of trauma; distinguishes among traumas that affect individuals, groups, and communities; describes trauma characteristics; and addresses the socioecological and cultural factors that influence the impa ct of trauma. Cha p\u00ad ter 3 broadly focuses on understanding the impact of trauma, trauma -related stress reactions and associated symptoms, and common mental health and substance use disorders associated withtrauma. Chapter 4 provides an introduction to screening and assessment as they relate to traumaand is devoted to screening and assessment processes and tools that are useful in evaluatingtrauma exposure, its effects, and client intervention and treatment needs. Chapter 5 covers clin i\u00ad cal issues that counselors and other behavioral health professionals may need to know and a d\u00ad dress when treating clients who have histories of trauma. Chapter 6 presents information onspecific treatment models for trauma, distinguishing integrated models (which address substan ce use disorders, mental disorders, and trauma simultaneously) from those that treat trauma alone. Advice to Counselors and/or Administrators boxes in Part 1 provide practical information for providers. Case illustrations, exhibits, and text boxes further illustrate information in the text by offering practical examples. Part 2 provides an overview of programmatic and administrative practices that will help behav\u00ad ioral health program administrators increase the capacity of their organizations to deliver xv Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services trauma -informed services. Chapter 1 examines the essential ingredients, challenges, and processes in creating and implementing trauma -informed services within an organization. Chapter 2 focuses on key development activities that support staff members, including trauma -informed training and supervision, ethics, and boundaries pertinent to responding to traumatic stress, secondary trauma, and counselor self -care. Advice to Administrators and/or Supervisors boxes in Part 2 highlight more detailed information that supports the organizational implementation of trauma -informed care (TIC) . In addition, case illustrations, organizational activities, and text boxes reinforce the material presented withinthis section. Part 3 is a literature review on TIC and behavioral health services and is intended for use by cli n\u00ad ical supervisors, interested providers, and administrators. Part 3 has three sections: an analysis of the literature, links to select abstracts of the references most central to the topic, and a general bibliography of the available literature. To facilitate ongoing updates (performed periodically forup to 3 years from first publication), the literature review is only available online at the S ubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Publications Ordering Webpage (http://store.samhsa.gov ). Terminology Behavioral health: Throughout the TIP , the term \"behavioral health \" is used. Behavioral health refers to a state of mental/emotional being and/or choices and actions that affect wellness. B e\u00ad havioral health problems include substance abuse or misuse, alcohol and drug addiction, serious psychological distress, suicide, and mental and substance use disorders. This includes a range ofproblems from unhealthy stress to diagnosable and treatable diseases like serious mental illness and substance use disorders, which are often chronic in nature but from which people can and dorecover. The term is also used in this TIP to describe the service systems encompassing the pr o\u00ad motion of emotional health, the prevention of mental and substance use disorders, substance use and related problems, treatments and services for mental and substa nce use disorders, and reco v\u00ad ery support. Because behavioral health conditions, taken together, are the leading causes of disa\u00adbility burden in North America, efforts to improve their prevention and treatment will benefitsociety as a whole. Efforts to reduce the impact of mental and substance use disorders on Amer i\u00ad ca's communities, such as those described in this TIP , will help achieve nationwide improvements in health. Client/consumer: In this TIP , the term \"client\" means anyone who seeks or receives menta l health or substance abuse services. The term \"consumer\" stands in place of \"client\" in content areas that address consumer participation and determination. It is not the intent of this doc u\u00ad ment to ignore the relevance and historical origin of the term \"consumer\" among individuals whohave received, been subject to, or are seeking mental health services. Instead, we choose the word\"client,\" given that this terminology is also commonly used in substance abuse treatment services.Note: This TIP also uses the term \"participant(s)\" instead of \"client(s)\" for individuals, families, orcommunities seeking or receiving prevention services. Complex trauma: This manual adopts the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) definition of complex trauma. The term refers to the pervasive impact, including developmental xvi How This TIP Is Organized consequences, of exposure to multiple or prolonged traumatic events. According to the NCTSN Web site ( http://www.nctsn.org/trauma -types ), complex tr auma typically involves exposure to sequential or simultaneous occurrences of maltreat ment, \" including psychological maltreatment, neglect, physical and sexual abuse, and domestic vio lence.... Exposure to these initial traumatic experiences \u2014and the resulting emotional dysregulation and the loss of safety, direction, and the ability to detect or respond to danger cues \u2014often sets off a chain of events leading to subsequent or repeated trauma exposure in adolescence and adulthood \" (NCTSN, 2013). Co-occurring di sorders: When an individual has one or more mental disorders as well as one or more substance use disorders (including substance abuse), the term \"co-occurring \" applies. Although people may have a number of health conditions that co -occur, including physic al pro b\u00ad lems, the term \"co -occurring disorders,\" in this TIP , refers to substance use and mental disorders. Cultural responsiveness and cultural competence: This TIP uses these terms interchangeably, with \"responsiveness\" applied to services and systems and \"competence\" applied to people, to referto \"a set of behavior s, attitudes, and policies that ...enable a system, agency, or group of profes\u00ad sionals to work effectively in cross- cultural situations\" (Cross, Bazron, Dennis, & Isaacs, 1989, p. 13). Culturally responsive behavioral health services and culturally competent providers \"honorand respect the beliefs, languages, interpersonal styles, and behaviors of individuals and families receiving services... . [C]ultural competence is a dynamic, ongoing development al process that requires a long -term commitment and is achieved over time\" (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2003, p. 12). Evidence -based practices: There are many different uses of the term \"evidence- based practices.\" One of the most widely accepted is that of Chambless and Hollon (1998), who say that for a treatment to be considered evidence based, it must show evidence of positive outcomes based onpeer-reviewed randomized controlled trials or other equivalent strong methodology. A treatment is labeled \"strong\" if criteria are met for what Chambless and Hollon term \"well -established\" treatments. To attain this level, rigorous treatment outcome studies conducted by independentinvestigators (not just the treatment developer) are necessary. Research support is labeled \"mo d\u00ad est\" when treatments attain criteria for what Chambless and Hollon call \"probably efficacious treatments.\"To meet this standard, one well -designed study or two or more adequately designed studies must support a treatment's eff icacy. In addition, it is possible to meet the \"strong\" and \"modest\" thresholds through a series of carefully controlled single -case studies. An evidence - based practice derived from sound, science -based theories incorporates detailed and empirically suppor ted procedures and implementation guidelines, including parameters of applications (such as for populations ), inclusionary and exclusionary criteria for participation, and target interventions. Promising practices: Even though current clinical wisdom, theories, and professional and expert consensus may support certain practices, these practices may lack support from studies that are scientifically rigorous in research design and statistical analysis; available studies may be limitedin number or sample siz e, or they may not be applicable to the current setting or population. This TIP refers to such practices as \"promising.\" xvii Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services Recovery : This term denotes a process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self -directed life , and strive to reach their full potential. Major dimen\u00ad sions that support a life in recovery, as defined by SAMHSA, include: Health: overcoming or managing one's disease(s) as well as living in a physically and emo\u00ad tionally healthy way. Home: a stable and s afe place to live. Purpose: meaningful daily activities, such as a job, school, volunteerism, family caretaking, or creative endeavors, and the independence, income, and resources to participate in society. Community: relationships and social networks that provide support, friendship, love, and hope. Resilience: This term refers to the ability to bounce back or rise above adversity as an individual, family, community, or provider. Well beyond individual characteristics of hardiness, resilience includes the process of using available resources to negotiate hardship and/or the consequences ofadverse events. This TIP applies the term \" resilience \" and its processes to individuals across the life span. Retraumatization: In its more literal translation, \"retraumatization\" means the occurrence of traumatic stress reactions and symptoms after exposure to multiple events (Duckworth & Follette, 2011). This is a significant issue for trauma survivors, both because they are at increased risk for higher rates of retraumatization, and because people who are traumatized multiple times often have more serious and chronic trauma -related symptoms than those with single traumas. In this manual, the term not only refers to the effect of being exposed to multiple events, but also implies the process of reexperiencing traumatic stress as a result of a current situation that mi r\u00ad rors or replicates in some way the prior traumatic experiences (e.g., specific smells or other sens o\u00ad ry input; interactions with others; responses to one's surroundings or interpersonal context, such as feeling emotionally or physically trapped). Secondary trauma: Literature often uses the terms \"secondary trauma,\"\"compassion fatigue,\" and \"vicarious traumatization\" interchangeably. Although co mpassion fatigue and secondary trauma refer to similar physical, psychological, and cognitive changes and symptoms that beha v\u00ad ioral health workers may encounter when they work specifically with clients who have histories of trauma, vicarious trauma usually refers more explicitly to specific cognitive changes, such as in worldview and sense of self (Newell & MacNeil, 2010). This publication uses \"secondary trauma\"to describe trauma -related stress reactions and symptoms resulting from exposure to another individual 's traumatic experiences, rather than from exposure directly to a traumatic event. Sec\u00ad ondary trauma can occur among behavioral health service providers across all behavioral healthsettings and among all professionals who provide services to those who have experienced trauma(e.g., healthcare providers, peer counselors, first responders, clergy, intake workers). Substance abuse: Throughout the TIP , the term \"substance abuse\" has been used to refer to both substance abuse and substance dependence. This term was chosen partly because behavioral health professionals commonly use the term substance abuse to describe any excessive use of a d\u00ad dictive substances. In this TIP , the term refers to the use of alcohol as well as other substances ofabuse. Readers should attend to the context in which the term occurs to determine what possible range of meanings it covers; in most cases, it will refer to all varieties of substance- related xviii How This TIP Is Organized disorders as found in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (American Psychiatric Association, 2013a). Tr auma: In this text, the term \"trauma\" refers to experiences that cause intense physical and psy\u00ad chological stress reactions. It can refer to \"a single event, multiple events, or a set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically and emotionally harmful or threatening andthat has lasting adverse effects on the individual's physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well \u00ad being\" (SAMHSA, 2012, p. 2). Although many individuals report a single specific traumatic event, others, especially those seeking mental health or substance abuse services, have been ex\u00adposed to multiple or chronic traumatic events. See the \"What Is Trauma\" section in Part 1, Cha p\u00ad ter 1, for a more indepth definition and discussion of trauma. Tr auma -informed: A trauma -informed approach to the delivery of behavioral health services includes an understanding of trauma and an awareness of the impact it can have across settings, services, and populations. It involves viewing trauma through an ecological and cultural lens andrecognizing that context plays a significant role in how individuals perceive and process traumaticevents, whether acute or chronic. In May 2012, SAMHSA convened a group of national experts who identif ied three key elements of a trauma -informed approach: \"(1) realizing the prevalence of trauma; (2) recognizing how trauma affects all individuals involved with the program, organ i\u00ad zation, or system, including its own workforce; and (3) responding by putting this knowledge intopractice\" (SAMHSA, 2012, p 4). Tr auma -informed care: TIC is a strengths -based service delivery app roach \" that is grounded in an understanding of and responsiveness to the impact of trauma, that emphasizes physical, psy\u00ad chological, and e motional safety for both providers and survivors, and that creates opportunities for survivors to rebuild a sense of control and empowerment\" (Hopper, Bassuk, & Olivet, 2010, p.82). It also involves vigilance in anticipating and avoiding institutional pro cesses and individual practices that are likely to retraumatize individuals who already have histories of trauma, and itupholds the importance of consumer participation in the development, delivery, and evaluation ofservices. Tr auma -specific treatment services: These services are evidence -based and promising practices that facilitate recovery from trauma. The term \"trauma -specific services\" refers to prevention, intervention, or treatment services that address traumatic stress as well as any co -occurring diso r\u00ad ders (including substance use and mental disorders) that developed during or after trauma. Trauma survivor: This phrase can refer to anyone who has experienced trauma or has had a traumatic stress reaction. Knowing that the use of language and words can set the tone for reco v\u00ad ery or contribute to further retraumatization, it is the intent of this manual to put forth a message of hope by avoiding the term \"victim\" and instead using the term \"survivor\" when appropriate. xix Part 1: A Practical Guide for the Provision of Behavioral Health Services IN THIS CHAPTER Scope of the TIP Intended Audience Before You B egin Structure of the TIP What Is Trauma? Trauma Matters in Behavioral Health Services Trauma -Informed Intervention andTreatment Principles As You P roceed Trauma -Informed Car e:1 A Sociocultural Perspective Many individuals who seek treatment in behavioral health settings have histories of trauma, but they often don 't recognize the signif i\u00ad cant effects of trauma in their lives; either they don 't draw conne c\u00ad tions between their trauma hist ories and their presenting problems, or they avoid the topic altogether. Likewise, treatment providers may not ask questions that elicit a client's history of trauma , may feel unprepared to address trauma -related issues proactively, or may struggle to addr ess traumatic stress effectively within the co n\u00ad straints of their treatment program, the program 's clinical orient a\u00ad tion, or their agency 's directives. By recognizing that traumatic experiences and their sequelae tie closely into behavioral health problems, front -line professionals and community -based programs can begin to build a trauma - informed environment across the continuum of care. Key steps include meeting client needs in a safe, collaborative, and compa s\u00ad sionate manner; preventing treatment practices that retraumatize people with histories of trauma who are seeking help or receiving services; building on the strengths and resilience of clients in th e context of their environments and communities; and endorsingtrauma -informed principles in agencies through support, consult a\u00ad tion, and supervision of staff. This Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) begins by introducing the scope, purpose, and organization of the topic and describing its intended audience . Along with defining trauma and trauma - informed care (TIC) , the first chapter discusses the rationale for addressing trauma in behavioral health services and reviews trauma - informed intervention and treatment principles.These principles serve as the TIP's conceptual framework. 3 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services Scope of the TIP Many individuals experience trauma during their lifetime s. Although many people exposed to trauma demonstrate few or no lingeringsymptoms, those individuals who have exper i\u00ad enced repeated, chronic, or multiple trau mas are more likely to exhibit pronounced symp\u00adtoms and consequences, including substance abuse, mental illness, and health problems.Subsequently, trauma can significantly affecthow an individual engages in major life areas as well as treatment. This TIP provides evidence -based and best practice information for behavioral health service providers and administrators who want to work more effectively with people who have been exposed to acute and chronic traumas and/or are at risk of developing traumaticstress reactions. Using key trauma -informed principles, this TIP addresses trauma -related prevention, intervention, and treatment issues and strategies in behavioral health services. The content is adaptable across behavioral health settings that service indi viduals, fam i\u00ad lies, and communities \u2014placing emphasis on the importance of coordinating as well as int e\u00ad grating services. Intended Audience This TIP is for behavioral health service pro\u00ad viders, prevention specialists, and program administrators \u2014the professionals directly r e\u00ad sponsible for providing care to trauma surv i\u00ad vors across behavioral health settings,including substance abuse and mental healthservices. This TIP also targets primary care professionals, including physicians; teams working with clients and communities whohave experienced trauma; service providers inthe criminal justice system; and researchers with an interest in this topic. Before You Begin This TIP endorses a trauma -informed model of care; this model emphasizes the need forbehavioral health practitioners and organiz a\u00ad tions to recognize the prevalence and pervasive impact of trauma on the lives of the people they serve and develop trauma -sensitive or trauma -responsive services. This TIP provides key information to help behavi oral health practitioners and program administrators b e\u00ad come trauma aware and informed, improve screening and assessment processes, and i m\u00ad plement science -informed intervention strat e\u00ad gies across settings and modalities inbehavioral health services. Whether provided by an agency or an individual provider, trauma - informed services may or may not include trauma -specific services or trauma specialists (individuals who have advanced training andeducation to provide specific treatment inter\u00adventions to address traumatic stress reactions).Nonetheless, TIC anticipates the role that trauma can play across the continuum of care\u2014establishing integrated and/or collaborativeprocesses to address the needs of traumatizedindividuals and communities proactively . Individual s who have experienced trauma are at an elevated risk for substance use disorders,including abuse and dependence; mental health problems (e.g., depression and anxiety symptoms or disorders, impairment in rela\u00adtional/social and other major life areas, otherdistressing symptoms); and physical disorders and conditions, such as sleep disorders. This TIP focuses on specific types of prevention(Institute of Medicine et al. , 2009): selective prevention, which targets people who are at risk for developing social , psychological, or other conditions as a result of trauma or who are at greater risk for experiencing trauma due to behavioral health disorders or conditions;and indicated prevention , which target s people who display early signs of trauma -related 4 Part 1, Chapter 1 \u2014Trauma -Informed Care: A Sociocultural Perspective symptoms. This TIP identifies interventions, including trauma -informed and trauma - specific strategies, and perceives treatment as a means of prevention \u2014building on resilience, developing safety and skills to negotiate the impact of trauma, and addressing mental an d substance use disorders to enhance recovery. This TIP 's target population is adults. Beyond the context of family, this publication does not examine or address youth and adolescent responses to trauma, youth -tailored trauma - informed strategies, or trauma -specific inte r\u00ad ventions for youth or adolescents, because the developmental and contextual issues of these populations require specialized interventions.Providers who work with young clients who have experienced trauma should refer to the resource l ist in Appendix B. This TIP covers TIC, trauma characteristics, the impact of traumatic experiences, assessment, and inter\u00adventions for persons who have had traumatic experiences. Considering the vast knowledge base and specificity of individual, repeated,and chronic forms of trauma, this TIP does not provide a comprehensive overview of the unique characteristics of each type of trauma(e.g., sexual abuse, torture, war -related trauma , murder). Instead, this TIP provides an ove r\u00ad view supported by examples. Fo r more info r\u00ad mation on several specific types of trauma,please refer to TIP 36, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Child Abuse and Neglect Issues (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment [ CSAT ], 2000b) , TIP 25, Substance Abuse Treatment and Domestic Violence (CSAT, 1997b) , TIP 51, Substance Abuse Treatment: Addressing the Specific Needs of W omen (CSAT, 2009d), and the planned TIP, Reintegration -Related Behavioral Health Issues in Veterans and Military Families (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service s Administration [ SAMHSA] , planned f). Th i s T I P, Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services, is guided by SAMHSA's Str a\u00ad tegic Initiatives described in Leading Change: A Plan for SAMHSA's Roles and Actions 2011 - 2014 (SAMHSA, 2011b). Specific to Strat e\u00ad gic Initiative #2, Trauma and Justice, this TIP addresses several goals, objectives, and actions outlined in this initiative by providing behav\u00adioral health practitioners, supervisors, and a d\u00ad ministrators with an introduct ion to culturally responsive TIC. Specifically, the TIP presents fundamental concepts that behavioral health service provi d\u00ad ers can use to: Become trauma aware and knowledgeable about the impact and consequences oftraumatic experiences for individuals, fa mi\u00ad lies, and communities. Evaluate and initiate use of appropriate trauma -related screening and assessment tools. Implement interventions from a collabor a\u00ad tive, strengths- based approach , appreciating the resilience of trauma survivors. Learn the core prin ciples and practices that reflect TIC. Anticipate the need for specific trauma - informed treatment planning strategies that support the individual 's recovery. Decrease the inadvertent retraumatization that can occur from implementing standardorganizational policies, procedures, and in\u00adterventions with individuals, including cli\u00adents and staff, who have experiencedtrauma or are exposed to secondary trauma. Evalu ate and build a trauma -informed o r\u00ad ganization and workforce. The consensus panelists, as well as other co n\u00ad tributors to this TIP , have all had experience assubstance abuse and mental health counselors,prevention and peer specialists, supervisors,clinical directors, researchers, or administrators working with individuals, families, and 5 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services communities who have experienced trauma. The material presen ted in this TIP uses the wealth of the ir experience in addition to the available published resources and research relevant to this topic. Throughout the conse n\u00ad sus process, the panel members were mindful of the strengths and resilience inher ent in in\u00ad dividuals, families, and communities affectedby trauma and the challenges providers face in addressing trauma and imple menting TIC. Structure of the TIP Using a TIC framework (Exhibit 1.1-1), this TIP provides information on key aspects of trauma, including what it is; its consequences; screening and assessment; effective prevention, intervention, and treatment a p\u00ad proaches; trauma recovery; the impact of trauma on service providers; programmatic and administrative practices; and trauma re\u00ad sources. Note: To produce a user -friendly but i n\u00ad formed document, the first two parts of theTIP include minimal citations. If you are in\u00adterested in the citations associated with topics covered in Parts 1 and 2, please consult the review of the literature provided in Part 3 (available online a t http://store.samhsa.gov ). Parts 1 and 2 are easily read and digest ed on their own , but it is highly recommended that you read the literature review as well. Exhibit 1.1 -1: TIC Framework in Behavioral Health Services \u2014Sociocultural Perspective 6 See Appendix C to read about the histor y of trauma and trauma interventions. Part 1, Chapter 1 \u2014Trauma -Informed Care: A Sociocultural Perspective What Is Trauma? According to SAMHSA's Trauma and Justice Strategic Initiative, \"trauma results from anevent, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physi\u00adcally or emotionally harmful or threateningand that has lasting adverse ef fects on the i n\u00ad dividual's functioning and physical, social,emotional, or spiritual well -being\" (SAMHSA, 2012, p. 2). Trauma can affect people of every race, ethnicity, age, sexual or i\u00ad entation, gender, psychosocial background, andgeographic region. A trau matic experience can be a single event, a series of events, and/or achronic condition (e.g., childhood neglect , domestic violence). Traumas can affect ind i\u00ad viduals, families, groups, communities, specificcultures, and generations. It generally over\u00adwhelms an individual 's or community 's re\u00ad sources to cope, and it often ignites the \"fight, flight, or freeze \" reaction at the time of the event(s). It frequently produces a sense of fear,vulnerability, and helplessness. Often, traumatic events are unex\u00adpected. Indi vid uals may experience the traumatic even t directly, witness an event, feel threa t\u00ad ened, or hear about an event that affects someone they know. Events may be hu man- made, such as a mechanical error that causes a disaster, war, terrorism, sexual abuse, or vi o\u00ad lence, or they can be the products of nature (e.g., flooding, hurr icanes, tornadoes). Trauma can occur at any age or developmental stage,and often, events that occur outside expected life stages are perceived as traumatic (e.g., achild dying before a par ent, cancer as a teen, personal illness, job loss before retirement). It is not just the event itself that determines whether something is traumatic, but also the individual 's experience of the event. Two peo\u00ad ple may be exposed to the same event or series of events but experience and interpret these events in vastly different ways. Various biopsychosocial and cultural factors influence an individual's immediate response and lo ng\u00ad term reactions to trauma. For most, regardless of the severity of the trauma, the immediate orenduring effects of trauma are met with resil i\u00ad ence\u2014the ability to rise above the circum\u00ad stances or to meet the challenges withfortitude. For some people , reactions to a traumatic event are temporary, whereas others have pr o\u00ad longed reactions that move from acute symp\u00ad toms to more severe, prolonged , or enduring mental health consequences (e.g., posttra u\u00ad matic stress and other anxiety disorders, sub\u00ad stance use and mood disorders) and medical problems (e.g., arthritis, headaches, chronic pain). Others do not meet established criteria for posttraumatic stress or other mental diso r\u00ad ders but encounter significant trauma -related symptoms or culturally expressed symptoms oftrauma (e.g., somatization, in which psych o\u00ad logical stress is expressed through physical concerns). For that reason, even if an individ u\u00ad al does not meet diagnostic criteria fortrauma -related disorders, it is important to recognize that trauma may still affect his or her life in significant ways. For more info r\u00ad mation on traumatic events, trauma characte r\u00ad istics, traumatic stress reactions, and factors that heighten or decrease the impact o f trau\u00ad ma, see Part 1, Chapter 2, \"Trauma Awar e\u00ad ness,\" and Part 1, Chapter 3, \"Understanding the Impact of Trauma .\" Trauma Matters in Behavioral Health Services The past decade has seen an increased focus on the ways in which trauma, psychological distress, quality of life, health, mental illness, 7 Two Influential Stud ies That Set the Stage for the Development of TIC The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013) was a large epidemiological study involving more than 17,000 individuals from United States ; it analyzed the long -term effects of childhood and adolescent traumatic experiences on adult health risks, menta l health, healthcare costs, and life expectancy. The Women, Co- Occurring Disorders and Violence Study (SAMHSA, 2007) was a large multisite study focused on the role of interpersonal and other traumatic stressors among women; the interre\u00ad latedness of trauma, violence, and co -occurring substance use and mental disorders; and the incorp o\u00ad ration of trauma -informed and trauma -specific principles, models, and services. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services and substance a buse are linked . With the a t\u00ad tacks of September 11, 2001, and other acts of terror, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, disa s\u00ad trous hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, and sexual abuse scandals, trauma has moved to the for e\u00ad front of national consciousness. Trauma was once considered an abnormal experience. However , the first National Comorbidity Study established how prevalent traumas were in the lives of the general pop u\u00ad lation of the United States. In the study, 61percent of men and 51 percent of women r e\u00ad ported experiencing at least one trauma intheir lifetime, with witnessing a trauma, being involved in a natural disaster, and/or exper i\u00ad encing a life -threatening accident ranking as the most common events (Kessler et al., 1999).In Wave 2 of the National EpidemiologicSurvey on Alcohol and Related Conditions,71.6 percent of the sample reported witnessing trauma, 30.7 percent experienced a traumathat resulted in injury, and 17.3 percent exp e\u00ad rienced psychological trauma (El -Gabalawy, 2012). For a thorough review o f the impact of trauma on quality of life and health and among individuals with mental and substance use disorders, refer to Part 3 of this TIP , the online literature review. Rationale for TIC Integrating TIC into behavioral health ser\u00advices provides many benefits not only for cl i\u00ad ents, but also for their families and communities, for behavioral health service organization s, and for staff. Trauma -informed services bring to the forefront the belief that trauma can pervasively affect an individual 's well-being, including physical and mental health. For behavioral health service providers, trauma -informed practice offers many oppo r\u00ad tunities. It reinforces the importance of a c\u00ad quiring trauma -specific knowledge and skills to meet the specific needs of clients; of reco g\u00ad nizing that individuals may be affected by trauma regardless of its acknowledgment; of understanding t hat trauma likely affects many clients who are seeking behavioral health se r\u00ad vices; and of acknowledging that organizations and providers can retraumatize clients throughstandard or unex amined policies and practices. TIC stresses the importance of addressing the client individually rather than applying ge n\u00ad eral treatment approaches. TIC provides clients more opportunities to engage in services that reflect a compassionate perspective of their presenting problems. TIC can potentially provide a greater sense of saf e\u00ad ty for clients who have histories of trauma and a platform for preventi ng more serious cons e\u00ad quences of traumatic stress ( Fallot & Harris, 2001). Although many individuals may notidentify the need to connect with their histo\u00adries, trauma -informed services offer clients a chance to explore the impact of trauma, theirstrengths and creative adaptations in manag\u00ading traumatic histories, their resilience , and the relationships among trauma, substance use,and psychological symptoms. 8 Advice to Counselors: The Importance of TI C The history of trauma raises various clinical issues. Many counselors do not have extensive training in treating trauma or offering trauma -informed services and may be uncertain of how to respond to clients' trauma -related reactions or symptoms. Some counselors have experienced traumas them\u00ad selves that may be triggered by clients' reports of trauma. Others are interested in helping clients with trauma but may unwi ttingly cause harm by moving too deeply or quickly into trauma material or by discounting or disregarding a client's report of trauma. Counselors must be aware of trauma - related symptoms and disorders and how they affect clients in behavioral health treatm ent. Counselors with primary treatment responsibilities should also have an understanding of how to rec\u00ad ognize trauma -related reactions, how to incorporate treatment interventions for trauma -related symptoms into clients' treatment plans, how to help clients build a safety net to prevent further trauma, how to conduct psychoeducational interventions, and when to make treatment referrals for further evaluations or trauma -specific treatment services. All treatment staff should recognize that traumatic stress symptoms or trauma -related disorders should not preclude an individual from mental health or substance abuse treatment and that all co -occurring disorders need to be addressed on some level in the treatment plan and setting. For example, helping a client in substance abuse trea t\u00ad ment gain control over trauma -related symptoms can greatly improve the client's chances of sub\u00ad stance abuse recovery and lower the possibility of relapse Golding, Young, Mulligan, & Minkoff, 2004; Ouimette, Ahrens, Moos, & Finney, 1998). In addition, assisting a client in achieving abstinence builds a platform upon which recovery from traumatic stress can proceed. Part 1, Chapter 1 \u2014Trauma -Informed Care: A Sociocultural Perspective Implementing trauma -informed services can improve screening and assessment processes, treatment planning, and plac ement while also decreasing the risk for retraumatization. The implementation may enhance communication between the client and treatment provider,thus decreasing risks associated with misun\u00adderstanding the client 's reactions and presen t\u00ad ing problems or underestimating the need forappropriate referrals for evaluation or trauma - specific treatment. Organizational investmentin developing or improving trauma -informed services may also translate to cost effectiv e\u00ad ness, in that services are more appropriately matched to clients from the outset. TIC is an essential ingredient in organizational risk management; it ensures the implementation ofdecisions that will optimize therapeutic out\u00adcomes and minimize adverse effects on the client and, ultimately, the organiz ation. A key principle is the engagement of community,clients, and staff. Clients and staff are more apt to be empowered, invested, and satisfied ifthey are involved in the ongoing development and delivery of trauma -informed services. An organization al so benefits from work d e\u00ad velopment practices through planning for,attracting, and retaining a diverse workforce of individuals who are knowledgeable about trauma and its impact. Developing a trauma - informed organization involves hiring andpromotional prac tices that attract and retain individuals who are educated and trained in trauma -informed practices on all levels of the organization, including board as well as peersupport appointments. Trauma -informed o r\u00ad ganizations are invested in their staff and adopt similar trauma -informed principles , including establishing and providing ongoingsupport to promote TIC in practice and in addressing secondary trauma and implemen t\u00ad ing processes that reinforce the safety of the staff. Even though investing in a trauma - informed workforce does not necessarily gua r\u00ad antee trauma -informed practices, it is more likely that services will evolve more profi \u00ad ciently to meet client, staff, and community needs. 9 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services Trauma and Substance Use Disorders Many people who have substance use diso r\u00ad ders have experienced trauma as children , Stellman, Sommer, & Stellman, 2008; Ompad et al., 2005). Sub\u00ad stance abuse is known to predispose people to higher rates of traumas, such as dangerous situations and accidents, while under the i n\u00ad fluence (Stewart & Conrod, 2003 ; Zinzow, Resnick, Amstadter, McCauley, Ruggiero, & Kilpatrick, 2010) and as a result of the lifestyle associated with substance abuse (Reynolds etal., 2005). In addition, people who abuse sub\u00adstances and have experienced trauma haveworse treatment outcomes than those without histor ies of trauma (Driessen et al., 2008; Najavits et al., 2007). Thus, the process of r e\u00ad covery is more difficult , and the counselor 's role is more challenging , when clients have histories of trauma. A person presenting withboth trauma and substance abuse issues can have a variety of other difficult life problems that commonly accompany these disorders,such as other psychological symptoms or men\u00adtal disorders, poverty, homelessness, increasedrisk of HIV and other infections, and lack ofsocial support (Mills, Teesson, Ross, & Peters,2006; Najavits, Weiss, & Shaw, 1997). Many individuals who seek treatment for substance use disorders have histories of one or more traumas. More than half of women seekingsubstance abuse treatment report one or more lifetime traumas (Farley, Golding, Y oung,Mulligan, & Minkoff, 2004; Naja vits et al., 1997), and a significant number of clients ininpatient treatment also have subclinicaltraumatic stress symptoms or posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD; Falck, Wang, Siegal, & Carlson, 2004; Grant et al., 2004; Reynolds etal., 2005). Trauma and Mental Disorders People who are receiving treatment for severe mental disorders are more likely to have hist o\u00ad ries of trauma , including childhood physical and sexual abuse, serious accidents, homeles s\u00ad ness, involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations,drug overdoses, interpersonal violence, and other forms of violen ce. Many clients with severe mental disorders meet criteria for PTSD ; others with serious mental illness who have histories of trauma present with psych o\u00ad logical symptoms or mental disorders that are commonly associated with a history of trauma , including anxiety symptoms and disorders, mood disorders (e.g., major depression, dy s\u00ad thymia, bipolar disorder ; Mueser et al., 2004), impulse control disorders, and substance use disorders (Kessler, Chiu, D emler , & Walters, 2005). Traumatic stress increases the risk for mental illness, and findings suggest that traumaticstress increases the symptom severity of men\u00adtal illness (Spitzer, Vogel, Barnow, Freyberger& Grabe, 2007). These findings thattraumatic plays a significant role in per\u00ad petuating and exacerbating mental illness andsuggest that trauma often precedes the deve l\u00ad opment of mental disorders. As with trauma and substance use disorders, there is a bidirec\u00adtional relationship ; mental illness increases the risk of experiencing trauma, and trauma i n\u00ad creases the risk of developing psychological symptoms and mental disorders. For a more comprehensive review of the interactions among traumatic stress, mental illness, andsubstance use disorders, refer to Part 3 of thisTIP , the online literature review. 10 Advice to Counselors : Implementing Trauma -Informed Services Recognizing that trauma affects a majority of clients served within public health systems, the National Center for Trauma -Informed Care (NCTIC) has sought to establish a comprehensive framework to guide systems of care in the development of trauma -informed services. If a system or program is to support the needs of traum a survivors, it must take a systematic approach that offers trauma -specific diagnostic and treatment services, as well as a trauma -informed environment that is able to sustain such services, while fostering positive outcomes for the clients it serves. NCTI C also offers technical assistance in the implementation of trauma -informed services. For specific administrative information on TIC implementation, refer to Part 2, Chapters 1 and 2, of this TIP. \"A program, organization, or system that is trauma -informed realizes the widespread impact of trauma and under -stands pote n - tial paths for healing; rec ognizes the signs and symptoms of trau ma in staff, clients, and others involved with the system; and responds by fully integrating knowledge about trauma into policies, procedures, practices, and settings.\" (SAMHSA, 2012, p. 4) Part 1, Chapter 1 \u2014Trauma -Informed Care: A Sociocultural Perspective Trauma -Informed Intervention and Treatment Principles TIC is an inter vention and organizational approach that focuses on how trauma may affect an individual 's life and his or her re\u00ad sponse to behavioral health services from pr e\u00ad vention through treatment. There are many definitions of TIC and various models for incorporating it across organizations, but a \"trauma -informed approach incorporates three key elements: (1) realizing the prevalence of trauma; (2) recognizing how trauma affects all individuals involved with the program, organ i\u00ad zation, or system, including its own workforce; and (3) responding by putting this knowledge into practice\" (SAMHSA, 2012, p. 4 ). TIC begins with the first contact a person has with an agen cy; it requires all staff members (e.g., receptionists, intake personnel, direct care staff, supervisors, administrators, peer supports, board members) to recognize that the individual 's experience of trauma can greatly influence his or her receptivity to and engagement with services, interactions with staff and clients, and responsiveness to pr o\u00ad gram guidelines, practices, and interventions. TIC includes program policies, procedures, and practices t o protect the vulnerabilities of those who have experienced trauma and those who provide trauma -related services. TIC is created through a supportive environment and by redesigning organizational practices, with consumer participation, t o prev ent practices that could be retraumatizing (Harris & Fallot, 2001c ; Hopp er et al., 2010). The ethical pri n\u00ad ciple, \"first, do no harm, \" resonates strongly in the application of TIC. TIC involves a commitment to building co m\u00ad petenc e among staff and establishing pr o\u00ad grammatic standards and clinical guidelines that support the delivery of trauma -sensitive services. It encompasses recruiting, hiring, andretaining competent staff; involving consu m\u00ad ers, trauma survivors, and peer support specia l\u00ad ists in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of -informed services; devel\u00ad oping collaborations across service thereby securingtrauma -specific services when appropriate; and building a continuity of TIC as consumers move from one system or service to the next.TIC involves reevaluating each service deli v\u00ad ery component through a trauma -aware lens. The principles described in the following sub\u00adsections serve as the TIP 's conceptual 11 \"Trauma -informed care embraces a per\u00ad spective that highlights adaptation over symptoms and resilience over pathology.\" (Elliot, Bjelajac, Fallot, M arkoff, & Reed, 2005, p. 467 ) Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services framework. These principles comprise a co m\u00ad pilation of resources, including research, theo\u00ad retical papers, commentaries, and lessons learned from treatment facilities. Key elements are outlined for each principle in providing services to clients affected by trauma and to popu lations most likely to incur trauma. Although these principles are useful across all prevention and intervention services, settings,and populations, they are of the utmost i m\u00ad portance in working with people who have had traumatic experiences. Promote Trauma Awareness and Understanding Foremost, a behavioral health service providermust recognize the prevalence of trauma and its possible role in an individual 's emotional, behavioral, cognitive, spiritual, and/or physicaldevelopment, presentation, and well- being. Being vigilant about the prevalence and p o\u00ad tential consequences of traumatic events among clients allows counselors to tailor theirpresentation styles , theoretical approaches , and intervention strategies from the outset to planfor and be responsive to clients' specific needs. Although not every client has a history oftrauma, those who have substance use andmental disorders are more likely to have exp e\u00ad rienced trauma. Being trauma aware does notmean that you must assume everyone has ahistory of trauma, but rather that you antic i\u00ad pate the possibility from your initial contactand interactions, intake processes, and screen\u00ading and assessment procedures. Even the most standard behavioral health practices can retraumatize an individual e x\u00adposed to prior traumatic experiences if the pr ovider implements them without recogni z\u00ad ing or considering that they may do harm. For example, a counselor might develop a trea t\u00ad ment plan recommending that a female cli\u00adent\u2014who has been court mandated to substance abuse treatment and was raped as anadult \u2014attend group therapy, but without co n\u00ad sidering th e implications, for her, of the fact that the only available group at the facility isall male and has had a low historical rate of female participation. Trauma awareness is anessential strategy for preventing this type ofretraumatization; it reinforces the need for providers to reevaluate their usual practices. Becoming trauma aware does not stop with the recognition that trauma can affect clients;instead, it encompasses a broader awareness that traumatic experiences as well as the i m\u00ad pact of an individ ual's trauma can extend to significant others, family members, first r e\u00ad sponders and other medical professionals, b e\u00ad havioral health workers, broader social networks, and even entire communities. Fami\u00adly members frequently experience the tra u\u00ad matic stress reactions of the individual family member who was traumatized (e.g., angry outbursts, nightmares, avoidant behavior, othersymptoms of anxiety, overreactions or underr e\u00ad actions to stressful events). These repetitive experiences can increase the risk of secondary trauma and symptoms of mental illness among the family, heighten the risk for externalizing and internalizing behavior among children(e.g., bullying others, problems in rel a\u00ad tionships, health -damaging behaviors) , in\u00ad crease children 's risk for developing posttraumatic stress later in life, and lead to a greater propensity for traumatic stress rea c\u00ad tions across generations of the family. Hence,prevention and intervention services can pr o\u00ad vide education and age -appropriate progra m\u00ad ming tailored to develop coping skills andsupport systems. 12 Part 1, Chapter 1 \u2014Trauma -Informed Care: A Sociocultural Perspective So too, behavioral health service providers can be influenced by exposure to trauma -related affect and content when working with clients.A trauma -aware workplace supports superv i\u00ad sion and program practices that educate all direct service staff members on secondary trauma, encourages the processing o f trauma - related content through participation in peer - supported activities and clinical supervision,and provides them with professional develo p\u00ad ment opportunities to learn about and engage in effective coping strategies that help prevent secondary trauma or trauma -related symp\u00ad toms. It is important to generate traumaawareness in agencies through education across services and among all staff members who have any direct or indirect contact with clients (including receptionists or in take and admission personn el who engage clients for the first time within the agency). Agencies canmaintain a trauma -aware environment through ongoing staff training, continued s u\u00ad pervisory and administrative support, collab o\u00ad rative (i.e., participation)trauma -responsive program design and i m\u00ad plementation, and organizational policies andpractices that reflect accommodation and fle x\u00ad ibility in attending to the needs of clients a f\u00ad fected by trauma. Recognize That Trauma -Related Symptoms and Behaviors Originate From A dapting to Traumatic Experiences A trauma -informed perspective views trauma - related symptoms and behaviors as an individ\u00ad ual's best and most resilient attempt to ma n\u00ad age, cope with, and rise above his or her experience of trauma. Some individuals' means of adapting and coping have produced little difficulty ; the coping and adaptive strategies of others have worked in the past but are not working as well now. Some people have diff i\u00adculties in one area of life but have effectively negotiated and functioned in o ther areas. Individuals who have survived trauma vary widely in how they experience and express traumatic stress reactions.Traumatic stress reactions vary in severity; they are often mea s\u00ad ured by the level of impairment or distress thatclients report and are determined by the mul\u00ad tiple factors that characterize the trauma itself,individual history and characteristics, deve l\u00ad opmental factors, sociocultural attributes, andavailable resources. The characteristics of the trauma and the subsequent traumatic stress reactions can dramatically influence how ind i\u00ad viduals respond to th e environment, relatio n\u00ad ships, interventions, and treatment services,and those same characteristics can also shape the assumptions that clients/consumers make about their world ( e.g., their view of others, sense of safety), their future ( e.g., hopefulness, fear of a foreshortened future), and themselves (e.g., feeling resilient , feeling incompetent in regulating emotions). The breadth of these effects may be observable or subtle. Once you become aware of the significance of traumatic experiences in clients' lives and begin to view their presentation as adaptive, your identification and classification of theirpresenting symptoms and behaviors can shiftfrom a \"pathology \" mindset (i.e., defining cl i\u00ad ents strictly from a diagnostic label, implyingthat something is wrong with them) to one ofresilience \u2014a mindset that views clients' pre\u00ad senting difficulties, behaviors, and emotions as responses to surviving trauma. In essence, you will come to view traumatic stress reactions as normal reactions to abnormal situations. In embracing the belief that trauma -related rea c\u00ad tions are adaptive, you can begin relationshipswith clients from a hopeful, strength s-based stance that builds upon the belief th at their responses to traumatic experiences reflectcreativity, self -preservation, and determination. 13 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services This will help build mutual and collaborative therapeutic relationships, help clients identify what has worked and has not worked in their attempts to deal with the aftermath of traumafrom a nonjudgmental stance, and developintervention and coping strategies that aremore likely to fit their strengths and resources.This view of trauma prevents further retra u\u00ad matization by not defining traumatic stressreactions as pathological or as symptoms of pathology. View Trauma in the Context of Individuals ' Environments Many factors contribute to a person 's response to trauma, whether it is an individual, group, or community -based trauma. Individual at\u00ad tributes, developmental factors (including pr o\u00ad tective and risk factors), life history, type oftrauma, specific characteristics of the trauma,amount and length of trauma exposure, cultu r\u00ad al meaning of traumatic events, number oflosses associated with the trauma, avail able resources (internal and external, such as copingskills and family support), and community reactions are a few of the d eterminants that influence a person' s responses to trauma across time. Refer to the \"View Trauma Through a Sociocultural Lens\" section later in this cha p\u00ad ter for more specific information highlightingthe importance of culture in understandingand treating the effects of trauma. Trauma cannot be viewed narrowly; instead, it needs to be seen through a broader lens \u2014a contextual lens inte grating biopsychosocial, interpersonal, community, and societal (the degree of individualistic or collective cultural values) characteristics that are evident preced\u00ading and during the trauma, in the immediateand sustained response to the event(s), and inthe short -and long -term effects of the tra u\u00ad matic event(s), which may include housingavailability, community response, adherence to or maintenance of family routines and stru c\u00ad ture, and level of family support. To more adequately understand trauma, you must also consider the contexts in which it occurred. Understanding trauma from this angle helps expand the focus beyond individ u\u00ad al characteristics and effects to a broader sy s\u00ad temic perspective that acknowledges the influences of social interactions, communi ties, governments, cultures, and so forth , while also examining the possible interactions amongthose various influences. Bronfenbrenner 's (1979) and Bronfenbrenner and Ceci 's (1994) work on ecological models sparked the devel\u00adopment of other contextual mod els. In recent years, the social -ecological framework has been adopted in understanding trauma, inimplementing health promotion and otherprevention strategies, and in developing trea t\u00ad ment interventions (Centers for Disease Co n\u00ad trol and Prevention, 2009). Here are the three main beliefs of a social -ecological approach (Stokols, 1996): Environmental factors greatly influence emotional, physical, and social well -being. A fundamental determinant of health ver\u00ad sus illness is the degree of fit between ind i\u00ad viduals ' biological, behavioral, and sociocultural needs and the resources avai l\u00ad able to them. Prevention, intervention, and treatmentapproaches integrate a combination ofstrategies targeting individual, interperso n\u00ad al, and community systems. This TIP uses a soci al-ecological model to explore trauma and its effects (Exhibit 1 .1-2). The focus of this model is not only on neg a\u00ad tive attributes (risk factors) across each level,but also on positive ingredients (protective factors) that protect against or lessen the i m\u00ad pact of trauma. This model also guides the inclusion of certain targeted interventions inthis text, including selective and indicated 14 Part 1, Chapter 1 \u2014Trauma -Informed Care: A Sociocultural Perspective Exhibit 1.1 -2: A Social -Ecological Mod el for Understanding Trauma and Its Effects prevention activities. In addition, culture, d e\u00ad velopmental processes (including the devel\u00ad opmental stage or characteristics of the individual and/or community), and the specificera when the trauma(s) occurred c an signif i\u00ad cantly influence how a trauma is perceived andprocessed, how an individual or community engages in help -seeking, and the degree of accessibility, acceptability, and availability ofindividual and community resources. Depending on the developmen tal stage and/or processes in play, children, adolescents, and adults will perceive, interpret, and cope withtraumatic experiences differently. For example,a child may view a news story depicting a traumatic event on television and believe that the traum a is recurring every time they see the scene replayed. Similarly, the era in which one lives and the timing of the trauma can greatly influence an individual or community r e\u00ad sponse. Take, for example, a pregnant womanwho is abusing drugs and is wary of rec eiving medical treatment after being beaten in a d o\u00ad mestic dispute. She may fear losing her chi l\u00ad dren or being arrested for child neglect. Eventhough a number of States have adopted poli\u00adcies focused on the importance of treatmentfor pregnant women who are abusing drugs and of the accessibility of prenatal care, other States have approach ed this issue from a crim\u00ad inality standpoint ( e.g., with child welfare and criminal laws) in the past few decades. Thus , the traumatic event 's timing is a significant 15 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services component in understanding the context of trauma and trauma -related responses. The social -ecological model depicted in E x\u00ad hibit 1.1-2 provides a systemic framework for looking at individuals, families, and commun i\u00ad ties affected by trauma in general; it highlights the bidirectional influence that multiple co n\u00ad texts can have on the provision of behavioral health services to people who have exper i\u00ad enced trauma (see thin arrow). Each ring re p\u00ad resents a different system (refer to Exhibit 1.1-3 for examples of specific factors within each system) . The inner most ring represents the individual and his or her biopsychosocialcharacteristics. The \"Interpersonal\" circle e m\u00ad bodies all immediate relationships including family, friends, peers, and others. The \"Com\u00ad munity/Organizational \" band represents social support networks, workplaces, neighborhoods,and institutions that directly influence theindividual and his/her relationships. The \"So\u00ad cietal \" circle signifies the largest system \u2014State and Federal policies and laws, such as ec o\u00ad nomic and healthcare policies, social norms, governmental systems, and political ideologies.The outermost ring, \"Period of Time in His\u00ad tory,\" reflects the si gnificance of the period of time during which the event occurred ; it influ\u00ad ences each other level represented in the circle.For example, making a comparison of society 's attitudes and responses to veterans' homeco m\u00ad ings across different wars and conflicts through time shows that homecoming env i\u00ad ronments can have either a protective or a negative effect on healing from the psycholo g\u00ad ical and physical wounds of war, depending onthe era in question. The thicker arrows in the figure represent the key influences o f culture, developmental characteristics, and the type and characteristics of the trauma. All told, thecontext of traumatic events can significantly influence both initial and sustained responses to trauma; treatment needs; selection of pr e\u00ad vention, interv ention, and other treatment Exhibit 1.1 -3: Understanding the Levels Within the Social -Ecological Model of Trauma and Its Effect s Individual Factors Interpersonal Factors Community and Organizational Factors Societal Factors Cultural and Developmen\u00ad tal Factors Period of Time in History Age, biophys i\u00ad cal state, men\u00ad tal health status, tempe r\u00ad ament and other persona l\u00ad ity traits, ed u\u00ad cation, gender, coping styles, socioeconomic status Family, peer, and significant other intera c\u00ad tion patterns, parent/famil y mental health, parents ' histo\u00ad ry of trauma, social network Neighborhood quality, school system and/or work environ\u00ad ment, behavioral health system quality and acces\u00adsibility, faith - based settings, transportation availability, co m\u00ad munity socioec o\u00ad nomic status, community em\u00ad ployment rates Laws, State and Federal econom ic and social policies, media, societal norms, judicial system Collective or individualistic cultural norms, et h\u00ad nicity, cultural subsystem norms, to military service mem\u00ad bers' hom e\u00ad comings, changes in diagnostic understanding between DSM\u00ad III-R* and DSM -5** *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised ( American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1987) **Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (APA, 2013a) 16 Marisol is a 28-year-old Latina woman working as a barista at a local coffee shop. One evening, she was driving home in the rain when a drunk driver crossed into her lane and hit her head on. Marisol remained conscious as she waited to be freed from the car and was then transported to the hospital. She sustained fractures to both legs. Her recovery involved two surgeries and nearly 6 months of rehabilitation, including initial hospitalization and outpatient physical therapy. She described her friends and family as very supportive, saying that they often foresaw what she needed before she had to ask. She added that she had an incredible sense of gratitude for her em\u00ad ployer and coworkers, who had taken turns visiting and driving her to appointments. Although s he was able to return to work after 9 months, Marisol continued experiencing considerable distress about her inability to sleep well, which started just after the accident. Marisol describes repetitive dreams and memories of waiting to be transported to the hospital after the crash. The other driver was charged with driving under the influence (DUI), and it was reported that he had been convicted two other times for a DUI misdemeanor. Answering the following questions will help you see how the different levels of influence affect the impact and outcome of the traumatic event Marisol experienced, as well as her responses to that event: 1. Based on the limited information provided in this illustration, how might Marisol's personality affect the responses of her family and friends, her coworkers, and the larger community? 2. In what ways could Marisol's ethnic and cultural background influence her recovery? 3. What societal factors could play a role in the car crash itself and the outcomes for Marisol and the other dri ver? Explore the influence of the period of time in history during which the scenario occurs \u2014compare the possible outcomes for both Marisol and the other driver if the crash occurred 40 years ago versus in the present day. Part 1 , Chapter 1 \u2014Trauma -Informed Care: A Sociocultural Perspective strategies; and ways of providing hope and promoting recovery. Minimize the Risk of Retraumatization or Replicating Prior Trauma Dynamics Trauma -informed treatment providers acknowledge that clients who have histories of trauma may be more likely to experience pa r\u00ad ticular treatment procedures and practices as negative, reminiscent of spec ific characteristics of past trauma or abuse, or retraumatizing \u2014 feeling as if the past trauma is reoccurring oras if the treatment experience is as dangerous and unsafe as past traumas. For instance, cl i\u00ad ents may express feelings of powerlessness orbeing trapped if they are not actively involved in treatment decisions; if treatment processes or providers mirror specific behavior from the clients' past experiences with trauma, they may voice distress or respond in the same way as they did to the original tr auma. Among the potentially retraumatizing elements of trea t\u00ad ment are seclusion or \"time -out\" practices that isolate individuals, mislabeling client symp\u00ad toms as personality or other mental disorders rather than as traumatic stress reactions, in\u00ad teractions that command authority, treatment assignments that could humiliate clients (suchas asking a client to wear a sign in group thatreflects one of their treatment issues, even ifthe assignment centers on positive attributes of the client), confronting clients as resistant,or presenting treatment as conditional uponconformity to the provider 's beliefs and defin i\u00ad tions of issues. Clients' experiences are unique to the specific traumas they have faced and the surrounding 17 How often have you heard \"We aren't equipped to handle trauma\" or \"We don't have time to deal with reactions that surface if traumatic experiences are discussed in treatment\" from counselors and administrators in behavioral health services? For agencies, staff members, and clients, these stat e\u00ad ments present many difficulties and unwanted outcomes. For a client, such comments may replicate his or her earlier encounters with others (including family, friends, and previous behavioral health professionals) who h ad difficulty acknowledging or talking about traumatic experiences with him or her. A hands -off approach to trauma can also reinforce the client's own desire to avoid such discus\u00ad sions. Even when agencies and staff are motivated in these sentiments by a goo d intention \u2014to con\u00ad tain clients' feelings of being overwhelmed \u2014such a perspective sends strong messages to clients that their experiences are not important, that they are not capable of handling their trauma - associated feelings, and that dealing with traumatic experiences is simply too dangerous. Statements like these imply that recovery is not possible and provide no structured outlet to address memories of trauma or traumatic stress reactions. Nevertheless, determining how and when to address traumatic stress in behavioral health services can be a real dilemma, especially if there are no trauma -specific philosophical, programmatic, or procedural processes in place. For example, it is difficult to provide an appropriate forum for a client to address past tr aumas if no forethought has been given to developing interagency and intra - agency collaborations for trauma -specific services. By anticipating the need for trauma -informed services and planning ahead to provide appropriate services to people who are affect ed by trauma, behavioral health service providers and program administrators can begin to develop informed inter\u00ad vention strategies that send a powerful, positive message: Both clients and providers can competently manage traumatic experiences and reactions . Providers are interested in hearing clients' stories and attending to their experiences. Recovery is possible . Tra uma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services circumstances before, during, and after that trauma, so remember that even seemingly safe and standard treatment policies and proc e\u00ad dures, including physical plant operations ( e.g., maintenance, grounds, fire and safety proc e\u00ad dures), may feel quite the contrary for a clientif one or more of those elements is reminiscent of his or her experience of trauma in some way. Examples include having limited privacy or personal space, being interviewed in a room that feels too isolating or confining, underg o\u00ad ing physical examination by a medical profe s\u00ad sional of the same sex as the client 's previous perpetrator of abuse, attending a group session in which another client expresses anger appr o\u00ad priately in a role play, or being directed not totalk about distressing experiences as a means of deescalating traumat ic stress reactions. Although some treatment policies or proc e\u00ad dures are more obviously likely to solicit di s\u00adtress than others, all standard practices should be evaluated for their potential to retraumatize a client; this cannot be done without knowingthe specific features of the individual' s history of trauma. Consider, for instance, a treatmentprogram that serves meals including entrees that combine more than one food group. Your client enters this program and refuses to eatmost of the time; he expresses anger towarddietary staff and claims that food choices arelimited. You may initially perceive your cli\u00adent's refusal to eat or to avoid certain foods as an eating disorder or a behavioral problem.However, a trauma -aware perspective might change your assumptions; consider that this client experienced neglect and abuse sur\u00adrounding food throughout childhood (his mother forced him to eat meals prepared by combining anything in the refrigerator and cooking them together). 18 From the first time you provide outpatient counseling to Mike, you explain that he can call an agency number that will put him in direct contact with someone who can provide further assistance or sup\u00ad port if he has emotional difficulty after the session or after agency hours. However, when he attempts to call one night, no one is available despite what you've described. Instead, Mike is directed by an operator to either use his local emergency room if he perceives his situation to be a crisis or to wait for someone on call to contact him. The inconsistency between what you told him in the session and what actually happens when he calls makes Mike feel unsafe and vulnerable. Pa rt 1, Chapter 1 \u2014Trauma -Informed Care: A Sociocultural Perspective As a treatment provider, you cannot consist\u00ad ently predict what may or may not be upset\u00adting or retraumatizing to clients. Therefore, itis important to maintain vigilance and an att i\u00ad tude of curiosity with clients, inquiring aboutthe concerns that they expre ss and/or present in treatment. Remember that certain behaviors or emotional expressions can reflect what has happened to them in the past. Foremost, a trauma -informed approach begins with taking practical steps to reexamine trea t\u00ad ment strategies, program procedures, and o r\u00ad ganizational polices that could solicit distress or mirror common characteristics of traumatic experiences (loss of control, being trapped, orfeeling disempowered). To better anticipate the interplay between various treatment ele\u00adments and the more idiosyncratic aspects of aparticular client 's trauma history, you can: Work with the client to learn the cues he or she associates with past trauma. Obtain a good history. Maintain a supportive, empathetic, andcollaborative relationship. Enco urage ongoing dialog. Provide a clear message of availability andaccessibility throughout treatment . In sum, trauma -informed providers anticipate and respond to potential practices that may beperceived or experienced as retraumatizing toclients; they are able to forge new ways to r e\u00ad spond to specific situations that trigger atrauma -related response, and they can provide clients with alternative ways of engaging in a particularly problematic element of treatment. Create a Safe Environment The need to create a safe environment is not new to providers; it involve s an agency -wide effort supported by effective policies and pr o\u00ad cedures. However, creating safety within atrauma -informed framework far exceeds the standard expectations of physical plant safety (e.g., facility, environment al, and space -related concerns ), security (of staff members, clients, and personal property), policies and proc e\u00ad dures (including those specific to seclusionand restraint), emergency management anddisaster planning, and adherence to clien t rights. Providers must be responsive and adapt the environment to establish and support cli\u00ad ents' sense of physical and emotional safety. Beyond anticipating that various environ \u00ad mental stimuli within a program may generate strong emotions and reactions in a trauma survivor (e.g., triggers such as light ing, access to exits, seating arrangements, emotionality within a group, or visual or auditory stimuli)and implementing strategies to help clients cope with triggers that evoke their experiences with trauma, other key elements in establish\u00ading a safe envir onment include consistency in client interactions and treatment processes,following through with what has been r e\u00ad viewed or agreed upon in sessions or meetings,and dependability. Mike 's case illustration d e\u00ad picts ways in which the absence of these key elements could erode a client 's sense of safety during the treatment process. Neither providers nor service processes are always perfect. Sometimes, providers 19 Case Illustration: Jan e Jane, a newly hired female counselor, had a nephew who took his own life. The program that hired her was short of workers at the time; therefore, Jane did not have an opportunity to engage suffi\u00ad ciently in orientation outside of reviewing the policies and procedure manual. In an attempt to pr e\u00ad sent well to her new employer and supervisor, she readily accepted client assignments without considering her recent loss. By not immersing herself in the program's perspective and policies on staff well -being, ethical and clinical considerations in client assignments, and how and when to seek supervision, Jane failed to engage in the practices, heavily supported by the agency, that promoted safety for herself and her clients. Subsequently, she felt emotionally overwhelmed at work and would often abruptly request psychiatric evaluation for clients who expressed any feelings of hopelessness out of sheer panic that they would attempt suicide. T rauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services unintentionally relay information inaccurately or inconsistently to clients or other staff mem\u00ad bers; other times, clients mishear something , or extenuating circumstances prevent provi d\u00ad ers from responding as promised. Creating safety is not about getting it right all the time;it's about how consistently and forthrightly you handle situations with a client when ci r\u00ad cumstances provoke feelings of being vulner a\u00ad ble or unsafe. Honest and compassionate communication that conveys a sense of han\u00ad dling the situation together generates safety. It is equally important that safety extend s be\u00ad yond the client. Counselors a nd other beha v\u00ad ioral health staff members, including peer support specialists, need to be able to count onthe agency to be responsive to and maintaintheir safety within the environment as well. By incorporating an organizational ethos thatrecognizes the importance of practices that promote physical safety and emotional well\u00adbeing, behavioral health staff members may be more likely to seek support and supervision when needed and to comply with clinical and programmatic practices that minimize risksfor the mselves and their clients. Beyond an attitudinal prom otion of safety, organizational leaders need to consider and create avenues of professional developmentand assistance that will give their staff the means to seek support and process distressingcircumstances or events that occur within the agency or amon g their clientele, such as case consultation and supervision, formal or info r\u00ad mal processes to debrief service providers about difficult clinical issues, and referral pr o\u00ad cesses for client psychological evaluations andemployee assistance for staff. Organizational practices are only effective if supported by unswerving trauma awareness, training, andeducation among staff. Jane 's case illustration show s the impact of a minor but necessary postponement in staff orientation for a newhire\u2014not an unusual circumstance in beha v\u00ad ioral health programs that have heavy cas e\u00ad loads and high staff turnover. Identify Recovery From Trauma as a Primary Goal Often, people who initiate or are receiving mental health or substance abuse services don 't identify their experiences with trauma as a significant factor in their current challenges orproblems. In part, this is because people whohave been exposed to trauma, whether once orrepeatedly, are generally reluctant to revisit it.They may already feel stuck in repetitive memor ies or experiences, which may add to their existing belief that any intervention will make matters worse or, at least, no better. For some clients, any int roduction to their trauma - related memories or minor cues reminiscent of the trauma will cause them to experience strong, quick -to-surface emotions, supporting their belief that addressing trauma is dange r\u00ad ous and that they won 't be able to handle the 20 Part 1, Chapter 1 \u2014Trauma -Informed Care: A Sociocultural Perspective emotions or thoughts that result from a t\u00ad tempting to do so. Others readily view their experiences of trauma as being in the pas t; as a result, they engage in distraction, dissociation, and/or avoidance (as well as adaptation) due toa belief that trauma has little impact on theircurrent li ves and presenting problems. Even individuals who are quite aware of the impact that trauma has had on their lives may still struggle to translate or connect how these events continue to shape their choices, beha v\u00ad iors, and emotions. Many survivors draw no connection between trauma and their mental health or substance abuse problems, whichmakes it more difficult for them to see the value of trauma -informed or trauma -specific interventions, such as creating safety, engagingin psychoeducation, enhancing coping skills,and so forth. As a trauma -informed provider, it is important that you help clients bridge the gap between their mental health and substance -related i s\u00ad sues and the traumatic experiences they may have had. All too often, trauma occurs before substance use and mental disorders develop;then, such disorders and their associated symptoms and consequences create opportun i\u00ad ties for additional traumatic events to occur. If individuals engage in mental health and sub\u00adstance abuse treatment without addressing the role that trauma has played in their lives, they are less likely to experience recovery in the long run. For example, a person with a history of trauma is more likely to have anxiety anddepressive symptoms, use substances to self - medicate, and/or relapse after exposure totrauma -related cues. Thus, collaboration wit h\u00ad in and between behavioral health agencies is necessary to make integrated, timely, trauma - specific interventions available from the b e\u00ad ginning to clients/consumers who engage insubstance abuse and mental health services. Support Control, Choice, and Autonomy Not every client who has experienced trauma and is engaged in behavioral health services wants, or sees the need for, trauma -informed or trauma -specific treatment. Clients may think that they 've already dealt with their trauma adequately, or they may beli eve that the effects of past trauma cause minimal di s\u00ad tress for them. Other clients may voice the same sentiments, but without conviction \u2014 instead using avoidant behavior to deter dis\u00adtressing symptoms or reactions. Still others may struggle to see the role o f trauma in their presenting challenges, not connecting theirpast traumatic experiences with other, more current difficulties (e.g., using substance s to self-medicate strong emotions). Simply the idea of acknowledging trauma -related exper i\u00ad ences and/or stress reactions may be toofrightening or overwhelming for some clients,and others may fear that their reactions will be dismissed. On the other hand, some individ u\u00ad als want so much to dispense with their tra u\u00ad matic experiences and reactions that they hurried ly and repeatedly disclose their exper i\u00ad ences before establishing a sufficient ly safe environment or learning effective coping stra t\u00ad egies to offset distress and other effects of r e\u00ad traumatization. As these examples show, not everyone affected by trauma will approach trauma -informed services or recognize the impact of trauma in their lives in the same manner. This can be challenging to behavioral health service pr o\u00ad viders who are knowledgeable about the i m\u00ad pact of trauma and who perceive the importance of addressing trauma and its e f\u00ad fects with clients. As with knowing that di f\u00ad ferent clients may be at different levels ofawareness or stages of change in substance abuse treatment services, you shouldacknowledge that people affected by trauma 21 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services present an array of reactions, various levels of trauma awareness, and different degrees ofurgency in their need to address trauma. Appreciating clients' perception of their pre\u00ad senting pr oblems and viewing their responses to the impact of trauma as adaptive \u2014even when you believe their methods of dealing with trauma to be detrimental \u2014are equally important elements of TIC. By taking the time to engage with clients and understand the ways the y have perceived, adjusted to, and responded to traumatic experiences, providers are more likely to project the message thatclients possess valuable personal expertise andknowledge about their own presenting pro b\u00ad lems. This shifts the viewpoint from \"Provid\u00ad ers know best \" to the more collaborative \"Together , we can find solutions. \" How often have you heard from clients thatthey don 't believe they can handle symptoms that emerge from reexperiencing traumaticcues or memories? Have you ever heard clients state that they can 't trust themselves or their reactions, or that they never know when they are going to be triggered or how they are g o\u00ad ing to react? How confident would you feel about yourself if, at any time, a loud noise could initiate an immediate attem pt to hide, duck, or dive behind something? Traumaticexperiences have traditionally been describedas exposure to events that cause intense fear, helplessness, horror, or feelings of loss of co n\u00ad trol. Participation in behavioral health servicesshould not mirror these aspects of traumaticexperience. Working collaboratively to facil i\u00ad tate client s' sense of control and to maximize clients' autonomy and choices throughout the treatment process, including treatment pla n\u00ad ning, is crucial in trauma -informed servic es. For some individuals, gaining a sense of co n\u00ad trol and empowerment, along with under\u00adstanding traumatic stress reactions, may be pivotal ingredients for recovery. By creating opportunities for empowerment, counselors and other behavioral health service p roviders help reinforce, clients' sense of competenc e, which is often eroded by trauma and pr o\u00ad longed traumatic stress reactions. Keep inmind that treatment strategies and procedures that prioritize client choice and control neednot focus solely on major life decisions ortreatment planning; you can apply such a p\u00ad proaches to common tasks and everyday inter\u00adactions between staff and consumers. Tr y asking your clients some of the followingquestions (which are only a sample of the types of questions that could be useful): What information would be helpful for us to know about what happened to you? Where/ when would you like us to call you? How would you like to be addressed? Of the services I 've described, which seem to match your present concerns and needs? From your experience, what responses from others appear to work best when you feel overwhelmed by your emotions? Likewise, organizations need to reinforce the importance of staff autonomy, choice, andsense of c ontrol. What resources can staff members access, and what choices are availa\u00ad ble to them, in processing emotionally chargedcontent or events in treatment? How often do administrators and supervisors seek out feed\u00adback on how to handle problematic situations(e.g., staff rotations for vacations, case consu l\u00ad tations, changes in scheduling)? Think aboutthe parallel between administration and staffmembers versus staff members and clients ; often, the same philosophy, attitudes, and behaviors conveyed to staff members by ad\u00ad ministrative practices are mirrored in staff - client interactions. Simply stated, if staffmembers do not feel empowered, it will be achallenge for them to value the need for clientempowerment. (For more information onadministrative and workfo rce development issues, refer to Part 2, Chapters 1 and 2.) 22 members cannot make decisions pertaining to interventions or involvement in community services autocratically; instead, they should develop trauma -informed, individualized care plans and/or treatment plans collaboratively with the client and, when appropriate, with family and caregivers. The nonauthoritarian approach that characterizes TIC views clients Mina initially sought counseling after her husband was admitted to an intensive outpatient drug and alcohol program. She was self -referred for low -grade depression, resentment toward her spouse, and codependency. When asked to define \"codependency\" and how the term applied to her, she responded that she always felt guilty and responsible for everyone in her family and for events that occurred even when she had little or no control over them. After the intake and screening process, she expressed interest in attending group sessions that f o\u00ad cused primarily on family issues and substance abuse, wherein her presenting concerns could be explored. In addition to describing dynamics and issues relating to substance abuse and its impact on her marriage, she referred to her low mood as frozen grief. During treatment, she reluctantly began to talk about an event that she described as life changing: the loss of her father. The story began to unfold in group; her father, who had been 62 years old, was driving her to visit a cousin. During the ride, he had a heart attack and drove off the road. As the car came to stop in a field, she remembered calling 911 and beginning cardiopulmonary resuscitation while waiting for the amb u\u00ad lance. She rode with the paramedics to the hospital, watching them work to save her father's life; however, he was pronounced dead soon after arrival. She always felt that she never really said goodbye to her father. In group, she was asked what she would need to do or say to feel as if she had revisit ed that opportunity. She responded in quite a unique way, saying, \"I can't really answer this question; the lighting isn't right for me to talk about my dad.\" The counselor encouraged her to adjust the lighting so that it felt \"right\" to her. Being invited to do so turned out to be pivotal in her ability to address her loss and to say goodbye to her father on her terms. She spent nearly 10 minutes moving the dimmer switch for the lighting as ot h\u00ad ers in the group patiently waited for her to return to her chair. She then began to talk about what happened during the evening of her father's death, their relationship, the events leading up to that evening, what she had wanted to say to him at the hospital, and the things that she had been want\u00ad ing to share with him since his death. Weeks later, as the group was coming to a close, each member spoke about the most important experiences, tools, and insights that he or she had taken from participating. Mina disclosed that the group helped her establish b oundaries and co ping strategies within her marriage, but said that the event that made the most difference for her had been having the ability to adjust the lighting in the room. She explained that this had allowed her to control something over which she had been po w\u00ad erless during her father's death. To her, the lighting had seemed to stand out more than other d e\u00ad tails at the scene of the accident, during the ambulance ride, and at the hospital. She felt that the personal experience of losing her father and needing to be with him in the emergency room was marred by the obtrusiveness of staff, procedures, machines, and especially, the harsh lighting. She reflected that she now saw the lighting as a representation of this tragic event and the lack of priv a\u00ad cy she had experienced when trying to say goodbye to her father. Mina stated that this moment in group had been the greatest gift: \"...to be able to say my goodbyes the way I wanted... I was given an opportunity to have some control over a tragic event where I couldn't control the outcome no matter how hard I tried.\" Part 1, Chapter 1 \u2014 Trauma -Informed Care: A Sociocultural Perspective Create Collaborative Relationships and Participation Opportunities This trauma -informed principle encompasses three main tenets. First, ensure that the provider -client relationship is collaborative , regardless of settin g or service. Agency staff 23 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services as the experts in their own lives and current struggles, thereby emphasizing that clients andproviders can learn from each other . The second tenet is to build collaboration beyond the provider -client relationship . Building ongoing relationships across the ser\u00advice system, provider networks, and the local community enhances TIC continuity as cli\u00ad ents move from one level of service to the next or when they are involved in multiple services at one time. It also allows you to learn about resource s available to your clients in the se r\u00ad vice system or community and to connect withproviders who have more advanced training intrauma -specific interventions and services. The third tenet emphasizes the need to en\u00ad sure client/consumer representation andparticipation in behavioral he alth program development, planning, and evaluation aswell as in the professional development ofbehavioral health workers . To achieve tra u\u00ad ma-informed competence in an organization or across systems, clients need to play an active role; this starts with pr oviding program fee d\u00ad back. However, consumer involvement shouldnot end there ; rather, it should be encouraged throughout the implementation of trauma - informed services. So too, clients, potential clients, their families, and the community should be invited to participate in forming any behavioral health organization 's plans to i m\u00ad prove trauma -informed competence, provide TIC, and design relevant treatment services and organizational policies and procedures. Trauma -informed principles and practices generated without the input of people affected by trauma are difficult to apply effectively. Likewise, staff trainings and presentationsshould include individuals who have felt the impact of trauma. Their participation reachespast the purely cognitive aspects of such ed u\u00ad cation to offer a personal perspective on the strengths and resilience of people who have experienced trauma. The involvement oftrauma survivors in behavioral health educ a\u00ad tion lends a human face to subject matter thatis all too easily made cerebral by some staffmembers in an attempt to avoid the emotio n\u00ad ality of the topic. Consumer participation also means giving clients/consumers the chance to obtain State training and certification, as well as emplo y\u00ad ment in behavioral health settings as peer spe\u00ad cialists. Programs that incorporate peersupport services reinforce a powerful me s- sage\u2014that provider -consumer partnership is important , and that consumers are valued. Peer support specialists are self -identified in\u00ad dividuals who have progressed in their own recovery from alcohol dependence, drug ad\u00ad diction, and/or a mental disorder and work within behavioral health programs or at peersupport centers to assist others with similardisorders and/or life experiences. Tasks andresponsibilities may include lea ding a peer support group; modeling effective coping,help-seeking, and self -care strategies; helping clients practice new skills or monitor progress;promoting positive self -image to combat cli\u00ad ents' potentially negative feelings about them\u00ad selves and the d iscrimination they may perceive in the program or community; ha n\u00ad dling case management tasks; advocating forprogram changes; and representing a voice ofhope that views recovery as possible. Familiarize the Client With Trauma -Informed Services Without thinking too much about it, you probably know the purpose of an intake pr o\u00ad cess, the correct way to complete a screeningdevice, the meaning of a lot of the jargon sp e\u00ad cific to behavioral health, and your program 's expectations for client participation; in fact , maybe you 're already involved in facilitating these processes in behavioral health services every day, and they 've become almost 24 Part 1, Chapter 1 \u2014Trauma -Informed Care: A Sociocultural Perspective automatic for you. This can make it easy to forget that nearly everything clients and their families encounter in seeking beh avioral health assistance is new to them. Thus, intr o\u00ad ducing clients to program services, activities,and interventions in a manner that expects them to be unfamiliar with these processes is essential, regardless of their clinical and trea t\u00ad ment history. Bey ond addressing the unfamili\u00ad arity of services, educating clients about each process \u2014from first contact all the way through recovery services \u2014gives them a chance to participate actively and make i n\u00ad formed decisions across the continuum of care. Familiarizing clients with trauma -informed services extends beyond explaining program services or treatment processes; it involves explaining the value and type of trauma - related questions that may be asked during anintake process, educating clients about trauma to help normalize traumatic stress reactio ns, and discussing trauma -specific interventions and other available services ( including expla\u00ad nations of treatment methodologies and of the rationale behind specific interventions). D e\u00ad velopmentally appropriate psychoeducationabout trauma -informed ser vices allows clients to be informed participants. Incorporate Universal Routine Screenings for Trauma Screening universally for client histories, exp e\u00ad riences, and symptoms of trauma at intake can benefit clien ts and providers. Most providers know that clients can be affected by trauma, but universal screening provides a steady r e\u00ad minder to be watchful for past traumatic exp e\u00ad riences and their potential influence upon a client 's interactions and engagement with ser\u00ad vices across the continuum of care. Screeningshould guide treatment planning; it alerts thestaff to potential issues and serves as a valuable tool to increase clients' awareness of the possi\u00adble impact of trauma and the importance ofaddressing related i ssues during treatment. Nonetheless, screenings are only as useful as the guidelines and processes established toaddress positive screens (which occur whenclients respond to screening questions in a way that signifies possible trauma -related symp\u00ad toms or histories). Staff should be trained to use screening tools consistently so that all cli\u00adents are screened in the same way. Staff mem\u00ad bers also need to know how to score screenings and when specific variables (e.g.,race/ethnicity, native language, gender, c ulture) may influence screening results. For example, awoman who has been sexually assaulted by aman may be wary of responding to questions ifa male staff member or interpreter administers the screening or provides translation services.Likewise, a pers on in a current abusive or vi o\u00ad lent relationship may not acknowledge the interpersonal violence in fear of retaliation or as a result of disconnection or denial of his or her experience, and he or she may have diff i\u00ad culty in processing and then living between two worlds\u2014what is acknowledge d in trea t\u00ad ment versus what is experienced at home. In addition, staff training on using trauma - related screening tools needs to center on how and when to gather relevant information afterthe screening is complete. Organizat ional po l\u00ad icies and procedures should guide staff me m\u00ad bers on how to respond to a positive screening,such as by making a referral for an indepthassessment of traumatic stress, providing the client with an introductory psychoeducational session on the typical biopsychosocial effects of trauma, and/or coordinating care so that theclient gains access to trauma -specific services that meet his or her needs. Screening tool se\u00adlection is an important ingredient in incorp o\u00ad rating routine, universal screening practic es into behavioral health services. Many screen\u00ading tools are available, yet they differ in format 25 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services and in how they present questions. Select t ools based not just on sound test properties, but also according to whether they encompass a broad range of experie nces typically consi d\u00ad ered traumatic and are flexible enough to a l\u00ad low for an individual 's own interpretation of traumatic events. For more information on screening and assessment of trauma and tra u\u00ad ma-related symptoms and effects, see Chapter 4, \"Screening and Assessment, \" in this TIP . View Trauma Through a Sociocultural Lens To understand how trauma affects an indivi d\u00ad ual, family, or community, you must first un\u00ad derstand life experiences and cultural background as key contextual elements for that trauma. As demonstrated in Exhibit 1.1\u00ad2, many factors shape traumatic experiences and individual and community responses to it;one of the most significant factors is culture. Itinfluences the interpretation and meaning of traumatic events, individual beliefs regardingpersonal responsibility for the trauma andsubsequent responses, and the meaning andacceptability of symptoms, support, and help - seeking behaviors. As this TIP proceeds todescribe the differences among cultures per\u00adtaining to trauma, remember that there arenumerous cross -cutting factors that can direc t\u00ad ly or indirectly influence the attitudes, beliefs,behaviors, resources, and opportunities withina given culture, subculture, or racial and/or ethnic group ( Exhibit 1.1-4). For an indepth Exhibit 1.1 -4: Cross -Cutting Factors of Cultur e 26 \"Trauma -informed care recognizes symp - toms as originating from adaptations to the traumatic event(s) or context. Valida t\u00ad ing resilience is important even when past coping behaviors are now causing pro b\u00ad lems. Understanding a symptom as an adaptation reduces a survivor's guilt and shame, increases their self -esteem and provides a guideline for developing new skills and resources to allow new and bet\u00ad ter adapt ation to the current situation. \" (Elliot et al., 2005 , p. 467 ) Culture and Traum a Some populations and cultures are more likely than others to experience a traumatic event or a specific type of trauma. Rates of traumatic stress are high across all diverse populations and cultures that face military action and political violence. Culture influences not only whether certain events are perceived as traumatic, but also how an individual interprets and assigns meaning to the trauma. Some traumas may have greater impact on a given culture because those traumas represent something significant for that culture or disrupt cultural practices or ways of life. Culture determines acceptable responses to trauma and shapes the expression of distress. It significantly influences how people convey traumatic stress through behavior, emotions, and thinking immediately following a trauma and well after the traumatic experience has ceased. Traumatic stress symptoms vary according to the type of trauma within the culture. Culture affects what qualifies as a legitimate health concern and which symptoms warrant help. In addition to shaping beliefs about acceptable forms of help -seeking behavior and healing pra c\u00ad tices, culture can provide a source of strength, unique coping strategies, and specific resources. Part 1, Chapter 1 \u2014 Trauma -Informed Care: A Sociocultural Perspective exploration of these cross -cutting cultural fa c\u00ad tors, refer to the planned TIP , Improving Cu l\u00ad tural Competence (SAMHSA, planned c). When establishing TIC, it is vital that beha v\u00ad ioral health systems, service providers, licen s\u00ad ing agencies, and accre diting bodies build culturally responsive practices into their cur\u00ad ricula, standards, policies and procedures, and credentialing processes. The implementationof culturally responsive practices will furtherguide the treatment planning process so thattraum a-informed services are more appropr i\u00ad ate and likely to succeed. Use a Strengths- Focused Perspective: Promote Resilience Fostering individual strengths is a key step inprevention when working with people whohave been exposed to trauma. It is also an e s\u00ad sential intervention strategy \u2014one that builds on the individual 's existing resources and views him or her as a resourceful, resilient survivor.Individuals who have experienced trauma d e\u00ad velop many strategies and/or behaviors toadapt to its emotional, cognitive, spiritual, andphysical consequences. Some behaviors may be effective across time, whereas others may eventually produce difficulties and disrupt the healing process. Traditionally, behavioralhealth services have tended to focus on pr e\u00ad senting problems, risk factors, and symptoms in an a ttempt to prevent negative outcomes, provide relief, increase clients' level of fun c\u00ad tioning, and facilitate healing. However, focu s\u00ad ing too much o n these areas can undermine clients' sense of competenc e and hope. Targe t\u00ad ing only presenting problems and symptoms does not provide individuals with an oppo r\u00ad tunity to see their own resourcefulness inmanaging very stressful and difficult exper i\u00ad ences. It is important for providers to engage in interventions using a balanced approachthat tar gets the strengths client s have 27 Advice to Counselors and Administrators: Using Strengths -Oriented Questions Knowing a client's strengths can help you understand, redefine, and reframe the client's presenting problems a nd challenges. By focusing and building on an individual's strengths, counselors and other behavioral health professionals can shift the focus from \"What is wrong with you?\" to \"What has worked for you?\" It moves attention away from trauma -related problems and toward a perspective that honors and uses adaptive behaviors and strengths to move clients along in recovery. Potential strengths -oriented questions include: The history that you provided suggests that you've accomplished a great deal since the traum a. What are some of the a ccomplishments that give you the most pride? What would you say are your strengths? How do you manage your stress today? What behaviors have helped you survive your traumatic experiences (during and afterward)? What are some of the creative ways that you deal with painful feelings? You have survived trauma. What characteristics have helped you manage these experiences and the challenges that they have created in your life? If we were to ask someone in your life, who knew your history and experience with trauma, to name two positive characteristics that help you survive, what would they be? What coping tools have you learned from your _____ (fill in: cultural history, spiritual practices, athletic pursuits, etc.)? Imagine for a moment that a group of people are standing behind you showing you support in some way. Who would be standing there? It doesn't matter how briefly or when they showed up in your life, or whether or not they are currently in your life or alive. How do you ga in support today? (Possible answers include family, friends, activities, coaches, counselors, other supports, etc.) What does recovery look like for you? Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services devel oped to survive their experiences and to thrive in recovery. A strengths -based , resilience -minded approach lets trauma surv i\u00ad vors begin to acknowledge and appreciate their fortitude and the behaviors that helpthem survive. Foster Trauma -Resistant Skills Trauma -informed services build a foundation on which individuals can begin to explore the role of trauma in their lives; such services canalso help determine how best to address andtailor interventions to meet their needs. Pr e\u00ad vention, mental health, and substance abusetreatment services should include teaching clients about how trauma can affect their lives;these services should also focus on developingself-care skills, coping strategies, supportive networks, and a sense of competence. Buildingtrauma -resistant skills begins with normali z\u00ad ing the symptoms of traumatic stress and helping clients who have experienced trauma connect the dots between current problems and past trauma when appropriate. Nevertheless, TIC and trauma -specific inte r\u00ad ventions that focus on skill -building should not do so at the expense of acknowledging individual strengths, creativity in adapting totrauma, and inherent attributes and tools cl i\u00ad ents possesses to combat the effects of trauma.Some theoretical models that use skill - building strategie s base the value of this a p\u00ad proach on a deficit perspective; they assume that some individuals lack the necessary tools to manage specific situations and, because ofthis deficiency, they encounter problems thatothers with effective skills would not exper i\u00ad ence. This type of perspective further assumes that, to recover, these individuals must learnnew coping skills and behavior. TIC, on the other hand, makes the assumption that clients 28 Advice to Administrators: Self-Assessment for Trauma -Informed System s NCTIC has developed a self-assessment package for trauma -informed systems to help administrators structurally incorporate trauma into programs and services. The self- assessment can be used by sy s\u00ad tems of care to guide quality improvement with the goal of establishing fully trauma -informed trea t\u00ad ment and recovery efforts (NCTIC, Center for Mental Health Services, 2007). Behavioral health treatment program administrators can use these materials and NCT IC as resources for improvement in delivering TIC. Part 1, Chapter 1 \u2014Trauma -Informed Care: A Sociocultural Perspective are the experts in their own lives and have learned to adapt and acquire skills to survive. The TIC approach honors each individual 's adaptations and acquired skills, and it helps clients explore how these may not be workingas well as they had in the past and how theircurrent repertoire of responses may not be as effective as other strategies. Demonstrate Organizational and Administrative Commitment to TIC Becoming a trauma -informed organization requires administrative guidance and support across all levels of an agency. Behavioral healthstaff will not likely sustain TIC practices without the organization 's ongoing commi t\u00ad ment to support professional development andto allocate resources that promote these pra c\u00ad tices. An agency that wishes to commit to TIC will benefit from an organizational assessmentof how staff members identify and manage trauma and trauma -related reactions in their clients. Are they trauma aware \u2014do they re c\u00ad ognize that trauma can significantly affect a client 's ability to function in one or more areas of his or her life? Do the staff members unde r\u00ad stand tha t traumatic experiences and trauma - related reactions can greatly influence clients' engagement, participation, and response toservices? Agencies need to embrace specific strategies across each level of the organization to create trauma -informed services; this begins with staff education on the impact of trauma among clients. Other agency strategies that reflect a trauma -informed infrastructure i n\u00ad clude, but are not limited to: Universal screening and assessment proc e\u00ad dures for trauma. Interagency and intra -agency collaboration to secure trauma -specific services. Referral agreements and networks to matchclients' needs. Mission and value statements endorsing the importance of trauma recognition. Consumer -and community -supported committees and trauma response teams. Workforce development strategies, inclu d\u00ad ing hiring practices. Professional development plans, including staff train ing/supervision focused on TIC. Program policies and procedures that en\u00adsure trauma recognition and secure trauma - informed practice s, trauma -specific services, and prevention of retraumatization. TIC requires organizational commitment, and often, cultural change. For more informationon implementing TIC in organizations, see Part 2, Chapter 1 of this TIP . Develop Strategies To Address Secondary Trauma and Promote Self-Care Secondary trauma is a normal occupational hazard for mental health and substance abuse professionals, particularly those who serve populations that are likely to include survivors of trauma (Figley, 1995; Klinic CommunityHealth Centre, 2008). Behavioral health staffmembers who experience secondary trauma present a range of traumatic stress reactions 29 Trauma is similar to a rock hitting the water's surface. The impact first creates the largest wave, which is followed by ever-expanding, but less intense, ripples. Likewise, the influence of a given trauma can be broad, but generally, its effects are less intense for individuals further removed from the trauma; eventually, its i m\u00ad pact dissipates all around. For trauma survivors, the impact of trauma can be far -reaching and can affect life areas and relat ionships long after the trauma occurred. This analogy can also broadly describe the recovery process for ind i\u00ad viduals who have experienced trauma and for those who have the privilege of hearing their stories. As survivors reveal their tra uma-related experiences and struggles to a counselor or another caregiver, the trauma becomes a shared experience, although it is not likely to be as intense for the caregiver as it was for the individual who experienced the trauma. The caregiver may hold onto the trauma's k nown and unknown effects or may consciously decide to engage in behaviors that provide support to further dissipate the impact of this trauma and the risk of secondary trauma. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services and effects from providing servic es focused on trauma or listening to clients recount trauma tic experiences. So too, when a coun\u00ad selor has a history of personal trauma, wor k\u00ad ing with trauma survivors may evoke memories of the counselor's own trauma hi s\u00ad tory, which may increase the potential for secondary traumatization. The range of reactions that manifest with sec\u00ad ondary trauma can be, but are not necessarily, similar to the reactions presented by clients who have experienced primary trauma. Symp\u00adtoms of secondary trauma can produce varyinglevels of difficulty, impairment, or distress indaily functioning; these may or may not meetdiagnostic thresh olds for acute stress, post- traumatic stress, or adjustment, anxiety , or mood disorders (Bober & Regehr, 2006).Symptoms may include physical or psycholo g\u00ad ical reactions to traumatic memories clients have shared; avoidance behaviors during clientinteraction s or when recalling emotional co n\u00ad tent in supervision; numbness, limited em o\u00ad tional expression, diminished affect; somaticcomplaints; heightened arousal, including i n\u00ad somnia; negative thinking or depressed mood;and detachment from family, friends, and ot h\u00ad er supports (Maschi & Brown, 2010). Working daily with individuals who have been traumatized can be a burden for counselors and other behavioral health service providers , but all too often, they blame the symptoms resulting from that burden on other stre ssors at work or at home. Only in the past 2 decades have literature and trainings begun payingattention to secondary trauma or compassionfatigue ; even so , agencies often do not trans\u00ad late this knowledge into routine preventionpractices. Counselors and o ther staff members may find it difficult to engage in activities thatcould ward off secondary trauma due to time constraints, workload, lack of agency r e\u00ad sources, and/or an organizational culture that disapproves of help -seeking or provides inad e\u00ad quate staff support. The demands of providingcare to trauma survivors cannot be ignored,lest the provider become increasingly impairedand less effective. Counselors with unacknowledged secondary trauma can cause harm to clients via poorly enforced bound a\u00ad ries, missed appointments, or even abando n\u00ad ment of clients and their needs (Pearlman &Saakvitne, 1995). Essential components of TIC include organ i\u00ad zational and personal strategies to address The Impact of Traum a 30 Advice to Counselors: Decreasing the Risk of Secondary Trauma and Promoting Self-Care Peer support. Maintaining adequate social support will help prevent isolation and depression. Supervision and consultation. Seeking professional support will enable you to understand your own responses to clients and to work with them more effectively. Training. Ongoing professional training can improve your belief in your abilit ies to assist clients in their recoveries. Personal therapy. Obtaining treatment can help you manage specific problems and become better able to provide good treatment to your clients. Maintaining balance. A healthy, balanced lifestyle can make you more resilient in managing any difficult circumstances you may face. Setting clear limits and boundaries with clients. Clearly separating your personal and work life allows time to rejuvenate from stresses inherent in being a professional caregiver. Part 1, Chapter 1 \u2014Trauma -Informed Care: A Sociocultural Perspective secondary trauma and its physical, cognitive, emotional, and spiritual consequences. Inagencies and among individual providers, it iskey for the culture t o promote acceptability, accessibility, and accountability in seekinghelp, accessing support and supervision, andengaging in self -care behaviors in and outside of the agenc y or office. Agencies should i n\u00ad volve staff members who work with trauma in developing informal and formal agency pra c\u00ad tices and procedures to prevent or address sec\u00adondary trauma. Even though a number of community -based agencies face fiscal co n\u00ad straints, prev ention strategies for secondary trauma can be intertwined with the current infrastructure ( e.g., staff meetings, education, case consultations and group case discussions,group support, debriefing sessions as appropr i\u00ad ate, supervision). For more information on strategies to address and prevent secondary trauma, see Part 2, Chapter 2 of this TIP . Provide Hope \u2014Recovery Is Possible What defines recovery from trauma -related symptoms and traumatic stress disorders? Is it the total absence of symptoms or cons e\u00ad quences? Does it mean that clients stop ha v\u00ad ing nightmare s or being reminded, by cues, of past trauma? When clients who have exper i\u00ad enced trauma enter into a helping relationship to address trauma specifically, they are oftenlooking for a cure, a remission of symptoms, orrelief from the pain as quickly as possi ble. However, they often possess a history of un\u00adpredictable symptoms and symptom intensity that reinforces an underlying belief that reco v\u00ad ery is not possible. On one hand, client s are looking for a message that they can be cured,while on the other hand, they have serious doubts about the likely success of any intervention. Clients often express ambivalence about dea l\u00ad ing with trauma even if they are fully aware of trauma 's effects on their lives. The idea of li v\u00ad ing with more discomfort as they address the past or as they experiment with alternativeways of dealing with trauma -related symptoms or consequences is not an appealing prospect,and it typically elicits fear. Clients may inte r\u00ad pret the uncomfortable feelings as dangerous or unsafe even in an environment and rela\u00adtionship that is safe and supportive. How do you promote hope and relay a me s\u00ad sage that recovery is possible? First, maintain consistency in delivering services, promoting and providing safety for clients, and showingrespect and compassion wi thin the client - provider relationship. Along with clients' commitment to learning how to create safety for themselves, counselors and agencies need 31 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services to be aware of, and circumvent, practices that could retraumatize clients. Projecting hope and reinforcing t he belief that recovery is po s\u00ad sible extends well beyond the practice of es\u00adtablishing safety; it also encompasses discussing what recovery means and how itlooks to clients, as well as identifying how they will know that they've entered into reco v\u00ad ery in earnest. Providing hope involves projecting an attitude that recovery is possible. This attitude alsoinvolves viewing clients as competent to make changes that will allow them to deal withtrauma -related challenges, providing opport u\u00ad nities for them to practice dealing with diff i\u00ad cult situations, and normalizing discomfort or difficult emotions and framing these as ma n\u00ad ageable rather than dangerous. If you convey this attitude consistently to your clients, they will begin to under stand that discomfort is not a signal to avoid, but a sign to engage \u2014and that behavioral, cognitive, and emotional r e\u00ad sponses to cues associated with previous tra u\u00ad mas are a normal part of the recovery process.It's not the absence of responses to such tri g\u00ad gers that mark recovery, but rather, how clients experience and manage those responses. Cli\u00ad ents can also benefit from interacting withothers who are further along in their recovery from trauma. Time spent with peer supportstaff or sharing stories with other trauma sur\u00advivors who are well on their way to recovery is invaluable \u2014it sends a powerful message that recovery is achievable , that there is no shame in being a trauma survivor, and that there is a future beyond the trauma. As You Proceed This chapter has established the foundationand rationale of this TIP , reviewed trauma - informed concepts and terminology , and pr o\u00ad vided an overview of TIC principles and a guiding framework for this text. As you pr o\u00ad ceed, be aware of the wide -ranging responses to trauma that occur not only across racially and ethnically diverse groups but also withinspecific communities, families, and individuals.Counselors, prevention specialists, other b e\u00ad havioral health workers, supervisors, and o r\u00ad ganizations all need to develop skills to create an environment that is responsive to theunique attributes and experiences of each cli\u00adent. As you read this TIP , remember thatmany cross -cutting factors influence the exp e\u00ad riences, help -seeking behaviors, inter vention responses, and outcomes of individuals, fam i\u00ad lies, and populations who have survived tra u\u00ad ma. Single, multiple, or chronic exposures totraumatic events, as well as the emotional,cognitive, behavioral, and spiritual responses totrauma, need to be understood within a social - ecological framework that recognizes th e many ingredients prior to , during, and after traumatic experiences that set the stage for recovery. 32 IN THIS CHAPTER Types of Trauma Characteristics of Trauma Individual and Sociocultural Features Trauma Awarenes s2 Traumatic experiences typically do not result in long -term i m\u00ad pairment for most individuals. It is normal to experience such events across the lifespan; often, individuals, families, and co m\u00ad munities respond to them with resilience. This chapter explores several main elements that influence why people respond differ\u00ad ently to trauma. Using the social -ecological model outlined in Part 1, Chapter 1, this chapter explore s some of the contextual and systemic dynamics that influence individual and community perceptio ns of trauma and its impact. The three main foci are: types of trauma, objective and subjective characteristics of trauma,and individual and sociocultural features that serve as risk or pr o\u00ad tective factors. This chapter 's main objective is to highlight the key characteri s\u00ad tics of traumatic experiences. Trauma- informed behavioral health service provider s understand that many influences shape the ef\u00ad fects of trauma among individuals and communities \u2014it is not just the event that determines the outcome, but also the event's context and the resultant interactions across systems. Types of Trauma The following section reviews various forms and types of trauma. It does not cover every conceivable trauma that an individual,group, or community may encounter. Specific traumas are r e\u00ad viewed only once, even when they could fit in multiple categories of trauma. Additionally, the order of appearance does not denote a specific trauma's importance or prevalence, and there is no lack of relevance implied if a given trauma is not specifically addressedin this Treatment Improvement Protocol ( TIP). The intent is to give a broad perspective of the various categories and types of trauma to behavioral health workers who wish to be trau ma in\u00ad formed. 33 For information on resources to prepare States, Territories, and local entities to deliver effective m ental health and sub\u00ad stance abuse responses during disasters, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA's) Disaster Technical Assistance Center: 4350 Care in Behavioral Health Services TIC Framework in Behavioral Health Services \u2014Trauma Awareness Natural or Human -Caused Traumas The classification of a trauma as natural or caused by humans can have a significant i m\u00ad pact on the ways people react to it and on the types of assistance mobilized in its aftermath(see Exhibit 1.2-1 for trauma examples). Na t\u00ad ural traumatic experiences can directly affect asmall number of people, such as a tree fallingon a car during a rainstorm, or many people and communities, as with a hurricane. Natural events, often referred to as \"acts of God, \" are typically unavoidable. Human -caused traumas are caused by human failure (e.g., technolog i\u00ad cal catastrophes, acciden ts, malevolence) or by human design (e.g., war). Although multiple factors contribute to the severity of a natural or human -caused trauma, traumas perceived as intentional ly harmful often make the event more traumatic for people and communities. 34 Part 1, Chapter 2\u2014Trauma Awareness Exhibi t 1.2-1: Trauma Examples Caused Naturally Caused by People .

The amount, accessibi l\u00ad ity, and d uration of relief services can signifi\u00ad cantly influence the duration of traumaticstress reactions as well as the recovery process. Alongside the disruption of daily routi nes, the presence of community members or outsiders in affected areas may add significant stress orcreate traumatic experiences in and of them\u00adselves. Examples include the threat of others stealing what remains of personal property, restrictions on travel or access to property or living quarters , disruption of privacy within shelters, media attention , and subsequent ex\u00ad posure to repetitive images reflecting the dev\u00ad astation. Therefore, it isn 't just the natural disaster or event that can challenge an ind i\u00advidual or community; often , the consequences of the event and behavi oral responses from others within and outside the community play a role in push ing survivors away from effective coping or toward resilience and recovery. Human -caused traumas are fundamentally different from natural disasters. They are ei\u00ad ther intentional, such as a convenience store robbery at gunpoint, or unintentional, such as the technological accident of a bridge collapse (as occurred in Minneapolis, Minnesota , in 2007; U.S. Fire Administ ration, 2007). T he subsequent reactions to these traumas oftendepend on their intentionality. However, aperson or group of people is typically the ta r\u00ad get of the survivors' anger and blame. Surv i\u00ad vors of an unintentionally human -caused traumatic event may feel angry and frustratedbecause of the lack of protection or care of\u00adfered by the responsible party or government, particularly if there has been a perceived act of omission. After intentional human -caused acts, survivors often struggle to understand the 35 Case Illustrations: Quecreek Mine Flood and Greensburg's Tornado Quecreek Mine Flood The year following the rescue of nine miners from the Quecreek mine in western Pennsylvania in 2002 was a difficult one for residents of Somerset County. The dazzle of publicity surrounding a handful of workers from a small town, tension between miners and rescuers, and animosity over money for movie and book deals, in addition to the trauma itself, resulted in a rescuer's suicide, a number of miners having trauma -related symptoms, and several rescuers needing to seek treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Goodell, 2003). Greensburg 's Tornado Greensburg, a small town in southern Kansas, was hit by a large tornado in 2007 that killed 11 res i\u00ad dents and leveled 95 percent of the town while causing severe damage to the remaining 5 percent. Families and community members experienced significant grief and traumatic stress after the disa s\u00ad ter. Yet today, Greensburg is rebuilding with a focus on being \"green\" \u2014that is, environmentally responsibl e\u2014from design to construction and all the way through demolition. This town has the highest number of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design- certified buildings in the world. A reality television show about the town's reinvention ran for three seasons, demonstrating the town's residents and business owners working with local government and various c orporations to make their home an even better place than it was before the tornado. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services motives for performing the act , the calculated or random nature of the act, and the psych o\u00ad logical makeup of the perpetrator(s). Individual, Group, Community, and Mass Traumas In recognizing the role of trauma and unde r\u00ad standing responses to it, consider whether the trauma primarily affected an individual and perhaps his or her family ( e.g., automobile accident, sexual or physical assault, severe il l\u00ad ness); occurred within the context of a group(e.g., trauma experienced by first responders or those who have seen military combat) orcommunity ( e.g., gang-related shooting s); transpired within a certain culture; or was alarge -scale disaster ( e.g., hurricane , terrorist attack). This context can have significant im\u00adplications for whether (and how) people exp e\u00ad rience shame as a result of the trauma, the kinds of support and compassion they receive, whether their experiences are normalized ordiminished by others, and even the kinds ofservices they are offered to help them recoverand cope. Individual trauma An individual trauma refers to an event that only occurs to one p erson. It can be a single event (e.g., mugging, rape, physical attack, work -related physical injury) or multiple or prolonged events (e.g., a life- threatening il l\u00ad ness, multiple sexual assaults). Although the trauma directly affects just one individual,others who know the person and/or are aware of the trauma will likely experience emotional repercussions from the event(s) as well, suchas recounting what they said to the personbefore the event, reacting in disbelief, orthinking that it cou ld just as easily have ha p\u00ad pened to them, too. Survivors of individual trauma may not receive the environmental support and concern thatmembers of collectively traumatized groups and communities receive. They are less likely to reveal their traumas or to receive validation of their experiences. Often, shame distorts their perception of responsibility for the tra u\u00ad ma. Some survivors of individual traumas,especially those who have kept the trauma secret, may not receive needed comfort and 36 Advice to Counselors: Working With Clients Who Have Experienced Individual Traumas In working with clients who have histories of individual trauma, counselors should consider that: Empathy, or putting oneself in the shoes of another, is more potent than sympathy (expressing a feeling of sorrow for another person). Some clients need to briefly describe the trauma(s) they have experienced, particularly in the early stages of recovery. Strategies that focus on reexperiencing the trauma, retrieving feelings related to the trauma, and bringing past experiences to the forefront should only be implemen t\u00ad ed if trauma -specific treatment planning and services are available. Understanding the trauma, especially in early recovery, should begin with educating the client about and normalizing trauma -related symptoms, creating a sense of safety within the treatment environment, and addressing how trauma symptoms may interfere with the client's life in the present. It is helpful to examine how the trauma affects opportunities to receive substance abuse and/or mental health treatment as well as treatment for and recovery from the trauma itself (e.g., by li m\u00ad iting one's willingness to share in or participate in group counseling). Identifying and exploring strengths in the client's history can help the client apply those strengths to his or her ability to function in the present. Acute stress disorder (ASD) prevalence among patients at medical trauma centers is very high, making trauma -related diso r\u00ad ders some of t he most common complica\u00ad tions seen in physically injured patients. Clients who have sustained serious injuries in car crashes, fires, stabbings, shootings, falls, and other events have an increased likelihood of developing trauma -related mental disorders. Research suggests that PTSD and/or problem drinking is evident in nearly 50 percent of patients 1 year after discharge from trauma surgical units. (Zatzick, Jurkovich, Gentilello, Wisner, & Rivara, 2002) Part 1, Chapter 2\u2014Trauma Awareness acceptance from oth ers; they are also are more likely to struggle with issues of causation (e.g., a young woman may feel unduly responsible for a sexual assault), to feel isolated by the trauma, and to experience repeated traumathat makes them feel victimized. Physical injuries Physical injuries are among the most prevalent individual traumas. Millions of emergency room (ER) visits each year relate directly to physical injuries. Most trauma patients are relatively young; about 70 percent of injury-related ER cases are people younger than 45 years old (McCaig & Burt, 2005). Dedicate d ER hospital units, known as \"trauma centers, \" specialize in physical traumas such as gunshotwounds, stabbings, and other immediate phys\u00adical injuries. The term \"trauma \" in relation to ERs does not refer to psychological trauma,which is the focus of this TIP, yet physical injuries can be associated with psychological trauma. Sudden, unexpected , adverse health - related events can lead to extensive psycholo g\u00ad ical trauma for patients and their families. Excessive alcohol use is the leading risk factor for phy sical injuries; it 's also the most promi s\u00ading target for injury prevention. Studies co n\u00ad sistently and substance use (Gentilello, &Rivara, 2005); nearly 50 percent to trauma centers have injuries a t\u00ad tributable to alcohol abuse and dependence (Gentilello et al., 1999). One study found thattwo thirds of ambulatory assault victims pr e\u00ad senting to an ER had positive substance use urinalysis results; more than half of all victims had PTSD 3 months later (Roy -Byrne et al., 37 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services 2004). Nearly 28 percent of patients whose drinking was identified as problematic duringan ER visit for a physical injury will have a new injury within 1 year (Gentilello et al.,2005). For further information, see TIP 16,Alcohol and Other Drug Screening of Hospita l\u00ad ized Trauma Patients (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment [ CSAT ], 1995a ). Group trauma The term \"group trauma \" refers to traumatic experiences that affect a particular group ofpeople. This TIP intentionally distinguishes group trauma from mass trauma to highlight the unique experiences and characteristics oftrauma -related reactions among small groups. These groups often share a common identity and history, as well as similar activities and concerns. They includ e vocational groups who specializ e in managing traumas or who ro u\u00ad tinely place themselves in harm's way\u2014for example, first responders, a group includ ing police and emergency medical personnel.Some examples of group trauma include crews and their families w ho lose members from a commercial fishing accident, a gang whose members experience multiple deaths and inju\u00ad ries, teams of firefighters who lose members in a roof collapse, responders who attempt tosave flood victims, and military service me m\u00ad bers in a specific theat er of operation. Survivors of group trauma can have differentexperiences and responses than survivors ofindividual or mass traumas. Survivors of group trauma, such as military service members andfirst responders, are likely to experience r e\u00ad peated trauma. They tend to keep the trauma experiences within the group, feeling that ot h\u00ad ers outside the group will not understand;group outsiders are generally viewed as intrud\u00aders. Members may enc ourage others in the group to shut down emotionally and repress their traumatic experiences \u2014and there are some occupational roles that necessitate the repression of reactions to complete a missionor to be attentive to the needs at hand. Groupmembers may not want to seek help and may discourage others from doing so out of fearthat it may shame the entire group. In thisenvironment, members may see it as a viola\u00adtion of group confidentiality when a memberseeks assistance outside the group, such as by going to a counselor. Group members who have had traumaticexperiences in the past may not actively sup\u00adport traumatized colleagues for fear that a c\u00ad knowledging the trauma will increase the risk of repressed trauma -related emotions surfa c\u00ad ing. However, groups with adequate resources for helping group members can develop astronger and more supportive environmentfor handling subsequent traumas. These maingroup features influence the course of short - and long -term adjustments, including the development of traumatic stress symptoms associated with mental and substance use disorders. Certain occupational groups are at greater risk of experiencing trauma \u2014particularly multiple traumas. This TIP briefly reviews two main groups as examples in the following sections:first responders and military service members.For more detailed information on the impactof trauma and deployment, refer to theplanned TIP , Reintegration -Related Behavioral Health Issues in Veterans and Military Families (SAMHSA, planned f). First responders First responders are usually emergency med i\u00ad cal technicians, disaster management perso n\u00ad nel, police officers, rescue workers, medical and behavioral health professional s, journalists, and volunteers from various backgrounds.They also include lifeguards, military perso n\u00ad nel, and clergy. Stressors associated with the kinds of traumatic events and/or disasters first responders are likely to experience include 38 \"The excitement of the season had just begun, and then, we heard the news, oil in the water, lots of oil killing lots of water. It is too shocking to understand. Never in the millen\u00ad nium of our tradition have we thought it possible for the water to die, but it is true.\" \u2014Chief Walter Meganack, Port Graham, 1989 Of all the groups negatively affected by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, in many ways Alaska Natives were the most devastated. The oil spill destroyed more than economic resources; it shook the core cultural foundation of Native life. Alaska Native subsistence culture is based on an intimate relationship with the environment. Not only does the environment have sacred qualities for Alaska Natives; their sur\u00ad vival also depen ds on the well -being of the ecosystem and the maintenance of cultural norms of sub\u00ad sistence. The spill directly threatened the well -being of the environment, disrupted subsistence behavior, and severely disturbed the sociocultural milieu of Alaska Natives. Source: Gill & Picou, 1997, pp. 167-168. Part 1, Chapter 2\u2014Trauma Awareness exposure to toxic agents, feeling responsi ble for the lives of others, witnessing catastrophic devastation, potential exposure to gruesome images, observing human and animal sufferingand/or death, working beyond physical e x\u00ad haustion, and the external and internal pre s\u00ad sure of working against the clock. Military service members Military personnel are likely to experience numerous stressors associated with trauma. Service members who have repeatedly d e\u00ad ployed to a war zone are at a greater risk for traumatic stress reactions (also known as co m\u00ad bat stress reaction or traumatic stress injury),other military personnel who provide supportservices are also at risk for traumatic stress and secondary trauma (refer to the glossary portion of the \"How This TIP Is Organized\" sectionthat precedes Part 1, Chapter 1 , of this TIP ). So too, service members who anticipate d e\u00ad ployment or redeployment may exhibit psy\u00adchological symptoms associated withtraumatic stress. Some stressors that military service members may encounter include wor k\u00ad ing while physically exhausted, exposure togunfire, seeing or knowing someone who has been injured or killed, traveling in areas known for roadside bombs and rockets, ex\u00adtended hypervigilance, fear of being struck by an improvised explosive device, and so forth. Trauma affecting communities and cultures Trauma that affects communities and cultures covers a broad range of violence and atrocitiesthat erode the sense of safety within a givencommunity, including neighborhoods,schools, towns, and reservations. It may i n\u00ad volve violence in the form of physical or sexual assaults, hate crimes, robberies, workplace organg -related violence, threats, shootings, or stabbings \u2014for example, the school shooti ng at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and StateUniversity in 2007. It also includes actions that attempt to dismantle systemic cultural practices, resources, and identities, such as making boarding school attendance mandat o\u00ad ry for Native American children or placingthem in non- Native foster homes. Cultural and/or community- based trauma can also o c\u00ad cur via indifference or limited responsiveness to specific communities or cultures that are facing a potential catastrophe. Cultural tra u\u00ad mas are events that, whether intentionally ornot, erode the heritage of a culture\u2014as with prejudice, disenfranchisement, and healthinequities (e.g., late prenatal care, inability toafford medications, limited access to culturally appropriate health education, vicinity andqualit y of affordable medical services), among other examples. 39 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services Historical trauma Historical trauma, known also as generational trauma, refers to events that are so widespreadas to affect an entire culture; such events alsohave effects intense enough to influence gen\u00aderations of the culture beyond those who e x\u00ad perienced them directly. The enslavement, torture, and lynching of African Americans ; the forced assimilation and relocation of American Indians onto reservations ; the e x\u00ad termination of millions of Jews and others in Europe during World War II; and the gen o\u00ad cidal policies of the Hutus in Rwanda and theKhmer Rouge in Cambodia are examples ofhistorical trauma. In the past 50 years, research has explored the generational effects of the Holocaust uponsurvivors and their families. More recent liter\u00ad ature has extended the concept of historical orgenerational trauma to the traumatic exper i\u00ad ences of Native Americans. Reduced popula\u00adtion, forced relocation, and acculturation aresome examples of traumatic experiences that Native people have endured across centuries,beginning with the first European presence inthe Americas. These tragic experiences have led to significant loss of cultural identity acrossgenerations and have had a significant impacton the well- being of Native communities (Whitbeck, Chen, Hoyt, & Adams, 2004). Data are limited on the association of mental and substance use disorders with historical trauma among Native people, but literature suggests that historical trauma has repercus\u00adsions across generations, such as depression,grief, traumatic stress, domestic violence, andsubstance abuse, as well as significant loss ofcultural knowledge, language, and identity (Gone, 2009). Historical trauma can increase the vulnerability of multiple generations to the effects of traumas that occur in their own lifetimes. Mass trauma Mass traumas or disasters affect large numbers of people either directly or indirectly. It is b e\u00ad yond the scope of this TIP to cover any speci f\u00ad ic disaster in detail ; note, however, that mass traumas include large -scale natural and human -caused disasters (including intentional acts and accidents alike). Mass traumas may involve significant loss of property and lives as well as the widespread disruption of normal routines and services. Res ponding to such traumas often requires immediate and exten\u00adsive resources that typically exceed the capac i\u00ad ty of the affected communities, States, orcountries in which they occur . Recent exa m\u00ad ples of such large -scale catastrophes include: In January 2010, a massive earthquake hit Haiti, killing hundreds of thousands of people and leaving over a million homeless. A nuclear reactor meltdown in the Ukraine in 1986 resulted in a technological and en\u00advironmental disaster that affected tens of millions of people. The tsunami in the Indian Ocean in 2005 left hundreds of thousands dead in nine countries. One factor that influences an individual's response to trauma is his or her ability to process one trauma before another traumaoccurs. In mass traumas, the initial eventcauses considerable destruction, the cons e\u00ad quences of which may spawn additional traumas and other stressful events that lead to more difficulties and greater need for adjus t\u00ad ments among survivors, first responders, anddisaster re lief agencies. Often, a chain rea c\u00ad tion occurs . Take, for example, Hurricane Katrina and its impact on the people ofLouisiana and other coastal States. After the initial flooding, people struggled to obtainbasic needs, including food, drinking water, safe shelter, clothing, medicines, personal hygiene items, and so forth, all as concern mounted about the safety of children and 40 Part 1, Chapter 2\u2014Trauma Awareness other relatives, friends, and neighbors . In this and similar cases, the destruction from the initial flooding led to mass displacement offamilies and communities; many people had torelocate far from New Orleans and other badly affected areas, while also needing to gain f i\u00ad nancial assistance, reinitiate work to generate income, and obtain stable housing. People could not assimilate one stressor before anot h\u00ad er appeared. Nevertheless, mass traumas can create an i m\u00ad mediate sense of commonality\u2014 many people are \"in the same boat, \" thus removing much of the isolation that can occur with other types of trauma. People can acknowledge their dif fi\u00ad culties and receive support, even from strangers. It is easier to ask for help because blame is often externalized; large- scale disa s\u00ad ters are often referred to as \"acts of God \" or, in cases of terrorism and other intentional events, as acts of \"evil. \" Even so, survivors of mass trauma often encounter an initial rally ofsupport followed by quickly diminishing ser\u00advices and dwindling care. When the disasterfades from the headlines, public attention andconcern are likely to decrease, leaving surv i\u00ad vors stru ggling to reestablish or reinvent their lives without much outside acknowledgment. The experience of mass trauma can lead to the development of psychological symptoms andsubstance use at either a subclinical or a dia g\u00ad nostic level (refer to Part 3 of this TIP, avail a\u00ad ble online, for more information highlightingthe relationship between trauma and beha v\u00ad ioral health problems). Likewise, one of the greatest risks for traumatic stress reactions after a mass tragedy is the presence of preex\u00adisting mental and co -occurring disorders, and individuals who are in early recovery from substance use disorders are at greater risk forsuch reactions as well. Nonetheless, people are amazingly resilient, and most will not developlong-term mental or substance use disorders after an event; in fact, most trauma -related symptoms will resolve in a matter of months (Keane & Piwowarczyk, 2006). Interpersonal Traumas Interpersonal traumas are events that occur(and typically continue to reoccur) betweenpeople who often know each other, such as spouses or parents and their children. Exa m\u00ad ples include physical and sexual abuse, sexual assault, domestic violence, and elder abuse. Intimate partner violence Intimate partner violence (IPV), often r e\u00ad ferred to as domestic violence, is a pat tern of actual or threatened physical, sexual, and/oremotional abuse. It differs from simple assaultin that multiple episodes often occur and the perpetrator is an intimate partner of the vi c\u00ad tim. Trauma associated with IPV is normally ongoing. Incidents of this form of violence are rarely isolated , and the client may still be in contact with and encountering abuse from the perpe trator while engaged in treatment. Intimate partners include current and formerspouses, boyfriends, and girlfriends. The ma\u00adjority of all nonfatal acts of violence and int i\u00ad mate partner homicides are committed againstwomen; IPV accounts for over 20 percent ofnonfatal violence against women but only 3.6percent of that committed against men(Catalano, 2012). Children are the hidden casualties of IPV. They often witness the a s\u00ad saults or threats directly, within earshot, or by being exposed to the aftermath of the violence (e.g., seeing bruises and destruction of proper\u00adty, hearing the pleas for it to stop or the pro m\u00ad ises that it will n ever happen again). Substance abuse, particularly involving alc o\u00ad hol, is frequently associated with IPV. It is the presence of alcohol -related problems in either partner, rather than the level of alcohol co n\u00ad sumption itself, that is the important factor. 41 Child Neglect Child neglect occurs when a parent or caregiver does not give a child the care he or she needs a c\u00ad cording to his or her age, even though that adult can afford to give that care or is offered help t o give that care. Neglect can mean not providing adequate nutrition, clothing, and/or shelter. It can mean that a parent or caregiver is not providing a child with medical or mental health treatment or is not giving prescribed medicines the child needs. Neglect can also mean neglecting the child's educ a\u00ad tion. Keeping a child from school or from special education can be neglect. Neglect also includes exposing a child to dangerous environments (e.g., exposure to domestic violence). It can mean poor supervision for a child, including putting the child in the care of someone incapable of caring for chi l\u00ad dren. It can mean abandoning a child or expelling him or her from home. Lack of psychological care, including emotional support, attention, or love, is also consid ered neglect \u2014and it is the most co m\u00ad mon form of abuse reported to child welfare authorities. Source: dePanfilis , 2006. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services Drinking may or may not be the cause of the violence; that said, couples with alcohol - related disorders could have more tension and disagreement within the relationship in gen\u00aderal, which leads to aggression and violence.The consumption of alcohol during a dispute is likely to decrease inhibitions and increase impulsivity, thus creating an opportunity foran argument to escalate into a physical alterc a\u00ad tion. More information on domestic violence and its effects on partners and families, as well as its connection with substance use and trauma- related disorders, is available in TIP 25, Substance Abuse Treatment and Domestic Violence (CSAT, 1997b), and from the N a\u00ad tional Online Resource Center on Violence Against Women ( http://www.vawnet.org/ ). Developmental Traumas Developmental traumas include specific events or experiences that occur within a given devel\u00adopmental stage and influence later develo p\u00ad ment , adjustment, and physical and mental health. Often, these traumas are related toadverse childhood experiences (ACEs), but they can also result from tragedies that occuroutside an expected developmental or life stage (e.g., a child dying before a parent, being diagnosed with a life -threatening illness as a young adult) or from events at any point in the life cycle that create significant loss and have life -altering consequences (e.g., the death of a significant other in the later yearsthat leads to displ acement of the surviving partner). Adverse childhood experiences Some people experience trauma at a young age through sexual, physical, or emotional abuse and neglect. The Adverse Childhood Exper i\u00ad ences Study (Felitti et al., 1998) examined the effects of several categories of ACEs on adulthealth, including physical and emotional abuse;sexual abuse; a substance -dependent parent; an incarcerated, mentally ill, or suicidal householdmember; spousal abuse between parents; anddivorce or separation that meant one parentwas absent during childhood. The National Comorbidity Studies examined the prevalence of trauma and defined childhood adversities as parental death, parental divorce/separation,life-threateni ng illness, or extreme economic hardship in addition to the childhood exper i\u00ad ences included in the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study (Green et al., 2010). ACEs can negatively affect a person 's well\u00ad being into adulthood. Whether or not theseexperiences occur simultaneously, are time-limited, or recur, they set the stage for i n\u00ad creased vulnerability to physical, mental, andsubstance use disorders and enhance the risk 42 Torture and Captivity Torture traumatizes by taking away an individual's personhood. To survive, victims have to give up their sense of self and will. They become the person the torturer designs or a nonperson, simply exist\u00ad ing. Inevitably, the shame of the victim is enormous, because the focus of torture is to humiliate and degrade. As a result, victims often seek to hide their trauma and significant parts of their selfhood long after torture has ended and freedom has been obtained. According to Judith Herman, \"the methods of establishing control over another person are based upon the systematic, repetitive infli c\u00ad tion of psychological trauma. They are organized techniques of disempowerment and disconnection. Methods of psychological control are d esigned to instill terror and helplessness and to destroy the victim's sense of self in relation to others.\" Source: Herman, 1997, p. 77. Part 1, Chapter 2\u2014Trauma Awareness for repeated trauma exposure across the life span. Childhood abuse is highly associatedwith major depression, suicidal thoughts, PTSD, and dissociative symptoms. So too,ACEs are associated with a greater risk of adult alcohol use. When a person experiences several adverse events in childhood, the risk ofhis or her heavy drinking, self -report ed alc o\u00ad hol dependence, and marrying a person who is alcohol dependent is two to four times greaterthan that of a person with no ACEs (Dube,Anda, Felitti, Edwards, & Croft , 2002). A detailed examination of the issues involved in providing substance abuse treatment tosurvivors of child abuse and neglect is the sub\u00adject of TIP 36, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Child Abuse and Neglect Issues(CSAT, 2000b) . Political Terror and War Political terror and war are likely to have last\u00ading consequences for survivors . In essence, anything that threatens the existence, beliefs,well- being, or livelihood of a community is likely to be experienced as traumatic by co m\u00ad munity members. Whether counselors are working with an immigrant or refugee enclave in the United States o r in another country, they should be aware of local events, local hi s\u00ad tory, and the possibility that clients have en\u00addured trauma. (For international informationabout the clinical, historical, and theoretical aspects of trauma and terrorism, see Danieli, Brom, & Sills, 2005.) Terrorism is a unique subtype of human -caused disasters. The ove r\u00ad all goal of terrorist attacks is to maximize the uncertainty, anxiety, and fear of a large co m\u00ad munity, so the responses are often epidemic and affect large numbers of peopl e who have had direct or indirect exposure to an event(Silver et al. , 2004; Suvak, Maguen, Litz, Silver, & Holman, 2008). Terrorism has a vari\u00ad ety of results not common to other disasters, such as reminders of the unpredictability ofterrorist acts; increases in security measures forthe general population; intensified suspicion about a particular population, ethnicity, or cu l\u00ad ture; and heightened awareness and/or arousal. Refugees According to the World Refugee Survey,there are an estimated 12 million refugees andasylum seekers, 21 million internally displacedpeople, and nearly 35 million uprooted people (U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immi\u00adgrants, 2006). Many of these people have sur\u00advived horrendous ordeals with profound and lasting effects for individuals and whole pop u\u00ad lations. In addition to witnessing deaths by execution, starvation, or beatings, many surv i\u00ad vors have experienced horrific torture. Refugees are people who flee their homes b e\u00ad cause they have experienced or have a reaso n\u00ad able fear of experiencing persecution. They 43 Vietnamese Refugees \"Wars always have consequences, both immediate and remote, and the consequences are often tragic. One tragic circumstance often caused by war is the forceful, disorganized, and uncontrollable mass movement of both civilians and soldiers trying to escape the horrors of the wars or of an op\u00ad pressive regime.... \"Vietnamese communists, by taking power in the North in 1954 and then in the South in 1975, caused two major upheavals in the Land of the Small Dragon, as Vietnam was once called. The first Vietnam War led to the 1954 exodus during which 1 million people fled from the North to the South. The se c\u00ad ond Vietnam War resulted in the dispersion, from 1975 -1992, of approx imately 2 million Vietnamese all over the world. These significant, unplanned, and uncoordinated mass movements around the world not only dislocated millions of people, but also caused thousands upon thousands of deaths at sea.... \"The second and third wave of refugees from 1976 onward went through a more difficult time. They had to buy their way out and to hide from soldiers and the police who hunted them down. After catching them, the police either asked for brides or threw the escapees into jails. Those who evaded police still had to face engine failures, sea storms, pirates...They then had to survive overcrowded boats for days or weeks, during which food and water could not be replenished and living conditions were terrible... Many people died from exhaustion, dehydration, and hunger. Others suffered at the hands of terrifying pirates... After the sea ordeal came the overcrowded camps where living cond i\u00ad tions were most often substandard and where security was painfully lacking .... \"In the United States, within less than 3 decades, the Vietnamese population grew from a minority of perhaps 1,000 persons to the second largest refugee group behind Cubans.\" Source: Vo, 2006, pp. 1-4. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services differ from immigrants who willingly leave their homes or homeland to seek better o p\u00ad portunities. Although immigrants may exper i\u00ad ence trauma before migrating to or afterreaching their new destination, refugees will often have greater exposure to trauma before migration. Refugees typically come from war - torn countries and may have been persecutedor torture d. Consequently, greater exposure to trauma, such as torture, before migrating oftenleads to more adjustment -related difficulties and psychological symptoms after relocation (Steel et al., 2009). Refugees typically face substantial difficulties in assimilating into new countries and cul\u00ad tures. Moreover, the environment can create anew set of challenges that may include add i\u00ad tional exposure to trauma and social isolation(Miller et al., 2002). These as well as additio n\u00ad al factors influence adjustment, the develo p\u00ad ment of mental illness (i ncluding PTSD), and the occurrence of substance use disorders. A d\u00ad ditional factors that influence outcome s after relocation include receptivity of the local community, along with opportunities for so\u00ad cial support and culturally responsive services. Among re fugee populations in the United States, little research is available on rates of mental illness and co -occurring substance use disorders and traumatic stress among refugee populations. Substance use patterns vary basedon cultural factors as well as assimi lation, yet research suggests that trauma increases the risk for substance use among refugees after war-related experiences (Kozari -Kovai, Ljubin, & Grappe, 2000). Therefore, providers should expect to see trauma -related disorders among refugees who are seeking treatment fora substance use disorder and greater prev a\u00ad lence of substance use disorders among ref u\u00ad gees who seek behavioral health services. 44 Advice to Counselors: Addressing Retraumatization Anticipate and be sensitive to the needs of clients who have experienced trauma regarding pr o\u00ad gram policies and procedures in the treatment setting that might trigger memories of trauma, such as lack of privacy, feeling pushed to take psychotropic medications, perceiving that they have limited choices within the program or in the selection of the program, and so forth. Attend to client s' experiences. Ignoring clients' behavioral and emotional reactions to having their traumatic memories triggered is more li kely to increase these responses than decrease t hem. Develop an individual coping plan in anticipation of triggers that the individual is likely to exper i\u00ad ence in treatment based on his or her history. Rehearse routinely the coping strategies highlighted in the coping plan. If the client does not practice strategies prior to being triggered, the likelihood of being able to use them effectively upon triggering is lessened. For example, it is far easier to practice grounding exercises in the absence of severe fear than to wait for that moment when the client is reexperiencing an aspect of a traumatic event. (For more information on grounding exercises, refer to Seeking Safety: A Treatment Manual for PTSD and Substance Abuse; Najavits, 2002a, pp. 125 -131.) Recognize that clinical and programmatic efforts to control or contain behavior in treatment can cause traumatic stress reactions, particularly for trauma survivors for whom being trapped was part of the trauma experience. Listen for the specific trigger that seems to be driving the client's reaction. It will typically help both the counselor and client understand the behavior and normalize the traumatic stress reactions. Make sure that staff and other clients do not shame the trauma survivor for his or her behavior, such a s through teasing or joking about the situation. Respond with consistency. The client should not get conflicting information or responses from different staff members; this includes information and responses given by administrators. Part 1, Chapter 2\u2014Trauma Awareness System -Oriented exper i\u00ad ence something that makes them feel as though they are undergoing another trauma.Unfortunately, treatment settings and clin i\u00ad cians can create retraumatizing experiences,often without being aware of it, and some\u00adtimes clients themselves are not consciously aware that a clinical situation has actually trig\u00adgered a traumatic stress reaction. Agencies thatanticipate the risk for retraumatization andactively work on adjusting program policies and procedures to remain sensitive to the hi s\u00ad tories and needs of individuals who have un\u00ad dergone past trauma are likely to have more success in providing care, retaining clients, andachieving positive outcomes. Staff and agency issues that can cause retra u\u00ad matization include: Being unaware that the client's traumatic history significantly affects his or her life. Failing to screen for trauma history prior totreatment planning. Challenging or discounting reports of abuse or other traumatic events. Using isolation or physical re straints. Using experiential exercises that humiliate the individual. Endorsing a confrontational approach incounseling. Allowing the abusive behavior of one client toward another to continue without intervention. Labeling behavior/ feelings as pathologic al. Failing to provide adequate security andsafety within the program. Limiting participation of the client in treatment decisions and planning processes. Minimizing, discrediting, or ignoring client responses. Disrupting counselor -client relationships by changing counselors' schedules and assignments. Obtaining urine specimens in a nonprivatesetting. 45 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services Having clients undress in the presence of others. Inconsistently enforcing rules and allowingchaos in the treatment environment. Imposing agency policies or rules withoutexceptions or an opportunity for clients toquestion them. Enforcing new restrictions within the pr o\u00ad gram without staff -client communication. Limiting access to services for ethnically diverse populations. Accepting agency dysfunction, inc luding lack of consistent, competent leadership. Characteristics of Trauma The following section highlights several s e\u00ad lected characteristics of traumatic experiences that influence the effects of trauma tic stress . Objective characteristics are those elements ofa traumatic event that are tangible or factual;subjective characteristics include internal pr o\u00ad cesses, such as perceptions of traumatic exper i\u00ad ences and meanings assigned to them. Objective Characteristics Was it a single, repeated, or sustained trauma? Trauma can involve a single event, numerous or repeated events, or sustained/chronic exp e\u00ad riences. A single trauma is limited to a single point in time. A rape, an automobile accident,the sudden death of a loved one\u2014all are ex\u00adamples of a single trauma. Some people whoexperience a single trauma recover without any specific intervention. But for others \u2014 especially those with histories of previous trauma or mental or substance use disorders, or those for whom the trauma experience is particularly horrific or overwhelming \u2014a sin\u00ad gle trauma can result in traumatic stress symp\u00adtoms and trauma -and stress- related disorders. Single traumas do not necessarily have a lesserpsychological impact than repeated traumas. After the terrorist attacks on September 11,2001\u2014a significant single trauma\u2014 many Manhattan residents experienced intrusive memories and sleep disruption whether they were at the site of the attacks or watched tel e\u00ad vision coverage of it ( Ford & Fournier , 2007; Galea et al., 2002). A series of traumas happening to the same person over time is known as repeated trauma . This can include repeated sexual or physical assaults, exposure to frequent injuries of ot h\u00ad ers, or seemingly unrelated traumas. Military personnel, journalists covering stories of mass tragedies or prolonged conflicts, and first re\u00adsponders who handle hundreds of cases eachyear typify repeated trauma survivors. Repet i\u00ad tive exposure to traumas can have a cumulative effect over one's lifetime. A person who was assaulted dur ing adolescence, diagnosed with a life-threatening illness in his or her thirties, and involved in a serious car accident later in life has experience d repeated trauma. Some repeated traumas are sustained orchronic. Sustained trauma experiences tend to wear down resilience and the ability to adapt. Some examples include children who endure ongoing sexual abuse, physical neglect, oremotional abuse; people who are in violent relationships; and people who live in chronicpoverty. Individuals in chronically stressful, traumatizing environments are particularly susceptible to traumatic stress reactions, sub\u00adstance use, and mental disorders. Bidirectional relationships exist between trauma and substance use as well as trauma and mental illness. For example, abuse of a l\u00ad cohol and drugs increases the risk of a tra u\u00ad matic experience and creates greatervulnerability to the effects of trauma; sub\u00adstance abuse reduces a person's ability to take corrective and remedial actions that mightreduce the impact of the trauma. Likewise, traumatic stress leads to a greater likelihood of 46 Case Illustration: Yourself Think of a time that was particularly stressful (but not traumatic) in your life. Revisit this period as an observer watching the events unfold and then ask yourself, \"What made this time particularly stres s\u00ad ful?\" It is likely that a part of your answer will include the difficulty of managing one situation before another circumstance came along demanding your time. Stressful times denote being bombarded with many things at one time, perceived or actual, without sufficient time or ability to address them emotionally, cognitively, spiritually , and/or physically. The same goes for trauma \u2014rapid exposure to numerous traumas one after another lessens one's ability to process the event before the next o n\u00ad slaught. This creates a cumulative effect, making it more difficult to heal from any one trauma. Part 1, Chapter 2\u2014Trauma Awareness substance abuse that, in turn, increases the risk for additional exposure to trauma. Parallelingthis bidirectional relationship, mental illness increases vulnerability to the effects of traumaand raises the risk for substance use disorders and for encountering additional traumatic events. So too, early exposure to ACEs is as\u00ad sociated with traumatic stress reactions and subsequent exposure to trauma in adult years. People who have encountered multiple and longer doses of trauma are at the greatest risk for developing traumatic stress. For example,military reservists and other military servicemembers who have had multiple long tours of duty are at greater risk for traumatic stress reactions (see th e planned TIP, Reintegration - Related Behavioral Health Issues in Veterans and Military Families; SAMHSA, planned f). In addition, people are more likely to encounter greater impairment and distress from traumaif that trauma occurs with significant intensi ty and continues sporadically or unceasingly forextended periods. Was there enough time to process the experience? A particularly severe pattern of ongoing tra u\u00ad ma, sometimes referred to as \"cascading tra u\u00ad ma,\" occurs when multiple traumas happen in a patt ern that does not allow an individual to heal from one traumatic event before another occurs. Take, for example, California resi\u00addents \u2014they repeatedly face consecutive and/or simultaneous natural disasters includ\u00ading fires, landslides, floods, droughts, andearthquakes. In other cases, there is ample time to process an event, but processing is limited because people don 't have supportive relationships or environments that model pr e\u00ad ventive practices. This can lead to greater vul\u00adnerability to traumas that occur later in life . How many losses has the trauma caused? Trauma itself can create significant distress, but often , the losses associated with a trauma have more far -reaching effects. Fo r instance, a child may be forced to assume adult responsi\u00adbilities, such as serving as a confidant for a parent who is sexually abusing him or her, and lose the opportunity of a childhood free from adult worries. In another scenario, a couple may initially feel grateful to have escaped a house fire, but they may nevertheless face si g\u00ad nificant community and financial losses months afterward. In evaluating the impact oftrauma, it is helpful to access and discuss the losses associated with the initial trauma. The number of losses greatly influences an indivi d\u00ad ual's ability to bounce back from the tragedy. In the case illustration on the next page , Rasheed 's losses cause him to disconnect from his wife, who loves and supports him. Success\u00adful confrontation of loss es can be difficult if the losses compound each other, as withRasheed 's loss of his friend, his disability, his employment struggles, and the threats to his marriage and liberty. People can cite a specific 47 Case Illustration: Rasheed Rasheed was referred to an employee assistance program by his employer. He considered quitting his job, but his wife insisted he talk to a counselor. He is a 41- year- old auto mechanic who, 4 years ago, caused a head -on collision while attempting to pass another vehicle. A close friend, riding in the passenger's seat, was killed, and two young people in the other vehicle were seriously injured and permanently disabled. Rasheed survived with a significant back injury and has only been able to work sporadically. He was convicted of negligent homicide and placed on probation because of his physical disability. He is on probation for another 4 years, and if he is convicted of another felony during that time, he will have to serve prison time for his prior offense. While still in t he hospital, Rasheed complained of feeling unreal, numb, and disinterested in the care he received. He did not remember the crash but remembers waking up in the hospital 2 days later. He had difficulty sleeping in the hospital and was aware of feelings of impending doom, although he was unaware of the legal charges he would later face. He was diagnosed with ASD. He was discharged from the hospital with a variety of medications, including pain pills and a sleep aid. He rapidly became dependent on these medications, feeling he could not face the day without the pain medication and being unable to sleep without sleep medicine in larger doses than had been prescribed. Within 3 months of the accident, he was \"doctor shopping\" for pain pills and even had a friend obtain a prescription for the sleeping medication from that friend's doctor. In the 4 intervening years, Rasheed's drug use escalated, and his blunted emotions and detachment from friends became more profound. He became adept at obtaining pain pills from a variety of sources, most of them illegal. He fears that if he seeks treatment for the drug problem, he will have to admit to felony offenses and will probably be imprisoned. He also does not believe he can manage his life without the pain pills. In the past 2 years, he has had recurring dreams of driving a car on the wrong side of the road and into the headlights of an oncoming vehicle. In the dream, he cannot control the car and wakes up just before the vehicles crash. At unusual times \u2014for instance, when he is just awakening in the morning, taking a shower, or walking alone\u2014he will feel profound guilt over the death of his friend in the accident. He becomes very anxious when driving in traffic or when he feels he is driving faster than he should. His marriage of 18 years has been marked by increasing emotional distance, and his wife has talked about separating if he does not do something about his problem. He has been unable to work consistently because of back pain and depression. He was laid off from one job b e\u00ad cause he could not concentrate and was making too many mistakes. The counselor in the employee assistance program elicited information on Rasheed's drug use, althoug h she suspected Rasheed was minimizing its extent and effects. Knowledgeable about p sy\u00ad chological trauma, the counselor helped Rasheed feel safe enough to talk about the accident and how it had affected his life. She was struck by how little Rasheed connected his present difficulties to the accident and its aftermath. The counselor later commented that Rasheed talked about the acc i\u00ad dent as if it had happened to someone else. Rasheed agreed to continue seeing the counselor for five additional visits, during which time a plan would be made for Rasheed to begin treatment for drug dependence and PTSD. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services event as precipitating their trauma, or, in ot h\u00ad er cases, the specific trauma can symbolize a series of disabling events in which the personfelt his or her life was threatened or in which he or she felt emotionally overwhelmed, psy\u00adchologically disor ganized, or significantly di s\u00ad connected from his or her surroundings. It will be important for Rasheed to understand how his losses played a part in his abuse ofprescription medications to cope with symp\u00adtoms associated with traumatic stress and loss,(e.g., guilt, depression, fear). If not addressed, his trauma could increase his risk for relapse. 48 Part 1, Chapter 2\u2014Trauma Awareness Was the trauma expected or unexpected? When talking about a trauma, people som e\u00ad times say they didn 't see it coming. Being un\u00ad prepared, unaware, and vulnerable often increases the risk of psychological injury, butthese are common compon ents of most tra u\u00ad mas, given that most traumatic events do o c\u00ad cur without warning ( e.g., car crashes , terrorist attacks, sexual assaults). People with substance use disorders, mental illness, and/or cognitive disabilities may be especially vulnerable in thatthey may attend less or have competing co n\u00ad cerns that diminish attention to what is goingon around them, even in high -risk enviro n\u00ad ments. However, most individuals attempt togain some control over the tragedy by repla y\u00ad ing the moments leading up to the event andprocessing how they could have anticipated it.Some people perseverate on these thoughts for months or years after the event. Sometimes, a trauma is anticipated but has unexpected or unanticipated consequences, as in the case of Hurricane Katrina. Learningabout what is likely to happen can reduce traumatization. For instance, training militarypersonnel in advance of going to combat ove r\u00ad seas prepares them to handle traumas and can reduce the impact of trauma. Were the trauma's effects on the person's life isolated or pervasive? When a trauma is isolated from the larger context of life, a person 's response to it is more likely to be contai ned and limited. For i n\u00ad stance, military personnel in combat situations can be significantly traumatized by what theyexperience. On return to civilian life or no n- combat service, some are able to isolate the traumatic experience so that it does not invade ordinary, day -to-day living. This does not mean that the combat experience was not di s\u00ad turbing or that it will not re surface if the ind i\u00ad vidual encounters an experience that triggers memories of the trauma; it just means that theperson can more easily leave the trauma in thepast and attend to the present. Conversely, people who remain in the vicinity of the trauma may encounter greater cha l\u00ad lenges in recovery. The traumatic event inter\u00ad twines with various aspects of the person 's daily activities and interactions, thus increa s\u00ad ing the possibility of being triggered by sur\u00adrounding cues and experiencing subsequentpsychological distress. However, another way to view this potential dilemma for the client is to reframe it as an opportunity \u2014the repetitive exposure to trauma -related cues may provide vital guidance as to when and which treatment and coping techniques to use in the delivery of trauma -informed and trauma -specific behav\u00ad ioral health services. Who was responsible for the trauma and was the act intentional? If the severity of a trauma is judged solely by whether the act was intentional or not, events that reflect an intention to harm would be a primary indicator in predicting subsequentdifficulties among individuals exposed to this form of trauma. For most s urvivors, there is an initial disbelief that someone would conceiv a\u00ad bly intend to harm others, followed by consi d\u00ad erable emotional and, at times, behavioral investment in somehow making things right again or in making sense of a senseless, mali\u00ad cious act. For instance, in the wake of the World Trade Center attacks in New York City, people responded via renewed patrio t\u00ad ism, impromptu candlelight vigils, attacks onpeople of Arab and Muslim descent, and un\u00adprecedented donations and willingness to waitin long line s to donate blood to the Red Cross. Each example is a response that insome way attempts to right the perceived wrong or attach new meaning to the event andsubsequent consequences. 49 Case Illustration: Frank Frank entered substance abuse treatment with diagnoses of co- occurring PTSD and substance use disorder. While on a whitewater kayak trip with his wife, her kayak became pinned on a rock, and Frank could only watch helplessly as she drowned. His drinking had increased markedly after the a c\u00ad cident. He acknowledged a vicious cycle of sleep disturbance with intrusive nightmares followed by vivid memories and feelings of terror and helplessness after he awoke. He drank heavily at night to quiet the nightmares and memories, but heavy alcohol consumption perpetuated his trouble sleep\u00ad ing. He withdrew from contact with many of his old \"couple friends\" and his wife's family, with whom he had been close. At treatment entry , he described his life as \"going to work and coming home.\" The trauma occurred 3 years before he sought treatment, but Frank continued to feel numb and di s\u00ad connected from the world. His only emotion was anger, which he tried to keep in check. Integrated treatment for PTSD and substance abuse helped him sleep and taught him coping skills to use when the memories arose; it fostered his engagement and retention in long -term care for both disorders. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services When terrible things happen, it is human n a\u00ad ture to assign blame. Trauma survivors can become heavily invested in assigning blame orfinding out who was at fault, regardless of the type of trauma. Often, this occurs as an a t\u00ad tempt to make sense of , give meaning to, and reestablish a sense of predictability, contro l, and safety a fter an irrational or random act. It is far easier to accept that someone, includingoneself, is at fault or could have done some\u00adthing different than it is to accept the fact that one was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. For some trauma survivors, needing to find out why a trauma occurred or who is at faultcan become a sig nificant block to growth when the individual would be better served by asking , \"What do I need to do to heal? \" Be\u00ad havioral health professionals can help clients translate what they have learned about respo n\u00ad sibility in recovery to other aspects of theirlives. For instance, someone in treatment for co-occurring disorders who has internalized that becoming depressed or addicted was nothis or her fault , but that recovery is a personal responsibility, can then apply the same princ i\u00ad ple to the experience of child hood abuse and thereby overcome negative judgments of self(e.g., thinking oneself to be a bad person whodeserves abuse). The individual can then beginto reassign responsibility by attaching the blame to the perpetrator(s) while at the sametime assuming responsibility for recovery. Was the trauma experienced directly or indirectly? Trauma that happens to someone directly seems to be more damaging than witnessingtrauma that befalls others. For example, it is usually more traumatic to be robbed at gun\u00adpoint than to witness someone else being robbed or hearing someone tell a story aboutbeing robbed. Yet, sometimes, experiencinganother 's pain can be equally traumatic. For instance, parents often internalize the painand suffering of their children when the chi l\u00ad dren are undergoing traumatic circumstances(e.g., treatments for childhood cancer). There are two ways to experience the trauma of others. An individual may witness the event,such as seeing someone killed or seriously i n\u00ad jured in a car accident, or may learn of anevent that happened to someone, such as aviolent personal assault, suicide, serious acc i\u00ad dent, injury, or sudden or unexpected death.For many people , the impact of the trauma will depend on a host of variables, including their proximity to the event as eyewitnesses, the witnesses' response in the situation, theirrelationship to the victim s, the degree of help\u00ad lessness surrounding the experience, their ex\u00ad posure to subsequent consequences, and so on. 50 It is important to remember that what happened is not nearly as important as what the trauma means to the individual. Part 1, Chapter 2\u2014Trauma Awareness The effects of traumas such as genocide and internment in concentration camps can be feltacross generations\u2014stories, coping behaviors,and stress reactions can be passed across gen\u00aderational lines far removed from the actual event s or firsthand accounts. Known as histo r\u00ad ical trauma, this type of trauma can affect thefunctioning of families, communities, andcultures for multiple generations. What happened since the trauma? In reviewing traumatic events, it is important to assess the degree of disruption after the initial trauma has passed, such as the loss ofemployment, assets, community events, beha v\u00ad ioral health services, local stores, and recre a\u00ad tional areas. There is typical ly an initial rally of services and support following a trauma, pa r\u00ad ticularly if it is on a mass scale. However, the reality of the trauma 's effects and their disrup\u00ad tiveness may have a more lasting impact. The deterioration of normalcy, including the di s\u00ad ruption of day -to-day activities and the dam\u00ad age of structures that house these routines, will likely erode the common threads that provide a sense of safety in individual lives and co m\u00ad munities. Hence, the degree of disruption inresuming normal daily activities is a significant risk factor for substance use disorders, subcli n\u00ad ical psychological symptoms, and mental di s\u00ad orders. For example, adults displaced from their homes because of Hurricanes Katrina or Rita had significantly higher rates of past - month cigarette use, illicit drug use, and binge drinking than those who were not displaced(Office of Applied Studies, 2008). Subjective Characteristics Psychological meaning of trauma An important clinical issue in understandingthe impact of trauma is the meaning t hat the survivor has attached to the traumatic exper i\u00ad ence. Survivors' unique cognitive interpret a\u00ad tions of an event \u2014that is, their beliefs and assumptions\u2014contribute to how they process, react to,cope with, and reco v\u00ad er from the trauma. Does the event repr e\u00ad sent retribution for pa st deeds committed by the individual or his or her family? How does the individual attach meaning to his or her survival? Does he or she believe that it is a sign of a greater purpose not yet revealed?People who attempt to share the ir interpret a\u00ad tion and meaning of the event can feel misun\u00adderstood and sometimes alienated (Paulson &Krippner , 2007; Schein, Spitz, Burlingame, & Muskin, 2006). People interpret traumatic events in vastly different ways, and many variables shape how an in dividual assigns meaning to the exper i\u00ad ence (framing the meaning through culture,family beliefs, prior life experiences and lear n\u00ad ing, personality and other psychological fea\u00adtures, etc.). Even in an event that happens in a household, each family member may interpretthe experience differently. Likewise, the same type of event can occur at two different times in a person 's life, but his or her interpretation of the events may differ considerably because of developmental differences acquired betweenevents, current cognitive and emotional pr o\u00ad cessing skills, availability of and access to env i\u00ad ronmental resources, and so forth. Disruption of core assumptions and beliefs Trauma often engenders a crisis of faith (Frankl, 1992) that leads clients to questionbasic assumptions about life. Were the ind i\u00ad vidual 's core or life -organizing assumptions (e.g., about safety, perception of others, fai r\u00ad ness, purpose of life, future dreams) chal\u00ad lenged or disrupted during or after the traumatic event ? (See the seminal work, 51 Resilience: Connection and Continuity Research suggests that reestablishing ties to family, community, culture, and spiritual systems is not only vital to the individual, but it also influences the impact of the trauma upon future generations. For example, Baker and Gippenreiter (1998) studied the descendants of survivors of Joseph Stalin's purge. They found that families who were able to maintain a sense of connection and continuity with grandparents directly affected by the purge experienced fewer negative effects than those who were emotiona lly or physically severed from their grandparents. Whether the grandparents survived was less important than the connection the grandchildren felt to their pasts. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services Shattered Assumptions, by Janoff -Bulman, 1992.) For example, some trauma survivors see themselves as irreparably wounded or beyond the possibility of healing. The following case illustration (Sonja) explores not only the i m\u00ad portance of meaning , but also the role that trauma plays in altering an individual 's core assumptions\u2014the very assumptions that pr o\u00ad vide meaning and a means to organize our lives and our interactions with the world and others. Cultural meaning of trauma Counselors should strive to appreciate the cultural meaning of a trauma. How do cultural interpretations, cultural support, and cult ural responses affect the experience of trauma? It is critical that counselors do not presume to un\u00ad derstand the meaning of a traumatic exper i\u00ad ence without considering the client 's cultural context. Culture strongly influences the per\u00adceptions of trauma. For instance, a trauma involving shame can be more profound for aperson from an Asian culture than for some\u00adone from a European culture. Likewise, anAlaska Native individual or community , de\u00ad pending upon their Tribal ancestry, may b e\u00ad lieve that the traumatic ex perience serves as a form of retribution. Similarly, the suddendeath of a family member or loved one can be less traumatic in a culture that has a strongbelief in a positive afterlife. It is important forcounselors to recognize that their perceptions of a specific trauma could be very different from their clients ' perceptions. Be careful not to judge a client 's beliefs in light of your own value system. For more information on culture and how to achieve cultural competence inproviding behavioral health services, see SAMHSA 's planned TIP , Improving Cultural Competence (SAMHSA, planned c). Individual and Sociocultural Features A wide variety of social, demographic, env i\u00ad ronmental, and psychological factors influence a person 's experience of trauma, the severity of traumatic stress reactions following the event,and his or her resilience in dealing with the short- and long -term environmental, physical, sociocultural, and emotional consequences.This section addresses a few known factors that influence the r isk of trauma along with the development of subclinical and diagnostictraumatic stress symptoms, such as mood andanxiety symptoms and disorders. It is notmeant to be an exhaustive exploration of these factors, but rather, a brief presentation to makecounselors and other behavioral health profes\u00ad sionals aware that various factors influence risk for and protection against traumatic stress andsubsequent reactions. (For a broader perspective on such factors, refer to Part 1, Chapter 1.) Individual Factors Several factors influence one's ability to deal with trauma effectively and increase one 's risk for traumatic stress reactions. Individual fa c\u00ad tors pertain to the individual 's genetic, biolog i\u00ad cal, and psychological makeup and history as they influence the p erson 's experi ence and 52 Case Illustration: Sonja Sonja began to talk about how her life was different after being physically assaulted and robbed in a parking lot at a local strip mall a year ago. She recounts that even though there were people in the parking lot, no one came to her aid until the assailant ran off with her purse. She sustained a cheek\u00ad bone fracture and developed visual difficulties due to the inflammation from the fracture. She r e\u00ad cently sought treatment for depressive symptoms and reported that she had lost interest in activities that typically gave her joy. She reported isolating herself from others and said that her perception of others had changed dramatically since the attack. Sonja had received a diagnosis of major depression with psychotic features 10 years earlier and r e\u00ad ceived group therapy at a local community mental health center for 3 years until her depression went into remission. She recently became afraid that her depression was becoming more pr o\u00ad nounced, and she wanted to prevent another severe depressive episode as well as the use of ps y\u00ad chotropic medications, which she felt made her lethargic. Thus, she sought out behavioral health counseling. As the sessions progressed, and after a psychological evaluation, it was clear that Sonja had some depressive s ymptoms, but they were subclinical. She denied suicidal thoughts or i ntent, and her thought process was organized with no evidence of hallucinations or delusions. She described her isolation as a reluctance to shop at area stores. On one hand, Sonja was self- compassionate about her reasons for avoidance, but on the other hand, she was concerned that the traumatic event had altered how she saw life and others. \"I don't see people as very caring or kind, like I used to prior to the ev ent. I don't trust them, and I feel people are too self- absorbed. I don't feel safe, and this bothers me. I worry that I'm becoming paranoid again. I guess I know better, but I just want to have the freedom to do what I want and go where I want.\" Two mont hs after Sonja initiated counseling, she came to the office exclaiming that things can i n\u00ad deed change. \"You won't believe it. I had to go to the grocery store, so I forced myself to go the shopping center that had a grocery store attached to a strip mall. I was walking by a coffee shop, quickly browsing the items in the front window, when a man comes out of the shop talking at me. He says, 'You look like you need a cup of coffee.' What he said didn't register immediately. I looked at him blankly, and he said it again. 'You look like you need a cup of coffee. I'm the owner of the shop, and I noticed you looking in the window, and we have plenty of brewed coffee left before we close the shop. Come on in, it's on the house.' So I did! From that moment on, I began to see peo\u00ad ple differently. He set it right for me \u2014I feel as if I have myself back again, as if the assault was a sign that I shouldn't trust people, and now I see that there is some goodness in the world. As small as this kindness was, it gave me the hope that I had lost.\" For Sonja, the assault changed her assumptions about safety and her view of others. She also a t\u00ad tached meaning to the event. She believed that the event was a sign that she shouldn't trust people and that people are uncaring. Yet these beliefs bothered her and contradicted how she saw herself in the world, and she was afraid that her depressive symptoms were returning. For an inexperienced professional, her presentation may have ignited suspicions that she was b e\u00ad ginning to present with p sychotic features. However, it is common for trauma survivors to exper i\u00ad ence changes in core assumptions immediately after the event and to attach meaning to the trauma. Often, a key ingredient in the recovery process is first identifying the meaning of the event and the beliefs that changed following the traumatic experience. So when you hear a client say \"I will never see life the same,\" this expression should trigger further exploration into how life is different, what meaning has been assigned to the trauma, and how the individual has changed his or her perception of self, others, and the future.

Part 1, Chapter 2\u2014Trauma Awareness 53 Case Illustration: Sonja (continued) Sometimes, reworking the altered beliefs and assumptions occurs with no formal intervention, as with Sonja. In her situation, a random stranger provided a moment that challenged an assumption generated from the trauma. For others, counseling may be helpful in identifying how beliefs and thoughts about self, others, and the world have changed since the event and how to rework them to move beyond the trauma. It is important to understand that the meaning that an individual attaches to the event(s) can either undermine the healing process (e.g., believing that you should not have survived, feeling shame about the trauma, continuing to engage in high- risk activities) or pave the road to recovery (e.g., volunteering to protect victim rights after being sexually assaulted). The fol\u00ad lowing questions can help behavioral health staff members introduce topics surrounding assum p\u00ad tions, beliefs, interpretations, and meanings related to trauma: In what ways has your life been different since the trauma? How do you understa nd your survival? (This is an important question for clients who have been exposed to ACEs or cumulative trauma and those who survived a tragedy when others did not.) Do you believe that there are reasons that this event happened to you? What are they? What meaning does this experience have for you? Do you feel that you are the same person as before the trauma? In what ways are you the same? In what ways do you feel different? How did this experience change you as a person? Would you like to return to the p erson you once were? What would you need to do, or what would need to happen, for this to occur? Did the traumatic experience change you in a way that you don't like? In what ways? How do you view others and your future differently since the trauma? What w ould you like to believe now about the experience? Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services interpretation of, as well as his or her reactions to, trauma. However, many factors influence individual responses to trauma; it is not justindividual characteristics. Failing to recognizethat multiple factors aside from individual attributes and history influence experiences during and after trauma can lead to blamingthe victim for having traumatic stress. History of prior psychological trauma People with histories of prior psychological trauma appear to be the most susceptible to severe traumatic responses (Nishith, Mechanic, & Resick, 2000; Vogt, Bruce, Street, &Stafford, 2007), particularly if they have avoided addressing past traumas. Because minimization, dissociation, and avoidance are common de fenses for many trauma survivors, prior traumas are not always consciously avai l\u00ad able, and when they are, memories can be distorted to avoid painful aff ects. Some surv i\u00ad vors who have repressed their experiences d e\u00adny a history of trauma or are unable to expla in their strong reactions to present situations. Remember that the effects of trauma are c u\u00ad mulative; therefore, a later trauma that out\u00adwardly appears less severe may have more impact upon an individual than a trauma thatoccurred years earlier. Conversely, individuals who have experienced earlier traumas may have developed effective coping strategies orreport positive outcomes as they have learnedto adjust to the consequences of the trauma(s).This outcome is often referred to as posttra u\u00ad matic growth or p sychological growth. Clients in behavioral health treatment who have histories of trauma can respond negativ e\u00ad ly to or seem disinterested in treatment efforts. They may become uncomfortable in groups that emphasize personal sharing; likewise, anindividual who experiences brief bouts of di s\u00ad sociation (a reaction of some trauma survivors)may be misunderstood by others in treatmentand seen as un interested. Providers need to 54 Part 1, Chapter 2\u2014Trauma Awareness attend to histories , adjust treatment to avoid retraumatization , and steer clear of labeling clients' behavior as pathological. History of resilience Resilience\u2014 the ability to thrive despite nega\u00ad tive life experiences and heal from traumatic event s\u2014is related to the internal strengths and environmental supports of an i ndividual. Most individuals are resilient despite experiencing traumatic stress. The ability to thrive beyondthe trauma is associated with individual factors as well as situational and contextual factors. There are not only one or two primary factors that make an individual resilient; many factors contribute to the development of resilience.There is little research to indicate that there are specific traits predictive of resilience; instead, it appears that more general characteristics influ\u00adence resilience, including neurobiology (Feder,Charney, & Collins, 2011), flexibility in adap t\u00ad ing to change, beliefs prior to trauma, sense ofself-efficacy, and ability to experience positive emotions (Bonanno & Mancini, 2011). History of mental disorders The correlations among traumatic stress, sub\u00adstance use disorders, and co -occurring mental disorders are well known. According to theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Di s\u00ad orders , Fifth Edition (American Psychiatric Association , 2013a), traumatic stress reactions are linked to higher rates of mood, substance - related, anxiety, trauma, stress -related, and other mental disorders, each of which can pr e\u00ad cede, follow, or emerge concurrently withtrauma itself. A co -occurring mental disorder is a significant determinant of whether an individual can successfully address and resolve trauma as it emerges from the past or occurs in the present. Koenen, Stellman, Stellman,and Sommer (2003) found that the risk of developing PTSD following combat traum a was higher for individuals with preexistingconduct disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and/or major depression than for those without preexisting mental disorders. For additional information on comorbidity oftrauma and other mental disorders, see TIP42, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Co-Occurring Disorders (CSAT , 2005c). Sociodemographic Factors Demographic variables are not good predi c\u00ad tors of who will experience trauma and subse\u00adquent traumatic stress reactions. Gender, age, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, maritalstatus, occupation, income, and education canall have some influence, but not enough todetermine who should or should not receive screening for trauma and traumatic stress symptoms. The following sections cover a few selected variables. (For more information,please refer to Part 3 of this TIP , the online literature review .) Gender In the United States, men are at greater risk than women for being exposed to stressful events. Despite the higher prevalence amongmen, lifetime PTSD occurs at about twice the rate among women as it does in men. Less is known about gender differences with subclin i\u00ad cal traumatic stress reactions. There are also other gender differences, such as the types of trauma experienced by men and women.Women are more likely to experience physical and sexual assault, whereas men are most lik e\u00ad ly to experience combat and crime victimiz a\u00ad tion and to witness military service are subject to the same risks as men and are also at a greater risk for mil i\u00ad tary sexual trauma. Men's traumas often occur in public ; women 's are more likely to take place in private settings. Perpetrators of tra u\u00ad mas against men are often strangers, but wom\u00ad en are more likely to know the perpetrator. 55 Resilience: Cultural, Racial, and Ethnic Characteristics The following list highlights characteristics that often nurture resilience among individuals from d i\u00ad verse cultural, racial, and ethnic groups: Strong kinship bonds Respect for elders and the importance of extended family Spirituality and religious practices (e.g., shrine visitations or the use of traditional healers) Value in friendships and warm personal relationships Expression of humor and creativity Instilling a sense of history, heritage, and historical traditions Community orientation, activities, and socialization Strong work ethic Philosophies and beliefs about life, suffering, and perseverance \"Fortune owes its existence to misfortune, and misfortune is hidden in fortune.\" -Lao-Tzu teaching, Taoism (Wong & Wong, 2006) Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services Age In general , the older one becomes, the higher the risk of trauma \u2014but the increas e is not dramatic. Age is not particularly important in predicting exposure to trauma, yet at no age is one immune to the risk. However, trauma that occurs in the earlier and midlife years app ears to have greater impact on people for different reasons. For younger individuals, the trauma can affect developmental processes, attac h\u00ad ment, emotional regulation, life assumptions,cognitive interpretations of later experiences, and so forth (for additional resources, visit the National Child Traumatic Stress Netwo rk; http://www.nctsn.org/ ). For adults in midlife, trauma may have a greater impact due to theenhanced stress or burden of care that often characterizes this stage of life \u2014caring for their children and their parents a t the same time. Older adults are as likely as youngeradults to recover quickly from trauma, yet they may have greater vulnerabilities, includingtheir ability to survive without injury and theirability to address the current trauma withoutpsychological interference from earlier stress\u00ad ful or traumatic events. Older people are nat u\u00ad rally more likely to have had a history oftrauma because they have lived longer, thus creating greater vulnerability to the effects ofcumulative trauma. Race, ethnicity, and culture The potential for trauma exists in all major racial and ethnic groups in American society,yet few studies analyze the relationship of race and ethnicity to trauma exposure and/or tra u\u00ad matic stress reactions. Some studies show that certain racial and ethnic groups are at greater risk for specific traumas. For example, AfricanAmericans experienced higher rates of overall violence, aggravated assault, and robbery thanWhites but were as likely to be victims of rape or sexual assault (Catalano, 2004). Literature reflects that diverse ethnic, racial, and cultural groups are more likely to experience adverse effects from various traumas and to meet crit e\u00ad ria for posttraumatic stress (Bell, 2011). Sexual orientation and gender identity Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender ind i\u00ad viduals are likely to experience various forms of trauma associated with their sexual orient a\u00ad tion, including harsh consequences from fami\u00ad lies and faith traditions, higher risk of assaultfrom cas ual sexual partners, hate crimes, lack of legal protection, and laws of exclusion(Brown, 2008). Gay and bisexual men as well as transgender people are more likely to exp e\u00ad rience victimization than lesbians and bisexual women. Dillon (2001) reported a traum a ex\u00ad posure rate of 94 percent among lesbian, gay, 56 Part 1, Chapter 2\u2014Trauma Awareness and bisexual individuals; more than 40 percentof respondents experienced harassment due totheir sexual orientation. Heterosexual orient a\u00ad tion is also a risk for women , as w omen in relationship s with men ar e at a greater risk of being physical ly and sexually abused. People who are homeless Homelessness is typically defined as the lack of an adequate or regular dwelling, or having a nighttime dwelling that is a publicly or pr i\u00ad vately supervised institution or a place notintended for use as a dwelling (e.g., a bus st a\u00ad tion). The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) estimates thatbetween 660,000 and 730,000 individualswere homeless on any given night in 2005(HUD, 2007). Two thirds were unaccomp a\u00ad nied person s; the other third were people in families. A dults who are homeless and unma r\u00ad ried are more likely to be male than female.About 40 percent of men who are homeless are veterans (National Coalition for theHomeless, 200 2); this percentage has grown, including the number of veterans with d e\u00ad pendent children (Kuhn & Nakashima, 201 1). Rates of trauma symptoms are high amongpeople who are homeless (76 to 100 percent of women and 67 percent of men; Christensen etal., 2005; Jainchill, Hawke, & PTSD is among the mostprevalent non -substance use Ax is I disorders (Lester et al., 2007 ; McNamara, Schumacher, Milby, Wallace, & Usdan, 2001). People whoare homeless report high levels of trauma (e s\u00ad pecially physical and sexual abuse in childhoodor as adults) preceding their homeless status; assault, rape, and other traumas frequently happen while they are homeless. Researchsuggests that many women are homeless b e\u00ad cause they are fleeing domestic violence (National Coalition for the Homeless, 2002). Other studies suggest that women who are homeless are more likely to have histor ies of childhood physical and sexual abuse and to have experienced sexual assault as adult s. A history of physical and/or sexual abuse is evenmore common among women who are home\u00adless and have a serious mental illness. Youth who are homeless, especially those who live without a parent, are likely to have exper i\u00ad enced physical and/or sexual abuse. Between21 and 42 percent of youth runaways reporthaving been sexually abused before leavingtheir homes ; for young women, rates range from 3 2 to 63 percent (Administration on Children, Youth and Families, 2002). Addi\u00ad tionally, d ata reflect elevated rates of substance abuse for youth who are homeless and have histor ies of abuse. More than half of people who are homeless have a lifetime prevalence of mental illness and substance use disorders. Those who are homeless have higher rates of substance abuse (84 percent of men and 58 percent of women) , and substance use disorders, including alcohol and drug abuse/dependence, increase with longer lengths of homelessness (North,Eyrich, Pollio, & Spitznagel, 2004). For more information on providing trauma - informed behavioral health services to clients who are homeless, and for further discussionof the incidence of trauma in this populatio n, see TIP 55 -R, Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless (SAMHSA, 2013b). 57 IN THIS CHAPTER Sequence of Trauma Reactions Common Experiences and Responses to Trauma Subthreshold Trauma - Related Symptoms Specific Trauma -Related Psychological Disorders Other Trauma -Related and Co -Occurring Disorders Understanding th e3 Impact of Trauma Trauma -informed care (TIC) involves a broad understanding of traumatic stress reactions and common responses to trauma. Pr o\u00ad viders need to understand how trauma can affect treatment presen\u00ad tation, engagement, and the outcome of behavioral health services. This chapter examines common experiences survivors may encoun\u00adter immediately following or long after a traumatic experience. Trauma, including one -time, multiple, or long -lasting repetitive events, affects everyone differently. Some individuals may clearly display criteria associated with posttraumatic stress disorder(PTSD), but many more individuals will exhibit resilient responses or brief subclinical symptoms or consequences that fall outside ofdiagnostic criteria. The impact of trauma can be subtle, insidious,or outright destructive. How an event affects an individual depends on many factors, including characteristics of the individual, the type and characteristics of the event(s), developmental processes,the meaning of the trauma, and sociocultural factors. This chapter begins with an overview of common responses, emphasizing that traumatic stress reactions are normal reactions to abnormal circumstances. It highlights common short -and long \u00ad term responses to traumatic experiences in the context of individuals who may seek behavioral health services. This chapter discusses psychological symptoms not represented in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ( DSM -5; American Psych iatric Association [ APA ], 2013a), and responses associated with trauma that either fall below the threshold of mental disorders or reflect resilience . It also addresses common disorders associated with traumatic stress. This chapter explores the role of culture i n defining mental illness, particularly PTSD, and e nds by addressing co -occurring mental and substance -related disorders. 59 Foreshortened future: Trauma can affect one's beliefs about the future via loss of hope, limited expectations about life, fear that life will end abruptly or early , or anticipation that normal life events won't occur (e.g., access to education, ability to have a significant and committed relationship, good opportunities for work ). Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services TIC Framework in Behavioral Health Services \u2014The Impact of Trauma Sequence of Trauma Reactions Survivors ' immediate reactions in the afte r\u00ad math of trauma are quite complicated and are affected by their own experiences, the accessi\u00ad bility of natural supports and healers, the ir coping and life skills and those of immediate family, and the responses of the larger com\u00ad munity in which they live. Although reactions range in severity, even the most acute responsesare natural responses to manage trauma \u2014 they are not a sign of psychopathology. Co p\u00ad ing styles vary from action oriented to reflec\u00adtive and from emot ionally expressive to reticent. Clinically, a response style is less im\u00ad portant than the degree to which coping ef\u00ad forts successfully allow one to continue necessary activities, regulate emotions, sustainself-esteem, and maintain and enjoy interper\u00ad sonal c ontacts. Indeed, a past error in tra u\u00ad matic stress psychology, particularly regarding group or mass traumas, was the assumptionthat all survivors need to express emotions associated with trauma and talk about the trauma; more recent research indicates thatsurvivors who choose not to process theirtrauma are just as psychologically healthy as 60 Part 1, Chapter 3\u2014 Understanding the Impact of Trauma those who do. The most recent psychological debriefing approaches emphasize respecting the individual 's style of coping and not valuing one type over another. Initial reactions to trauma can include exhau s\u00ad tion, confusion, sadness, anxiety, agitation, numbness, dissociation, confusion, physical arousal, and blunted affect. Most responses are normal in that they affect most survivors andare socially acceptable, psychologically effec\u00adtive, and self -limited. Indicators of more s e\u00ad vere responses include continuous distress without periods of relative calm or rest, severe dissociation symptoms, and intense intrusive recollections that continue despite a return tosafety. Delayed responses to trauma can i n\u00ad clude persistent fatigue, sleep disorders,nightmares, fear of recurrence, anxiety focusedon flashbacks, depression, and avoidance ofemotions, sensations, or activities that are as\u00ad sociated with the trauma, even remotel y. Ex\u00ad hibit 1.3-1 outlines some common reactions. Common Experiences and Responses to Trauma A variety of reactions are often reported and/or observed after trauma. Most survivors exhibit immediate reactions, yet these typically resolve without severe long -term consequences. This is because most trauma survivors are highly resilient and develop appropriate copingstrategies, including the use of social sup\u00ad ports, to deal with the aftermath and effects of trauma. Most recover with time, show mi n\u00ad imal distress, and function effectively across major life areas and developmental stages.Even so , client s who show little impairment may still have subclinical symptoms or symp\u00ad toms that do not fit diagnostic criteria for acute stress disorder (ASD) or PTSD . Only a small percentage of people with a history of trauma show impairment and symptoms thatmeet criteria for trauma -related stress diso r\u00ad ders, including mood and anxiety disorders. The following sections focus on some co m\u00ad mon reactions across domains (emotional, physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, and d e\u00ad velopmental) associated with singular, mult i\u00ad ple, and enduring traumatic events. These reactions are often normal responses to traumabut can stil l be distressing to experience. Such responses are not signs of mental illness, nor do they indicate a mental disorder. Traumatic stress- related disorders comprise a specific constellation of symptoms and criteria. Emotional Emotional reactions to trauma can vary grea t\u00ad ly and are significantly influenced by the ind i\u00ad vidual 's sociocultural history. Beyond the initial emotional reactions during the event,those most likely to surface include anger, fear,sadness, and shame. However, individuals may encounter difficulty in identifying any of these feelings for various reasons. T hey might lack experience with or prior exposure to emotional expression in their family or community. They may associate strong feelings with the pasttrauma, thus believing that emotional expres\u00adsion is too dangerous or will lead to feeling outof control (e.g., a sense of \"losing it \" or going crazy). Still others might deny that they haveany feelings associated with their traumaticexperiences and define their reactions as numbness or lack of emotions. Emotional dysregulation Some trauma survivors have difficulty regula t\u00ad ing emotions such as anger, anxiety, sadness,and shame \u2014this is more so when the trauma occurred at a young age (van der Kolk, Roth,Pelcovitz, & Mandel, 1993). In individualswho are older and functioning well 61 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services Exhibit 1.3-1: Immediate and Delayed Reactions to Trauma Immediate Emotional Reactions Delayed Emotional Reactions Numbness and detachment Irritability and/or hostility Anxiety or severe fear Depression Guilt (including survivor guilt) Mood swings, instability Exhilaration as a result of surviving Anxie ty (e.g., phobia , generalized anxiety ) Anger Fear of trauma recurrence Sadness Grief reactions Helplessness Shame Feeling unreal; depersonalization (e.g., feeling Feelings of fragility and/or vulnerability as if you are watching yourself) Emotional detachment from anything that re- Disorientation quires emotional reactions (e.g., significant Feeling out of control and/or family relationships, conversat ions Denial about self, discussion of traumatic events or Constriction of feelings reactions to them) Feeling overwhelmed Immediate Physical Reactions Delayed Physical Reactions Nausea and/or gastrointestinal distress Sleep disturbances, nightmares Sweating or shivering Somatization (e.g., increased focus on and Faintness worry about body aches and pains) Muscle tremors or uncontrollable shaking Appetite and digestive changes Elevated heartbeat, respiration, and blood Lowered resistance to colds and infection pressure Persistent fatigue Extreme fatigue or exhaustion Elevated cortisol levels Greater startle responses Hyperarousal Depersonalization Long -term health effects including heart, liver, autoimmune, and chronic obstructive pulm o\u00ad nary disease Immediate Cognitive Reactions Difficulty concentrating Rumination or racing thoughts (e.g., replaying the traumatic event over and over again) Distortion of time and space (e.g., traumatic event may be perceived as if it was happen\u00ading in slow motion, or a few seconds can be perceived as minutes) Memory probl ems (e.g., not being able to r e\u00ad call important aspects of the trauma) Strong identification with victims Delayed Cognitive Reactions Intrusive memories or flashbacks Reactivation of previous traumatic events Self-blame Preoccupation with event Difficulty making decisions Magical thinking: belief that certain behaviors, including avoidant behavior, will protect against future trauma Belief that feelings or memories are dangerous Generalization of triggers (e.g., a person who experiences a home invasion dur ing the da y\u00ad time may avoid being alone during the day) Suicidal thinking Immediate Behavioral Reactions Delayed Behavioral Reactions Startled reaction Avoidance of event reminders Restlessness Social relationship disturbances Sleep and appetite disturbances Decreased activity level Difficulty expressing oneself Engagement in high- risk behaviors Argumentative behavior Increased use of alcohol and drugs Increased use of alcohol, drugs, and tobacco Withdrawal Withdrawal and apathy Avoidant behaviors (Continued on the next page.) 62 Part 1, Chapter 3\u2014 Understanding the Impact of Trauma Exhibit 1.3-1: Immediate and Delayed Reactions to Trauma (continued) Immediate Existential Reactions Intense use of prayer Restoration of faith in the goodness of others (e.g., receiving help from others) Loss of self-efficacy Despair about humanity, particularly if the event was intentional Delayed Existential Reactions Questioning (e.g., \"Why me?\") Increased cynic ism, disillusionment Increased self- confidence (e.g., \"If I can su r\u00ad vive this, I can survive anything\") Loss of purpose Renewed faith Immediate disruption of life assumptions (e.g., fairness, safety, goodness, predictability of life) Hopelessness Reestablishing priorities Redefining meaning and importance of life Reworking life's assumptions to accommoda te the trauma (e.g., taking a self -defense class to reestablish a sense of safety) Source s: Briere & Scott, 2006b; Foa, Stein, & McFarlane, 2006; Pietrzak, Goldstein, Southwick, & Grant, 2011. prior to the trauma, such emotional dysregula\u00ad tion is usually short lived and represents animmediate reaction to the trauma , rather than an ongoing pattern. Self -medication \u2014namely, substance abuse\u2014is one of the methods that traumatized people use in an attempt to regain emotional control, a lthough ultimately it causes even further emotional dysregulation (e.g.,substance- induced changes in affect during and after use). Other efforts toward emotional regulation can include engagement in high - risk or self -injurious behaviors, disordered eating , compulsive behaviors such as gambling or overworking, and repression or denial ofemotions; however, not all behaviors associated with self -regulation are considered negative. In fact, some individuals find cre a\u00ad tive, healthy, and industrious ways to mana ge strong affect generated by trauma, such as through renewed commitment to physical activity or by creating an organization to su p\u00ad port survivors of a particular trauma. Traumatic stress tends to evoke two emotional extremes: feeling either too much (over\u00adwhelmed) or too little (numb) emotion.Treatment can help the client find the optimal level of emotion and assist him or her with appropriately experiencing and regulating di f\u00adficult emotions. In treatment, the goal is tohelp clients learn to regulate thei r emotions without the use of substances or other unsafe behavior. This will likely require learning new coping skills and how to tolerate distressingemotions; some clients may benefit from mindfulness practices, cognitive restructuring,and trauma -specif ic desensitization approaches, such as exposure therapy and eye movementdesensitization and reprocessing (EMDR;refer to Part 1, Chapter 6 , for more info r\u00ad mation on trauma- specific therapies). Numbing Numbing is a biological process whereby emo\u00adtions are d etached from thoughts, behaviors, and memories. In the following case illustr a\u00ad tion, Sadhanna 's numbing is evidenced by her limited range of emotions associated with i n\u00ad terpersonal interactions and her inability toassociate any emotion with her history ofabuse. She also possesses a belief in a foreshor t\u00ad ened future. A prospective longitudinal study (Malta, Levitt, Martin, Davis, & Cloitre, 2009) that followed the development of PTSD indisaster workers highlighted the importance ofunderstanding and appreciating numbing as atraumatic stress reaction. Because numbing 63 Case Illustration: Sadhanna Sadhanna is a 22-year- old woman m andated to outpatient mental health and substance abuse trea t\u00ad ment as the alternative to incarceration. She was arrested and charged with assault after arguing and fighting with another woman on the street. At intake, Sadhanna reported a 7- year history of alcohol abuse and one depressive episode at age 18. She was surprised that she got into a fight but admi t\u00ad ted that she was drinking at the time of the incident. She also reported severe physical abuse at the hands of her mother's boyfriend between ages 4 and 15. Of particular note to the intake worker was Sadhanna's matter- of-fact way of presenting the abuse history. During the interview, she clearly ind i\u00ad cated that she did not want to attend group therapy and hear other people talk about their feelings, sayin g, \"I learned long ago not to wear emotions on my sleeve.\" Sadhanna reported dropping out of 10th grade, saying she never liked school. She didn't expect much from life. In Sadhanna's first weeks in treatment, she reported feeling disconnected from other group members and questioned the purpose of the group. When asked about her own history, she denied that she had any difficulties and did not understand why she was mandated to treatment. She further denied having feelings about her abuse and did not believe that it affected her life now. Group members often commented that she did not show much empathy and maintained a flat affect, even when group discussions were emotionally charged. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services symptoms hide what is going on inside em o\u00ad tionally, there can be a tendency for family members, counselors, and other behavioral health staff to assess levels of traumatic stress symptoms and the impact of trauma as less severe than they actually are. Physical Diagnostic criteria for PTSD place consider a\u00ad ble emphasis on psychological symptoms, but some people who have experienced traumaticstress may present initially with physical symp toms. Thus, primary care may be the first and only door through which these individuals seek assistance for trauma- related symptoms. Moreover, ther e is a significant connection between trauma, including adverse childhoodexperiences (ACEs) , and chronic health co n\u00ad ditions. Common disorders symptoms include and substance use disorders. Somatization Somatization indicates a focus on bodily symptoms or dysfunctions to express emotio n\u00adal distress. Somatic symptoms are more likelyto occur with individuals who have traumatic stress reactions, including PTSD. People from certain ethnic and cultural backgrounds may initially or solely present emotional distress viaphysical ailments or concerns. Many individ u\u00ad als who present with somatization are likely unaware of the connection between their emo\u00adtions and the physical symptoms that they 're experiencing. At times, clients may remainresistant to exploring emotional content andremain focused on bodily complaints as ameans of avoidance. Some clients may insist that their pri mary problems are physical even when medical evaluations and tests fail to co n\u00ad firm ailments. In these situations, somatiz a\u00ad tion may be a sign of a mental illness.However, various cultures approach emotional distress through the physical realm or view emotional and physical symptoms and well\u00adbeing as one. It is important not to assume that clients with physical complaints are usingsomatization as a means to express emotional pain; they may have specific conditions ordisorders that require medical attention. Foremost, counselors need to refer for medical evaluation. 64 Part 1, Chapter 3\u2014 Understanding the Impact of Trauma Advice to Counselors: Using Information About Biology and Trauma Educate your clients: \u00ad Frame reexperiencing the event(s), hyperarousal, sleep disturbances, and other physical symptoms as physiological reactions to extreme stress. \u00ad Communicate that treatment and other wellness activities can improve both psychological and physiological symptoms (e.g., therapy, meditation, exercise, yoga). You may need to refer certain clients to a psychiatrist who can evaluate them and, if warranted, prescribe psycho\u00ad tropic medication to address severe symptoms. \u00ad Discuss traumatic stress symptoms and their physiological components. \u00ad Explain links between traumatic stress symptoms and substance use disorders, if appropriate. \u00ad Normalize trauma symptoms. For example, explain to clients that their symptoms are not a sign of weakness, a character flaw, being damaged, or going crazy. Support your clients and provide a message of hope \u2014that they are not alone, they are not at fault, and recovery is possible and anticipated. Case Illustration : Kimi Kimi is a 35-year- old Native American woman who was group raped at the age of 16 on her walk home from a suburban high school. She recounts how her whole life changed on that day. \"I never felt safe being alone after the rape. I used to enjoy walking everywhere. Afterward, I couldn't tolerate the fear that would arise when I walked in the neighborhood. It didn't matter whether I was alone or with f riends \u2014every sound that I heard would throw me into a state of fear. I felt like the same thing was going to happen again. It's gotten better with time, but I often feel as if I'm sitting on a tree limb waiting for it to break. I have a hard time relaxing. I can easily get startled if a leaf blows across my path or if my children scream while playing in the yard. The best way I can describe how I experience life is by comparing it to watching a scary, suspenseful movie \u2014anxiously waiting for something to happen, palms sweating, heart pounding, on the edge of your chair .\" Biology of trauma Trauma biology is an area of burgeoning r e\u00ad search, with the promise of more complex and explanatory findings yet to come. Although a thorough presentation on the biological a s\u00ad pects of trauma is beyond the scope of this publication, what is currently known is thatexposure to trauma leads to a cascade of bi o\u00ad logical changes and stress responses. These biological alterations are highly associatedwith PTSD, other mental illnesses, and sub\u00adstance use disorders. These include: Changes in limbic system functioning. -pituitary arousal and endogenous opioid systems. As a clear example, early ACEs such as abuse, neglect, and other traumas affect brain development and increase a person's vulner a\u00ad bility to encountering interpersonal violence as an adult and to developing chronic diseasesand other physical illnesses, mental illnesses,substance- relate d disorders, and impairment in other life areas (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012). Hyperarousal and sleep disturbances A common symptom that arises from tra u\u00ad matic experiences is hyperarousal (also called hypervigilance). Hyperarousal is the body 's way of remaining prepared. It is characterized by sleep disturbances, muscle tension, and a lower threshold for startle responses and can persist years after trauma occurs . It is also one of the primary diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Hyperarousa l is a consequence of biological changes initiated by trauma. Although it 65 Cognitions and Trauma The following examples reflec t some of the types of cognitive or thought -process changes that can occur in response to traumatic stress. Cognitive errors: Misinterpreting a current situation as dangerous because it resembles, even r e\u00ad motely, a previous trauma (e.g., a client overreacting to an overturned canoe in 8 inches of water, as if she and her paddle companion would drown, due to her previous experience of nearly drowning in a rip current 5 years earlier). Excessive or inappropriate guilt: Attempting to make sense cognitively and gain control over a traumatic experience by assuming responsibility or possessing survivor's guilt, because others who experienced the same trauma did not survive. Idealization: Demonstrating inaccurate rationalizations, idealizations, or justifications of the perp e\u00ad trator's behavior, particularly if the perpetrator is or was a caregiver. Other similar reactions mirror idealization; traumatic bonding is an emotional attachment that develops (in part to secure survival) between perpetrators who engage in i nterpersonal trauma and their victims, and Stockholm syn\u00ad drome involves compassion and loyalty toward hostage takers (de Fabrique, Van Hasselt, Vecchi, & Romano, 2007). Trauma -induced hallucinations or delusions: Experiencing hallucination s and delusions that, althoug h they are biological in origin, contain cognitions that are congruent with trauma content (e.g., a woman believes that a person stepping onto her bus is her father, who had sexually abused her repeatedly as child, because he wore shoes simila r to those her father once wore). Intrusive thoughts and memories : Experiencing, without warning or desire , thoughts and memories associated with the trauma. These intrusive thoughts and memories can easily trigger strong em o\u00ad tional and behavioral reactions , as if the trauma was recurring in the present. The intrusive thoughts and memories can come rapidly, referred to as flooding, and can be disruptive at the time of their occurrence. If an individual experiences a trigger, he or she may have an increase in intrusive thoughts and memories for a while. For instance, individuals who inadvertently are retraumatized due to program or clinical practices may have a surge of intrusive thoughts of past trauma, thus ma k\u00ad ing it difficult for them to discern what is happening now versus what happened then. Whenever counseling focuses on trauma, it is likely that the client will experience some intrusive thoughts and memories. It is important to develop coping strategies before, as much as possible, and during the delivery of trauma -informed and trauma -specific treatment. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services serves as a means of self -protection after trauma, it can be detrimental. Hyperarousal can interfere with an individual's ability totake the necessary time to assess and appropr i\u00ad ately respond to specific input, such as loud noises or sudden movements. Sometimes,hyperarousal can produce overreactions tosituations perceived as dangerous when, infact, the circumstances are safe. Along with hyperarousal, sleep disturbances are very common in individuals who have ex\u00adperienced trauma. They can come in the form of early awakening, restless sleep, difficulty falling asleep, and nightmares. Sleep distur b\u00adances are most persistent among individuals who have trauma -related stress; the distur b\u00ad ances sometimes remain resistant to interven\u00adtion long after other traumatic stress symptoms have been successfully treated.Numerous strategies are available beyondmedication, including good sleep hygiene practices, cognitive rehearsals of nightmares,relaxation strategies, and nutrition. Cognitive Traumatic experiences can affect and alter cognitions. From the outset, trauma challen g\u00ad es the just -world or core life assumptions that 66 Part 1, Chapter 3\u2014 Understanding the Impact of Trauma help individuals navigate daily life (Janoff - Bulman, 1992). For example, it would be di f\u00ad ficult to leave the house in the morning if you believed that the world was not safe, that all people are dangerous, or that life holds no promise. Belief that one's efforts and inte n\u00ad tions can protect oneself from bad things makes it less likely for an individual to per\u00adceive personal vulnerability. However, tra u\u00ad matic events\u2014particularly if they are unexpected \u2014can challenge such beliefs. Let's say you always considered your driving time as \"your time \"\u2014and your car as a safe place to spend that time. Then someone hits you from behind at a highway entrance. A l\u00ad most immediately, the accident affects how you perceive the world, and from that momen t onward, for months following the crash, you feel unsafe in any car. You become hypervig i\u00ad lant about other drivers and perceive that ot h\u00ad er cars are drifting into your lane or failing tostop at a safe distance behind you . For a time, your perception of safety is eroded, often lea d\u00ad ing to compensating behaviors (e.g., excessiveglancing into the rearview mirror to see whether the vehicles behind you are stopping) until the belief is restored or reworked. Some individuals never return to their previous beliefsystems after a trauma , nor do they find a way to rework them \u2014thus leading to a worldview that life is unsafe. Still, many other individuals are able to return to organi z\u00ad ing core beliefs that support their perception of safety. Many factors contribute to cognitive patterns prior to,during, and after a trauma.Adopting Beck and colleagues' cognitive triad model (1979),trauma can alter three main cognitive patterns: thoughts about self, the world (ot hers/environment), and the future. To clarify, trauma can lead individuals to see themselves as incompetentor damaged, to see others and the world as unsafe and unpredictable, and to see the future as hopeless\u2014believing that pe rsonal suffering will continue, or negative ou tcomes will pr e\u00ad side for the foreseeable future (see Exhibit1.3-2). Subsequently, this set of cognitions can greatly influence clients' belief in their ability to use internal resources and external support effectively. From a cognitive - behavioral perspective, these cognitions have a bidirectio nal relationship in sustaining or co n\u00ad tributing to the development of depressive andanxiety symptoms after trauma. However, it is possible for cognitive patterns to help protect against debilitating psychological symptoms as well. Many factors contribute t o cognitive patterns prior to, during, and after a trauma. Feeling different An integral part of experiencing trauma isfeeling different from others, whether or not the trauma was an individual or group exper i\u00ad ence. Traumatic experiences typically feel sur\u00adreal and challenge the necessity and value ofmundane activities of daily life. Survivors Exhibit 1.3 -2: Cognitive Triad of Traumatic Stress 67 Advice to Counselors: Helping Clients Manage Flashbacks a nd Triggers If a client is triggered in a session or during some aspect of treatment, help the client focus on what is happening in the here and now; that is, use grounding techniques. Behavioral health service provi d\u00ad ers should be prepared to help the client get regrounded so that they can distinguish between what is happening now versus what had happened in the past (see Covington, 2008, and Najavits, 2002b , 2007b , for more grounding techniques). Offer education about the experience of triggers and flash\u00ad backs, and then normalize these events as common traumatic stress reaction s. Afterward, some cl i\u00ad ents need to discuss the experience and understand why the flashback or trigger occurred. It often helps for the client to draw a connection between the trigger and the traumatic event(s). This can be a preventive strategy whereby the client can anticipate that a given situation places him or her at higher risk for retraumatization and requires use of coping strategies , including seeking support. Source: Green Cross Academy of Traumatology, 2010. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services often believe that others will not fully under\u00ad stand their e xperiences, and they may think that sharing their feelings, thoughts, and rea c\u00ad tions related to the trauma will fall short of expectations. However horrid the trauma may be, the experience of the trauma is typically profound. The type of trauma can dictate how an ind i\u00ad vidual feels different or believes that they are different from others. Traumas that generate shame will often lead survivors to feel more alienated from others\u2014believing that they are\"damaged goods. \" When individuals believe that their experi ences are unique and inco m\u00ad prehensible, they are more likely to seek sup\u00adport, if they seek support at all, only withothers who have experienced a similar trauma. Triggers and flashbacks Triggers A trigger is a stimulus that sets off a memory of a trauma or a specific portion of a traumaticexperience. Imagine you were trapped briefly in a car after an accident. Then, several yearslater, you were unable t o unlatch a lock after using a restroom stall; you might have begun to feel a surge of panic reminiscent of the a c\u00ad cident, even though there were other avenues of escape from the stall . Some triggers can be identified and anticipated easily, but many aresubtle and inconspicuous, often surprising the individual or catching him or her off guard. In treatment, it is important to help clients ide n\u00ad tify potential triggers, draw a connection b e\u00ad tween strong emotional reactions and triggers,and develop coping strat egies to manage those moments when a trigger occurs. A trigger is any sensory reminder of the traumatic event: anoise, smell, temperature, other physical sens a\u00ad tion, or visual scene. Triggers can generalize toany characteristic, no matter how remote, that resembles or represents a previous trauma,such as revisiting the location where the traumaoccurr ed, being alone, having your children reach the same age that you were when you experienced the trauma, seeing the same breedof dog that bit you, or hearing loud voices. Triggers are often associated with the time of day, season, holiday, or anniversary of the event. Flashbacks A flashback is reexperiencing a previous tra u\u00ad matic experience as if it were actually happen\u00ading in that moment. It includes reactions that often resemble the client 's reactions during the trauma. Flashback experiences are very briefand typically l ast only a few seconds, but the emotional aftereffects linger for hours or lon g\u00ad er. Flashbacks are commonly initiated by atrigger, but not ne cessarily. Sometimes, they occur out of the blue. Other times, specific physical states increase a person's vulnerability to reexperien cing a trauma, (e.g., fatigue, high 68 Potential Signs of Dissociation Fixed or \"glazed\" eyes Sudden flattening of affect Long periods of silence Monotonous voice Stereotyped movements Responses not congruent with the present context or situation Excessive intellectualization (Briere, 1996a) Part 1, Chapter 3\u2014 Understanding the Impact of Trauma stress levels). Flashback s can feel like a brief movie scene that intrudes on the client. For example, hearing a car backfire on a hot , sunny day may be enough to cause a veteran to re\u00ad spond as if he or she were back on military patrol. Other ways people reexperience tra u\u00ad ma, besides flashbacks, are via nightmares and intrusive thoughts of the trauma. Dissociation, depersonalization, and derealization Dissociation is a mental process that severs connections among a person 's thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, and/or sense of identity. Most of us have experienced dissoci a\u00ad tion\u2014losing the ability to recall or track a particular action (e.g., arriving at work but not remembering the last minutes of the drive).Dissociation happens because the person is engaged in an automatic activity and is notpaying attention to his or her immediate env i\u00ad ronment. Dissociation can also occur during severe stress or trauma as a protective elementwhereby the individual incurs distortion oftime, space, or identity. This is a commonsymptom in traumatic stress reactions. Dissociation helps distance the experience from the individual. People who have exper i\u00ad enced severe or developmental trauma may have learned to separate themselves from di s\u00ad tress to survive. At times, dissociation can be very perv asive and symptomatic of a mental disorder, such as dissociative identity disorder (DID; formerly known as multiple personality dis order). According to the DSM -5, \"d isso\u00ad ciative disorders are characterized by a disru p\u00ad tion of and/or discontinuity in the normal integration of consciousness, memory, ident i\u00ad ty, emotion, perception, body representation,motor control, and behavior \" (APA, 2013a , p. 291). Dissociative disorder diagnoses are closely associated with histories of severe childhood trauma or pervasiv e, human-caused, intentional trauma, such as that experiencedby concentration camp survivors or victims ofongoing political imprisonment, torture, orlong-term isolation. A mental health profes\u00ad sional, preferably with significant training inworking with dissociative disorders and withtrauma, should be consulted when a dissoci a\u00ad tive disorder diagnosis is suspected. The characteristics of DID can be common ly accepted experience s in other cultures, rather than being viewed as symptomatic of a tra u\u00ad matic expe rience. For example, in non - Western cultures, a sense of alternate beings within oneself may be interpreted as beinginhabited by spirits or ancestors (Kirmayer,1996). Other experiences associated with di s\u00ad sociation include depersonalization \u2014 psychologically \"leaving one's body ,\" as if watching oneself from a distance as an observer or through derealization, leading to a sense thatwhat is taking place is unfamiliar or is not real. If clients exhibit signs of dissociation, beha v\u00ad ioral health service provider s can use groun d\u00ad ing techniques to help them reduce this defense strategy. One major long -term cons e\u00ad quence of dissociation is the difficulty it causesin connecting strong emotional or physical reactions with an event. Often, individual s may believe that they are going crazy be cause they are not in touch with the nature of theirreactions. By educating clients on the resilient qualities of dissociation while also emphasi z\u00ad ing that it prevents them from addressing or 69 Resilient Responses to Trauma Many people find healthy ways to cope with, respond to, and heal from trauma. Often, people aut o\u00ad matically reevaluate their values and redefine what is important after a trauma. Such resilient re\u00ad sponses include: Increased bonding with family and community. Redefined or increased sense of purpose and meaning. Increased commitment to a personal mission. Revised priorities. Increased charitable giving and volunteerism. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services validating the trauma, individuals can begin tounderstand the role of dissociation. All in all,it is important when working with traumasurvivors that the intensity level is not so great that it triggers a dissociative reaction and pr e\u00ad vents the person from engaging in the process. Behavioral Traumatic stress reactions vary widely; often,people engage in behaviors to manage the aftereffects, the intensity of emotions, or the distressing aspects of the traumatic experience.Some people reduce tension or stress through avoidan t, self-medicatin g (e.g., alcohol abuse), compulsive (e.g., overeating), impulsive (e.g.,high- risk behaviors), and/or self -injurious behaviors. Others may try to gain control over their experiences by being aggressive or sub\u00adconsciousl y reenacting aspect s of the trauma. Behavioral reactions are also the consequences of, or learned from, traumatic experiences . For example, some people act like they can't con\u00ad trol their current environment, thus failing totake action or make decisions lo ng after the traum a (learned helplessness). Other associate elements of the trauma with current activities,such as by reacting to an intimate moment ina significant relationship as dangerous or u n\u00ad safe years after a date rape. The following sec\u00ad tions discu ss behavioral consequences of trauma and traumatic stress reactions. Reenactments A hallmark symptom of trauma is reexper i\u00ad encing the trauma in various ways. Reexper occur through reenactments (lite r\u00ad ally, to \"redo \"), by which trauma survivors repetitively relive and recreate a past trauma intheir present lives. This is very apparent inchildren, who play by mimicking what o c\u00ad curred during the trauma, such as by preten d\u00ad ing to crash a toy airplane into a toy buildingafter seeing televised image s of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center on Sep\u00ad tember 11, 2001. Attempts to understandreenactments are very complicated, as ree n\u00ad actments occur for a variety of reasons. Some\u00adtimes , individuals reenact past traumas to master them. Examples of reenactments i n\u00ad clude a variety of e\u00ad haviors, hypersexuality, walking alone inunsafe areas or other high -risk behaviors, dri v\u00ad ing recklessly, or involvement in repetitive destructive relationships ( e.g., repeatedly get\u00ad ting into roman tic relationships with people who are abusive or violent), to name a few. Self-harm and self-destructive behaviors Self-harm is any type of intentionally self - inflicted harm, regardless of the severity of injury or whether suicide is intended. Often, self-harm is an attempt to cope with emotio n\u00ad al or physical distress that seems overwhelm\u00ad ing or to cope with a profound sense ofdissociation or being trapped, helpless, and\"damaged\" (Herman, 1997; Santa Mina &Gallop, 1998). Self- harm is associated with past childhood sexual abuse and other forms of trauma as well as substance abuse. Thus, 70 Part 1, Chapter 3\u2014 Understanding the Impact of Trauma Case Illustration: Marco Marco, a 30 -year- old man, sought treatment at a local mental health center after a 2-year bout of anxiety symptoms. He was an active member of his church for 12 years, but although he sought help from his pastor about a year ago, he reports that he has had no contact with his pastor or his church since that time. Approximately 3 years ago, his wife took her own life. He describes her as his soul- mate and has had a difficult time understanding her actions or how he could have prevented them. In the initial intake, he mentioned that he was the first person to find his wife after the suicide and reported feelings of betrayal, hurt, anger, and devastation since her death. He claimed that everyone leaves him or dies. He also talked about his difficulty sleeping, having repetitive dreams of his wife, and avoiding relationships. In his first session with the counselor, he initially rejected the counselor before the counselor had an opportunity to begin reviewing and talking about the events and di s\u00ad comfort that led him to treatment. In this scenario, Marco is likely reenacting his feelings of abandonment by attempting to reject others before he experiences another rejection or abandonment. In this situation, the counselor will need to recognize the reenactment, explore the behavior, and examine how reenactments appear in other situations in Marco's life. addressing self -harm requires attention to the client's reasons for self -harm. More than lik e\u00ad ly, the client needs help recognizing and co p\u00ad ing with emotional or physical distress in manageable amounts and ways. Among the self -harm behaviors reported in the literature are cutting, burning skin by heat (e.g., cigarettes) or caustic liquids, punchinghard enough to self -bruise, head banging, hair pulling, self -poisoning, inserting foreign o b\u00ad jects into bodily orifices, excessive nail biting, excessive scratching, bone breaking, gnawingat flesh, interfering with wound healing, tyingoff body parts to stop breathing or blood flow,swallowing sharp objects, and suicide. Cuttingand burning are among the most common forms of self -harm. Self-harm tends to occur most in people who have experienced repeated and/or early trauma (e.g., childhood sexual abuse) rather than in those who have undergone a single adulttrauma (e.g., a community- wide disaster or a serious car accident). There are strong associ a\u00ad tions between eating disorders, self -harm, and substance (Claes &Vandereycken, 200 7; for discussion, see Harned, Najavits, & Weiss,2006). Self- mutilation is also associated with (and part of the diagnostic criteria for) a nu m\u00ad ber of personality disorders, including borde r\u00ad line and histrionic, as well as DID, depression,and some forms of schizophrenia; these diso r\u00ad ders can co -occur with traumatic stress rea c\u00ad tions and disorders. It is important to distinguish self -harm that is suicidal from self -harm that is not suicidal and to assess and manage both of these very serious dangers carefully. Most people who engage inself-harm are not doing so with the intent to kill themselves (Noll, Horowitz, Bonanno , Trickett, & Putnam, 2003) \u2014although self - harm can be life threatening and can escalate into suicidality if not managed thera peutically. Self-harm can be a way of getting attention or manipulating others, but most often it is not.Self-destructive behaviors such as substance abuse, restrictive or binge eating, reckless a u\u00ad tomobile driving, or high -risk impulsive b e\u00ad havior are diff erent from self -harming behaviors but are also seen in clients with a history of trauma. Self -destructive behaviors differ from self -harming behaviors in that there may be no immediate negative impact ofthe behavior on the individual ; they differ from sui cidal behavior in that there is no in\u00ad tent to cause death in the short term. 71 Advice to Counselors: Working With Clients Who Are Self -Injurious Counselors who are unqualified or uncomfortable working with clients who demonstrate self- harming, self-destructive, or suicidal or homicidal ideation, intent, or behavior should work with their agencies and supervisors to refer such clients to other counselors. They should consider seeking specialized supervision on how to manage such clients effectively and safely and how to manage their feelings about these issues. The following suggestions assume that the counselor has had suffi\u00ad cient training and experience to work with clients who are self- injurious. To respond appropriately to a client who engages in self- harm, counselors should: Screen the client for self-harm and suicide risk at the initial evaluation and throughout treatment. Learn the client's perspective on self -harm and how it \"helps.\" Understand that self -harm is often a coping strategy to manage the intensity of emotional and/or physical distress. Teach the client coping skills that improve his or her management of emotions without self-harm. Help the client obtain the level of care needed to manage genuine risk of suicide or severe self - injury. This might include hospitalization, more intensive programming (e.g., intensive outp a\u00ad tient, partial hospitalization, residential treatment), or more frequent treatment sessions. The goal is to stabilize the client as quickly as possible, and then, if possible, begin to focus trea t\u00ad ment on developing coping strategies to manage self -injurious and other harmful impulses. Consult with other team members, supervisors, and, if necessary, legal experts to determine whether one's efforts with and conceptualiz ation of the self -harming client fit best practice guidelines. See, for example, Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) 42, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Co -Occurring Disorders (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment [CSAT], 2005c). Document such consultations and the decisions made as a result of them tho r\u00ad oughly and frequently. Help the client identify how substance use affects self- harm. In some cases, it can increase the behavior (e.g., alcohol disinhibits the client, who is then more likely to self-harm). In other cases, it can decrease the behavior (e.g., heroin evokes relaxation and, thus, can lessen the urge to self-harm). In either case, continue to help the client understand how abstinence from substances is necessary so that he or she can learn more adaptive coping. Work collaboratively with the client to develop a plan to create a sense of safety. Individuals are affected by trauma in different ways; therefore, safety or a safe environment may mean som e\u00ad thing entirely different from one person to the next. Allow the client to define what safety means to him or her. Counselors can also help the client prepare a safety card that the client can carry at all times. The card might include the counselor's contact information, a 24- hour crisis nu mber to call in emergen\u00ad cies, contact information for supportive individuals who can be contacted when needed, and, if a p\u00ad propriate, telephone numbers for emergency medical services. The counselor can discuss with the client the types of signs or crises that might warrant using the numbers on the card. Additionally, the counselor might check with the client from time to time to confirm that the information on the card is current. TIP 50, Addressing Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT, 2009a), has examples of safety agreements specifically for s uicidal clients and discusses their uses in m ore detail. There is no credible evidence that a safety agreement is effective in preventing a suicide a t\u00ad tempt or death. Safety agreements for clients with suicidal thoughts and behaviors should only be used as an adjunct support accompanying professional screening, assessment, and treatment for people with suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Keep in mind that safety plans or agreements may be percei ved by the trauma survivor as a means of controlling behavior, subsequently replicating or triggering previous traumatic experiences. All professionals\u2014and in some States, anyone \u2014could have ethical and legal responsibilities to those clients who pose an imminent danger to themselves or others. Clinicians should be aware of the pertinent State laws where they practice and the relevant Federal and professional regulations. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services 72 Part 1, Chapter 3\u2014 Understanding the Impact of Trauma However, as with self -harming behavior, self - destructive behavior needs to be recogn ized and addressed and may persist \u2014or worsen \u2014 without intervention. Consumption of substances Substance use often is initiated or increased after trauma. Clients in early recovery\u2014 especially those who develop PTSD or have it reactivated \u2014have a higher relapse risk if they experience a trauma. In the first 2 months after September 11, 2001, more than a quarterof New Yorker residents who smoked cig a\u00ad rettes, drank alcohol, or used marijuana (about 265,000 people ) increased their consumption. The increases continued 6 months after the attacks (Vlahov, Galea, Ahern, Resnick, &Kilpatrick, 2004). A study by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Admi n\u00ad istration (SAMHSA , Office of Applied Studies , 2002) used National Survey on Drug Use and Health data to compare the first three quarters of 2001 with the last quarter and r e\u00ad ported an increase in the prevalence rate foralcohol use among people 18 or older in the New York m etropolitan area during the fourth quarte r. Interviews with New York City residents whowere current or former cocaine or heroin users indicated that many who had been clean for 6months or less relapsed after September 11,2001. Others , who lost their income and could no longer support their habit, enrolled in methadone programs (Weiss et al., 2002). After the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995,Oklahomans reported double the normal rate of alcohol use, smoking more cigarettes, and ahigher incidence of initiating smoking months and even years after the bombing (Smith, Christiansen, Vincent, & Hann, 1999). Self-medication Khantzian 's self -medication theory (1985) suggests that drugs of abuse are selected for their specific effects. However, no definitive pattern has yet emerged of the use of partic u\u00ad lar substances in relation to PTSD or trauma symptoms. Use of substances can vary basedon a variety of factors, including which trauma symptoms are most prominent for an individ\u00ad ual and the individual 's access to particular substances. Unresolved traumas sometimes lurk behind the emotions that clients cannot allow themselves to experience. Substance use and abuse in trauma survivors can be a way toself-medicate and thereby avoid or displace difficult emotions associated with traumatic experiences. When the substances are wit h\u00ad drawn, the survivor may use other behaviors toself-soothe, self -medicate, or avoid emotions. As likely, emotions can appear after abstinence in the form of anxiety and depression. Avoidance Avoidance often coincides with anxiety and the promotion of anxiety symptoms . Individ u\u00ad als begin to avoid people, places, or situations to alleviate unpleasant emotions, memories, orcircumstances. Initially, the avoidance works,but over time, anxiety increases and the per\u00ad ception that the situation is unbearable ordangerous increases as well, leading to a grea t\u00ad er need to avoid. Avoidance can be adaptive,but it is also a behavioral pattern that reinforcesperceived danger without testing its validity, and it typically leads to greater problems across major life areas (e.g., avoiding emotio n\u00ad ally oriented conversations in an intimate rela\u00adtionship). For many individuals who havetraumatic stress reactions, avoidan ce is co m\u00ad monplace. A person may drive 5 miles longer to avoid the road where he or she had an acc i\u00ad dent. Another individual may avoid crowded places in fear of an assault or to circumventstrong emotional memories about an earlierassault that took place in a crowded area. Avoidance can come in many forms. Whenpeople can 't tolerate strong affects associated with traumatic memories, they avoid, project, 73 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services deny, or distort their trauma -related emotional and cognitive experiences. A key ingredient in trauma reco very is learning to manage triggers, memories, and emotions without avoidance \u2014 in essence, becoming desensitized to traumaticmemories and associated symptoms. Social/Interpersonal A key ingredient in the early stage of TIC is to establish, confirm, or reestablish a support system, including culturally appropriate activ i\u00ad ties, as soon as possible. Social supports andrelationships can be protective factor s against traumatic stress. However, trauma typically affects relationships significantly, regardless of whether the trauma is interpersonal or is of some other type. Relationships require emo\u00adtional exchanges, which means that others who have close relationships or friendships with the individual who survived the trauma(s)are often affected as well \u2014either through se c\u00ad ondary traumatization or by directly exper i\u00ad encing the survivor 's traumatic stress reactions. In natural disasters, social and community supports can be abruptly eroded and difficultto rebuild after the initial disaster relief efforts have wane d. Survivors may readily rely on family members,friends, or other social supports \u2014or they may avoid support , either because they believe that no one will be understanding or trustworthy or because they perceive their own needs as a burden to others . Survivors who have strong emotional or physical reactions, includingoutbursts during nightmares, may pull away further in fear of being unable to predict their own reactions or to protect their own safety and that of others. Often, trauma survivors feel asham ed of their stress reactions, which further hampers their ability to use their sup\u00adport system s and resources adequately. Many survivors of childhood abuse and inter\u00ad personal violence have experienced a signif i\u00adcant sense of betrayal. They have often en\u00ad countered trauma at the hands of trusted car e\u00ad givers and family members or throughsignificant relationships. This history of b e\u00ad trayal can disrupt forming or relying on sup\u00adportive relationships in recovery, such as peer supports and counseling. Although t his fear of trusting others is protective, it can lead to di f\u00ad ficulty in connecting with others and greatervigilance in observing the behaviors of others,including behavioral health service providers.It is exceptionally difficult to override the feel\u00ading that someone is going to hurt you, take advantage of you, or, minimally, disappointyou. Early betrayal can affect one's ability todevelop attachments, yet the formation ofsupportive relationships is an important ant i\u00ad dote in the recovery from traumatic s tress. Developmental Each age group is vulnerable in unique ways to the stresses of a disaster, with children andthe elderly at greatest risk. Young childrenmay display generalized fear, nightmares,heightened arousal and confusion, and physi\u00adcal symptoms, (e.g., stomachaches , head\u00ad aches). School -age children may exhibit symptoms such as aggressive behavior andanger, regression to behavior seen at youngerages, repetitious traumatic play, loss of ability to concentrate, and worse school performance. Adole scents may display depression and social withdrawal, rebellion, increased risky activities such as sexual acting out, wish for revenge andaction -oriented responses to trauma, and sleep and eating disturbances (Hamblen, 2001).Adults may display sleep problems, increasedagitation, hypervigilance, isolation or wit h\u00ad drawal, and increased use of alcohol or drugs.Older adults may exhibit increased withdrawal and isolation, reluctance to leave home, wor s\u00ad ening of chronic illnesses, confusion, & Nordboe , 2000b ). Like PTS D, the symptoms can be misdia g\u00ad nosed as depression, anxiety, or another men\u00ad tal illness. Likewise, clients who have experienced trauma may link some of their symptoms to their trauma and diagnose the m\u00ad selves as having PTSD, even though they do not meet all cr iteria for that disorder. Combat Stress Reaction A phenomenon unique to war, and one that counselors need to understand well, is combat stress reaction (CSR). CSR is an acute anxiety reaction occurring during or shortly after pa r\u00ad ticipating in military con flicts and wars as well as other operations within the war zone, known as the theater. CSR is not a formal diagnosis , nor is it included in the DSM -5 (APA, 20 13a). It is similar to acute stress Neurobiological Development: Consequences of Early Childhood Trauma Findings in developmental psychobiology suggest that the consequences of early maltreatment pr o\u00ad duce enduring negative effects on brain development (DeBell is, 2002; Liu, Diorio, Day, Francis, & Meaney, 2000; Teicher, 2002). Research suggests that the first stage in a cascade of events pr o\u00ad duced by early trauma and/or maltreatment involves the disruption of chemicals that function as neurotransmitters (e.g., cortisol, norepinephrine, dopamine), causing 2008; Teicher, 2002). These chemical responses can then negatively affect critical neural growth during specific sensitive periods of childhood development and can even lead to cell death. Adverse brain development can also result from elevated levels of cortisol and catecholamines by contributing to maturational failures in other brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex (Meaney, Brake, & Gratton, 2002). Heim, Mletzko et al. (2008) found that the neuropeptide oxytocin \u2014 important for social affiliation and support, attachment, trust, and management of stress and anxi e\u00ad ty\u2014was markedl y decreased in the cerebrospinal fluid of women who had been exposed to child\u00ad hood maltreatment, particularly those who had experienced emotional abuse. The more childhood traumas a person had experienced, and the longer their duration, the lower that perso n's current level of oxytocin was likely to be and the higher her rating of current anxiety was likely to be. Using data from the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study, an analysis by Anda, Felitti, Brown et al. (2006) confirmed that the risk of negative outcomes in affective, somatic, substance abuse, memory, sexual, and aggression- related domains increased as scores on a measure of eight ACEs increased. The researchers concluded that the association of study scores with these outcomes can serve as a theore tical parallel for the effects of cumulative exposure to stress on the developing brain and for the resulting impairment seen in multiple brain structures and functions. The National Child Traumatic Stress Network (http://www.nctsn.org) offers information about chil d\u00ad hood abuse, stress, and physiological responses of children who are traumatized. Materials are avai l\u00ad able for counselors, educators, parents, and caregivers. There are special sections on the needs of children in military families and on the imp act of natural disasters on children's mental health. Part 1, Chapter 3\u2014 U nderstanding the Impact of Trauma Subthreshold Trauma - Related Symptoms Many trauma survivors experience symptoms that, although they do not meet the diagnostic criteria for ASD or PTSD, nonetheless limittheir ability to function normal ly (e.g., reg u\u00ad late emotional states , maintain steady and rewarding social and family relationships,function competently at a job, maintain a steady pattern of abstinence in recovery).These symptoms can be transient, only arisingin a specific context; in termittent, appearing for several weeks or months and then reced\u00ading; or a part of the individual 's regular pattern of functioning (but not to the level of DSM -5 diagnostic criteria). Often , these patterns are termed \"subthreshold \" trauma symptoms. 75 Case Illustration: Frank Frank is a 36-year- old man who was severely beaten in a fight outside a bar. He had multiple injuries, including broken bones, a concussion, and a stab wound in his lower abdomen. He was hospitalized for 3.5 weeks and was unable to return to work, thus losing his job as a warehouse forklift operator. For several years, when faced with situations in which he perceived himself as helpless and over\u00ad whelmed, Frank reacted with violent anger that, to others, appeared grossly out of proportion to the situation. He has not had a drink in almost 3 years, but the bouts of anger persist and occur three to five times a year. They leave Frank feeling even more isolated from others and alienated from those who love him. He reports that he cannot watch certain television shows that depict violent anger; he has to stop watching when such scenes occur. He sometimes daydreams about getting revenge on the people who assaulted him. Psychiatric and neurological evaluations do not reveal a cause for Frank's anger attacks. Other t han these symptoms, Frank has progressed well in his abstinence from alcohol. He attends a support group regularly, has acquired friends who are also abstinent, and has reconciled with his family of origin. His marriage is more stable, although the episodes of rage limit his wife's willingness to co m\u00ad mit fully to the relationship. In recounting the traumatic event in counseling, Frank acknowledges that he thought he was going to die as a result of the fight, especially when he realized he had been stabbed. A s he described his experience, he began to become very anxious, and the counselor ob\u00ad served the rage beginning to appear. After his initial evaluation, Frank was referred to an outpatient program that provided trauma -specific interventions to address his su bthreshold trauma symptoms. With a combination of cognitive - behavioral counseling, EMDR, and anger management techniques, he saw a gradual decrease in symptoms when he recalled the assault. He started having more control of his anger when memories of the trauma emerged. Today, when feeling trapped, helpless, or overwhelmed, Frank has r e\u00ad sources for coping and does not allow his anger to interfere with his marriage or other relationships. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services reaction , except that the precipitating event or events affect military personnel (and civi l\u00ad ians exposed to the events) in an armed co n\u00ad flict situation. The terms \"combat stress reaction\" and \"posttraumatic stress injury\" are relatively new, and the intent of using these new terms is to call attention to the unique experiences of combat -related stress as well as to decrease the shame that can be associated with seeking behavioral health services for PTSD (for more information on veterans and combat stress reactions, see the planned TIP, Reintegration -Related Behavioral Health Issues for Veterans and Military Families ; SAMHSA, planned f). Although stress mobilizes an individual's physical and psychological resources to per\u00ad form more effectively in combat, reactions tothe stress may persist long after the actual danger has ended. As with other traumas, the nature of the event(s), the reactions of others,and the survivor 's psychological history and resources affect the likelihood and severity ofCSR. With combat veterans, this translates tothe number, intensity, and duration of t hreat factors; the social support of peers in the vet\u00ad erans' unit; the emotional and cognitive resili\u00ad ence of the service member s; and the quality of military leadership. CSR can vary from manageable and mild to debilitating and s e\u00ad vere. Common, less severe symptoms of CSRinclude tension, hypervigilance, sleep pro b\u00ad lems, anger, and difficulty concentrating. Ifleft untreated, CSR can lead to PTSD. Common causes of CSR are events such as a direct attack from insurgent small arms fire ora military convoy being hit by an improvised explosive device, but combat stressors enco m\u00ad pass a diverse array of traumatizing events,such as seeing grave injuries, watching others 76 Part 1, Chapter 3\u2014 Understanding the Impact of Trauma Advice to Counselors: Understanding the Nature of Combat Stress Several sources of information are available to help counselors deepen their understanding of co m\u00ad bat stress and postdeployment adjustment. Friedman (2006) explains how a prol onged combat -ready stance, which is adaptive in a war zone, becomes hypervigilance and overprotectiveness at home. He makes the point that the \"mutual interdependence, trust, and affection\" (p. 587) that are so nece s\u00ad sarily a part of a combat unit are diffe rent from relationships with family members and colleagues in a civilian workplace. This complicates the transition to civilian life. Wheels Down: Adjusting to Life After Deployment (Moore & Kennedy, 2011) provides practical advice for military service mem bers, inclu d\u00ad ing inactive or active duty personnel and veterans, in transitioning from the theater to home. The following are just a few of the many resources and reports focused on combat -related psych o\u00ad logical and stress issues: Invisible Wounds of War: P sychological and Cognitive Injuries, Their Consequences, and Services to Assist Recovery (Tanielian & Jaycox, 2008) On Killing (Grossman, 1995), an indepth analysis of the psychological dynamics of combat Haunted by Combat (Paulson & Krippner, 2007), which contains specific chapters on Reserve and National Guard troops and female veterans Treating Young Veterans: Promoting Resilience Through Practice and Advocacy (Kelly, Howe - Barksdale, & Gitelson, 2011) die, and making on -the-spot decisions in a m\u00ad biguous co nditions (e.g., having to determine whether a vehicle speeding toward a military checkpoint contains insurgents with explosives or a family traveling to another area). Such circumstances can lead to combat stress. Mili\u00ad tary personnel also serve in noncombat posi\u00ad tions (e.g., healthcare and administrativeroles), and personnel filling these supportive roles can be exposed to combat situations by proximity or by witnessing their results. Specific Trauma -Related Psychological Disorders Part of the definition of trauma is that the individual responds with intense fear, help\u00adlessness, or horror. Beyond that, in both the short term and the long term, trauma co m\u00ad prises a range of reactions from normal (e.g., being unable to concentrate, feelin g sad, having trouble sleeping) to warranting a diagnosis of atrauma -related mental disorder. Most people who experience trauma have no long -lasting disabling effects; their coping skills and the support of those around them are sufficient tohelp them overcome their difficulties, and their ability to function on a daily basis overtime is unimpaired. For others, though, the symptoms of trauma are more severe and last longer . The most common diagnoses associa t\u00ad ed with trauma are PTSD and ASD , but trauma is also associated with the onset of other mental disorders \u2014particularly substance use disorders, mood disorders, various anxiety disorders, and personality disorders. Trauma also typically exacerbates symptoms of preex\u00ad isting disorders , and , for people who are pre\u00ad disposed to a mental disorder , trauma can precipitate its onset . Mental disorders can oc\u00ad cur almost simultaneously with trauma exp o\u00ad sure or manifest sometime thereafter. Acute Stress Disorder ASD represents a normal response to stress.Symptoms develop within 4 weeks of the trauma and can cause significant levels of dis\u00adtress. Most individuals who have acute stress reactions never develop further impairment orPTSD. Acute stress disorder is highly assoc i\u00ad ated with the experience of one specific tra u\u00ad ma ra ther than the experience of long -term exposure to chronic traumatic stress. Diagno s\u00ad tic criteria are presented in Exhibit 1.3-3. 77 Exhibit 1.3-3: DSM -5 Diagnostic Criteria for ASD A. Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violation in one (or more) of the following ways: 1. Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s). 2. Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others. 3. Learning that the event (s) occurred to a close family member or close friend. Note: In cases of actual or threatened death of a family member or friend, the event(s) must have been vi o\u00ad lent or accidental. 4. Experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the traumatic event(s) (e.g., first responders collecting human remains, police officers repeatedly exposed to d e\u00ad tails of child abuse). Note: This does not apply to exposure through electronic media, telev i\u00ad sion, movies, or pictures, unless this exposure is work related. B. Presence of nine (or more) of the following symptoms from any of the five categories of intr u\u00ad sion, negative mood, dissociation, avoidance, and arousal, beginning or worsening after the traumatic event(s) occurred: Intrusion Symptoms: 1. Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic event(s). Note: In children, repetitive play may occur in which themes or aspects of the traumatic event(s) are expressed. 2. Recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or affect of the dream are related to the event(s). Note: In children, there may be frightening dreams without recognizable content. 3. Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks), during which the individual feels or acts as if the traumatic event(s) were recurring. Such reactions may occur on a continuum, with the most extreme expression being a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings. Note: In children, trauma -specific reenactment may occur in play. 4. Intense or prolonged psychological distress or marked physiological reactions in response to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s). Negative Mood: 5. Persistent inability to experience positive emotions (e.g., inability to experience happiness, satisfaction, or loving feelings). Dissociative Symptoms: 6. An altered sense of the reality of one's surroundings or oneself (e.g., seeing oneself from a n\u00ad other's perspective, being in a daze, time slowing). 7. Inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event(s) (typically due to dissoci a\u00ad tive amnesia and not to other fa ctors, such as head injury, alcohol, or drugs). Avoidance Symptoms: 8. Efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s). 9. Efforts to avoid external reminders (e.g., people, places, conversations, activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associa t\u00ad ed with the traumatic event(s). Arousal Symptoms: 10. Sleep disturbance (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep, restless s leep). 11. Irritable behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no provocation), typically expressed as verbal or physical aggression toward people or objects. 12. Hypervigilance. 13. Problems with concentration. 14. Exaggerated startle response. (Continued on the next page.) Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services 78 Part 1, Chapter 3\u2014 Understanding the Impact of Trauma Exhibit 1.3-3: DSM -5 Diagnostic Criteria for ASD (continued) C. Duration of the disturbance (symptoms in Criterion B) is 3 days to 1 month after trauma exposure. Note: Symptoms typically begin immediately after the traum a, but persistence for at least 3 days and up to a month is needed to meet disorder criteria. D. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or oth\u00ad er important areas of functioning. E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., medication or alcohol) or another medical condition (e.g., mild traumatic brain injury) and is not better e x\u00ad plained by brief psychotic disorder. Source: APA, 20 13a, pp. 280- 281. The primary presentation of an individual with an acute stress reaction is often that of someone who appears overwhelmed by the traumatic experience. The need to talk aboutthe experience can lead the client to seem self - centered and unconcerned about the needs of others. He or she may need to describe, in repetitive detail, what happened, or may seem obsessed with trying to understand what ha p\u00ad pened in an effort to make sense of the exper i\u00ad ence. The client is often hypervigilant and avoid s circumstances that are reminders of the trauma. For instance, someone who was in aserious car crash in heavy traffic can becomeanxious and avoid riding in a car or driving intraffic for a finite time afterward. Partial am\u00adnesia for the trauma often acc ompanies ASD, and the individual may repetitively questionothers to fill in details. People with ASDsymptoms sometimes seek assurance from others that the event happened in the waythey remember, that they are not \"going crazy\"or \"losing it,\" and that they could not have prevented the event. The next case illustrationdemonstrates the time- limited nature of ASD. Differences between ASD and PTSD It is important to consider the differences b e\u00ad tween ASD and PTSD when forming a dia g\u00ad nostic impression. The primary difference is the amount of time the symptoms have beenpresent. ASD resolves 2 days to 4 weeks afteran event, whereas PTSD continues beyond the 4 -week period. The diagnosis of ASD can change to a diagnosis of PTSD if the cond i\u00ad tion is noted within the first 4 weeks after the event, but the symptoms persist past 4 weeks. ASD also differs from PTSD in that the ASD diagnosis requires 9 out of 14 symptoms from five categories , including intrusion, negative mood, dissociation, avoidance, and arousal . Thes e symptoms can occur at the time of the trauma or in the following month. Studies indicate that dissociation at the time of tra u\u00ad ma is a good predictor of subsequent PTSD,so the inclusion of dissociative symptoms makes it more likely that those who developASD will later be diagnosed with PTSD(Bryant & Harvey , 2000). Additionally, ASD is a transient disorder, meaning that it is pr e\u00ad sent in a person 's life for a relatively short time and then passes. In contrast, PTSD typically becomes a primary feature of a n individual 's life. Over a lengthy period, PTSD can have profound effects on clients' perceptions of safety, their sense of hope for the future, theirrelationships with others, their physical health, the appearance of psychiatric symptoms, andtheir patterns of substance use and abuse. There are common symptoms between PTSD and ASD, and untreated ASD is a possible predisposing factor to PTSD, but it is un\u00ad known whether most people with ASD are likely to develop PTSD. There is some su g\u00ad gestion that, as with PTSD, ASD is more 79 Case Illustration: Sheila Two months ago, Sheila, a 55- year- old married woman, experienced a tornado in her home town. In the previous year, she had addressed a long -time marijuana use problem with the help of a trea t\u00ad ment program and had been abstinent for about 6 months. Sheila was proud of her abstinence; it was something she wanted to continue. She regarded it as a mark of personal maturity; it improved her relationship with her husband, and their business had flourished as a result of her abstinence. During the tornado, an employee reported that Sheila had become very agitated and had grabbed her assistant to drag him under a large table for cover. Sheila repeatedly yelled to her assistant that they were going to die. Following the storm, Sheila could not remember certain details of her beha v\u00ad ior during t he event. Furthermore, Sheila said that after the storm, she felt numb, as if she was floa t\u00ad ing out of her body and could watch herself from the outside. She stated that nothing felt real and it was all like a dream. Following the tornado, Sheila experienced emotional numbness and detachment, even from people close to her, for about 2 weeks. The symptoms slowly decreased in intensity but still disrupted her life. Sheila reported experiencing disjointed or unconnected images and dreams of the storm that made no real sense to her. She was unwilling to return to the building where she had been during the storm, despite having maintained a business at this location for 15 years. In addition, she began smoking marijuana again because it helped her sleep. She had been very irritable and had unchara c\u00ad teristic angry outbursts toward her husband, children, and other family members. As a result of her earlier contact with a treatment program, Sheila returned to that program and engaged in psychoeducational, supportive counseling focused on her acute stress reaction. She r e\u00ad gained abstinence from marijuana and returned shortly to a normal level of functioning. Her symp\u00ad toms slowly diminished over a period of 3 weeks. With the help of her counselor, she came to understand the link between the trauma and her relapse, regained support from her spouse, and again felt in control of her life. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services prevalent in women than in men (Bryant & Harvey , 2003). However, many people with PTSD do not have a diagnosis or recall a hist o\u00ad ry of acute stress symptoms before seeking treatment for or receiving a diagnosis of PTSD. Effective interventions for ASD can signif i\u00ad cantly reduce the possibility of the subsequent development of PTSD. Effective treatment ofASD can also reduce the incidence of oth er co-occurring problems, such as depression, anxiety, dissociative disorders, and compulsive behaviors (Bryant & Harvey, 2000). Interve n\u00ad tion for ASD also helps the individual developcoping skills that can effectively prevent the recurrence of ASD after l ater traumas. Although predictive science for ASD andPTSD will continue to evolve, both disorders are associated with increased substance use and mental disorders and increased risk of relapse; therefore, effective screening for ASDand PTSD is important for all clients with these disorders. Individuals in early recovery\u2014lacking well- practiced coping skills, lacking environmental supports, and already operatingat high levels of anxiety \u2014are particularly su s\u00ad ceptible to ASD. Events that would not no r\u00ad mally be disabling can produce symptoms ofintense helplessness and fear, numbing anddepersonalization, disabling anxiety, and aninability to handle normal life events. Counse\u00adlors should be able to recognize ASD andtreat it rather than attributing the symptomsto a client 's lack of motivation to change, b e\u00ad ing \"dry drunk \" (for those in substance abuse recovery), or being manipulative. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder The trauma -related disorder that receives the greatest attention is PTSD ; it is the most 80 Part 1, Chapter 3\u2014 Understanding the Impact of Trauma Case Illustration: Michael Michael is a 62 -year- old Vietnam veteran. He is a divorced father of two children and has four grand\u00ad children. Both of his parents were dependent on alcohol. He describes his childhood as isolated. His father physically and psychologically abused him (e.g., he was beaten with a switch until he had welts on his legs, back, and buttocks). By age 10, his parents regarded him as incorrigible and sent him to a reformatory school for 6 months. By age 15, he was using marijuana, hallucinogens, and alcohol and was frequently truant from school. At age 19, Michael was drafted and sent to Vietnam, where he witnessed the deaths of six American military personnel. In one incident, the soldier he was next to in a bunker was shot. Michael felt hel p\u00ad less as he talked to this soldier, who was still conscious. In Vietnam, Michael increased his use of both alcohol and marijuana. On his return to the United States, Michael continued to drink and use mar i\u00ad juana. He reenlisted in the military for another tour of duty. His life sta bilized in his early 30s, as he had a steady job, supportive friends, and a relatively stable family life. However, he divorced in his late 30s. Shortly thereafter, he married a second time, but that marriage ended in divorce as well. He was chronically an xious and depressed and had insomnia and frequent nightmares. He periodically binged on alcohol. He complained of feeling empty, had suicidal ideation, and frequently stated that he lacked purpose in his life. In the 1 980s, Michael received several years of mental health treatment for dysthymia. He was hospita l\u00ad ized twice and received 1 year of outpatient psychotherapy. In the mid -1990s, he r eturned to outp a\u00ad tient treatment for similar symptoms and was diagnosed with PTSD and dysthymia. He no longer used marijuana and rarely drank. He reported that he didn't like how alcohol or other substances made him feel anymore \u2014he felt out of control with his emotions when he used them. Michael reported sym p\u00ad toms of hyperarousal, intrusion (intrusive memories, nightmares, and preoccupying thoughts about Vietnam), and avoidance (isolating himself from others and feeling \"numb\"). He reported that these symptoms seemed to relate to his childhood abuse and his experiences in V ietnam. In treatment, he expressed relief that he now understood the connection between his symptoms and his history. commonly diagnosed trauma -related diso r\u00ad der, and its symptoms can be quite debilita t\u00ad ing over time. Nonetheless, it is important to remember that PTSD symptoms are repre\u00ad sented in a number of other mental illnesses, including major depressive disorder (MDD) , anxiety disorders, and psychotic disorders (Foaet al., 2006). The DSM -5 (APA, 2013a) identifies four symptom clusters for PTSD: presence of intrusion symptoms, persistent avoidance of stimuli, negative al terations in cognitions and mood, and marked alterations in arousal and reactivity . Individuals must have been exposed to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence, andthe symptoms must prod uce significant dis\u00ad tress and impairment for more than 4 weeks (Exhibit 1.3-4). Certain characteristics make people more su s\u00ad ceptible to PTSD, including one's unique per\u00adsonal vulnerabilities at the time of the traumatic exposure, the support (or lack ofsupport) received from others at the time of the trauma and at the onset of trauma -related symptoms, and the way others in the person's environment gauge the nature of the traumaticevent (Brewin, Andrews, & Valentine, 2000). People with PTSD often present va rying cli n\u00ad ical profiles and histories. They can experience symptoms that are activated by environmental triggers and then recede for a period of time. Some people with PTSD who show mostly psychiatric symptoms (particularly depressionand anxiety) are misdiagnosed and go untrea t\u00ad ed for their primary condition. For many pe o\u00ad ple, the trauma experience and diag nosis 81 Exhibit 1.3 -4: DSM -5 Diagnostic Criteria for PTSD Note: The following criteria apply to adults, adolescents, and children older than 6 years. For chi l\u00ad dren 6 years and younger, see the DSM -5 section titled \"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder for Children 6 Years and Younger\" (APA, 2013a). A. Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence in one (or more) of the following ways: 1. Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s). 2. Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others. 3. Learning that the traumatic event(s) occurred to a close family member or close friend. In cases of actual or threatened death of a family member or friend, the event(s) must have been violent or accidental. 4. Experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the traumatic event(s) (e.g., first responders collecting human remains; police officers repeatedly exposed to d e\u00ad tails of ch ild abuse). Note : Criterion A4 does not apply to exposure through electronic m e\u00ad dia, television, movies, or pictures, unless this exposure is work related. B. Presence of one (or more) of the following intrusion symptoms associated with the traumatic event(s) , beginning after the traumatic event(s) occurred: 1. Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic event(s). Note : In children older than 6 years, repetitive play may occur in which themes or aspects of the traumatic event(s) are expressed. 2. Recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or affect of the dream are related to the traumatic event(s). Note: In children, there may be frightening dreams without reco g\u00ad nizable content. 3. Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the individual feels or acts as if the traumatic event(s) were recurring. (Such reactions may occur on a continuum, with the most extreme expression being a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings.) Note: In children, trauma -specific reenactment may occur in play. 4. Intense or prolonged psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s). 5. Marked physiological reactions to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s). C. Persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning after the tra u\u00ad matic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by one or both of the following: 1. Avoidance of or efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s). 2. Avoidance of or efforts to avoid external reminders (people, places, conversations, activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s). D. Negative alterations in cognitions and mood associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning or worsening after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by two (or more) of the following: 1. Inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event(s) (typically due to di s\u00ad sociative amnesia, and not to other factors such as head injury, alcohol, or drugs). 2. Persistent and exaggerated negative beliefs or expectations about oneself, others , or the world (e.g., \"I am bad,\" \"No one can be trusted,\" \"The world is completely dangerous,\" \"My whole nervous system is permanently ruined\"). 3. Persistent, distorted cognitions about the cause or consequences of the traumatic event(s) that lead the individual to blame himself/herself or others. 4. Persistent negative emotional state (e.g., fear, horror, anger, guilt, or shame). 5. Markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities. 6. Feelings of detachment or estrangement from others. 7. Persistent inability to experience positive emotions (e.g., inability to experience happ i\u00ad ness, satisfaction, or loving feelings). (Continued on the next page.) Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services 82 Posttraumatic stress disorder: Timing of symptoms Although symptoms of PTSD usually b egin within 3 months of a trauma in adulthood, there can be a delay of months or even years before symptoms appear for some people. Some people may have minimal symptoms after a trauma but then experience a crisis later in life. Trauma symptoms can appear suddenly, even without conscious memory of the original trauma or without any overt provocation. Su r\u00ad vivors of abuse in childhood can have a delayed response triggered by something that happens to them as adults. For example, seeing a movie about child abuse can trigger symptoms related are obscured by co -occurring substance use disorder symptoms. The important feature of PTSD is that the disorder becomes an orien t\u00ad ing feature of the individual 's life. How well the person can work, with whom he or she associates, the nature of close and intimate relationships, the ability to have fun and reju\u00advenate, and t he way in which an individual goes about confronting and solving problems in life are all affected by the client 's trauma experiences and his or her struggle to recover. Part 1, Chapter 3\u2014 Understanding the Impact of Trauma Exhibit 1.3 -4: DSM -5 Diagnostic Criteria for PTSD (continued) E. Marked alterations in arousal and reactivity associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning or worsening after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by two (or more) of the following: 1. Irritable behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no provocation), typically expressed as verbal or physical aggression toward people or objects. 2. Reckless or self -destructive behavior. 3. Hypervigilance. 4. Exaggerated startle response. 5. Problems with concentration. 6. Sleep disturbance (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep or restless sleep). F. Duration of the disturbance (Criteria B, C, D and E) is more than 1 month. G. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. H. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., medication, alcohol) or another medical condition. Specify whether: With dissociative symptoms : The individual's symptoms meet the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder, and in a ddition, in response to the stressor, the individual experiences persistent or recurrent symptoms of either of the following: 1. Depersonalization: Persistent or recurrent experiences of feeling detached from, and as if one were an outside observer of, one's mental processes or body (e.g., feeling as though one were in a dream; feeling a sense of unreality of self or body or of time moving slowly). 2. Derealization: Persistent or recurrent experiences of unreality of surroundings (e.g., the world around the individual is experienced as unreal, dreamlike, distant, or distorted). Note : To use this subtype, the dissociative symptoms must not be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts, behavior during alcohol intoxication) or another med\u00ad ical condition (e.g., complex partial seizures). Specify whether: With delayed expression: If the full diagnostic criteria are not met until at least 6 months after the event (although the onset and expression of some symptoms may be immediate).

Discuss their initial recall or first suspicion that they were having a traumatic response. Become educated on delayed trauma responses. Draw a connection between the trauma and presenting trauma -related symptoms. Create a safe environment. Explore their support system s and fortify them as needed. Understand that triggers can precede traumatic stress reac tions, including delayed responses to trauma. Identify their triggers. Develop coping strategies to navigate and manage symptoms. Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services to the trauma. Other triggers include retur n\u00ad ing to the scene of the trauma, being reminded of it in some other way, or noting the anniver\u00adsary of an event. Likewise, combat veterans and survivors of community -wide disasters may seem to be coping well shortly after atrauma, only to have symptoms emerge laterwhen their life situations seem to have stab i\u00ad lized. Some clients in substance abuse recovery only begin to experience trauma symptoms when they maintain abstinence for so me time. As individuals decrease tension -reducing or self-medicating behaviors, trauma memories and symptoms can emerge. Culture and posttraumatic stress Although research is limited across cultures,PTSD has been observed in Southeast Asian,South American, Middle Eastern, and NativeAmerican sur vivors (Osterman & de Jong, 2007; Wilson & Tang, 2007). As Stamm andFriedman (2000) point out, however, simply observing PTSD does not mean that it is the\"best conceptual tool for characterizing pos t- traumatic distress among non -Western ind i\u00ad viduals\" (p. 7 3). In fact, many trauma -related symptoms from other cultures do not fit the DSM -5 criteria. These include somatic and psychological symptoms and beliefs about the origins and nature of traumatic events . More\u00ad over, religious and spiritual beliefs can affect how a survivor experiences a traumatic event and whether he or she reports the distress. For example, in societies where attitudes towardkarma and the glorification of war veterans arepredominant, it is harder for war veterans to come forward and disclose that they are emo\u00adtionally overwhelmed or struggling. It wouldbe perceived as inappropriate and possibly demoralizing to focus on the emotional di s\u00ad tress that he or she still bears. (For a review ofcultural competence in treating trauma, refer to Brown, 2008.) Methods for measuring PTSD are also cultur\u00ad ally specific. As part of a project begun in1972, the World Health Organization(WHO) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) embarked on a joint st udy to test the cross -cultural applicability of classification systems for various diagnoses. WHO andNIH identified apparently universal factors ofpsychological disorders and developed specificinstruments to measure them. These instr u\u00ad ments, the Composit e International Diagno s\u00ad tic Interview and the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry, include cer\u00adtain criteria from t he DSM (Fourth Edition, Text R evision; APA, 2000 a) as well as criteria from the International Statistical Classific a\u00ad tion of Di seases and Related lems, 10th revision (ICD -10; Exhibit 1.3-5). 84 Part 1, Chapter 3\u2014 Understanding the Impact of Trauma Exhibit 1.3 -5: ICD -10 Diagnostic Criteria for PTSD A. The patient must have been exposed to a stressful event or situation (either brief or long -lasting) of exceptionally threatening or catastrophic nature, which would be likely to cause pervasive di s\u00ad tress in almost anyone. B. There must be persistent remembering or \"reliving\" of the stressor in intrusive \"flashbacks,\" vivid memories, or recurring dreams, or in experiencing di stress when exposed to circumstances r e\u00ad sembling or associated with the stressor. C. The patient must exhibit an actual or preferred avoidance of circumstances resembling or assoc i\u00ad ated with the stressor, which was not present before exposure to the stressor. D. Either of the following must be present: 1. Inability to recall, either partially or completely, some important aspects of the period of e x\u00ad posure to the stressor. 2. Persistent symptoms of increased psychological sensitivity and arousal (not present before exposu re to the stressor), shown by any two of the following: a. Difficulty in falling or staying asleep. b. Irritability or outbursts of anger. c. Difficulty in concentrating. d. Exaggerated startle response. E. Criteria B, C, and D must all be met within 6 months of the stressful event or at the end of a p e\u00ad riod of stress. (For some purposes, onset delayed more than 6 months can be included, but this should be clearly specified.) Source: WHO , 1992 . The term \" co -occurring disorders\" refers to cases when a person has one or more mental disorders as well as one or more substance use disorders (including sub - stance abuse). Co -occurring disorders are common among individuals who have a history of trauma and are seeking help. Complex trauma and complex traumatic stress When individuals experience multiple tra u\u00ad mas, prolonged and repeated trauma during childhood, or repetitive trauma in the context of significant interpersonal relationships, theirreactions to trauma have unique characteristics (Herman, 1992). This unique constellation of reactions, called complex traumatic stress, is not recognized diagnostically in the DSM -5, but theoretical discussions and research have begun to highlight the similarities and diffe r\u00ad ences in symptoms of posttraumatic stress versus complex traumatic stress (Courtois &Ford, 2009). Often, the symptoms generatedfrom complex trauma do not fully matchPTSD criteria and exceed the severity ofPTSD. Overall, literature reflects that PTSDcriteria or subthreshold symptoms do not fully account for the persistent and more impai ring clinical presentation of complex trauma. Even though c urrent research in the study of tra u\u00admatology is prolific, it is still in the early stages of development. The idea that there may be more diagnostic variations or subtypes is forthcoming, and this will likely pave the way for more client -matching interventions to better serve those individuals who have been repeatedly exposed to multiple, early child\u00adhood, and/or interpersonal traumas. Other Trauma -Related and Co-Occurring Disorders The symptoms of PTSD and other mental disorders overlap considerably; these disordersoften coexist and i nclude mood, anxiety, 85 Advice to Counselors: Universal Screening and Assessment Only pe ople specifically trained and licensed in mental health assessment should make diagnoses; trauma can result in complicated cases, and many symptoms can be present, whether or not they meet full diagnostic criteria for a specific disorder. Only a trained assessor can distinguish accurately among various sy mptoms and in the presence of co -occurring disorders. However, behavioral health professionals without specific assessment training can still serve an important role in screening for possible mental disorders using established screening tools (CSAT , 2005 c; see also Chapter 4 of this TIP). In agencies and clinics, it is critical to provide such screenings systematically \u2014for each client\u2014 as PTSD and other co -occurring disorders are typically underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. Many survivors with severe mental disorders function fairly well following trauma, including disasters, as long as essential services aren't interrupted. For others, additional mental health supports may be necessary. For more information, see Responding to the Needs of People With Serious and Persistent Mental Illness in Times of Major Disaster (Center for Mental Health Services, 1996). Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services substance use, and personality disord ers. Thus, it's common for trauma survivors to be under- diagnosed or misdiagnosed. If they have not been identified as trauma survivors, their psy\u00ad chological distress is often not associated with previous trauma , and/ or they are diagnosed with a disorder tha t marginally matches their presenting symptoms and psychological se\u00adquelae of trauma. The following sections pre\u00ad sent a brief overview of some mental disorders that can result from (or be worsened by)traumatic stress. PTSD is not the only dia g\u00ad nosis related to trauma nor its only psycholog\u00ad ical consequence; trauma can broadlyinfluence mental and physical health in clients who already have behavioral health disorders. People With Mental Disorders MDD is the most c ommon co- occurri ng di s\u00ad order in people who have experienced traumaand are diagnosed with PTSD. A well- established causal relationship exists between stressful events and depression, and a priorhistory of MDD is predictive of PTSD after exposure to major trauma (Foa et al., 2006). Co-occurrence is also li nked with greater i m\u00ad pairment and more severe symptoms of bothdisorders, and the person is less likely to exper i\u00ad ence remission of symptoms within 6 months . Generalized anxiety, obsessive-compulsive,and other anxiety disorders are also associated with PTSD. PTSD may exacerbate anxietydisorder symptoms, but it is also likely that preexisting anxiety symptoms and anxiety dis\u00ad orders increase vulnerability to PTSD. Preex\u00adisting anxiety primes survivors for greater hyperarou sal and distress. Other disorders, such as personality and somatization disorders,are also associated with trauma, but the hist o\u00ad ry of trauma is often overlooked as a signif i\u00ad cant factor or necessary target in treatment. The relationship between PTSD and o ther disorders is complex . More research is now examining the multiple potential pathways among PTSD and other disorders and how various sequences affect clinical presentation.TIP 42, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Co- Occurring Disorders (CSAT , 2005c ), is valuable in understanding the relationship ofsubstance use to other mental disorders. People With Substance Use Disorders There is clearly a correlation between trauma (including individual, group, or mass trauma) and substance use as well as the presence ofposttraumatic stress (and other trauma -related disorders) and substance use disorders. Alc o\u00ad hol and drug use can be, for some, an effort to 86 Part 1, Chapter 3\u2014 Understanding the Impact of Trauma Co-Occurring PTSD and Other Mental Disorders Individuals with PTSD often have at least one add itional diagnosis of a mental disorder. The presence of other disorders typically worsens and prolongs the course of PTSD and compl i\u00ad cates clinical assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. The most common co -occurring disorders, in addition to substance use disorders, include mood disorders, various anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and personality disorders. Exposure to early, severe, and chronic trauma is linked to more complex symptoms, including impulse control deficits, greater difficulty in emotional r egulation and establishing stable relation\u00ad ships, and disruptions in consciousness, memory, identity, and/or perception of the environment (Dom, De, Hulstijn, & Sabbe, 2007; Waldrop, Back, Verduin, & Brady, 2007). Certain diagnostic groups and at -risk popul ations (e.g., people with developmental disabilities, people who are homeless or incarcerated) are more susceptible to trauma exposure and to de\u00ad veloping PTSD if exposed but less likely to receive appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Given the prevalence of traumatic events in clients who present for substance abuse treatment, counselors should assess all clients for possible trauma -related disorders. manage traumatic stress and specific PTSD sy mptoms. Likewise, people with substance use disorders are at higher risk of developingPTSD than people who do not abuse sub\u00adstances. Counselors working with trauma sur\u00advivors or clients who have substance use disorders have to be particularly aware of the possibility of the other disorder arising. Timeframe: PTSD and the onset of substance use disorders Knowing whether substance abuse or PTSD came first informs whether a causal relatio n\u00ad ship exists, but learning this requires thoroughassessment of clients and access to complete data on PTSD; substance use, abuse, and d e\u00ad pendence; and the onset of each. Much cur\u00adrent research focuses solely on the age of onset of substance use (not abuse), so determiningcausal relationships can be difficult.The relationship between PTSD and sub\u00adstance use disorders is thought to be bidirec\u00adtional and cyclical: substance use increases trauma risk, and exposure to trauma escalates substance use to manage trauma -related symp toms. Three ot her causal pathways d e\u00ad scribed by Chilcoat and Breslau's seminal work (1998) further explain the relationship b e\u00ad tween PTSD and substance use disorders: 1. The \"self -medication\" hypothesis suggests that client s with PTSD use substances to manage PTSD symptoms (e.g., intrusive memories, physical arousal). Substances such as alcohol, cocaine, barbiturates, op i\u00ad oids, and amphetamines are frequently abused in attempts to relieve or numbemotional pain or to forget the event. 2. The \"high- risk\" hypothesis states that drug and alcohol use places people whouse substances in high -risk situations that increase their chances of being exposed to events that lead to PTSD. 3. The \"susceptibility\" hypothesis suggests that people who use substances are more susceptible to developin g PTSD after e x\u00ad posure to trauma than people who do not.Increased vulnerability may result from failure to develop effective stress manag e\u00ad ment strategies, changes in brain chemi s\u00ad try, or damage to neurophysiological systems due to extensive substance use. PTSD and substance abuse treatment PTSD can limit progress in substance abuse recovery, increase the potential for relapse, and complicate a client's ability to achieve success in various life areas. Each disorder can mask or hide the symptoms of the other, and both need 87 Case Illustration: Maria Maria is a 31-year- old woma n diagnosed with PTSD and alcohol dependence. From ages 8 to 12, she was sexually abused by an uncle. Maria never told anyone about the abuse for fear that she would not be believed. Her uncle remains close to the family, and Maria still sees him on certai n holidays. When she came in for treatment, she described her emotions and thoughts as out of control. Maria often experiences intrusive memories of the abuse, which at times can be vivid and unrelenting. She cannot predict when the thoughts will come; efforts to distract herself from them do not always work. She often drinks in response to these thoughts or his presence, as she has found that alcohol can dull her level of distress. Maria also has difficulty falling asleep and is often awakened by night\u00ad mare s. She does not usually remember the dreams, but she wakes up feeling frightened and alert and cannot go back to sleep. Maria tries to avoid family gatherings but often feels pressured to go. Whenever she sees her uncle, she feels intense panic and anger but says she can usually \"hold it together\" if she avoids him. A f\u00ad terward, however, she describes being overtaken by these feelings and unable to calm down. She also describes feeling physically ill and shaky. At these times, she often isolates herself, stays in her apartment, and drinks steadily for several days. Maria also reports distress pertaining to her relatio n\u00ad ship with her boyfriend. In the beginning of their relationship, she found him comforting and enjoyed his affection, but more recently , she has begun to feel anxious and unsettled around him. Maria tries to avoid sex with him, but she sometimes gives in for fear of losing the relationship. She finds it easi\u00ad er to have sex with him when she is drunk , but she often experiences strong feelings of dre ad and disgust reminiscent of her abuse. Maria feels guilty and confused about these feelings. Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services to be assessed and treated if the individual is to have a full recovery. There is a risk of misi n\u00ad terpreting trauma -related symptoms in sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment settings. For example,avoidance symptoms in an individual withPTSD can be misinterpreted as lack of mot i\u00ad vation or unwillingness to engage in substance abuse treatment ; a counselor 's efforts to a d\u00ad dress substance abuse -related behaviors in early recovery can likewise provoke an exa g\u00ad gerated response from a trauma survivor whohas profo und traumatic experiences of being trapped and controlled. Exhibit 1.3-6 lists important facts about PTSD and substance use disorders for counselors. Sleep, PTSD, and substance use Many people have trouble getting to sleepand/or staying asleep after a traumatic event ; consequently, some have a drink or two to help them fall asleep. Unfortunately, any in i\u00ad tially helpful effects are likely not only to wane quickly, but also to incur a negative reboundeffect. When someone uses a substance before going to bed, \"sleep becomes lighter and more easily disrupted ,\" and rapid eye movement sleep (REM) \"increases, with an associated increase in dreams and nightmares,\" as theeffects wear off (Auerbach, 2003, p. 1185). People with alcohol dependence report mult i\u00ad ple types of sleep disturbances over time, and it is not unusual for clients to report that they cannot fall asleep without first having a drink. Both REM and slow wave sleep are reduced in clients with alcohol dependence, which is also associated with an increase in the amount of time it takes before sleep occurs, decreasedoverall sleep time, more nightmares, a nd re\u00ad duced sleep efficiency. Sleep during withdra w\u00ad al is \"frequently marked by severe insomni a and sleep fragmentation...a loss of restful sleep and feelings of daytime fatigue. Nigh t\u00ad mares and vivid dreams are not uncommon \" (Auerbach, 2003, pp. 1185-1186). Confounding changes in the biology of sleep that occur in clients with PTSD and substance use disorders often add to the problems of 88 Part 1, Chapter 3\u2014 Understanding the Impact of Trauma Exhibit 1.3 -6: PTSD and Substance Use Disorders: Important Treatment Facts Profile Severity PTSD is one of the most common co -occurring mental disorders found in clients in substance abuse treatment (CSAT, 2005c). People in treatment for PTSD tend to abuse a wide range of substances, including opioids , co\u00ad caine, marijuana, alcohol, and prescription medications. People in treatment for PTSD and substance abuse have a more severe clinical profile than those with just one of these disorders. PTSD, with or without major depression, significant ly increases risk for suicidality (CSAT, 2009a). Gender Differences Rates of trauma -related disorders are high in men and women in substance abuse treatment . Women with PTSD and a substance use disorder most frequently experienced rape or wit nessed a killing or injury; men with both disorders typically witnessed a killing or injury or were the victim of sudden injury or accident (Cottler, Nishith, & Compton, 2001). Risk of Continued Cycle of Violence While under the influence of substances, a person is more vulnerable to traumatic events (e.g., automobile crashe s, assaults). Perpetrators of violent assault often are under the influence of substances or test positive for substances at the time of arrest. Treatment Complications It is important to recognize and help clients understand that becoming abstinent from sub \u00ad stances does not resolve PTSD; in fact, some PTSD symptoms become worse with absti nence for some people. Both disorders must be addressed in treatment. Treatment outcomes for clients with PTSD and a substance use disorder are worse than for clients with other co -occurring disorders or who only abuse substances (Brown, Read, & Kahler, 2003). recovery. S leep can fail to return to normal for months or even years after abstinence, and the persistence of sleep disruptions appears relatedto the likelihood of relapse. Of particular cli n\u00ad ical importance is the vicious cycle that can also begin during \"slips \"; relapse initially i m\u00ad proves sleep, but continued drinking leads to sleep disruption. This cycle of initial reduction of an unpl easant symptom, which only ends up exacerbating the process as a whole, cantake place for clients with PTSD as well as forclients with substance use disorders. There are effective cognitive-behavioral therapies andnonadd ictive pharmacological interventions for sleep difficulties. 89 IN THIS CHAPTER Screening and Assessment Barriers and Challenges to Trauma -Informed Screening and Assessment Cross -Cultural Screening and Assessment Choosing Instruments Trauma -Informed Screening andAssessment Concluding Note Screening to identify clients who have histories of trauma and experience trauma - related symptoms is a prevention strategy. Screening and4 Assessment Why screen universally for trauma in behavioral health services? E x\u00ad posure to trauma is common; in many surveys, more than half of r e\u00ad spondents report a history of trauma, and the rates are even higher among clients with mental or substance use disorders. Furthermore,behavioral health problems, including substance use and mental di s\u00ad orders, are more difficult to treat if trauma -related symptoms and disorders aren 't detected early and treated effectively (Part 3, Section 1, of this Treatment Improvement Protocol [TIP], available online, summarizes research on the prevalence of trauma and its relatio n\u00ad ship with other behavioral health problems). Not addressing traumatic stress symptoms, trauma -specific disor\u00ad ders, and other symptoms/disorders related to trauma can impede successful mental health and substance abuse treatment. Unreco g\u00ad nized, u naddressed trauma symptoms can lead to poor engagement in treatment, premature termination, greater risk for relapse of psy\u00adchological symptoms or substance use, and worse outcomes. Screening can also prevent misdiagnosis and inappropriate trea t\u00ad ment planning. People with histories of trauma often display symptoms that meet criteria for other disorders. Without screening, clients' trauma histories and related symptoms often go undetected, leading providers to direct services toward symptoms and disorders that may only partially explain clientpresentations and distress. Universal screening for trauma history and trauma - related symptoms can help behavioral health practi tioners identify individuals at risk of developing more pervasive and se\u00advere symptoms of traumatic stress.Screening, early identif icat ion, and inte r- vention serves as a prevention strategy. 91 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services Trauma -Informed Care Framework in Behavioral Health Services \u2014Screening and Assessment The chapter begins with a discussion of screening and assessment concepts, with a particular focus on trauma -informed scree n\u00ad ing. It then highlights specific factors that influence screening and assessment, includingtiming and environment. Barriers and cha l\u00ad lenges in providing trauma- informed scree n\u00ad ing are discussed, along with culturally specificscreening and assessment considerations andguidelines. Instrument selection, trauma - informed screening and a ssessment tools, and trauma -informed screening and assessment processes are reviewed as well. For a more research -oriented perspective on screening and assessment for traumatic stress disorders,please refer to the literature review provided inPart 3 of this TIP , which is available online. Screening and Assessment Screening The first two steps in screening are to deter\u00admine whether the person has a history oftrauma and whether he or she has trauma - related symptoms. Screening mainly obtainsanswers to \"yes\" or \"no\" questions: \"Has this client experienced a trauma in the past? \" and \"Does this client at this time warrant further assessment regarding trauma -related symp\u00ad toms? \" If someone acknowledges a trauma history, then further screening is necessary todetermine whether trauma -related symptoms are present. However, the presence of suchsymptoms does not necessarily say anythingabout their severity, nor does a positive screenindicate that a disorder actually exists. P ositive 92 Screening is often the first contact between the client and the treatment provider, and the client forms his or her first impression of treatment during this intake process. Thus, how screening is conducted can be as important as the actual information gathered, as it sets the tone of treatment and begins the relationship with the client. Part 1, Chapter 4\u2014 Screening and Assessment screen s only indicate that asses sment or fur\u00ad ther evaluation is warranted, and negative screen s do not necessarily mean that an ind i\u00ad vidual doesn 't have symptoms that warrant intervention. Screening procedures should always define the steps to take after a positive or negative scree ning. T hat is, the screening process e s\u00ad tablishes precisely how to score responses to screening tools or questions and clearly defines what constitutes a positive score (called a \"cut\u00ad off score \") for a particular potential problem. The screening procedures detail t he actions to take after a client scores in the positive range.Clinical supervision is helpful\u2014and som e\u00ad times necessary\u2014in judging how to proceed. Trauma -informed screening is an essential part of the intake evaluation and the treatment planning process, but it is not an end in itself. Screening processes can be developed thatallow staff without advanced degrees or grad u\u00ad ate-level training to conduct them, whereas assessments for trauma -related disorders r e\u00ad quire a mental health professional trained inassessment and evaluation processes. The most important domains to screen amongindividuals with trauma histor ies include: Trauma -related symptoms. Depressive or dissociative symptoms, sleepdisturbances, and intrusive experiences. Past and present mental disorders, includ\u00ading typically trauma -related disorders (e.g., mood disorders) . Severity or characteristics of a specifictrauma type (e.g., forms of interpersonal v i\u00ad olence, adverse childhood events, combat experiences). Substance abuse. Social support and coping styles. Availability of resources. Risks for self -harm, suicide, and violence. Health screenings. Assessment When a client screens positive for substance abuse, trauma -related symptoms, or mental disorders, the agency or counselor should fo l\u00ad low up with an assessment. A positive screen\u00ading calls for more action \u2014an assessment that determines and defines presenting struggles todevelop an appropriate treatment plan a nd to make an informed and collaborative decision about treatment placement. Assessment d e\u00ad termines the nature and extent of the client 's problems; it might require the client to r e\u00ad spond to written questions, or it could involve a clinical interview by a mental health or su b\u00ad stance abuse professional qualified to assess the client and arrive at a diagnosis. A clinicalassessment delves into a client 's past and cu r\u00ad rent experiences, psychosocial and cultural history, and assets and resources. Assessment protocols can require more than a single session to complete and should also use multiple avenues to obtain the necessary clin i\u00ad cal information , including self -assessment tools, past and present clinical and medical records, structured clinical interviews, assess\u00adment measures, and collateral informationfrom significant others, other behavioralhealth professionals, and agencies. Qualific a\u00ad tions for conducting assessments and clinical interviews are more rigorous than for screen\u00ading. Advanced degrees, licensing o r certifica\u00ad tion, and special training in administration, scoring, and interpretation of specific asses s\u00ad ment instruments and interviews are often 93 Advice to Counselors: Screening and Assessing Clients Ask all clients about any possible history of trauma; use a checklist to increase proper identific a\u00ad tion of such a history (see the online Adverse Childhood Experiences Study Score Calc ulator [http://acestudy.org/ace_score] for specific questions about adverse childhood experiences). Use only validated instruments for screening and assessment. Early in treatment, screen all clients who have histories of exposure to traumatic events for psy\u00ad chological symptoms and mental disorders related to trauma. When clients screen positive, also screen for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (see TIP 50, Ad\u00ad dressing Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Substance Abuse Treatment ; Center for Substance Abuse Tr eatment [CSAT], 2009a). Do not delay screening; do not wait for a period of abstinence or stabilization of symptoms. Be aware that some clients will not make the connection between trauma in their histories and their current patterns of behavior (e.g., alcohol and drug use and/or avoidant behavior). Do not require clients to describe emotionally overwhelming traumatic events in detail. Focus assessment on how trauma symptoms affect clients' current functioning. Consider using paper -and-pencil instrumen ts for screening and assessment as well as self -report measures when appropriate; they are less threatening for some clients than a clinical interview. Talk about how you will use the findings to plan the client's treatment, and discuss any immediate actio n necessary, such as arranging for interpersonal support, referrals to community agencies, or moving directly into the active phase of treatment. It is helpful to explore the strategies clients have used in the past that have worked to relieve strong emotions (Fallot & Harris, 2001). At the end of the session, make sure the client is grounded and safe before leaving the interview room (Litz, Miller, Ruef, & McTeague, 2002). Readiness to leave can be assessed by checking on the degree to which the client is c onscious of the current environment, what the client's plan is for maintaining personal safety, and what the client's plans are for the rest of the day. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services required. Counselors must be familiar with (and obtain) the level of training required forany instruments they consider using. For people with histories of traumatic life event s who screen positive for possible trauma - related symptoms and disorders, thorough assessment gathers all relevant info rmation necessary to understand the role of the trauma in their lives; a ppropriate treatment objectives, goals, planning , and placement; and a ny ong o\u00ad ing diagnostic and treatment considerations, including reevaluation or follow -up. Overall, assessment may indicate symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for a substanceuse or mental disorder or a milder form of symptomatology that doesn 't reach a diagno s\u00ad tic level\u2014or it may reveal that the posi tive screen was false and that there is no significant cause for concern . Information from an a s\u00ad sessment is used to plan the client 's treatment. The plan can include such domains as level ofcare, acute safety needs, diagnosis, disability,strengths and skills, support network, andcultural context. Assessments should reoccur throughout treatment. Ongoing assessmentduring treatment can provide valuable info r\u00ad mation by revealing further details of traumahistory as clients' trust in staff members grows and b y gauging clients ' progress. Timing of Screening and Assessment As a trauma -informed counselor, you need to offer psychoeducation and support from the outset of service provision; this begins with explaining screening and assessment and withproper pacing of the initial intake and evalu a\u00ad tion process. The client should understand the screening process, why the specific questions are important, and that he or she may choose to delay a response or to not answer a question 94 Conduct Assessments Throughout Treatment Ongoing assessments let counselors: Track changes in the presence, frequency, and intensity of symptoms. Learn the relationships among the client's trauma, pres enting psychological symp\u00ad toms, and substance abuse. Adjust diagnoses and treatment plans as needed. Select prevention strategies to avoid more pervasive traumatic stress symptoms. Part 1, Chapter 4\u2014 Screening and Assessment at all. Discussing the occurrence or conse\u00ad quences of traumatic events can feel as unsafe and dangerous to the client as if the event were reoccurring. It is importan t not to e n\u00ad courage avoidance of the topic or reinforce the belief that discussing trauma -related material is dangerous, but be sensitive when gathering information in the initial screening. Initialquestions about trauma should be general andgradual. Taking the time to prepare and ex\u00ad plain the screening and assessment process tothe client gives him or her a greater sense ofcontrol and safety over the assessment process. Clients with substance use disorders No screening or assessment of trauma shouldoccur when the client is under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Clients under the influence are more likely to give inaccurate information.Although it 's likely that clients in an active phase of use (albeit not at the assessment i t\u00ad self ) or undergoing substa nce withdrawal can provide consistent information to obtain a valid screening and assessment, there is insuf\u00adficient data to know for sure. Some theorists state that no final assessment of trauma or posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) should occur during t hese early phases (Read, Bollinger , & Sharkansky, 2003), asserting that symptoms of withdrawal can mimic PTSDand thus result in overdiagnosis of PTSD andother trauma -related disorders. Alcohol or drugs can also cause memory impairment thatclouds the cli ent's history of trauma symp\u00ad toms. However, Najavits (2004) and others note that underdiagnosis, not overdiagnosis, oftrauma and PTSD has been a significant issuein the substance abuse field and thus claim that it is essential to obtain an initial assess\u00ad ment early, which can later be modified if needed (e.g., if the client 's symptom pattern changes). Indeed, clinical observations suggestthat assessments for both trauma and PTSD \u2014 even during active use or withdrawal \u2014appear robust (Coffey, Schumacher, B rady, & Dansky, 2003). Although some PTSD symptoms andtrauma memories can be dampened or i n\u00ad creased to a degree, their overall presence orabsence, as assessed early in treatment, appears accurate (Najavits, 2004). The Setting for Trauma Screening and As sessment Advances in the development of simple, brief, and public -domain screening tools mean that at least a basic screening for trauma can bedone in almost any setting. Not only can cli\u00adents be screened and assessed in behavioral health treatment setting s; they can also be evaluated in the criminal justice system, ed u\u00ad cational settings, occupational settings, phys i\u00ad cians ' offices, hospital medical and trauma units, and emergency rooms. Wherever they occur, trauma -related screenings and subse\u00ad quent assessments can reduce or eliminate wasted resources, relapses, and, ultimately,treatment failures among clients who have histories of trauma, mental illness, and/or sub\u00adstance use disorders. Creating an effective screening and assessment environment You can greatly enhance the success of trea t\u00ad ment by paying careful attention to how you approach the screening and assessment pr o\u00ad cess. Take into account the following points: 95 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services Clarify for the client what to expect in thescreening and assessment process . For exa m\u00ad ple, tell the client that the screening and a s\u00ad sessment phase focuses on identifyingissues that might benefit from treatment.Inform him or her that during the traumascreening and assessment process, unco m\u00ad fortable thoughts and feelings can arise.Provide re assurance that, if they do, you 'll assist in dealing with this distress\u2014 but also let them know that, even with your assi s\u00ad tance, some psychological and physical r e\u00ad actions to the interview may last for a few hours or perhaps as long as a few days afterthe interview, and be sure to highlight thefact that such reactions are normal (Read et al., 2003). Approach the client in a matter -of-fact, yet supportive , manner . Such an approach helps create an atmosphere of trust, respect, acceptance, and thoughtfulness (Melnick & Bassuk, 2000). Doing so helps to normalize symptoms and experiences generated by the trauma; consider informing clients thatsuch events are common but can cause co n\u00ad tinued emotional distress if they are not treated. Clients may also find it helpful for you to explain the purpose of certain diff i\u00ad cult questions. For example, you could say, \"Many people have experienced troublingevents as children, so some of my questions are about whether you experienced any such events while growing up. \" Demo n\u00ad strate kindness and directness in equal measure when screening/assessing clients (Najavits, 2004). Respect the client 's personal space . Cultural and ethnic factors vary greatly regarding theappropriate physical distance to maintainduring the inter view. You should respect the client 's personal space, sitting neither too far from nor too close to the client; let yourobservations of the client 's comfort level during the screening and assessment pr o\u00ad cess guide the amount of distance. Clients with traum a may have particular sensitivity about their bod ies, personal space, and boundaries. Adjust tone and volume of speech to suit theclient 's level of engagement and degree of comfort in the interview process . Strive to maintain a soothing, quiet demeanor. Be sensitive to how the client might hear what you have to say in response to personal di s\u00ad closures. Clients who have been trauma\u00ad tized may be more reactive even to benign or well -intended questions. Provide culturally appropriate symbols ofsafety in the physical environment. These include paintings, posters, pottery, andother room decorations that symbolize the safety of the surroundings to the cl i\u00ad ent population. Avoid c ulturally inappr o\u00ad priate or insensitive items in the physical environment. Be aware of one's own emotional responses to hearing clients ' trauma histories . Hearing about clients' traumas may be very painful and can elicit strong emotions.The clientmay interpret your reaction to his or herrevelations as disinterest, disgust for the cl i\u00ad ent's behavior, or some other inaccurate i n\u00ad terpretation. It is important for you tomonitor your interactions and to check in with the client as necessary. You may alsofeel emotionally drained to the point that it interferes with your ability to accurately lis\u00ad ten to or assess clients.This effect of exp o\u00ad sure to traumatic stories, known as secondary traumatization, can result insymptoms similar to those experienced by the client (e.g., nightmares, emotional numbing) ; if necessary, refer to a colleague for assessment (Valent , 2002). Secondary traumatization is addressed in greater detailin Part 2, Chapter 2 , o f t h i s T I P. Overcome linguistic barriers via an inte r\u00ad preter. Deciding when to add an interpreter requires careful judgment.The interpretershould be knowledgeable of behavioral 96 Part 1, Chapter 4\u2014 Screening and Assessment health terminology, be familiar with the concepts and purposes of the interview and treatment programming, be unknown tothe client, and be part of the treatment team . Avoid a sking family members or friends of the client to serve as interpreters. Elicit only the information necessary for determining a history of trauma and thepossible existence and extent of traumaticstress symptoms and related disorders.There is no need to probe deeply into thedetails of a client 's trauma tic experiences at this stage in the treatment process. Giventhe lack of a therapeutic relationship inwhich to process the information safely,pursuing details of trauma can cause r e\u00ad traumatization or produce a level of r e\u00ad sponse that neither you nor your client is prepared to handle. Even if a client wants to tell his or her trauma story, it 's your job to serve as \"gatekeeper \" and preserve the client 's safety. Your tone of voice when sug\u00ad gesting postponement of a discussion oftrauma is very important . Avoid c onveying the message, \"I really don 't want to hear about it. \" Examples of appropriate stat e\u00ad ments are: \"Your life experiences are very i m\u00ad portant, but at this early point in ourwork together , we should start with what 's going on in your life currently rather than discussing past experiences in detail. If you feel that certain pastexperiences are having a b ig effect on your life now, it would be helpful for us to discuss them as long as we focus on your safety and recovery right now. \" \"Talking about you r past at this point could arouse intense feelings \u2014even more than you might be aware of rightnow. Later, if you choose to, you cantalk with your counselor about how towork on exploring your past. \" \"Often, people who have a history oftrauma want to move quickly into the details of the trauma to gain relief. I understand this desire, but my concernfor you at this moment is to help you establish a sense of safety and supportbefore moving into the traumatic exp e\u00ad riences. We want to avoid retraumat i\u00ad zation \u2014meaning, we want to establish resources that weren't available t o you at the time of the trauma before del v\u00ad ing into more content. \" Give the client as much personal control aspossible during the assessment by : Presenting a rationale for the interview and i ts stress -inducing potential, ma k\u00ad ing clear that the client has the right torefuse to answer any and all questions. Giving the client (where staffing per\u00admits) the option of being interviewedby someone of the gender with whichhe or she is most comfortabl e. Postponing the interview if necessary (Fallot & Harris, 2001). Use self -administered, written checklists rather than interviews when possible to a s\u00ad sess trauma . Traumas can evoke shame, guilt, anger, or other intense feelings that can make it difficult f or the client to report them aloud to an interviewer. Clients are more likely to report trauma when they use self-administered screening tools; however, these types of screening instruments only guide the next step. Interviews should coi n\u00ad cide with self -administered tools to create a sense of safety for the client (someone is present as he or she completes the screen\u00ading) and to follow up with more indepthdata gathering after a self -administered screening is complete. The Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ) is a self- administered tool (Green, 1996). It has been used successfully with clinical andnonclinical populations, including med i\u00ad cal patients, women who have exper i\u00ad enced domestic violence, and people withserious mental illnes s (Hooper , Stockton, 97 Exhibit 1.4 -1: Grounding Techniques Grounding techniques are important skills for assessors and all other behavioral health service pr o\u00ad viders who interact with traumatized clients (e.g., nurses, security, administrators, clinicians). Even if you do not directly conduct therapy, knowledge of grounding can help you defuse an escalating situation or calm a client who is triggered by the a ssessment process. Grounding strategies help a person who is overwhelmed by memories or strong emotions or is dissociating ; they help the person become aware of the here and now. A useful metaphor is the experience of walking out of a movie theater. When t he person dissociates or has a flashback, it's like watching a mental movie; g round\u00ad ing techniques help him or her step out of the movie theater into the daylight and the present env i\u00ad ronment. The client' s task is not only to hold on to moments from the past, but also to acknowledge that what he or she was experiencing is from the past. Try the following techniques: 1. Ask the client to state what he or she observe s. Guide the client through this exercise by using statements like, \"You seem to feel very scared/angry right now. You're probably feeling things related to what happened in the past. Now, you' re in a safe situation. Let's try to stay in the present. Take a slow deep breath, relax your shoulders, put your feet on the floor; let's talk about what day and time it is, notice what's on the wall, etc. What else can you do to feel okay in your body right now?\" 2. Help the client decrease the intensity of affect . \"Emotion dial\": A client imagines turning down the volume on his or her emotions. Clenching fists can move the energy of an emotion into fists, which the client can then r e\u00ad lease. Guided imagery can be used to visualize a safe place. Distraction (see #3 below). Use strengths- based questions (e.g., \"How did you survive?\" or \"What strengths did you possess to survive the trauma?\"). 3. Distract the client from unbearable emotional states . Have the client focus on the external environment (e.g., name red objects in the room). Ask the client to focus on recent and future events (e.g., \"to d o\" list for the day). Help the client use self- talk to remind himself or herself of current safety. Use distractions, such as counting, to return the focus to current reality. Somatosensory techniques (toe- wiggling , touching a chair) can remind clients of current reality. 4. Ask the client to use breathing techniques. Ask the client to inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth. Have the client place his or her hands on his or her abdomen and then watch the hands go up and down while the belly expands and contracts. Source: Melnick & Bassuk, 2000 . Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services Krupnick, & Green, 2011). Screen ing in\u00ad struments (including the THQ) are includ\u00ad ed in Appendix D of this TIP . Interview the client if he or she has trouble reading or writing or is otherwise unable to complete a checklist . Clients who are likely to minimize their trauma when using achecklist (e.g., those who exhibit significantsymptoms of dissociation or repression)benefit from a clinical interview. A trained interviewer can elicit information that a self-administered checklist does not ca p\u00ad ture. Overall, using both a self -administered questionnaire and an interview can helpachieve greater clarity and context. Allow time for the client to become calm and oriented to the present if he or she has very intense emotional res ponses when recalling or acknowledging a trauma . At such times, avoid responding with such exclamations as \"I don 't know how you survived that! \" (Bernstein, 2000). If the client has difficu l\u00ad ty self -soothing, guide him or her through grounding techniques (E xhibit 1.4-1), which are particularly useful \u2014perhaps even critical \u2014to achieving a successful 98 Part 1, Chapter 4\u2014 Screening and Assessment in terview when a client has dissociated or is experiencing intense feelings in response to screening and/or interview questions. Avoid phrases that imply judgment about the trauma . For example, don 't say to a cli\u00ad ent who survived Hurricane Katrina and lost family members, \"It was God 's will, \" or \"It was her time to pass, \" or \"It was meant to be. \" Do not make assumptions about what a person has experienced. R a\u00ad ther, li sten supportively without imposing personal views on the client 's experience. Provide feedback about the results of the screening . Keep in mind the client's vulner\u00ad ability, ability to access resources, strengths,and coping strategies. Present results in asynthesized manner, avoiding complicated,overly scientific jargon or explanations. A l\u00ad low time to process client reactions duringthe feedback session. Answer client ques\u00adtions and concerns in a direct, honest, and compassionate manner. Failure to deliverfeedback in this way can negatively affectclients' psychological status and severely weaken the potential for developing a ther\u00adapeutic alliance with the client. Be aware of the possible legal implicationsof assessment . Information you gather du r\u00ad ing the screening and assessment process can necessitate mandatory reporting to a u\u00ad thorities, even when the client does notwant such information disclosed (Najavits, 2004). For example, you can be required toreport a client 's experience of child abuse even if it happened many years ago or the client doesn 't want the information repor t\u00ad ed. Other legal issues can be quite co m\u00ad plex, such as confidentiality of records,pursuing a case against a trauma perpetr a\u00ad tor and divulging information to third par\u00adties while still protecting the legal status ofinformation used in prosecution, and childcustody issues (Najavits, 2004). It 's essen\u00ad tial that you know the laws in your State, have an expert legal consultant available,a nd access clinical supervision. Barriers and Challenges to Trauma -Informed Screening and Assessment Barriers It is not necessarily easy or obvious to identify an individual who has survived trauma wit h\u00ad out screening. Moreover, some clients may deny that they have encountered trauma andits effects even after being screened or askeddirect questions aimed at identifying the o c\u00ad currence of traumatic events. The two main barriers to the evaluation of trauma and its related disorders in behavioral health settings are clients not reporting trauma and providers overl ooking trauma and its effects. Concerning the first main barrier, some events will be experienced as traumatic by one personbut considered no ntraumatic by another. A history of trauma encompasses not only the experience of a potentially traumatic event, but also the person 's responses to it and the mea n\u00ad ings he or she attaches to the event. Certainsituations make it more likely that the clientwill not be forthcoming about traumaticevents or his or her responses to those events.Some clients might not ha ve ever thought of a particular event or their response to it as tra u\u00ad matic and thus might not report or even recall the event. Some clients might feel a reluctance to discuss something that they sense mightbring up uncomfortable feelings (especially with a counselor whom they 've only recently met). Clients may avoid openly discussing traumatic events or have difficulty recognizing or articulating their experience of trauma for other reasons, such as feelings of shame, guilt,or fear of retribution by other s associated with the event (e.g., in cases of interpersonal or 99 Common Reasons Why Some Providers Avoid Screening Clients for Trauma Treatment providers may avoid screening for traumatic events and trauma -related symptoms due to: A reluctance to inquire about traumatic events and symptoms because these questions are not a part of the counselor's or program's standard intake procedures. Underestimation of the impact of trauma on clients' physical and mental health. A belief that treatment of substance abuse issues needs to occur first and exclusively, before treating other behavioral health disorders. A belief that treatment should focus solely on presenting symptoms rather than exploring the potential origins or aggravators of sy mptoms. A lack of training and/or feelings of incompetence in effectively treating trauma -related problems (Salyers, Evans, Bond, & Meyer, 2004). Not knowing how to respond therapeutically to a client's report of trauma. Fear that a probing trauma inquiry will be too disturbing to clients. Not using common language with clients that will elicit a report of trauma (e.g., asking clients if they were abused as a child without describing what is meant by abuse). Concern that i f disorders are identified, clients will require treatment that the counselor or pr o\u00ad gram does not feel capable of providing (Fallot & Harris, 2001). Insufficient time for assessment to explore trauma histories or symptoms. Untreated trauma -related symptoms of the counselor, other staff members, and administrators. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services domestic violence). Still others may deny their history because they are tired of being inter\u00adviewed or asked to fill out forms and may b e\u00ad lieve it doesn 't matter anyway. A client may not report past trauma for many reasons, including: Concern for safety (e.g., fearing more abuse by a perpetrator for revealing the trauma). Fear of being judged by service providers. Shame about victimization. Reticence about talking with others in r e\u00ad sponse to trauma. Not recalling past trauma through dissoci a\u00ad tion, denial, or repression (although genuine blockage of all trauma memory is rare among trauma survivors; McNally, 2003). Lack of trust in others, including behavio r\u00ad al health service providers. Not seein g a significant event as traumatic. Regarding the second major barrier, counselors and other behavioral health service providers may lack awareness that trauma can signif i\u00ad cantly affect clients ' presentations in treatment and functioning across major life a reas, such as relationships and work. In addition, some counselors may believe that their role is to treat only the presenting psychological and/orsubstance abuse symptoms, and thus they may not be as sensitive to histories and effects of trauma. Other pr oviders may believe that a client should abstain from alcohol and drugs for an extended period before exploring tra u\u00ad ma symptoms. Perhaps you fear that addres s\u00ad ing a clients ' trauma history will only exacerbate symptoms and complicate trea t\u00ad ment. Behavioral h ealth service providers who hold biases may assume that a client doesn 't have a history of trauma and thus fail to askthe \"right \" questions, or the y may be unco m\u00ad fortable with emotions that arise from listen\u00ading to client experiences and, as a result,redirect the screening or counseling focus. Challenges Awareness of acculturation and language Acculturation levels can affect screening and assessment results.Therefore, indepth discus\u00adsions may be a more appropriate way to gain an understanding of trauma from the client 's point of view. During the intake, prior to trauma screening, determine the client 's history of 100 Common Assessment Myths Several com mon myths contribute to underas sessment of trauma -related disorders (Najavits, 2004): Myth #1: Substance abuse itself is a trauma. However devastating substance abuse is, it does not meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition (DSM -5; American Psychi atric Association [APA], 2013 a), criteria for trauma per se. Nevertheless, high-risk behaviors that are mo re likely to occur dur ing addic tion, such as interpersonal violence and self - harm, significantly increase the potential for traumatic injury. Myth #2: Assessment of trauma is enough. Thorough assessment is the best way to identify t he existence and extent of trauma -related problems. However, simply identifying trauma -related symptoms and disorders is just the first step. Also needed are individualized treatment protocols and action to implement these protocols. Myth #3: It is best to w ait until the client has ended sub stance use and withdrawal to assess for PTSD. Research does not provide a clear answer to the controversial question of when to as\u00ad sess for PTSD ; however, Najavits (2004) and others note that underdiagnosis of trauma and PTSD has been more significant in the substance abuse field than overdiagnosis. Clinical experience shows that the PTSD diagnosis is rather stable durin g substance use or withdrawal, but symptoms can become more or less intense; memory impairment from alcohol or drugs can also cloud the symptom picture. Thus, it is ad visable to establish a tentative diagnosis and then reassess after a period of abstinence, if possible. Part 1, Chapter 4\u2014 Screening and Assessment migration, if applicable, and primary language. Questions about the client 's country of birth, length of time in this country, events or reasons for migration, and ethnic self -identification are also appropriate at intake. Also be aware thateven individuals who speak English well mighthave t rouble understanding the subtleties of questions on standard screening and assessmenttools. It is not adequate to translate items simp\u00adly from English into another language; words,idioms, and examples often don 't translate d i\u00ad rectly into other languages an d therefore need to be adapted. Screening and assessment shouldbe conducted in the client 's preferred language by trained staff members who speak the la n\u00ad guage or by professional translators familiarwith treatment jargon. Awareness of co-occurring diagno ses A trauma -informed assessor looks for psych o\u00ad logical symptoms that are associated withtrauma or simply occur alongside it. Symptom screening involves questions about past orpresent mental disorder symptoms that may indicate the need for a full mental h ealth a s\u00ad sessment. A variety of screening tools are available, including symptom checklists. However, you should only use symptom checklists when you need information abouthow your client is currently feeling; don 't use them to screen for specific disorders. Responseswill likely change from one administration of the checklist to the next. Basic mental health screening tools are availa\u00adble. For example, the Mental Health ScreeningForm-III screens for present or past symptoms of most mental disorders (Carroll & McGinley,2001) ; it is available at no charge from Project Return Foundation, Inc . and is also reproduced in TIP 42, Substan ce Abuse Treatment for Per\u00ad sons With Co-Occurring Disorders (CSAT, 2005c). Other screening tools, such as the Beck Depression Inventory II and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck, Wright, Newman, & Liese,1993), also screen broadly for mental and sub\u00ad stance use disorders, as well as for specific di s\u00ad orders often associated with trauma . For further screening information and resources ondepression and suicide, see TIP 48, Managing Depressive Symptoms in Substance Abuse Clients During Early Recovery (CSAT, 2008), and TIP 50, Addressing Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT, 2009a). 101 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services For screening substance use disorders, see TIP 11, Simple Screening Instruments for Outreach for Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse and Infectious Diseases (CSAT, 1994); TIP 24, A Guide to Substance Abuse Services for Primary Care Cli\u00adnicians (CSAT, 1997a); TIP 31, Screening and Assessing Adolescents for Substance Use Disorders(CSAT, 1999c ); TIP 42, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Co -Occurring Di s\u00ad orders (CSAT, 2005c); and TIP 51, Substance Treatment: Addressing the Specific Needsof Women (CSAT , 2009d). A common dilemma in the assessment of trauma -related disorders is that certain trauma symptoms are also symptoms of other diso r\u00ad ders. Clients with histories of trauma typically present a variety of symptoms; thus, it is im\u00ad portant to determine the full scope of symp\u00ad toms and/or disorders present to help improve treatment planning. Clients with trauma - related and substance use symptoms and di s\u00ad orders are at increased risk for additional Axis I and/or Axis II mental disorders (Brady, Killeen, Saladin, D ansky, & Becker, 1994; Cottler, Nishith, & Compton, 2001). Thesesymptoms need to be so thatother presenting subclinical features or diso r\u00ad ders do not go unidentified and untreated. Toaccomplish this, a comprehensive assessmentof the client 's mental health is recommended. Misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis Many trauma survivors are either misdiagnosed(i.e., given diagnoses that are not accurate) orunderdiagnosed (i.e., have one or more diagn o\u00ad ses that have not been identified at all). Such diagnostic errors could result, in part, from the fact that many general instruments to evaluate mental disorders are not sufficiently sensitive toidentify posttraumatic symptoms and can mi s- classify them as other disorders, including per\u00adsonality disorders or psychoses. Intrusiveposttraumatic symptoms, for example, canshow up on general measures as indicative of hallucinations or obsessions. Dissociative symp toms can be interpreted as indicative of schizophrenia. Trauma- based cognitive symp\u00ad toms can be sco red as evidence for paranoia or other delusional processes (Briere, 1997). Some of the most common misdiagnoses in clients with PTSD and substance abuse are: Mood and anxiety disorders . Overlapping symptoms with such disorders as major d e\u00ad pression, generalized anxiety disorder, andbipolar disorder can lead to misdiagnosis. Borderline personality disorder . Historically, this has been more frequently diagnosedthan PTSD. Many of the symptoms, i n\u00ad cluding a pattern of intense interpersonal relationships, impulsivity, rapid and unpr e\u00ad dictable mood swings, power struggles in the treatment environment, underlying anxiety and depressive symptoms, and tra n\u00ad sient, stress- related paranoid ideation or s e\u00ad vere dissociative symptoms overlap. The effect of this misdiagnosis on treatment can be particularly negative; counselors often view clients with a borderline personality diagnosis as difficult to treat and unrespo n\u00ad sive to treatment. Antisocial personality disorder . For men and women who have been traumatized in childhood, \"acting out \" behaviors, a lack of empathy and conscience, impulsivity, andself-centeredness can be functions of tra u\u00ad ma and survival skills rather than true ant i\u00ad social characteristics. Attention def icit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD) . For children and ado lescents, impulsive behaviors and concentrationproblems can be diagnosed as ADHD r a\u00ad ther than PTSD. It is possible, however, for clients to legit i\u00ad mately have any of these disorders in addition to trauma -related disorders. Given the overlap of posttraumati c symptoms with those of ot h\u00ad er disorders, a wide variety of diagnoses oftenneeds to be considered to avoid misidentifying 102 Culture -Specific Stress Responses Culture- bound concepts of distress exist that don't necessarily match diagnostic criteria. Culture - specific symptoms and syndromes can involve physical complaints, broad emotional reactions, or specific cognitive features. Many such syndromes are unique to a specific culture but can broaden to cultures that have similar beliefs or characteristics. Culture -bound syndromes are typically treated by traditional medicine and are known throughout the culture. Cultural concepts of distress include: Ataques de nervios. Recognized in Latin America and among individuals of Latino descent, the primary features of this syndrome include intense emotional upset (e.g., shouting, crying, trem\u00ad bling, dissociative or seizure -like episodes). It frequently occurs in response to a traumatic or stressful event in the family. Nervios . This is considered a common idiom of distress among Latinos; it includes a wide range of emotional distress symptoms including headaches, nervousness, tearfulness, stomach discom\u00ad fort, difficulty sleeping, and dizziness. Symptoms can vary widely in intensi ty, as can impairment from them. This often occurs in response to stressful or difficult life events. Susto. This term, meaning \"fright,\" refers to a concept found in Latin American cultures, but it is not recognized among Latinos from the Caribbean . Susto is attributed to a traumatic or frighte n\u00ad ing event that causes the soul to leave the body, thus resulting in illness and unhappiness; ex\u00ad treme cases may result in death. Symptoms include appetite or sleep disturbances, sadness, lack of motivation, low self-esteem, and somatic symptoms. Taijin kyofusho. Recognized in Japan and among some American Japanese, this \"interpersonal fear\" syndrome is characterized by anxiety about and avoidance of interpersonal circumstances. The individual presents worry or a conviction that his or her appearance or social interactions are inadequate or offensive. Other cultures have similar cultural descriptions or syndromes assoc i\u00ad ated Briere & Scott, 2006b. Part 1, Chapter 4\u2014 Screening and Assessment other disorders as PTSD and vice versa. A trained and experienced mental health profes\u00adsional will be required to weigh differential diagnoses. TIP 42 (CSAT , 2005c ) explores issues related to differential diagnosis. Cross -Cultural Screening and Assessment Many trauma -related symptoms and disorders are culture specific, and a client 's cultural background must be considered in screeningand assessment (for review of assessment andcultural considerations when working withtrauma, see Wilson & Tang, 2007). Behavioral health serv ice providers must approach screen\u00ad ing and assessment processes with the infl u\u00ad ences of culture, ethnicity, and race firmly in mind. Cultural factors, such as norms for ex\u00ad pressing psychological distress, defining tra u\u00adma, and seeking help in dealing with trauma , can affect: How traumas are experienced. The meaning assigned to the event(s). How trauma -related symptoms are ex\u00ad pressed (e.g., as somatic expressions of di s\u00ad tress, level of emotionality, types of avoidantbehavior ). Willingness to express distress or identify trauma with a behavioral health service provider and sense of safety in doing so. Whether a specific pattern of behavior,emotional expression, or cognitive process is considered abnormal. Willingness to seek treatment in side and outside of one's own culture. Response to treatment . Treatment outcome. When selecting assessment instruments, coun\u00adselors and administrators need to choose, 103 The DSM -5 and Updates to Screening and Assessment Instruments The recent publication of the DSM -5 (APA, 2013a) reflects changes to certain diagnostic criteria, which will affect screening tools and criteria for trauma -related disorders. Criterion A2 (specific to traumatic stress disorders, acute stress, and posttraumatic stress disorders), included in the fourth edition (text revision) of the DSM (DSM -IV-TR; APA, 2000a), has been eliminated; this criterion stated that the individual's response to the trauma needs to involve intense fear, helplessness, or horror. There are now four cluster symptoms, not three: reexperie ncing, avoidance, arousal, and persistent negative alterations in cognitions and mood. Changes to the DSM -5 were made to symptoms within each cluster. Thus, screening will need modification to adjust to this change (APA, 2012b). Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services whenever possible, instruments that are cu l\u00ad turally appropriate for the client. Instruments that have been normed for, adapted to, and tested on specific cultural and linguistic groups should be used. Instruments that are not normed for the population are likely to co n\u00ad tain cultural biases and produce misleadingresults. Subsequently, this can lead to misdia g\u00ad nosis, over diagnosis, inappropriate treatment plans, and ineffective interventions. Thus, it is important to interpret all test results cautiou s\u00ad ly and to discuss the limitations of instruments with clients from diverse ethnic populatio ns and cultures. For a review of cross -cultural screening and assessment considerations, referto the planned TIP , Improving Cultural Co m\u00ad petence (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration , planned c). Choosing Instruments Numerous instruments screen for trauma hi s\u00ad tory, indicate symptoms, assess trauma -related and other mental disorders, and identify rela t\u00ad ed clinical phenomena , such as dissociation. One instrument is unlikely to meet all screen\u00ad ing or assessment needs or to determine the existence and full extent of trauma sympt oms and traumatic experiences. The following sec\u00adtions present g enera l considerations in selec t\u00ad ing standardized instrument s. Purpose Define your assessment needs. Do you need astandardized screening or assessment instr u\u00ad ment for clinical purposes? Do you need i n\u00adformation on a specific aspect of trauma, suchas history, PTSD, or dissociation? Do youwish to make a formal diagnosis , such as PTSD? Do you need to determine quickly whether a client has experienced a trauma? Doyou want an assessment that requires a clin i\u00ad cian to administer it, or can the client co m\u00ad plete the instrument him self or herself? Does the instrument match the current and specificdiagnostic crit eria established in the DSM -5? Population Consider the population to be assessed (e.g.,women, children, adolescents, refugees, disastersurvivors, survivors of physical or sexual vi o\u00ad lence, survivors of combat -related trauma, peo\u00ad ple whose native language is not English ); some tools are appropriate only for certainpopulations. Is the assessment process devel\u00adopmentally and culturally appropriate for yourclient? Exhibit 1.4-2 lists consider ations in choosing a screening or assessment instrument for trauma and/or PTSD. Instrument Quality An instrument should be psychometrically adequate in terms of sensitivity and specificity or reliability and validity as measured in seve r\u00ad al ways under varying conditions. Publishedresearch offers info rmation on an instrument 's psychometric properties as well as its utility inboth research and clinical settings. For furtherinformation on a number of widely usedtrauma evaluation tools, see Appendix D andAntony, Orsillo, and Roemer 's paper (2001). 104 Exhibit 1.4 -2: Key Areas of Trauma Screening and Assessment Trauma Key question: Did the client experience a trauma? Examples of measures: Life Stressor Checklist -Revised (Wolfe & Kimerling, 1997); Tra uma History Questionnaire (Green, 1996); Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (Kubany et al., 2000) . Note: A good trauma measure identifies events a person experienced (e.g., rape, assault, accident) and also evaluates other trauma -related symptoms (e.g., presence of fear, helplessness, or horror). Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) and PTSD Key question: Does the client meet criteria for ASD or PTSD? Examples of measures: Clinician -Administered PTSD Scale al., 1990); Modified PTSD Symptom Scale (Falsett Resnick, Checklist (Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, & Stress Reaction Questionnaire (Cardena, Koopman, Classen, Waelde, & Spiegel, 2000). Note: A PTSD diagnosis requires the person to meet criteria for having experienced a trauma; some measures include this, but others do not and require use of a separate trauma measure. The CAPS is an interview; the others listed are self -report questionnaires and take less time. Other Trauma -Related Symptoms Key question: Does the client have other symptoms related to trauma? These include depressive symptoms, self -harm, dissociation, sexuality problems, and relationship issues, such as distrust. Examples of measures: Beck Depression Inventory II (Beck, 1993; Beck et al., 1993); Dissociative Experiences Scale (Bernstein & Putnam, 1986; Carlson & Putnam, 1993); Impact of Event Scale (mea sures intrusion and avoidance due to exposure to traumatic events; Horowitz, Wilner, & Alvarez, 1979; Weiss & Marmar, 1997); Trauma Symptom (Briere, Symptom Children (Briere, 1996b); Modified PTSD Symptom Scale (Falsetti et al., 1993). Note: These measures can be helpful for clinical pur poses and for outcome assessment because they gauge levels of symptoms. Trauma -related symptoms are broader than diagnostic criteria and thus useful to measure, even if the patient doesn't meet criteria for any specific diagnoses. Other Trauma -Related Diag noses Key question: Does the client have other disorders related to trauma? These include mood diso r\u00ad ders, anxiety disorders besides traumatic stress disorders, and dissociative disorders. Examples of measures: Mental Health Screening Form III (Carroll & McGinley, 2001); The Mini - International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -IV-TR, P a\u00ad tient Edition (First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, revised 2011 ); Structured Clinical Interview for DSM \u00ad IV-TR, Non -Patient Edition (First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, revised 2011 a). Note: For complex symptoms and diagnoses such as dissociation and dissociative disorders, inter\u00ad views are recommended. Look for measures that incorporate DSM -5 criteria.

Is costly and extensive trai n\u00ad ing required to administer it? Is the instr u\u00ad ment too lengthy to be used in the clinical setting? Is it easily administered and scoredwith accompanying manuals and/or othertraining materials? How will results be pr e\u00ad sented to or used with the client? Is techni cal support available for difficulties in administr a\u00ad tion, scoring, or interpretation of results? Is special equipment required such as a micr o\u00ad phone, a video camera, or a touch -screen co m\u00ad puter with audio? Trauma -Informed Screening and Assessment The following section s focus on initial scree n\u00ad ing. For more information on screening and assessment tools, including structured inter\u00adviews, see Exhibit 1.4-2. S creening is only as good as the actions taken afterward to address a positive screen (when client s acknowledge that they experience symptoms or have en\u00adcountered events highlighted within the screening). Once a screening is complete and apositive screen is ac quired, the client then needs referral for a more indepth assessment to ensure development o f an appropr iate treatment plan that matches his or her pr e\u00ad senting problems. Establish a History of Trauma A person cannot have ASD, PTSD , or any trauma -related symptoms without experien c\u00ad ing trauma; theref ore, it is necessary to inquire about painful, difficult, or o verwhelming past experiences. Initial information should be gathered in a way that is minimally intrusive yet clear. Brief questionnaires can be less threatening to a client than face -to-face inte r\u00ad views, but interviews should be an integral part of any screening and assessment process. If the client initially denies a history of trauma(or minimizes it), administer the questionnaire later or delay additional trauma -related que s\u00ad tions until the client has perhaps developedmore trust in the treatment setting and feels safer with the thoughts and emotions that might arise in discussing his or her traumaexperiences. The Stressful Life Experiences (SLE) screen (Exhibit 1.4- 3) is a checklist of traumas that also considers the client 's view of the impact of those events on life functioning. Using the SLE can foster the client -counselor relatio n\u00ad ship. By going over the answers with the cli\u00adent, you can gain a deep understanding of yourclient, and the client receives a demonstrationof your sensitivity and concern fo r what the client has experienced. The National Center for PTSD Web site offers similar instruments (http://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/pages/assessments/assessment.asp ). In addition to broad screening tools that ca p\u00ad ture various traumatic experiences and symp\u00adtoms, other scre ening tools , such as the Combat Exposure Scale (Keane et al., 1989) and the Intimate Partner Violence ScreeningTool (Exhibit 1.4-4), focus on acknowl edging a specific type of traumatic event . Screen for Trauma -Related Symptoms and Disorders in Clients With Histories of Trauma This step evaluates whether the client 's trauma resulted in subclinical or diagnosable diso r\u00ad ders. The counselor can ask such questions as, \"Have you received any counseling or therapy? Have you ever been diagnosed or treated for apsychological disorder in the past? Have you ever been prescribed medications for youremotions in the past? \" Screening is typically conducted by a wide variety of behavioral health service providers with different levelsof training and education; however, all 106 Part 1, Chapter 4\u2014 Screening and Assessment Exhibit 1.4 -3: SLE Screening Source s: Hudnall Stamm, 1996, 1997 .

Exhibit 1.4-6: The SPAN The SPAN instrument is a brief screening tool that asks clients to identify the trauma in their past that is most disturbing to them currently. It then poses four questions that ask clients to rate the frequency and severity with which they have experienced, in the past week, different types of trauma -related symptoms (startle, physiologi cal arousal, anger, and numbness ). To order this screening instrument, use the following contact information: Multi -Health Systems, Inc . P.O. 0950 Phone: 800- 456-3003 Source : Meltzer- Brody et al., 1999. Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services individuals who administer screenings, regar d\u00ad less of education level and experience, should be aware of trauma -related symptoms, groun ding techniques, ways of creating safety for the client, proper methods for in troduc ing screening tools, and the protocol to followwhen a positive screen is obtained. (See A p\u00ad pendix D for information on specific instr u\u00ad ments.) Exhibit 1.4- 5 is an example of a screening instru ment for trauma symptoms, the Primary Care PTSD (PC -PTSD) Screen . Current research (Prins et al., 2004) suggests that the optimal cutoff score for the PC -PTSD is 3. If sensitivity is of greater concern thanefficiency, a cutoff score of 2 is recommended . Another instrument that can screen for tra u\u00ad matic stress symptoms is the four -item self - report SPAN , summarized in Exhibit 1.4-6 , which is derived from the 17 -item Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS). SPAN is an acronym forthe four items the screening addresses: startle, physiological arousal, anger, and numbness. Itwas developed using a small, diverse sample ofadult patients (N=243; 72 percent women;17.4 percent African American; average age =37 years) participating in several clinical stu d\u00ad ies, including a family study of rape trauma, combat veterans, and Hurricane Andrew sur\u00advivors, among others. The SPAN has a high diagnostic accuracy of 0.80 to 0.88, with sensitivity (percentage of true positive instanc es) of 0.84 and specificity (percentage of true negative instances ) of 0.91 (Meltzer- Brody, Churchill, & Davidson, 1999). SPAN scores correlated highly with the full DTS (r = 0.96) and other measures, such as the Impact of Events Scale (r = 0.85) a nd the Sheehan Disability Scale (r = 0.87).

Part 1, Chapter 4\u2014 Screening and Assessment 109 Exhibit 1.4 -8: Resilience Scales A number of scales with good psychometric properties measure resilience : Resilience Scale (Wagnild & Young, 1993) Resilience Scale for A dults (Friborg, Hjemdal, Rosenvinge, & Martinussen, 2003) 2007, respectively) Dispositional Resilience -,30-, 15\u00ad item forms (Bartone, Roland, Picano, &Williams, 2008) Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services Gulf Wars, it has since been validated on a variety of noncombat traumas (Keane, Brief,Pratt, & Miller, 2007). When using the check list, identify a specific trauma first and then have the client answer questions in rela\u00ad tion to that one specific trauma. Other Screening and Resilience Measures Along with identifying the presence oftrauma -related symptoms that warrant a s\u00ad sessment to determine the severity of symp\u00adtoms as well as whether or not the individual possesses subclinical symptoms or has metcriteria for a trauma -related disorder, clients should receive other screenings for symptoms associat ed with trauma ( e.g., depression , sui\u00ad cidality ). It is important that screenings a d\u00ad dress both external and internal resources ( e.g., support systems, strengths, coping styles).Knowing the client 's strengths can significan t\u00ad ly shape the treatment planning pr ocess by allowing you to use strategies that have alreadyworked for the client and incorporating stra t\u00ad egies to build resilience (Exhibit 1.4-8). Preliminary research improvement ofind ividual resilience (Lavretsky, 2010). Screen for \u2014particularly those who have exp e\u00ad rienced trauma \u2014should for su i\u00ad cidality by asking , \"In the past, have you ever had suicidal thoughts, had intention to co m\u00ad mit suicid e, or made a suicide attempt? Do you have any of those feelings now? Have you had any such feelings recently? \" Behavioral health service providers should receive trainingto screen for suicide. Additionally, clients withsubstance use disorders and a history of psy\u00adchological trauma are at heightened risk forsuicidal thoughts and behaviors; thus, screen\u00ading for suicidality is indicated. See TIP 50,Addressing Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors inSubstance Abuse Treatment (CSAT, 2009a ). For additional descriptions of screening processes for suicidality, see TIP 42 (CSAT, 2005 c). Concluding Note Screenings are only beneficial if there are follow -up procedures and resources for ha n\u00ad dling positive screens, such as the ability to review results with and provide feedback to the individual after the screening, sufficient resources to complete a thorough assessmentor to make an appropriate referral for an as\u00adsessment, treatment planning processes thatcan easily incorporate additional trauma - informed care objectives and goals, and avail a\u00ad bility and access to trauma- specific services that match the client 's needs. Screening is only the first step! 110 IN THIS CHAPTER Trauma -Informed Prevention and Treatment Objectives Treatment Issues Making Referrals to Trauma -Specific Services Clinical Issues Acro ss5 Services Many clients in behavioral health treatment may have histories of trauma, so counselors should be prepared to help them address i s\u00ad sues that arise from those histories. This chapter begins with athorough discussion of trauma -informed prevention and treatment objectives along with practical counselor strategies. Specific trea t\u00ad ment issues related to working with trauma survivors in a clinical setting are discussed as well, including client engagement, pacing and timing, traumatic memories, and culturally appropriate andgender -responsive services. The chapter ends with guidelines for making referrals to trauma -specific services. Trauma -Informed Prevention and Treatment Objectives Trauma -informed care (TIC) not only focuses on identifying ind i\u00ad viduals who have histories of trauma and traumatic stress symp\u00adtoms; it also places considerable effort in creating an environment that helps them recognize the impact of trauma and determine the next course of act ion in a safe place. For some individuals, ps y\u00ad choeducation and development or reinforcement of coping strat e\u00ad gies will be the most suitable and effective strategy, whereas others may request or warrant a referral for more trauma -specific inte r\u00ad ventions (see Part 1, Chapter 6 , of this Treatment Improvement Protocol [ TIP]). Although research is limited in the area of build\u00ad ing resilience to prevent exacerbation of trauma symptoms and traumatic stress disorders, TIC also focuses on prevention strat e\u00ad gies to avoid retraumatization in treatment, to promote resilience , and to prevent the development of trauma -related disorders. The following section s highlight key trauma -informed prevention and treatment objectives. 111 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services TIC Framework in Behavioral Health Services \u2014Clinical Issues Across Services seemingly without provocation; feelings of sadness, anger, shame, or being overwhelmed;or not having control over sudden disconne c\u00ad tions from others make moment -to-moment living feel unsafe. Clients might express fee l\u00ad ing unsafe through statements such as, \"I can 't control my feelings,\" or, \"I just space out and disconnect from the world for no reason ,\" or, \"I'm afraid to go to sleep because of the nightmares. \" The intense feelings that acco m\u00ad pany trauma can also make clients feel unsafe.They may wake up in the morning feeling fine but become immobilized by depression as the day progresses. Clients with histories of tra u\u00ad ma may experience panicky feelings of bein g trapped or abandoned. An early effort intrauma treatment is thus helping the client Establish Safety Beyond identifying trauma and trauma- related symptoms, the initial objective of TIC is e s\u00ad tablishing safety. Borrowing from Herman 's (1992) conceptualization of trauma recovery,safety is the first goal of treatment. Establish\u00ading safety is especially crucial at the outset oftrauma -informed treatment and often b e\u00ad comes a recurrent need when ev ents or ther a\u00ad peutic changes raise safety issues, such as achange in treatment staffing due to vacations. In the context of TIC, safety has a variety of meanings. Perhaps most importantly, the cli\u00ad ent has to have some degree of safety from trauma symptoms . Recurring intrusive nigh t\u00ad mares; painful memories that burst forth 112 Advice to Counselors: Strategies To Promote Safety Strategy #1: Teach clients how and when to use grounding exercises when they feel unsafe or overwhelmed. Strategy # 2: Establish some specific routines in individual, group, or family therapy (e.g., have an opening ritual or routine when starting and ending a group session). A structured setting can provide a sense of safety and familiarity for clients with histories of trauma. Strategy #3: Facilitate a discussion on safe and unsafe behaviors. Have clients identify, on paper, behaviors that promote safety and behaviors that feel unsafe for them today. Strategy #4: Refer to Seeking Safety: A Treatment Manual for PTSD and Substance Abuse (Najavits, 2002a). This menu- based manual covers an array of treatment topics, including the core concept of safety. Each topic consists of several segments, including preparing for the session, session format, session content, handouts, and guidelines. Strategy #5: Encourage the development of a safety plan. Depending on the type of trauma, pe r\u00ad sonal safety can be an issue; work with the client to develop a plan that will help him or her feel in control and prepared for the unexpected. If the trauma was a natural or human -caused disaster, e n\u00ad courage thinking about how family and friends will respond and connect in the event of another cr i\u00ad sis. If sexual abuse or rape was the event, encourage thinking about future steps that could help make the client safer. There is a delicate balance between preparation and the realization that one cannot prepare for all possible traumatic events. Nonetheless, an action plan can help the client r e\u00ad gain a sense of environmental balance. Part 1, Chapter 5\u2014 Clinical Issues Across Services gain more control over trauma symptoms (and be able to label them as such) by learning more about the client and helping him or her develop new coping skills to handle symptoms when they arise and stay more grounded whenflooded with feelings or memories. A second aspect is saf ety in the environment. Trauma reactions can be triggered by sudden loud sounds ( e.g., television at high volume, raised voices), tension between people, certain smells, or casual touches that are perceived as invasions of physical boundaries. The vulner a\u00ad bility of exposing one 's history in the trea t\u00ad ment setting can manifest in the client as feeling physically vulnerable and unsafe in the treatment environment. Sudden or inad e\u00ad quately explained treatment transitions, suchas moving from one level of treatment to an\u00ad other or changing counselors, can also evoke feelings of danger, abandonment, or instabi l\u00ad ity. Early in treatment, trauma survivors gen\u00aderally value routine and predictability. The counselor should recognize these needs and respond appropriately by off ering information in advance, providing nonshaming responses to a client 's reactions to stimuli in his or her environment, and helping the client build a daily structure that feels safe. A third aspect of safety is preventing a recur\u00ad rence of trauma . Peopl e with histories of trauma and substance abuse are more likely to engage in high -risk behaviors and to exp eri\u00ad ence subsequent traumas. Early treatmentshould focus on helping clients stop using unsafe coping mechanisms, such as substance abuse, self -harm, a nd other self -destructive behaviors , and replacing them with safe and healthy coping strategies. Helping clients learn to protect themselves in reasonable ways is a positive goal of treatment. Prevent Retraumatization A key objective in TIC is to prevent retraum a\u00ad tization generated by intervention and treat\u00ad ment practices and policies. Unfortunately,treatment settings and clinicians can 113 Advice to Counselors: Strategies To Prevent Retraumatization Strategy #1: Be sensitive to the needs of cli ents who have experienced trauma regarding behaviors in the treatment setting that might trigger memories of the trauma. Strategy #2: Do not ignore clients' symptoms and demands when clients with trauma histo ries act out in response to triggered trauma memories; doing so may replicate t he original traumatic experience. Strategy #3: Be mindful that efforts to control and contain a client's behaviors in treatment can pr o\u00ad duce an abnormal reaction, particularly for trauma survivors for whom being trapped was part o f the trauma experience. Strategy #4: Listen for specific triggers that seem to be driving the client's reaction. An important step in recovery is helping the client identify these cues and thereby reach a better understanding of reactions and behavior s. Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services unintent ionally create retraumatizing exper i\u00ad ences (for a review of traumas that can occur when treating serious mental illness, see Frueh et al., 2005). For instance, compassionate i n\u00ad quiry into a client 's history can seem similar to the interest shown by a perpetr ator many years before. Direct confrontation by counselors about behaviors related to substance abuse can be seen, by someone who has been repeatedly physically assaulted, as provocation buildingup to assault. Counselor and program efforts to help clients constrain destructive behaviors can be interpreted as efforts to control anddominate the individual. Intrusive shaming orinsensitive behavior demonstrated by another client in the program can threaten a traumasurvivor whose boundaries have been disr e\u00ad garded in the past \u2014thus making the exper i\u00ad ence of treatment feel dangerous rather thansafe. Some staff and agency issues that canresult in retraumatization include : Disrespectfully challenging reports of abuse or other traumatic events. Discounting a client's report of a traumatic event. Using isolation. Using physical restraints. Allowing the abusive behavior of one client toward another to continue without intervention. Labeling intense rage and other feelings as pathological. Minimizing, discrediting, or ignoring client responses. Disrupting counselor -client relationships by changing counselors' schedules and a s\u00ad signments. Obtaining urine specimens in a nonprivateand/or disrespectful manner. Having clients undress in the presence ofothers. Being insensitive to a client's physical or emotional boundaries. Inconsistently enforcing rules and allowingchaos in the treatment environment. Applying rigid agency policies or rules without an opportunity for clients to ques\u00adtion them. Accepting agency dysfunction, including a lack of consistent, competent leadership. Provide Psychoeducation Trauma -informed education informs clients about traumatic stress and trauma -related symptoms and disorders as well as the related consequences of trauma exposure. It focuses on giving information to clients to help no r\u00ad malize presenting symptoms, to highlight p o\u00ad tential short -term and long -term consequences of trauma and various paths torecovery, and to underscore the message thatrecovery is possible. Education frequently takes place prior to or immediately followingan initial screening as a way to prepare clients 114 Advice to Counselors: Strategies To Implement Psychoeducation Strategy #1: Remember that this may be the client's first experience with treatment. It's easy to use program or clinical jargon when you're around it every day, but most individuals who seek help are unfamiliar with clinical language, how the program works, and treatment objectives. Psychoeducation begins with understanding the client's expectations and reasons for seeking help, followed by ed u\u00ad cating the client and other family members about the program. Remember that this is all new for them. Strategy #2: After obtaining acknowledgment of a trauma history, provide an overview of common symptoms and consequences of traumatic stress, regardless of whether the client affirms having trauma -related symptoms. It is equally important to educate the client on resilience factors associa t\u00ad ed with recovery from trauma (Wessely et al., 2008). A trauma -informed perspectiv e provides a me s\u00ad sage that trauma reactions are normal responses to an abnormal situation. Strategy #3: Develop a resource box that provides an array of printed or multimedia educational materials that address t he program, specific symptoms and tools to combat trauma -related sym p\u00ad toms, treatment options and therapy approaches, advantages of peer support, and steps in develo p\u00ad ing specific coping strategies. Strategy #4: Develop a rotating educational group that matches services and client schedules to complement treatment. Remember that education can play a pivotal role in enhancing motivation, in normalizing experiences, and in creating a sense of safety as individuals move further into treatment. For some survivors, education can be a powerful intervention or prevention strategy. Pa rt 1, Chapter 5\u2014 Clinical Issues Across Services for hearing results or to place the screening and subsequent assessment findings in proper context. Education in and of itself, however,does not necessarily constitute a stand -alone treatment; rather, it can be conceptualized as afirst step and/or component of more compr e\u00ad hensive treatment. Nonetheless, educationmay be a prevention and intervention strategy for individuals who have histories o f trauma without current consequences or symptoms and/or those who have reported a resolutionof past trauma(s). For example, some clientsmay have significantly delayed onset of tra u\u00ad matic stress symptoms. In this scenario , earlier education can enhance re cognition of sym p\u00ad toms and ease the path of seeking treatment. Some clients do not recognize the link b e\u00ad tween their current difficulties and their tra u\u00ad ma histories; education can help them understand the possible origin of their diff i\u00ad culties. Psychoeducation presents trauma - related symptoms that follow a trauma as normal reactions. By identifying the source of clients' current difficulties and framing them as normal thoughts, emotions, and behaviors in response to trauma, many trauma survivors report a redu ction in the intensity of the diff i\u00ad culties or symptoms. Often, a client will ex\u00adpress relief that his or her reactions are normal. You may find the U.S. Department ofVeterans Affairs (VA) National Center onPTSD 's educational handouts on traumatic stress reactions useful. Psychoeducation goes beyond the identific a\u00ad tion of traumatic stress symptoms and/or learning about the psychological, cognitive,and physical impacts of trauma. Numerous curricula are available that use psychoeduc a\u00ad tion as a first -line or co mplementary approach to trauma -specific therapies to enhance coping strategies in key areas, including safety, em o\u00ad tional regulation, help -seeking, avoi dant b e\u00ad forth. An example is S.E.L.F., a trauma- informed psychoeducational group curriculum with educational components r e\u00ad lated to trauma recovery in the following 115 \"This might not sound like a big deal, but for many people relationships have become all about getting: telling your problem story and then getting help with it. There is little, if any, emphasis placed on giving back. That's a big deal!!! Service relationships are like a one -way street and both people's roles are clearly defined. But in 'regular' relationships in your community, people give and take all the time. No one is permanently on the taking side or the giving side. This exchange contributes to people feeling ok about being vulnerable (needing help) as well as confident about what they're offering. For many of us, being the role of 'getter' all the time has shaken our confi dence, making us feel like we have nothing worthwhile to contribute. Peer support breaks that all down. It gets complicated somewhat when one of us is paid, but modeling this kind of relationship in which both of us learn, offers us the real practice we need to feel like a 'regular' community member as opposed to an 'integrated mental patient'.\" (Mead, 2008, p.7) Case Illustration: Linda Linda served as an Army nurse in an evacuation hospital in Vietnam. She reported her postdeplo y\u00ad ment adjustment as difficult and isolating but denied any significant symptoms of traumatic stress throughout her life. Four years ago, Linda sought treatment for alcohol dependence; during the in\u00ad take, she recalls denying trauma -related symptoms. \"I distinctly remember the session,\" she re\u00ad counts. \"The counselor first took my history but then gave information on typical symptoms and reactions to trauma. I thought, 'Why do I need to hear this? I've survived the worst trauma in my life.' I didn't see the value of this information. Then 3 weeks ago, I began to have recurrent nightmares, the same graphic type I occasionally had when I was in Vietnam. Since then, I've been very anxious, reliving horrible scenes that I'd experienced as a nurse and postponing going to bed in fear of having the dreams again. I didn't understand it. I am 70 years old, and the war happened a long time ago. Then I began putting it together. Recently, the emergency helicopter flight pattern and approach to the area's hospital changed. I began hearing the helicopter periodically in my living room, and it re\u00ad minded me of Vietnam. I knew then that I needed help; I couldn't stop shaking. I felt as if I was losing control of my emotions. I remembered how the intake counselor took the time to explain common symptom s of trauma. That's why I'm here today.\" Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services areas: creating Safety, regulating Emotions, addressing Loss, and redefining the F uture (Bloom, Foderaro, & Ryan, 2006). Offer Trauma -Informed Peer Support Living with a history of trauma can be isolat\u00ad ing and consu ming. The experience of trauma can reinforce beliefs about being different,alone, and marred by the experience. At times, behavioral health treatment for trauma -related effects can inadvertently reinforce these b e\u00ad liefs. Simply engaging in treatment or rec eiv\u00ad ing specialized services (although warranted)can further strengthen clients' beliefs that there is something wrong with them. Forma l\u00ad ized peer support can enhance the treatmentexperience. Treatment plus peer support can break the cycle of beliefs that reinforce tra u\u00ad matic stress (e.g., believing that one is perma\u00adnently damaged; that nobody couldunderstand; that no one should or could toler\u00adate one 's story). Peer support provides oppo r\u00ad tunities to form mutual relationships; to learnhow one 's history shape s perspectives of self, others, and the future; to move beyond tra u\u00ad ma; and to mirror and learn alternate copingstrategies. Peer support defines recovery as an 116 Advice to Counselors: Strategies To Enhance Peer Support Strategy #1: Provide education on wh at peer support is and is not. Roles and expectations of peer support can be confusing, so providing clarification in the beginning can be quite useful. It is i m\u00ad portant to provide initial education about peer support and the value of using this resource. Strategy #2: Use an established peer support curriculum to guide the peer support process. For ex\u00ad ample, Intentional Peer Support: An Alternative Approach (Mead, 2008) is a workbook that highlights four main tasks for peer support: building connections, und erstanding one's worldview, developing mutuality, and helping each other move toward set desires and goals. This curriculum provides exten\u00ad sive materials for peer support staff members as well as for the individuals seeking peer support. interactive process, not as a definitive moment wherein someone fixes the \"problem. \" Normalize Symptoms Symptoms of trauma can become serious ba r\u00ad riers to recovery from substance us e and men\u00ad tal disorders , including trauma -related ones. Counselors should be aware of how trauma symptoms can present and how to respond to them when they do app ear. A significant step in addressing symptoms is normalizing them. People with traumatic stress symptoms need to know that their symptoms are not unique and that their reactions are common to their experience(s). Often, normalizing symptoms gives consider able relief to clients who may have thought that their symptoms signified some pervasive, untreatable mental disorder. Advice to Counselors: Strategies To Normalize Symptoms Strategy #1: Provide psychoeducation on the common symptoms of traumatic stress. Strategy #2: Research the client's most prev a\u00ad lent symptoms specific to trauma, and then provide education to the client. For example, an individual who was conscious and trapped during or as a result of a traumatic event will more likely be hypervigilant about exits, plan escape routes even in safe environments, and have strong reactions to interpersonal and environmental situations that are perceived as having no options for avoidance or resolution (e.g., feeling stuck in a work environment where the boss is emotional ly abusive). Strategy #3: First, have the client list his or her symptoms. After each symptom, ask the client to list the negative and positive consequences of the symptom. Remember that symptoms serve a purpose, even if they may not appear to work well o r work as well as they had in the past. Focus on how the symptoms have served the client in a positive way (see Case Illustr a\u00ad tion: Hector). This exercise can be difficult, because clients as well as counselors often don't focus on the value of symptoms. Case Illustration: Hector Hector was referred to a halfway house specia l\u00ad izing in co -occurring disorders after inpatient treatment for methamphetamine dependence and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the halfway house, he continued to feel over\u00ad whelm ed with the frequency and intensity of flashbacks. He often became frustrated, ex\u00adpressing anger and a sense of hopelessness, followed by emotional withdrawal from others in the house. Normalization strategy #3 was introduced in the session. During this exercise, he began to identify many negative aspects of flashbacks. He felt that he couldn't control the occurrence of flashbacks even though he want\u00aded to, and he realized that he often felt shame afterward. In the same exercise, he was also urged to identify positive aspects of flashbacks. Although this was difficult, he realized that flashbacks were clues about content that he needed to address in trauma -specific trea t\u00ad ment. \"I realized that a flashback, for me, was a billboard advertising what I needed to fo cus on in therapy.\" Pa rt 1, Chapter 5\u2014 Clinical Issues Across Services 117 Advice to Counselors: Strategies To Identify and Manage Trauma -Related Triggers Strategy #1: Use the Sorting the Past From the Present technique for cognitive realignment (Blackburn, 1995) to help separate the current situation from the past trauma. Identify one trigger at a time, and then discuss the following questions w ith the client : When and where did you begin to notice a reaction? How does this situation remind you of your past history or past trauma? How are your reactions to the current situation similar to your past reactions to the trauma(s)? How was this current situation different from the past trauma? How did you react differently to the current situation than to the previous trauma? How are you different today (e.g., factors such as age, abilities, strength, level of support)? What choices can you make that are different from the past and that can help you address the current situation (trigger)? After reviewing this exercise several times in counseling, put the questions on a card for the client to carry and use outside of treatment. Clients with substance use disorders can benefit from using the same questions (slightly reworded) to address relapse triggers. Strategy #2: After the individual identifies the trigger and draws connections between the trigger and past trauma, work with him or her to establish responses and coping strategies to deal with triggers as they occur. Initially, the planned responses will not immediately occur after a trigger, but with practice, the planned responses will move closer to the time of the trigger. Some strategies include an acronym that reflects coping strategies (Exhibit 1.5-1), positive self-talk generated by cognitive -behavioral covert m odeling exercises (rehearsal of coping statements), breathing retrai n\u00ad ing, and use of support systems (e.g., calling someone). Strategy #3: Self-monitoring is any strategy that asks a client to observe and record the number of times something happens, to note the intensity of specific experiences, or to describe a specific behavioral, emotional, or cognitive phenomenon each time it occurs. For individuals with histories of trauma, triggers and flashbacks can be quite frightening, intense, and powerful. Even if the client has had just one or two triggers or flashbacks, he or she may perceive flashbacks as happening constantly. Often, it takes time to recover from these experiences. Using self- monitoring and asking the client to record each time a trigger occ urs, along with describing the trigger and its intensity level (using a scale from 1 -10), clients and counselors will gain an understanding of the type of triggers present and the level of distre ss that each one produces. Moreover, the client may begin to see that the triggers don't actually happen all the time, even though they may seem to occur frequently . Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services Identify and Manage Trauma - Related Triggers Many clients who have traumatic stress are caught off guard with intrusive thoughts, feel\u00adings, sensations, or environmental cues of the trauma. This experience can be quite disco n\u00ad certing, but often , the individual does not draw an immediate connection between the internal or external trigger and his or her rea c\u00ad tions. At other times, the trigger is so potent that the individual is unable to discern the present trigger from the past trauma and b e\u00ad gins to respond as if the trauma is reoccurring. Key steps in identifying triggers are to reflectback on the situation, surroundings, or sensa\u00adtions prior to the strong reaction. By doing so,you and your client may be able to determine the connections among these cues, the past trauma(s), and the client 's reaction. Once the cue is identified, discuss the ways in which itis connected to past trauma. For some cues,there will be an obvious and immediate co n\u00ad nection ( e.g., having someone say \"I love you\" in a significant relationship as an adult andconnecting this to an abuser who said thesame thing prior to a sexual assault). Other 118 Exhibit 1.5 -1: The OBSERVATIONS Coping Strategy Take a moment to just Observe what is happening. Pay attention to your body, your senses , and your environment. Focus on your Breathing . Allow your fee l\u00ad ings a nd sensations to wash over you. Breathe. Name the Situation that initiated your response. In what way is this situation fa\u00ad miliar to y our past? How is it different? Remember that Emotions come and go. They may be intense now, but later they will be less so. Name your feelings. Recognize that this situation does not d e\u00ad fine you or your future. It does not dictate how things will be, nor is it a sign of things to come. Even if it is familiar, it is only one event. Validate your experience. State, at least internally, what you are feeling, thinking, and experiencing. Ask for help. You don' t have to do this alone. Seek support. Other people care for you. Let them! This too shall pass. Remember: There are times that are good and times that are not so good. This hard time will pass. I can handle this. Name your strengths. Your strengths have helped you survive. Keep an Open mind. Look for and try out new solutions. Name strategies that have worked before . Choose one and apply it to this situation. Remember you have survived. You are a Survivor ! cues will not be a s obvious. With practice, the client can begin to track back through what occurred immediately before an emotional, physical, or behavioral reaction and then e x\u00ad amine how that experience reminds him or her of the past. Draw Connections Mental health and substance abuse treatment providers have historically underestimated the effects of trauma on their clients for many reasons. Some held a belief that substance Advice to Counselors: Strategies To Help Clients Draw Connections Strategy #1: Writing about trauma can help clients gain awareness of their thoughts, feel\u00ad ings, and current experiences and can even improve physical health outcomes (Pennebaker, Kiecolt -Glaser, & Glaser, 1988; Smyth, Hockemeyer , & Tulloch, 2008). Although this tool ma y help some people draw connections between current experiences and past traumas, it should be used with caution; others may find that it brings up too much intense trauma mate\u00ad rial (especially among vulnerable trauma surv i\u00ad vors with co -occuring substance ab use, psychosis, and current domestic violence). Jou r\u00ad nal writing is safest when you ask clients to write about present- day specific targets, such as lo g\u00ad ging their use of coping strategies or identifying stren gths with examples. Writing about trauma can also be done via key questions or a wor k\u00ad book that provides questions centered upon trauma experiences and recovery. Strategy #2: Encourage clients to explore the links among traumatic experiences and mental and substance use disorders. Recognition that a mental disorder or symptom developed after the trauma occurred can provide relief and hope that the symptoms may abate if the trauma is addressed. Ways to help clients co n\u00ad nect substance use with t rauma histories 2002b ; Najavits, Weiss, & Shaw, 1997): Identifying how substances have helped \"solve \" trauma or PTSD symptoms in the short term (e.g., drinking to get to sleep).

Help ing clients recognize trauma sym p\u00ad toms a s triggers for relapse to substance use and mental distress. Work ing on new coping skills to recover from trauma and substance abuse at the same time. Recognizing how both trauma and sub\u00ad stance abuse often occur in families through multiple generations. Pa rt 1, Chapter 5\u2014 Clinical Issues Across Services 119 The Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) uses a 0 -10 rating scale, with 0 representing content that causes no or minimal distress and 10 representing content that is ex ceptionally distressing and overwhelming. (Wolpe & Abrams, 1991) Advice to Counselors: Strategy To Teach Balance Strategy #1: Teach and use the SUDS in counseling. This scale can be useful from the outset as a barometer for the client and counselor to measure the level of distress during and outside of session s. It provides a common language for the client and counselor, and it can also be used to guide the intensity of sessions. SUDS can tangibly show a client 's progress in managing experiences. Without a scale, it is more difficult to grasp that a distressing symptom or circumstance is becoming less and less severe without some repeated measure. Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services abuse should be addressed before attending to any co -occurring conditions. Others did not have the knowledge and training to evaluate trauma issues or were uncomfortable or reluc\u00adtant to discuss these sensitive issues with cli\u00adents (Ouimette & Brown, 2003). Similarly, inother behavioral health settings, clinicianssometimes address trauma -related sympto ms but do not have experience or training in the treatment of substance abuse. So to o, people who have histories of trauma will often be unaware of the connection b e\u00ad tween the traumas they 've experienced and their traumatic stress reactions.They may n o\u00ad tice depression, anger, or anx iety, or they may describe themselves as \"going crazy \" without being able to pinpoint a specific experience that produced the trauma symptoms. Even if clientsrecognize the events that precipitated theirtrauma symptoms, they may not understan d how others with similar experiences can have different reactions. Thus, a treatment goal for trauma survivors is helping them gain awar e\u00ad ness of the connections between their histories of trauma and subsequent consequences. Seeing the connections can impr ove clients' ability to work on recovery in an integrated fashion. Teach Balance You and your clients need to walk a thin line when addressing trauma. Too much work focused on highly distressing content can turna desensitization process into a session wher e\u00ad by the client dissociates, shuts down, or b e\u00ad comes emotionally overwhelmed. On the other hand , too little focus by the client or counselor can easily reinforce avoidance andco nfirm the client 's internal belief that it is too dangerous to deal with the aftermath of thetrauma. Several trauma -specific theories offer guidelines on acceptable levels of distress asso\u00adciated with the traumatic content that the therapy addresses. For example, some trad i\u00ad tional desensitization processes start at a very low level of subjective distress, gradually wor k\u00ad ing up through a hierarchy of trauma memo\u00ad ries and experiences until those experiences produce minimal reactions when paired withsome coping strategy, such as relaxation trai n\u00ad ing. Other desensitization processes start at ahigher level of intensity to provide more rapidextinction of traumatic associations and to decrease the risk of avoidance\u2014a behavior that reinforces traumatic stress. Working with trauma is a delicate balancing act between the development and/or use of coping strategies and the need to process the traumatic expe riences. Individuals will choose different paths to recovery; it 's a myth that every traumatic experience needs to be ex\u00adpressed and every story told. For some ind i\u00ad viduals, the use of coping skills, support, andspirituality are enough to recover. Regardless of theoretical beliefs, counselors must teach 120 Advice to Counselors: Strategies To Build Resilience Strategy #1: Help clients reestablish personal and social connections. Access community and cultural resources; reconnect the person to healing resources such as mutual -help groups and spiritual support s in the community. Strategy #2: Encourage t he client to take a c\u00ad tion. Recovery requires activity. Actively taking care of one's own needs early in treatment can evolve into assisting others later on , such as by volunteerin g at a community organization or helping military families. Strategy #3: Encourage stability and predicta\u00ad bility in the daily routine. Traumatic stress rea c\u00ad tions can be debilitating. Keeping a daily routine of sleep, eating, work, errands, house\u00ad hold chores, and hobbies can help the client see that life continues. Like exercise, daily li v\u00ad ing skills take time to take hold as the client learns to live through symptoms. Strategy #4: Nurture a positive view of per\u00ad sonal, social, and cultural resources. Help cl i\u00ad ents recall ways in which they successfully handled hardships in the past, such as the loss of a loved one, a divorce, or a major illness. Revisit how those crises were addressed. Strategy #5: Help clients gain perspective. All things pass, even when facing very painful events. Foster a long -term outlook ; help clients consider stress and suffering in a spiritual context. Strategy #6: Help maintain a hopeful outlook. An optimistic outlook enables visions of good things in life and can keep people going even in the hardest times. There are positive aspects to everyone's life. Taking time to identify and appreciate these enhances the client's outlook and helps him or her persevere. Strategy #7: Encourage participation in peer support, 12 -Step, and other mutual -help programs. Source: American Psychological Association, 2003. Pa rt 1, Chapter 5\u2014 Clinical Issues Across Services coping strategies as soon as possible. R etrau\u00ad matization is a risk whenever clients are e x\u00ad posed to their traumatic histories without sufficient tools, supports, and safety to manage emotional, behavioral, and physical reactions. Build Resilienc e Survivors are resilient! Often, counselors andclients who are trauma survivors focus on the negative consequences of trauma while failingto recognize the perseverance and att ributes that have helped them survive. It is natural tofocus on what 's not working rather than what has worked. To promote growth after trauma and establish a strengths -based approach, fo\u00ad cus on building on clients' resilience. Current resilience theories claim that building or rei n\u00ad forcing resilience prevents further development of trauma -related symptoms and disorders.The following Advice to Counselors box is adapted from the American Psychological Association 's 2003 statement on resilience. Address Sleep Disturbances Sleep disturbances are one of the most endur\u00ading symptoms of traumatic stress and are aparticularly common outcome of severe andprolon ged trauma. Sleep disturbances increase one's risk of developing traumatic stress; they signific antly alter physical and psychological processes, thus causing problems in da ytime functioning (e.g., fatigue, cognitive difficul ty, excessive daytime sleepiness). People with sleep disturbances have worse general health and quality of life. The cardiovasc ular and immune systems, among others, may be affec t\u00ad ed as well. Sleep disturbances can worsen traumatic stress symptoms and interfere withhealing by impeding the brain 's ability to pr o\u00ad cess and consolidate traumatic memories (Caldwell & Redeker, 2005). Sleep disturbances vary among trauma surv i\u00ad vors and can include decreased ability to stay asleep, frequent awakenings, early morning unintentional awakening, trouble fallingasle ep, poor quality of sleep, and disordered 121 Advice to Counselors: Strategies To Conduct a Sleep Intervention Strategy #1: Conduct a sleep history assessment focused first on the client's perception of his or her sleep patterns. Assess whether there is difficulty initiating or staying asleep, a history of frequent or early morning awakenings, physically restless sleep, sleepwalking, bedtime aversion, and/or disrup\u00ad tive physical and emotional states upon awakening (e.g., confusion, agitation, feeling unrested ). Also determine total sleep time, pattern of nightmares, and use of medications, alcohol, and/or caffeine (see Moul, Hal l, Pikon is, & Buysse, 2004, for a review of self- report measures). Strategy #2: Use a sleep hygiene measure to determine the presence of habits that typically inte r\u00ad fere with sleep (e.g., falling asleep while watching television). The National Sleep Foundation Web site ( http://www.sleepfoundation.org ) provides simple steps for promoting good sleep hygiene .. Strategy #3: Provide education on sleep hygiene practices. Introduce clients to the idea that practi c\u00ad ing good sleep hygiene is one step toward gaining control over their sleep disturbances. Strategy #4: Reassess sleep patterns and history during the course of treatment. Sleep patterns often reflect current client status. For example, clients who are struggling are more likely to have disturbed sl eep patterns; sleep disturbances significantly influence clients' mental health status. Strategy #5: Use interventions such as nightmare rehearsals to target recurrent nightmares. There are numerous examples of imagery- based nightmare rehearsals. Clients may be instructed to r e\u00ad hearse repetitively the recurrent nightmare a few hours before bedtime. In this instruction, the client either rehearses the entire nightmare with someone or visualizes the nightmare several time s to gain control over the material and become desensitized to the content. Other strategies involve imagi n\u00ad ing a change in the outcome of the nightmare (e.g., asking the client to picture getting assistance from others, even though his or her original nightmare reflects dealing with the experience alone). Case Illustration: Selena Selena initially sought treatment for ongoing depression (dysthymia). During treatment, she identified being sexually assault ed while attending a party at college. At times, she blames herself for the inc i\u00ad dent because she didn' t insist that she and her girlfriends stay together during the party and on the way back to their dorm afterward . Selena reported that she only had two drinks that night : \"I could never manage more than two drinks before I want ed to just sleep , so I never drank much socially. \" She was assaulted by someone she barely knew but considered a \"big brother \" in the brother frate r\u00ad nity of her sorority. \"I needed a ride home. During that ride, it happened, \" she said. For years there\u00ad after, Selena reported mild bouts of depression that began lasting longer and increasing in number. She also reported nightmares and chronic difficulty in falling asleep. In therapy, she note d avoid ing her bed until she' s exhausted, saying , \"I don 't like going to sleep; I know what 's going to happen. \" She describes fear of sleeping due to nightmares. \"It's become a habit at night. I get very involved in playing computer games to lose track of time. I also leave the television on through the night b e\u00ad cause then I don't sleep as soundly and have fewer nightmares. But I 'm always exhausted.\" Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services breathing during sleep (Caldwell & Redeker, 2005). Most traumatic stress literature focuses on nightmares, insomnia, and frequent awak\u00adenings. These disturbances are connected totwo main symptoms of traumatic stress: h y\u00ad perarousal ( which causes difficulty in falling and remaining asleep) and reexperiencing the trauma (e.g., through recurrent nightmares). Other sleep disturbances trauma survivors report include sleep avoidance or resistance tosleep (see Case Illustration: Selena), panicawakenings, and restless or unwanted body movements (e.g., hitting your spouse uninten\u00adtionally in bed while asleep; Habukawa,Maeda, & Uchimura, 2010). 122 Advice to Counselors: Strategies To Build Trust Strategy #1: Clients can benefit from a support or counseling group composed of other trauma su r\u00ad vivors. By comparing themselves with others in the group, they can be inspired by those who are further along in the recovery process and helpful to those who are not faring as well as the y are . These groups also motivate clients to trust others by experiencing acceptance and empathy. Strategy #2: Use conflicts that arise in the program as opportunities. Successful negotiation of a conflict between the client and the counselor is a major milestone (van der Kolk, McFarlane, & Van der Hart, 1996). Helping clients understand that conflicts are healthy and inevitable in relationships (and that they can be resolved while retaining the dignity and respect of all involved) is a key lesson for those whose relationship conflicts have been beset by violence, bitterness, and humiliation. Strategy #3: Prepare clients for staff changes, vacations, or other separations. Some clients may feel rejected or abandoned if a counselor goes on vacation or is absent due to illness, especially during a period of vulnerability or intense work. A phone call to the client during an unexpected absence can reinforce the importance of the relationship and the client's trust. You can use these opportunities in treatment to help the client understand that separation is part of relationships; work with the client to view separation in a new light. Strategy #4: Honor the client- counselor relationship, and treat it as significant and mutual. You can support the development of trust by establishing clear boundaries, being dependable, working with the client to define explicit treatment goals and methods, and demonstrating respect for the client's difficulty in trusting you and the therapeutic setting. Pa rt 1, Chapter 5\u2014 Clinical Issues Across Services Build Trust Some traumatic experiences result from trust\u00ad ing others (e.g., interpersonal trauma). In ot h\u00ad er cases, trust was violated during or after the traumatic experience, as in cases when help was late to arrive on the scene of a natural disaster. This lack of trust can leave individ uals alienated, socially isolated, and terrified ofdeveloping relationships. Some feel that the trauma makes them different from others who haven 't had similar experiences. Sometimes, a client 's trust issues arise from a lack of trust in self\u2014for instance , a lack of trust in one 's per\u00ad ceptions, judgment, or memories. People whohave also experienced severe mental or sub\u00adstance use disorders may have difficulty trust\u00ading others because, during the course of th eir illness, they felt alienated or discriminated against for behaviors and emotions generated by or associated with the disorders. Some client groups (e.g., gay, lesbian, and b i\u00ad sexual client s; people from diverse cultures; those with serious mental illness) evidence significant mistrust because their tr ust has been repeatedly violated in the past. Traumatic experiences then compound this mistrust.Mistrust can come from various sources, is usually unstated, and, if left unaddressed, can impede treatment. For example, some clients leave treatment early or do not engage in p o\u00ad tentially beneficial treatments. Others avoidissues of trust and commitment by leavingtreatment when those issues begin to arise. Establishing a safe, trusting relationship is paramount to healing \u2014yet this takes time in the counseling process. Counselors and otherbehavioral health professionals need to be consistent throughout the course of treatment; this includes maintaining consistency in theparameters set for availability, att endance, and level of empathy. Trust is built on behaviorshown in side and outside of treatment; you should immediately address any behavior thatmay even slightly injure the relationship (e.g.,being 5 minutes late for an appointment, not responding to a phone message in a timely manner, be ing distracted in a session). 123 Case Illustration: Abby Abby, a 30- year-old, nervous -looking woman, is brought by her parents to a community mental health clinic near their home in rural Indiana. During the intake process, the counselor learns that Abby is an Army Reservist who returned from 12 months of combat duty 3 years ago. The war expe\u00ad rience changed her in many ways. Her deployment pulled her away from veterinary school as well as the strong emotional support of family, friends, and fellow classmates. She got along with her unit in Iraq and had no discipli nary problems. While there, she served as a truck driver in the Sunni Triangle. Her convoy was attacked often by small arms fire and was once struck by an improvised explosive device. Although Abby sustained only minor injuries, two of her close friends were killed. With each successive convoy, her level of fear and foreboding grew, but she continued performing as a driver. Since returning to the United States, she has mostly stayed at home and has not returned to school, although she i s helping out o n the farm with various chores. Abby has isolated herself from both family members and lifelong friends, saying she doesn't think others can understand what she went through and that she prefers being alone. She reports to her parents and the counselor that she is vaguely afraid to be in cars and feels most comfortable in her room or working alone, doing routine tasks, at home. Abby also says that she now understands how fragile life can be. She has admitted to her parents that she drinks alcohol on a regular ba sis, something she did not do before her deployment, and that on occasion, she has experienced blackouts. Abby feels she needs a drink before talking with strangers or joining in groups of friends or family. She confided to her father that she isolates herself so that she can drink without having to explain her drinking to others. The counselor recognizes Abby's general sense of lacking internal control and feeling powerless over what will happen to her in the future. He adopts a motivational interviewing style to establish rapport and a working alliance with Abby. During sessions, the counselor asks Abby to elaborate on her strengths; he reinforces strengths that involve taking action in life, positive self- statements, and comments that deal with future plans. He also introduces Abby to an Iraq War veteran who came home quite discouraged about putting his life together but has done well getting reintegrated. The counselor urges Abby go to the local VA center so that she can meet and bond with other recently returned veterans. He also encourages Abby to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, emphasi z\u00ad ing that she won't be pressured to talk or interact with others more than she chooses to. The counselor continues to see Abby every week and begins using cognitiv e-behavioral techniques to help her examine some of her irrational fears about not being able to direct her life. He asks Abby to keep a daily diary of activities related to achieving her goals of getting back to school and reestablishing a social network. In each session, Abby reviews her progress using the diary as a memory aid, and the counselor reinforces these positive efforts. After 4 months of treatment, Abby reenrolls in college and is feeling optimistic about her ability to achieve her career plans . Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services Support Empowerment Strong feelings of powerlessness can arise in trauma survivors seeking to regain some co n\u00ad trol of their lives. Whether a person has sur\u00advived a single trauma or chronic trauma, the survivor can feel crushed by the weight ofpowerlessness. Mental illness and substance abuse, too, can be disempowering; clients may feel that they 've lost control over their daily lives, over a behavior such as drug use, or over powerful emotions such as fear, sadness, oranger. Empowerment means helping clients feel greater power and control over their lives,as long as such control is within safe andhealthy bounds. A key facet of empowermentis to help clients build on their strengths. E m\u00ad powerment is more than helping clients di s\u00ad cover what they \"should \" do; it is also helping them take the steps they feel ready to take. 124 Loved one's death resulting from disaster: unexpected, untimely, sudden, and shoc k\u00ad ing (New South Wales Institute of Psych i\u00ad atry & Centre for Mental Health, 2000). Advice to Counselors: Strategies To Support Empowerment Strategy #1: Offer clients information about treatment; help them make informed choices. Placing appropriate control for treatment choices in the hands of clients improves their chances of success. Strategy #2: Give clients the chance to collaborate in the development of their initial treatment plan, in the evaluation of treatment progress, and in treatment plan updates. Incorporate client input into treatment case consultations and subsequent feedback. Strategy #3: Encourage c lients to assume an active role in how the delivery of treatment services occurs. An essential avenue is regularly scheduled and structured client feedback on program and clinical services (e.g., feedback surveys). Some of the most effective initiatives to reinforce client em\u00ad powerment are the development of peer support services and the involvement of former clients in parts of the organizational structure, such as the advisory board or other board roles. Strategy #4: Establish a sense of self -efficacy in clients; their belief in their own ability to carry out a specific task successfully \u2014is key. You can help clients come to believe in the possibility of change and in the hope of alternative approaches to achieving change. Supporting clients in accepting i n\u00ad creasing responsibility for choosing and carrying out personal change can facilitate their return to empowerment (Miller & Rollnick, 2002). Advice to Counselor s: Strategies To Acknowledge and Address Grief Strategy #1: Help the client grieve by being present, by normalizing the grief, and by a s\u00ad sessing social supports and resources. Strategy #2: When the client begins to discuss or express grief, focus on having him or her voice the losses he or she experienced due to trauma. Remember to clarify that losses include internal experiences, not just physical losses. Strategy #3: For a client who has difficulty connecting feelings to experiences, assign a feelings journal in which he or she can log and name each feeling he or she experiences, rate the feeling's intensity numerically, and describe the situation during which the feeling occurred. The client may choose to share the journal in an individual or group session. Strategy #4: Note that some clients benefit from developing a ritual or ceremony to honor their losses, whereas others prefer offering time or resources to an association that repre\u00ad sents the loss. Part 1, Chapter 5\u2014 Clinical Issues Across Services Acknowledge Grief and Bereavement The experience of loss is common after tra u\u00ad mas, whether the loss is psychological (e.g., no longer feeling safe) or physical (e.g., death of aloved one, destruction of community, physical impairment). Loss can cause public displays of grief, but it is more often a private experience. Grieving processes can be emotionally over\u00adwhelming and can lead to increased substance use and other impulsive behaviors as a way tomanage grief and other feelings associatedwith the loss. Even for people who experi\u00ad enced trauma years prior to treatment, grief is still a common psychological issue. Delayed orabsent reactions of acute grief can cause ex\u00ad haustion, lack of strength, gastrointestinal symptoms, and avoidance of emotions. Risk factors of chronic bereavement (grief lasting more than 6 months) can include: Perceived lack of social support. Concurrent crises or stressors (includingreactivation of PTSD symptoms). High levels of ambivalence about the loss. An extremely dependent relationship priorto the loss. 125 Advice to Counselors : Strategies To Monitor and Facilitate Stability Strategy #1: If destabilization occurs during the intake process or treatment, stop exploring the material that triggered the reaction, offer emotional support, and demonstrate ways for the client to self-soothe. Strategy #2: Seek consultation from superv i\u00ad sors and/or colleagues (e.g., to explore whet h\u00ad er a new case conceptualization is needed at this point). Strategy #3: Refer the client for a further a s\u00ad sessment to determine whether a referral is necessary for trauma -specific therapy or a higher level of care, or use of multiple levels of care (e.g., intensive outpatient care, partial hospitalization, residential treatmen t). Strategy #4: Focus on coping skills and e n\u00ad courage participation in a peer support program. Strategy #5: When a client become s agitated and distressed, carefully explore with the client what is causing this state. When such feelings arise because of cur rent threats in the client's life or environment, it is dangerous to halt or soothe away responses that act as warning signals (Pope & Brown, 1996). When a client is in a situation involving domestic violence, lives in a dangerous neighborhood, or has run out of money for food, he or she requires direct and concrete assistance r ather than simple em o\u00ad tional sup port. Source: Briere & Scott, 2006b. Managing Destabilization When a client becomes destabilized during a session, you can respond in the following ma n\u00ad ner: \"Let's slow down and focus on helping you be and feel safe. What can we do to allow you to take care of yourself at this moment? Then, when you feel ready, we can decide what to focus on next.\" Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services Monitor and Facilitate S tability Stability refers to an ongoing psychological and physical state whereby one is not o ver\u00ad whelmed by disruptive internal or external stimuli (Briere & Scott, 2006b ). It's common for individuals to have an increase in sym p\u00ad toms, distress, or impairment when dealingwith the impact of their trauma or talkingabout specific aspects of their trauma. There is a thin line that the cl ient and counselor need to negotiate and then walk when addressing trauma. Too much work focused on highly di stressing content can turn a desensitization process into a session that causes the client todissociate, shut down, or become emotionally overwhelmed. On the other hand, too little focus by the client or counselor can easily rei n\u00ad force avoidance and confirm the client 's inte r\u00ad nal belief that it is too dangerous to deal withthe aftermath of the trauma. Clients should have some psychological stabi l\u00ad ity to engage in trauma -related work. An i m\u00ad portant distinction can be made between a normative increase in symptoms (e.g., the ty p\u00ad ical up -and-down course of traumatic stress reactions or substance abuse) and destabiliz a\u00ad tion (dangerous, significant decrease in fun c\u00ad tioning). of destabilization include(Green Cross Academy of Traumatology,2007; Najavits, 2002b ): Increased substance use or other unsafe behavior (e.g., self -harm). Increased psychiatric symptoms (e.g., de\u00ad pression, agitation, anxiety, withdraw al, anger). Increased symptoms of trauma (e.g., severedissociation). Helplessness or hopelessness expressedverbally or behaviorally. Difficulty following through on commi t\u00ad ments (e.g., commitment to attend trea t\u00ad ment sessions). Isolation. Notable decline in daily activities (e.g.,self-care, hygiene, care of children or pets, going to work). 126 Advice to Counselors : Strategies To Foster Engagement Strategy #1: According to Mahalik (2001), the standard method of handling clients' la ck of engagement is exploring it with them, clari \u00ad fying the situation through discussion with them, reinterpreting (e.g., from \"can't\" to \"won't\" to \"willing\"), and working through the situation toward progress. Strategy #2: To improve engagement into treatment, try motivational interviewing and enhancement techniques. For additional in\u00ad formation on such techniques, see TIP 35, En\u00ad hancing Motivation for Change in Substance Abuse Treatment (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment [CSAT], 1999b). Pa rt 1, Chapter 5\u2014 Clinical Issues Across Services Treatment Issues The treatment environment itself can signif i\u00ad cantly affect how clients experience traumatic stress and how the client responds to trea t\u00ad ment. Some specific issues related to workingwith trauma survivors in a clinical setting arediscussed in the following sections. Client Engagement A lack of engagement in treatment is the cli\u00adent's inability to make progress t oward trea t\u00ad ment goals, deal with important topics intreatment, or complete treatment. Clients whohave histories of trauma will express ambiv a\u00ad lence about treatment similarly to others, e x\u00ad cept that clients who have traumatic stress canfeel more \"stuck \" and perceive themselves as having fewer options. In addition, clients maybe avoiding engagement in treatment because it is one step closer to addressing their trauma.You should attend to the client 's motivation to change, implement strategies that address a m\u00ad bivalence toward treatment, and use approac h\u00ad es that help clients overcome avoidant behavior. Pacing and Timing Although your training or role as a counselor may prohibit you from providing trauma - specific services, you must still be prepared forthe fact that clients are not as focused on when or where it is most appropriate to a d\u00ad dress trauma \u2014they want relief, and most lay and p rofessional people have been taught that the only path to recovery is disclosure. Some clients are reluctant to talk about anythingassociated with their histories of trauma. Ot h\u00ad er clients immediately want to delve into the memories of their trauma without developing a safe environment. The need to gain any relieffor the traumatic stress pushes some individ u\u00ad als to disclose too quickly , without having the necessary support and coping skills to manage the intensity of their memories. Clients whoenter treatm ent and immediately disclose past trauma often don 't return because the initial encounter was so intense or because they e x\u00ad perienced considerable emotional distress for several days afterward and /or in anticipation of the next session. Proper pacing of sessions, disclosure, and i n\u00ad tensity is paramount. Clients who immediat e\u00ad ly disclose without proper safety nets are actually retraumatizing themselves by relivingthe experience without adequate support \u2014 often placing themselves in the same circu m\u00ad stances that occurred during the actual tra u\u00ad mas they experienced . Although you should not ada mantly direct client s not to talk about what happened, it is important to discuss with the client s, even if you have to interrupt them empathically and respectfully, the poten tial consequences of disclosing too soon and too fast. Ask whether they have done this before,and then inquire about the outcome. Rei n\u00ad force with clients that trauma heals when there are support, trust, and skills in place to manage the memories of the traumatic exper i\u00ad ences. Ideally, disclosure begins after these elements are secured, but realistically, it is a 127 balancing act for both the counselor and client as to when and how much should be a d\u00ad dressed in any given session. Remember not to inadvertently give a message that it is too da n\u00ad gerous to talk about trauma ; instead , reinforce the importance of addressing trauma without further retraumatization. Advice to Counselors : Strategies To Establish Appropriate Pacing and Timing Strategy #1: Frequently discuss and request feedback from clients about pacing and timing. Moving too quickly into discussion of the trauma can increase the risk of dissociation, overactivation of memories, and feeling over whelmed. Strategy #2: Use the SUDS as a barometer of intensity to determine the level of work. Strategy #3: Slowly increase the speed of interventions and continually adjust the intensity of inter\u00ad ventions; move in and out of very intense work, or use strategies that decrease the intensity when necessary. One approach that typically decreases the int ensity of traumatic memories is to ask the individual to imagine that he or she is seeing the scene through a window or on a television screen. This helps decrease intensity and the risk of dissociation. It provides an opportunity for the client to view th e trauma from a different perspective and a strategy to use outside of treatment to shift f rom reliving the trauma to observing it from a neutral position. Strategy #4: Monitor clients to ensure that treatment does not overwhelm their internal capacities, retraumatize them, or result in excessive avoidance; make sure therapy occurs in the \"therapeutic window\" (Briere & Scott, 2006b). Strategy #5: Be alert to signs that discussions of trauma, including screening, assessment, and i n\u00ad take processes, are going too fast. Mild to moderate signs are: Missing counseling appointments after discussions of important material. Periods of silence. Dissociation. Misunderstanding what are usually understandable concepts. Redirecting the focus of the discussion when certa in issues arise. Strategy #6: Observe the client's emotional state. Slow down; seek consultation if the client exhibits: Persistent resistance to addressing trauma symptoms. Repetitive flashbacks. Increase in dissociation. Regression. Difficulty in daily functioning (e.g., trouble maintaining everyday self-care tasks). Substance use relapses. Self-harm or suicidal thoughts/behaviors (e.g., talking about suicide). Strategy #7: Use caution and avoid (Briere, 1996b, p. 115): Encouraging clients to describe traumatic material in detail before they can deal with the cons e\u00ad quences of disclosure. Using overly stressful interventions (e.g., intensive role -plays, group confrontation, guided imagery). Confrontations or interpretations that are too challenging given the client's current functioning. Demanding that the client work harder and stop resisting.

Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services Length of Treat ment Many factors influence decisions regarding the length of treatment for a given client. Severity of addiction, type of substance abused, type of trauma, age at which the trauma occurred,level of social support, and the existence of 128 Memories of Trauma Points for c ounselors to remember are: Some people are not able to completely remember past events, particularly events that occurred during high -stress and d e\u00ad stabilizing moments. In addition to exploring the memories themselves, it can be beneficial to explore how a memory of an event helps the client understand his or her feeling, thinking, and behaving in the present. Persistently trying to recall all the details of a traumatic event can impair focus on the present. Pa rt 1, Chapter 5\u2014 Clinical Issues Across Services mental disorders all influence length of treat\u00ad ment. External factors, such as transportation and childcare, caps on insurance coverage, andlimitations in professional resources, can also affect length of treatment. In general, longertreatment experiences should be expected for clients who have histories of multiple or early traumas , meet diagnostic criteria for multiple Axis I or Axis II diagnoses , and/ or require intensive case management. Most of the em\u00adpirically studied and/or manual -based models described in the next chapter are short -term models (e.g., lasting several months); however,ongoing care is indicated for clients with more complex co -occurring trauma disorders. Traumatic Memories One of the most controversial issues in the trauma field is the phenomenon of \"recovered memories\" or \"traumatic amnesia \" (Brewin, 2007). Practitioners working with traumatizedindividuals are particularly concerned aboutthe possibility of new memories of the tra u\u00ad matic event emerging during the course oftherapy and the possibility of these memories being induced by the clinician. Scientific r e\u00ad views indicate that people can experience a m\u00ad nesia and delayed recall for some memories of awide variety of traumas, including military combat and prisoner of war experiences, natural disasters and accidents, ch ildhood sexual abuse, and political torture (Bowman & Mertz, 1996;Brewin, 2007; Karon & Widener, 1997;McNally, 2005). In some cases, the survivorwill not remember some of what happened,and the counselor may need to help the clientface the prospect of never knowing all there is to know about the past and accept moving on with what is known. Legal Issues Legal issues can emerge during treatment. A client, for instance, could seek to prosecute aperpetrator of trauma (e.g., for domestic vi o-lence) or to sue for damages sustained in an a ccident or natural disaster. The counselor 's role is not to provide legal advice, but rather,to offer support during the process and, ifneeded, refer the client to appropriate legal help (see Advice to Counselors box on p. 131). A legal matter can dominate the treatmentatmosphere for its duration. Some clients have difficulty making progress in treatment until most or all legal matters are resolved and no longer act as ongoing stressors. Forgiveness Clients may have all sorts of reactions to what has happened to them. They may feel grateful for the help they received, joy at having sur\u00advived, and dedication to their recovery. At theother extreme, they may have fantasies of r e\u00ad venge, a loss of belief that the world is a goo d place, and feelings of rage at what has ha p\u00ad pened. They may hold a wide variety of beliefs associated with these feelings. One issue that comes up frequently among counselors is whether to encourage clients toforgive. The issue of forgiveness is a very del i\u00ad cate one. It is key to allow survivors their feel\u00adings, even if they conflict with the counselor 's own responses. Some may choose to forgive the perpetrator, whereas others may remainangry or seek justice through the courts andother legal means. Early in recovery from 129 Advice to Counselors: Strategies To Manage Traumatic Memories Strategy #1: Most people who were sexually abused as children remember all or part of what hap\u00ad pened to them, although they do not necessarily fully understand or disclose it. Do not assume that the role of the clinician is to investigate, corroborate, or substantiate allegations or memories of abuse (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000b). Strategy #2: Be aware that forgotten memories of childhood abuse can be remembered years later. Clinicians should maintain an empathic, nonjudgmental, neutral stance toward reported memories of sexual abuse or other trauma. Avoid prejudging the cause of the client's difficulties or the veracity of the client's reports. A counselor's prior belief that physical or sexual abuse, or other factors, are or are not the cause of the client's problems can interfere with appropriate assessment and treatment (APA, 2000b). Strategy #3: Focus on assisting clients in coming to their own conclusio ns about t he accuracy of their memories or in adapting to uncertainty regarding what actually occurred. The therapeutic goal is to help clients understand the impact of the memories or abuse experiences on their lives and to reduce their detrimental conseq uences in the present and future (APA, 2000b). Strategy #4: Some clients have concerns about whether or not a certain traumatic event did or did not happen. In such circumstances, educate clients about traumatic memories, including the fact that memories a ren't always exact representations of past events; subsequent events and emotions can have the effect of altering the original memory. Inform clients that it is not always possible to deter\u00ad mine whether an event occurred but that treatment can still be effe ctive in alleviating distress. Strategy #5: There is evidence that suggestibility can be enhanced and pseudomemories can devel\u00ad op in some individuals when hypnosis is used as a memory enhancement or retrieval strategy. Hyp\u00ad nosis and guided imagery techniques can enhance relaxation and teach self- soothing strategies with some clients; however, use of these techniques is not recommended in the active exploration of memories of abuse (Academy of Traumatology, 2007). Strategy #6: When clients are highly distressed by intrusive flashbacks of delayed memori es, help them move through the distress. Teach coping strategies and techniques on how to tolerate strong affect and distress (e.g., mindfulness practices). Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services trauma, it is best to direct clients toward f o\u00ad cusing on stabilization and a return to normal functioning; suggest that, if possible, they d e\u00ad lay major decisions about forgiveness until they have a clearer mind for making decisions (Herman, 1997). Even in la ter stages of reco v\u00ad ery, it 's not essential for the client to forgive in order to recover. Forgiveness is a personal choice independent of recovery. Respect cli\u00adents' personal beliefs and meanings; don 't push clients to forgive or impose your own beliefs about forgiveness onto clients. In the long -term healing process, typically months or years after the trauma(s), fo r\u00ad giveness may become part of the discussion for some people and some communities. For ex\u00adample, in South Africa, years after the bitterand bloo dy apartheid conflicts, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established by the Government. Public hearings created di a\u00ad log and aired what had been experienc ed as a means, ultimately, to promote forgiveness andcommunity healing. By addressing very dif fi\u00ad cult topics in public, all could potentially benefit from the discourse. Similarly, a pare n\u00ad tal survivor of the Oklahoma City bombingwas, at first, bitter about his daughter 's early, unfair, and untimely death. Today, he gives talks around the world about the abolition of the death penalty. He sat with convicted 130 Advice to Counselors : Strategies To Manage Legal Proceedings Strategy #1: If you're aware of legal proceedings, you can play a key role in helping your client pr e\u00ad pare emotionally for their impact, such as what it might be like to describe the trauma to a judge or jury, or how to cope with seeing the perpetrator in court. When helping a client prepare, however, be careful not to provide legal advice. Strategy #2: Help clients separate a successful legal outcome from a successful treatment outcome. If clients connect these two outcomes, difficulties can arise. For example, a client may discontinue treatment after his or her assailant is sentenced to serve prison time, believing that the symptoms will abate without intervention. Strategy #3: If clients express interest in initiating a civil or criminal suit, encourage them to consider the ways in which they are and are not prepared for this, including their own mental states, capacity for resilienc e, and inevitable loss of confidentiality (Pope & Brown, 1996). Inform clients coping with legal issues that involvement in the legal process can be retraumatizing. Strategy #4: Emphasize, for trauma survivors who are involved in legal proceedings against an as\u00ad sailant, that \"not guilty\" is a legal finding \u2014it is based on the degree of available evidence and is not a claim that certain events in question did not occur. They should also receive, from an attorney or other qualified individual, information on: The nature of the legal process as it pertains to the clients' specific cases. The estimated duration and cost of legal services, if applicable. What to expect during police investigations. Court procedures. Full information on all possible outcomes. What to expect during cross -examination. Strategy #5: Counselors can be called on to assist with a legal case involving trauma. The court may require you to provide treatment records, to write a letter summarizing your client's progress, or to testify at a trial. Always seek supervisory and legal advice in such situations and discuss with the cl i\u00ad ent the possible repercussions that this might have for the therapeutic relationship. As a general rule, it is best practice to avoid dual roles or relationships. Part 1, Chapter 5\u2014 Clinical Issues Across Services bomber Timothy McVeigh 's father while the man's son was executed in Indiana at a Federal prison several years after the bombing. For this man, forgiveness and acceptance helped him attain personal peace. Other trauma survivors may choose never to forgive what happened, and this, too, is a legitimate response. Culturally and Gender Responsive Services Culture is the lens through which reality is interpreted. Without an understanding of cu l\u00ad ture, it is difficult to gauge how individualsorganize, interpret, and resolve their traumas. The challenge is to define how culture affects individuals who have been traumatized . Increased knowledge of PTSD (Wilson &Tang, 2007), mental illness, and substance use disorders and recovery (Westermeyer, 2004)requires behaviora l health practitioners to co n\u00ad sider the complicated interactions betweenculture, person ality, mental illness, and sub\u00ad stance abuse in adapting treatment protocols.This section offers some general guidelines forworking with members of cultures other than one's own. Treatment for traumatic stress, mental illness, substance use disorders, and co - occurring trauma -related symptoms is more effective if it is culturally responsive. 131 Cultural Competence Cultural competence includes a counselor's knowledge of: Whether the client is a survivor of cultural trauma (e.g., genocide, war, government oppression, torture, terrorism). How to use cultural brokers (i.e., authorities within the culture who can help interpret cultural patterns and serve as liaisons to those outside the culture). How trauma is viewed by an individual's sociocultural support network. How to differentiate PTSD, trauma -related symptoms, and other mental disorders in the culture. For more specific information on cultural co m\u00ad petenc e in trauma therapy, see Brown ( 2008). Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2003) has defined the term \"cultural competence \" as follows: Cultural competence is a set of values, beha v\u00ad iors, attitudes, and practices within a system, organization, program, or among individualsthat enables people to work effectively acrosscultures. It refers to the ability to honor andrespect the beliefs, language, interpersonal styles, and behaviors of individuals and fam i\u00ad lies receiving services, as well as staff who areproviding such services. Cultural competenceis a dynamic, ongoing, developmental processthat requires a long -term commitment and is achieved over time (p. 12). Cultural competence is a process that begins with an awareness of one 's own culture and beliefs and includes an understanding of how those beliefs affect one 's attitudes toward peo\u00ad ple of other cultures. It is rooted in respect, validation, and openness toward someone whose social and cultural background is differ\u00adent from one 's own. For a thorough revie w of cultural competence, see the planned TIP , Im\u00ad proving Cultural Competence (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA] , planned c). In some cultures, an individual 's needs t ake precedence over group needs (Hui & Triandis,1986), and problems are seen as deriving from the self. In other cultures, however, complexfamily, kin, and community systems take prec\u00adedence over individual needs. Considerable heterogeneity exists within and across mostethnic subcultures and across lines of g ender, class, age, and political groups (CSAT, 1999b).Subcultures abound in every culture, such as gangs ; populations that are homeless or use substances; orphaned or disenfranchised peo\u00adple; religious, ethnic, and sexual minorities;indigenous people; and refugee and immigrantpopulations. Some subcultures have more incommon with similar subcultures in other countries than with their own cultures (e.g.,nonheterosexual populations). Trauma and substance abuse can themselves be a basis for affiliation with a subculture. De Girolamo (1993) reports that \"disaster subcu l\u00ad tures\" exist within many cultures. These cul\u00ad tures of victimization, like all subcultures, have unique worldviews, codes of conduct, and pe r\u00ad ceptions of the larger society. In a disaster sub\u00adculture, people are, to some extent, inured todisaster and heedless of warnings of impen d\u00ad ing disaster. For example, riverbank erosion inBangladesh displaces thousands of people eachyear, yet few believe that it is a serious problem or that the displacement will be permanent(Hutton, 2000). Israelis who have lived withunpredictable violence for many years behave differently in public areas and have adapted todifferent norms than people who don't co m\u00ad monly exp erience violence (Young, 2001). Many people identify with more than one subculture. Some identify with a particularculture or subculture, but not with all of its values. Individual identities are typically a mo\u00adsaic of factors, including developmental achievements, life experiences, behavioral health histories, trauma tic experiences, and 132 Part 1, Chapter 5\u2014 Clinical Issues Across Services Community- Based Treatment for Native American Historical Trauma Key beliefs in community healing: Clients carry childhood pain that has led to adult dysfunction. Childhood pain must be confronted, co n\u00ad fessed, and addressed , if relief is to be obtained. Cathartic expression is the initial step in the healing journey toward a lifelong pursuit of introspection and self -improvement. The healing journey entails reclamation of indigenous heritage, identity, spirituality, and practices to remedy the pathogenic ef\u00ad fects of colonization and other sources of historical trauma. Source: Gone, 2009 . alcohol and illicit drug use ; levels of accultur a\u00ad tion and/or assimilation vary from one ind i\u00ad vidual to the next as well. Importance of the trauma aftermath Counselors working in the immediate after\u00ad math of trauma \u2014whether individual, group, or community in nature\u2014 face many challenges. For example, survivors may be forced to adjustwithout access to other health services, em\u00adployment, support, or insurance. In these i n\u00ad stances, counselors must often work with individuals and communities coping with thetrauma while struggling daily to meet basic needs. Research suggests that reestablishing ties to family, community, culture, and spiritual systems can not only be vital to the individual,but can also influence the impact of the tra u\u00ad ma upon future generations. For example,Baker and Gippenre iter (1998) studied the descend ants of people victimized by Joseph Stalin 's purge. They found that families who were able to maintain a sense of connection and continuity with grandparents affected by the purge experienced fewer negative effects than did those who were emotionally or physi\u00ad cally severed from their grandparents. The researchers also found that whether the grandparents survived was less important thanthe connection the grandchildren managed tokeep to their past. Ties to family and comm u\u00ad nity can also have an adverse effect, especially if the family or community downplays the trauma or blames the victim. Counselors need to have a full understanding of available sup\u00adport before advocating a particular approach. Treatment strategies Many tradition al healing ways have been damaged, forgotten, or lost \u2014yet much wi s\u00ad dom remains. Drawing on the best traditional and contemporary approaches to human di s\u00ad tress and defining culturally competent curri c\u00ad ula regarding identity and healing (Huriwai,2002; Wilson & Tang, 2007) both require respect and appreciation for the many w ays in which various people characterize and resolve trauma and how they use addictive substances to bear the burdens of human distress. It is not yet known how well existing PTSD treatments work for individuals who identify primarily with cultures other than mainstream America n culture . It is possible that such treatments do work for clients of other cul\u00adtures, though some cultural adaptation andtranslation may be required. For example, some PTSD treatments that have been used with subculture groups without adaptationother than language translation and that a p\u00ad pear to be effective across cultures include eye movement desensitization and reprocessing(Bleich, Gelkopf, & Solomon, 2003 ) and Seeking Safety (Daouest et al., 2012). Gender Gender differences exist in traumatic stress,mental disorders, and substance use disorders.For example, women have higher rates ofPTSD, whereas men have higher rates of sub\u00adstance abuse (Kessler, Chiu, Demler,Merikangas, & Walters, 2005; Stew art, Ouimette, & Brown, 2002; Tolin & Foa, 2006). 133 Working With Clients From Diverse Cultures: Trauma and Substance Abuse In socially appropriate ways, educate clients, their loved ones, and possibly members of their extended community about the relationship between substance abuse and PTSD, how substance abuse is often used to cope with trauma, and what treatment entails . Make serious efforts to connect clients to supportive and understanding people (preferably within culturally identified groups). Help clients understand that many who have not experienced trauma or do not have s ubstance use disorders will not understand the psychological, spiritual, and interpersonal insights that they have gained during their recovery processes. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services The types of interpersonal trauma experienced by men and by women are often different. Anumber of studies (Kimerling, Ouimette, &Weitlauf, 2007) indicate that men experien ce more combat and crime victimization and women experience more physical and/or sex u\u00ad al assault \u2014implying that men 's traumas often occur in public, whereas the traumatization of women is more likely to take place in a private setting , such as a home. Men 's abusers are more often strangers. Those who abuse wo m\u00ad en, on the other hand, are more often in a rela\u00adtionship with them. Women (and girls) oftenare told , \"I love you,\" during the same time period when the abuse occurs. However, wo m\u00ad en now serve in the military and thus are i n\u00ad creasingly subject to some of the same traumas as men and also to military sexual trauma,which is much more common for women to experience. Similarly, men can be subject todomestic violence or sexual abuse. In treatment, gender considerations are rel e\u00ad vant in a variety of ways , including, but not limited to, the role and impact of societal gen\u00ad der stereotypes upon assessment processes,treatment initiation, and engagement of se r\u00ad vices (e.g., peer support systems); the selection and implementation of gender -specific and gender -responsive approaches for both men and women at each level of intervention; andthe best selection of trauma -related for gender -specific diffe r\u00ad ences related to traumatic stress. For an extensive review and discussion of gender - specif ic and gender -responsive care for tra u\u00admatic stress and substance use, see the TIP 51, Substance Abuse Treatment: Addressing theSpecific Needs of Women (CSAT, 2009d), and TIP 56, Addressing the Specific Behavioral Health Needs of Men (SAMHSA, 2013a). Beyo nd the complexities of gender consider a\u00ad tions, one must also consider whether clients should be given the choice of working with amale or a female counselor. Some clients who have been traumatized have no preference,particularly if their trauma wasn 't associated with gender (e.g., a natural disaster, act of te r\u00ad rorism, fire, serious accident). If gender did play a role in trauma (e.g., childhood sexual abuse), clients can have strong fears of wor k\u00ad ing with a counselor who is the same genderas the perpetrato r. Many women who exper i\u00ad enced sexual abuse (whose perpetrators are typically men) feel uncomfortable being trea t\u00ad ed by men because of the intense emotions that can be evoked (e.g., anger, fear). Men whoexperienced sexual abuse (whose perpetratorsare also typically men) can feel uncomfortable for the same reasons, or they may feel shame when talking to men due to feelings evoked about masculinity, homosexuality, and so forth.However, not all clients with trauma histories prefer female therapists. Discuss with clients the possible risks (e.g., initial emotional discomfort) and benefits of being treated by a woman or man (e.g., devel\u00adoping a therapeutic relationship with a manmight challenge a client 's belief that all men are dangerous) , and, if possible, let them then choose the gender of their counselor. Tell 134 Part 1, Chapter 5\u2014 Clinical Issues Across Services them that if they experience initial emotional discomfort, and the discomfort does not d e\u00ad crease, they can switch to a counselor of the opposite gender. For group therapy that focuses on trauma, similar considerations apply. Gene r\u00ad ally, gender -specific groups are recommended when possible, but mixed -gender groups also work. Gender also comes into play in substance abuse treatment. Research and clinical observ a\u00ad tion indicate that significant gender differen ces occur in many facets of substance abuse and its treatment. For example, men and women exp e\u00ad rience different physical repercussions of sub\u00adstance use (e.g., women have more healthproblems), different trajectories (e.g., womenbecome addicted more quickly), and differenttreatment considerations (e.g., traditional su b\u00ad stance abuse treatment was designed for men). Sexual orientation Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender(LGBT) clients face specific issues in beha v\u00ad ioral health treatment settings, including his\u00ad tories of abuse and discrimination relating tosexual orientation, homophobia in treatmenton the part of counselors or other clients, p o\u00ad tential difficulty addressing trauma tic exper i\u00ad ences related to their sexuality or sexual orientation, and often, a significant lack of trust toward others. LGBT people sometimes think that others can 't understand them and their specific needs and thus are reluctant to engage in treatment programs in which theclientele is predominantly heterosexual. Someclients react with judgment, anger, or emba r\u00ad rassment when an LGBT client attempts todescribe sexual trauma relating to homosexual behavior, making it even harder for LGBT clients to describe their experiences. Often, individual counseling can address issues the LGBT cl ient isn 't comfortable discussing in group treatment. \"Providing one -on-one services may decrease the difficulty of mixingheterosexual and LGBT clients in treatment groups and decrease the likelihood that heter o\u00ad sexism or homophobia will become an issue \" (CSAT, 2001, p. 56). For more on treatingLGBT individuals, see A Provider 's Introdu c\u00ad tion to Substance Abuse Treatment for Lesbian,Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Individuals(CSAT, 2001). Making Referrals to Trauma -Specific Services Many people who experience trauma do notexhibit persistent traumatic stress symptoms.In fact, people do recover on their own. So how do you determine who is at higher risk for developing more persistent symptoms oftraumatic stress, trauma -related disorders, and traumatic stre ss disorders? One main factor is the severity of symptoms at the time ofscreen ing and assessment. Other factors, be\u00ad yond trauma characteristics and pretrauma individual characteristics, t o consider in ma k\u00ad ing referral s include (Ehlers & Clark, 2003): Cognitive appraisals that are excessively negative regarding trauma sequelae, inclu d\u00ad ing consequences, changes after theevent(s), responses of other people to thetrauma, and symptoms. Acknowledgment of intrusive memories. Engagement in behaviors that rei nforce or prevent resolution of trauma , including avoidance, dissociation, and substance use. History of physical consequences of trauma(e.g., chronic pain, disfigurement, healthproblems). Experiences of more traumas or stressful life events after the p rior trauma. Identification of co-occurring mood diso r\u00ad ders or serious mental illness. The next chapter provides an overview oftrauma -specific services to complement this chapter and to provide trauma -informed counselors with a general knowledge of trauma -specific treatment approaches. 135 IN THIS CHAPTER Introduction Trauma -Specific Treatment Models Integrated Models for Trauma Emerging Interventions Concluding Note 6 Trauma -Specific Services This chapter covers various treatment approaches designed specif i\u00ad cally to treat trauma -related symptoms, trauma -related disorders, and specific disorders of traumatic stress. The models presented do not comprise an exhaustive list, but rather , serve as examples. These models require training and supervised experience to be conducted safely and effectively. The chapter begins with a sectionon trauma -specific treatment models, providing a brief overview of interventions that can be delivered immediately after a trauma , as well as trauma -specific interventions for use beyond the immediate crisis. The second segment focuses on integrated care that targets trauma -specific treatment for mental, substance use, and co - occurring disorders. Even though entry -level, trauma -informe d behavioral health service providers are unlikely to be in a positionto use these interventions, having some knowledge of them is nev\u00adertheless important. Currently, more research is needed to tease out the most important ingredients of early intervention s and their role in the prevention of more pervasive traumatic stress symp\u00ad toms. More science- based evidence is available for trauma- specific treatments that occur and extend well beyond the immediate rea c\u00ad tions to trauma. The last part of the chapter provid es a brief review of selected emerging interventions that have not been coveredelsewhere in th is Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP ). Introduction Trauma -specific therapies vary in their approaches and objectives. Some are present focused, some are past focused, and some are combinations (Najavits, 2007 a). Present -focused approaches pr i\u00ad marily address current coping skills, psychoeducation, and mana g\u00ad ing symptoms for better functioning. Past-focused approaches primarily focus on telling the trauma story to understand the i m\u00ad pact of the trauma on how the person functions today, experien c\u00ad ing emotions that were too overwhelming to experience in the past,and helping clients more effectively cope in the present with their 137 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services Trauma -Informed Care Framework in Behavioral Health Services \u2014Trauma - Specific Services traumatic experience s. Clients participating in present -focused approaches may reveal some of their stories; past-focused approaches e m\u00ad phasize how understanding the past influences current behavior, emotion, and thinking,thereby helping clients cope more effectively with traumatic experiences in the pr esent. The distinction between these approaches lies in the primary emphasis of the approach. D e\u00ad pending on the nature of the trauma and thespecific needs of the client, one approach may be more suitable than the other. For instance,in short -term treatment for clients in early recovery from mental illness and/or substance abuse, present -focused, cognitive -behavioral, or psychoeducational approaches are generally more appropriate. For clients who are stable intheir re covery and have histories of develo p\u00admental trauma where much of the trauma has been repressed, a past -focused orientation may be helpful. Some clients may benefit from both types, either concurrently or sequentially. This chapter discusses a number of treatment models, general approaches, and techniques. Atreatment model is a set of practices designedto alleviate symptoms, promote psychological well-being, or restore mental health. Trea t\u00ad ment techniques are specific procedures thatcan be used as part of a variety of models.Some models and techniques described in this chapter can be used with groups, some withindividuals, and some with both. This chapteris selective rather than comprehensive; add i\u00ad tional models are described in the literature. See, for example, the PILOTS database on the Web site of the National Center for PTSD 138 Federal Agencies Both the American Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) re\u00ad spond to disasters. Behavioral health service providers should understand the basics about these major emergency response agencies. For example, the Red Cros s can respond rapidly with fund ing for food, shelter, and immediate needs, whereas FEMA assistance r equires a period of gearing up but provides for longer - term needs. SAMHSA, along with o ther Federal agencies, assists FEMA in a number of areas of emergency response planning activities. See also SAMHSA's Disaster T echnical Assistance Center Web site ( http://www.samhsa.gov/dtac) and Technical Assistance Publication 34, Disas\u00ad ter Planning Handbook for Behavioral Health Treatment Programs (SAMHSA, 2013) . Pa rt 1, Chapter 6\u2014Trauma -Specific Services (NCPTSD; http://www.ptsd.va.gov ) for treatment literature related to trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). For an overview of models for use with both adult and child populations, refer to Models for D e\u00ad veloping Trauma -Informed Behavioral Health Systems and Trauma -Specific Services (Center for Mental Health Services, 2008). Some treatments discussed in this chapter are described as evidence based. Because research on integrated treatment models is so new, many have only been examined in a few studies. Gi v\u00ad en these circumstances and the fact that an outcome study provides only limited evidenceof efficacy, the term \"evide nce based \" should be interpreted cautiously. Additional scientific study is needed to determine whether some treatments discussed herein are, in fact, ev i\u00ad dence based. A good resource for evaluating evidence -based , trauma -specific treatment models is Effect ive Treatments for PTSD (Foa, Keane, Friedman, & Cohen, 2009) . Although evidence -based interventions should be a pr i\u00ad mary consideration in selecting appropriatetreatment models for people with symptoms of trauma that co -occur with mental and sub\u00ad stance use disorders (see Allen, 2001, for anindepth discussion of trauma and serious men\u00ad tal illness), other factors must also be weighed, including the specific treatment needs of the client; his or her history of trauma, psychosocial and cultural background, and experiences in prior trauma treatment; the overall treatmentplan for the client; and the competencies of the program 's clinical staff. Although behavioral health counselors can prepare to help their cli\u00adents address some of the issues discussed in Chapter 5, specialized training is necessary toprovide treatment for co -occurring substance use and mental disorders related to trauma. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Ser\u00ad vices Administration (SAMHSA) has created the National Regis try of Evidence -Based Pr o-grams and Practices (NREPP) as a resource forre viewing and identifying effective treatment programs. Programs can be nominated for co n\u00ad sideration as co -occurring disorders programs or substance abuse prevention or treatmentprogram s, and their quality of evidence, read i\u00ad ness for dissemination, and training consider a\u00ad tions are then reviewed. For more detailed information, including details about severalevidence -based co -occurring trauma treatment programs, visit the NREPP Web site (http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov ). Program mo d\u00ad els for specialized groups, such as adolescents,can also be found on the NREPP Web site. For specific research -oriented information on trauma -specific treatments, refer to Part 3 of this TIP , which provides a literature review andlinks to select abstracts (available online). Trauma -Specific Treatment Models Immediate Interventions Intervention in the first 48 hours The acute intervention period comprises t he first 48 hours after a traumatic event. In a 139 \"One day I was called out of bed at 5:00 a.m. to go to a town approximately 30 miles away because a levee had broken.... By 6:00 a.m., my colleagues and I were there with many of the townspeople, with helicopters flying overhead, with t rucks going in and out by the main road trying to empty the factories. When we got there, as far as you could see was farmland. By 11 a.m., you could see a 'lake' in the di s\u00ad tance. By 2 p.m., the water was on the edge of the town. Being there, at that town, before, during, and after the water came was probably the most valuable function we performed. We were able to share in the grief of the hundreds of people as we stayed with them while their fields, houses, and workplaces were flooded. We witnessed the death of a town, and the people reacted with disbelief, anger, sad\u00ad ness, and numbness. Each person had a different story, but all grieved, and we provided many an o p\u00ad portunity to express it. People cried as the water started rising into their houses. Some had to watch. Some had to leave. At times it was utterly silent as we all waited. There was a woman whose parents sent her away during the floods of '43 and she had been angry for 50 years about it. She was deter\u00ad mined that her children and grandchildren would see everything. I spent 12 hours that day just giving support, listening, giving information, and sometimes shedding a tear or two myself.\" \u2014Rosemary Schwartzbard, Ph.D ., responde r to in 1993 Source: Schwartzbard, 1997 . Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services disaster, rescue operations usually begin with local agencies prior to other organizations ar\u00ad riving on the scene. Law enforcement is likely to take a primary role on site. Whether it is a disaster, group trauma, or individual trauma (including a trauma that affects an entire fam i\u00ad ly, such as a house fire), a hierarchy of needs should be established: survival, safety, security,food, shelter, health (physical and mental), or i\u00ad entation of survivors to immediate local ser\u00advices, and communication with family, friends,and community (National Institute of MentalHealth, 2002). In this crucial time, appropriate interventions include educating survivors aboutresources; educating other providers, such asfaith-based org anizations and social service groups, to screen for increased psychological effects including use of substances; and use of atrauma response team that assists clients withtheir immediate needs. No formal interventions should be attempted at this time, but a profe s\u00ad sionally trained, empathic listener can offer solace and support (Litz & Gray, 2002). Basic needs Basic necessities, such as shelter, food, and water , are key to survival and a sense of safety. It is important to focus on meeting these basic needs and on providing a supportive enviro n\u00adment. Clients' access to prescribed medications may be interrupted after a trauma, particularly a disaster , so providers should identify clients' medication needs for preexisting physical andmental disorders, including metha done or other pharmacological treatment for substance use. For example, after September 11, 2001,substance abuse treatment program admini s\u00ad trators in New York had to seek alternative methadone administration options (Frank,Dewart, Schmeidler, & Demirjian, 2006). Psychological first aid The psychological first aid provided in the first 48 hours after a disaster is designed toensure safety, provide an emotionally suppor t\u00ad ive environment and activities, identify those with high -risk reactions, and facilitate com\u00ad munication, including strong, reassuring lea d\u00ad ership immediately after the event. The primary helping response of psychological firstaid is to provide a calm, caring, and supportiveenvironment to set the scene for psychological recovery. It is also essential that all those first responding to a trauma \u2014rescue workers, med\u00ad ical professionals, behavioral health workers (including substance abuse counselors), jour\u00adnalists, and volunteers \u2014be familiar with rel e\u00ad vant aspects of traumatic stress.

Advice to Counselors: Evidence Related to Immediate Interventions Evidence related to immediate interventions suggests that: Early, brief, focused psychotherapeutic intervention provided in an individual or group format can reduce distress in b e\u00ad reaved spouses, parents, and children. Selected cognitive -behavioral approaches may help reduce the incidence, duration, and severity of acute stress disorder (ASD), PTSD, and depression in trauma survivors. A one -session individual recital of events and expression of emotions evoked by a traumatic event does not consistently r e\u00ad duce risk of later developing PTSD. In fact, it may increase the risk for adverse ou t\u00ad comes. Perhaps CISD hinders the natural recovery mechanisms that restore pretra u\u00ad ma functioning (Bonanno, 2004). The focus initially should be upon screen\u00ad ing with follow -up as indicated. survivors with genuine respect, concern, and knowledge increases the likelihood that the caregiver can (NCPTSD, 2002): Answer questions about what survivors may be experiencing. Normalize their distress by affirming thatwhat they are experiencing is normal. Help them learn to use effective coping strategies. Help them be aware of possible symptoms that may require add itional assistance. Provide a positive experience that will i n\u00ad crease their chances of seeking help if they need it in the future. Clinical experience suggests that care be takento respect a survivor 's individual method of coping ; some may want informatio n, for e x\u00ad ample, whereas others do not. Similarly, some may want to talk about the event, but others won't. An excellent guide to providing psych o\u00ad logical first aid is available online from the Terrorism and Disaster Branch of the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (http://www.nctsn.org/content/psychological \u00ad first-aid). Critical incident stress debriefing Initially developed for work with first r e\u00ad sponders and emergency personnel, critical incident stress debriefing (CISD; Mitchell & Everly, 2001) is now widely used and enco m\u00ad p asses various group protocols used in a vari e\u00ad ty of settings. This facilitator -led group intervention is for use soon after a traumatic event with exposed people. The goal is to pr o\u00ad vide psychological closure by enc ouraging pa r\u00ad ticipants to talk about their experiences andthen giving a didactic presentation on co m\u00ad mon stress reactions and management. The widespread use of CISD has occurred despite the publication of conflicting results regarding its efficacy. Claims that single - session psychological debriefing can preventdevelopment of chronic negative psychological sequelae are not empirically supported (van Emmerik, Kamphuis, Hulsbosch, &Emmelkamp , 2002). Some controlled studies suggest that it may impede natural recovery from trauma (McNally, Bryant, & Ehlers, 2003). Other research suggests emphasizingscreening to determine the need for early i n\u00ad terventions. Mitchell and Everly (2001) pointout that many of the studies showing negative 141 A widely accepted framework in treating trauma, substance use disorders, and mental illness categorizes therapies as single (treatment of only one disorder), sequential (treatment of one disorder first, then the other), or parallel (concurrent treatment of multiple disorders delivered by separate clinicians or in separate programs that do not necessarily address the interactions between symptoms and disorders). Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services results were not conducted with first respon d\u00ad ers; that is, CISD may be appropriate for some, but not all, groups. A recent study of952 U.S. peacekeepers and CISD by the U.S.Army Research Unit -Europe (Adler et al., 2008) found mixed results. Interventions Beyond the Initial Respons e to Trauma In the interest of increasing your overall fami l\u00ad iarity with relevant approaches, th e following section s review several traumatic stress trea t\u00ad ment approaches that counselors will mostlikely encounter when collaborating with cli\u00ad nicians or agencies that specialize in trauma - specific services and treating traumatic stress. Cognitive-behavioral therapies Most PTSD models involve cognitive - behavioral therap y (CBT) that integrate s cog\u00ad nitive and behavioral theories by incorporating two ideas: first, that cognitions (or thoughts) mediate between situational demands and one's attempts to respond to them effectively, and second, that behavior al change influences acceptance of altered cognitions about oneself or a situation and establishment of newly learn ed cognitive -behavioral interaction pat\u00ad terns. In practice, CBT uses a wide range ofcoping strategies. There are many different varieties of CBT. CBT originated in the 1970s (Beck, Rush, Shaw & Emery , 1979; Ellis & Harper , 1975) and has expanded since then to address var i\u00ad ous populations, including people who use substances, people who experience anxiety,people with PTSD or personality disorders, children and adolescents, individuals involved in the criminal justice system, and many ot h\u00ad ers. CBT has also been expanded to include various techniques , coping skills, and ap\u00ad proaches, such as dialectical Linehan, Safety (Najavits, 2002a ), and mindfulness ( Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2002). Traditional CBT emphasize s symptom reduction or resolution, but recent CBT approaches have also emph a\u00ad sized the therapeutic relationship, a particula r\u00ad ly important dynamic in trauma treatment( Jackson, Nissenson, & Cloitre, 2009) . CBT has been applied to the treatment oftrauma and has also been widely and effectiv e\u00ad ly used in the treatment of substance use. Areview of efficacy research on CBT for PTSDis provided by Rothbaum, Meadows, Resick,and Foy (2000). Najavits and colleagues (2009) and O 'Donnell and Cook (2006) offer an overview of CBT t herapies for treating PTSD and substance abuse. In addition, a free online training resource incorporating CBT for traumatized children within the commun i\u00ad ty, Trauma -Focused CBT, is available from the Medical University of South Carolina(http://tfcbt.musc.edu/ ). Cognitive processing therapy Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) is amanualized 12 -session treatment approach that can be administered in a group or ind i\u00ad vidual setting (Resick & Schnicke, 1992,1993). CPT was developed for rape survivors and combines elements of existing treatment s for PTSD, specifically exposure therapy (see the \"Exposure Therapy \" section later in this chapter) and cognitive therapy. The exposure therapy component of treatment consists of 142 Advice to Counselors: Relaxation Training, Biofeedback, and Breathing Retraining Strategies Relaxation training, biofeedback, and breathing retraining strategies may help some clients cope with anxiety, a core symptom of t raumatic stress. However, no evidence supports the use of relaxation and biofeedback as effective standalone PTSD treatment techniques (Cahill, Rothbaum, Resick, & Follete, 2009). Both are sometimes used as complementary strategies to manage anxiety symptoms elicited by trauma -related stimuli. Breathing retraining uses focused or controlled breathing to r e\u00ad duce arousal. Breathing retraining and relaxation, along with other interventions when necessary, can help clients with ASD. An important caution in the use of breath work with trauma clients is that it can sometimes act as a trigger \u2014for example, given its focus on the body and its potential to remind them of heavy breathing that occurred during assault. Biofeedback, which requires specialized equipment, combines stress reduction strategies (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation, guided imag e\u00ad ry) with feedback from biological system measures (e.g., heart rate, hand temperature) that gauge levels of stress or anxiety reduction. Relaxation training, which requires no specialized equipment, encourages clients to reduce anxiety responses (including physiological responses) to trauma -related stimuli; it is often part of more comprehensive PTSD treatments (e.g., prolonged exposure and stress inoculation training [SIT]). Pa rt 1, Chapter 6\u2014Trauma -Specific Services clients writing a detailed account of their trauma, including thoughts, sensatio ns, and emotions that were experienced during the event. The client then reads the narrative aloud during a session and at home. The co g\u00ad nitive therapy aspect of CPT uses six key PTSD themes identified by McCann andPearlman (1990): safety, trust, power, co ntrol, esteem, and intimacy. The client is guided toidentify cognitive distortions in these areas,such as maladaptive beliefs. Results from randomized, placebo -controlled trials for the treatment of PTSD related to interpersonal violence (Resick, 2001; Resick,Nishith, Weaver, of CPT. CPT and prolongedexposure therapy models are equally and hig h\u00ad ly positive in treating PTSD and depression inrape survivors; CPT is superior has shown positive ou t\u00ad comes with refugees when administered in the refugees' native language (Schulz, Marovic - Johnson, & Huber, 2006) and with veterans (Monson et al., 2006). However, CPT has not been studied with high -complexity popula\u00adtions such as individuals with substance d e\u00ad pendence, homelessness, current domesticviolence, serious and persistent mental illness,or suicidality. CPT requires a 3 -day training plus consultation (Karlin et al., 2010). Resick and Schicke (1996) published a CPT trea t\u00ad ment manual, Cognitive Processing Therapy for Rape Victims: A Treatment Manual. Exposure therapy Exposure therapy for PTSD asks clients todirectly describe and explore trauma -related memories, objects, emotions, or places. In\u00ad tense emotions are evoked (e.g., sadness, anx i\u00ad ety) but eventually decrease, desensitizingclients through repeated encounters with traumatic material. Careful monitoring of the pace and appropriatene ss of exposure -based interventions is necessary to prevent retraum a\u00ad tization (clients can become conditioned tofear the trauma -related material even more). Clients must have ample time to process their memories and integrate cognition and affect , so some sessions can last for 1.5 hours or more . For simple cases, exposure can work in as few as 9 sessions; more complex cases may require 20 or more sessions (Foa, Hembree, & Rothbaum, 2007). Various techniques can 143 A Brief Description of EMDR Therapy Treatment involves three main concentrations (past memories, present disturbances, future actions) and eight phases. Counselor s may work with several phases in one session. Each phase is meant to be revisited either in every session or when appropriate (e.g., the closure process is meant to be conducted at the end of every session , in preparation for the next). Phase 1: History a nd Treatment Planning (1-2 sessions) Phase 2: Preparation Phase 3: Assessment and Reprocessing Phase 4: Desensitization Phase 5: Installation Phase 6: Body Scan Phase 7: Phase 8: Network , 2012 . Advice to Counselors: Steps for Introducing a Breathing Exercise Use the following statements to lead clients through a breathing exercise: Place your hands on your stomach. As you inhale, breathe deeply but slowly so that your hands rise with your stomach. As you exhale slowl y, practice breathing so that your hands drop with your stomach. Inhale slowly through your nose with your mouth closed; don't rush or force in the air. Exhale slowly through your mouth with your lips in the whistling position. Breathe out for twice as long as you breathe in. Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services expose the client to traumatic material. Two of the more common methods are exposure through imagery and in vivo (\"real life\") exposure. The effectiveness of exposure therapy has been firmly established (Rothbaum et al., 2000); however, adverse reactions to exposure therapy have also been noted. Some individ u\u00ad als who have experienced trauma exhibit an exacerbation of symptoms during or following exposure treatments. Even so, the exacerb a\u00ad tion may depend on counselor variables during administration. Practitioners of exposure ther\u00ad apy need comprehensive training to master its techniques (Karlin et al., 2010); a counselor unskilled in the methods of this treatment model can not only fail to help his or her cli\u00adents, but also cause symptoms to worsen. Exposure therapy is recommended as a first - line treatment option when the prominenttrauma symptoms are intrusive thoughts, flashbacks , or trauma -related fears, panic, and avoidance. However, counselors should exe r\u00ad cise caution when using exposure with clients who have not maintained stability in manag\u00ading mental illness symptoms or abstinence from substance use disorders. Studie s and ro u\u00ad tine use of exposure have consistently excludedhigh- complexity clients such as those with substance dependence, homelessness, currentdomestic violence, serious and persistent men\u00adtal illness, or suicidality. The only trial of ex\u00adposure therapy with a substance dependence sample found that it did not outperform standard substance abuse treatment on most variables (Mills et al., 2012). Prolonged exposure therapy for PTSD is listed in SAMHSA 's NREPP. For reviews of exposure therapy, also see Najavits (2007a) and Institute of Medicine (200 8). In addition to prolonged exposure therapy, other therapies incorporate exposure and desensitization tec h\u00ad niques, including eye movement desensitiz a\u00ad tion reprocessing EMDR; Shapiro, 2001), cognitive processing, a nd systematic desensitization therapies (Wolpe, 1958). Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing EMDR (Shapiro, 2001) is one of the most widely used therap ies for trauma and PTSD. The treatment protocols of EMDR have evolved into sophisticated paradig ms requiring training and, preferably, clinical supervision.EMDR draws on a variety of theoretical 144 In the substance abuse treatment field, many clients will see a connection between narrative therapy and the process of telling their stories in 12 -Step programs, in which reframing life stories of feeling trapped, despairing, and hopeless leads to stories of strength, joy, and hope. Key storytelling points at a 12 -Step speaker meeting include describing what an experience was like, what happened, and what it is like now. Part 1, Chapter 6\u2014Trauma -Specific Services frameworks, including nonverbal repr e\u00ad sentation of traumatic memories. The goal of this therapy is to proce ss the experiences that are causing problems and distress. It is an ef\u00adfective treatment for PTSD (Seidler &Wagner, 2006) and is accepted as an evidence - based practice by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA), the Royal College of Psychiatrists, and the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (Najavits, 2007a); numerous reviews support its effectiveness (e.g., Mills et al., 2012). EMDR values the development of \"resource installation \" (calming procedures) and engages in exposure work todesensitize clients to traumatic material, us ing external tracking techniques across the visual field to assist in processing distressing mater i\u00ad al. Training in EMDR, available through the EMDR Institute, is required before counselors use this treatment. It is listed in SAMHSA 's NREPP (EMDR Network, 2012). Thus far, there is no study examining the use of EMDR with clients in substance abuse treatment . See Part 3 of this TIP , available online, t o review empirical work on EMDR . Narrative therapy Narrative therapy is an emerging approach tounderstanding human gro wth and change ; it is founded on the premise that individuals are the experts on their own lives and can access their existing intrapsychic and interpersonal resources to reduce the impact of problems intheir lives. Developed for the treatment of PTSD res ulting from political or community violence, narrative therapy is based on CBT principles, particularly exposure therapy approach views psych o\u00ad therapy not as a scientific practice , but as a natural extension of healing practices thathave been present throughout human history.For a trauma survivor, the narrative , as it is told and retold , exp resses the trauma tic expe\u00ad rience, puts the trauma in the context of the survivor 's life, and defines the options he or she has for change. Narrative structure helps clients connect events in their lives, reveals strings of events, explores alternative expres\u00adsions of trauma, evokes explanations for cli\u00ad ents' behaviors, and identifies their knowledge and skills. T he use of stories in therapy, with the client as the storyteller, generally helps lessen suffering (McLeod, 1997; White, 2004). Skills training in affective and interpersonal regulation Skills training in affective and interpersonal regulation (STAIR) is a two -phase cognitive - behavioral model that adapts therapies deve l\u00ad oped by others into a new package (Cloitre,Koenen, Cohen, & Han, 2002). Phase 1 co n\u00ad sists of eight weekly sessions of skills trainingin affect and in terpersonal regulation derived from general CBT and DBT (Linehan, 1993) and adapted to address trauma involving childhood abuse. Session topics are labelingand identifying feelings, emotion manag e\u00ad ment, distress tolerance, acceptance of feel\u00adings, identifying trauma -based interpersonal schemas, identifying conflict between trauma - generated feelings and current interpersonal goals, role -plays on issues of power and co n\u00ad trol, and role -plays on developing flexibility in interpersonal situations. Phase 2 features eight 145 STAIR Steps Phase 1, tailored to individual clients , is called Skills Training in Affect Regulation and consists of t he following components: Psychoeducation : Describe the symptoms of PTSD and explain the treatment rationale. Training in experiencing and identifying feelings, triggers, and thoughts, as well as training in mood regulation strategies. Learni ng history: Ask the client the following questions \u2014How did the client deal with traumas past and present? How did the client's family deal with feelings? How did the client' s family life affect his or her present difficulty experiencing and identifying feeling? Emotion regulation skills : Identify the cognitive, behavioral , and social support modalities for coping. Use data gathered with self -monitoring forms to identify strengths and weaknesses in each coping modality. Teach skills such as breathing retraining, self -statements to reduce fear, and social skill training to improve social support. Acceptance and tolerance of negative affect : Motivate clients to face distressing situations rela t\u00ad ed to the trauma that are important to them. Review negative repercussions of avoidance. Dis\u00ad cuss tolerating negative affect as a step toward achieving specific goals. Schema therapy for improved relationships: Identify relevant schemas learned in childhood. Sug\u00ad gest alternative ways of viewing self and others in current relationships . Use role -playing to teach assertiveness, emphasizing response flexibility based on relative power in each relationship. Once Phase 1 of STAIR is well learned, clients move to Phase 2, which involves exposure therapy. Source: Mollick & Spett , 2002 . SIT has been used to help individuals cope with the aftermath of exposure to stressful events and on a preventative basis to \"inoculate\" individuals to future and ongoing stressors (Meichenbaum, 1996). This practice as a preventive strategy is similar to promoting disease resistance through immunizations. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services sessions of modified prolonged exposure using a narrative approach. Cloitre and colleagues (2002) assigned women with PTSD related to childhood abuse ra n\u00ad domly to STAIR or a minimal attention wai t- list, excluding clients with current substance dependence as well as other complexities. STAIR participants showed significantlygreater gains in affect regulation, interpersonal skills, and PTSD symptoms than the control participants. These gains were maintainedthrough follow -up at 3 and 9 months. How\u00ad ever, it is not clear from this study whetherDBT and exposure were both needed . Phase 1 therapeutic alliance and negative mood regula\u00adtion skills predicted Phase 2 exposure success in reducing PTSD, suggesting the importance of establishing a strong therapeutic relatio n\u00ad ship and emotion regulation skills before co n\u00ad ducting exposure work with people who have chronic PTSD. Stress inoculation training SIT was originally developed to manage anxiety (Meichenbaum, 1994; Meichenbaum & Deffenbacher, 1988) . Kilpatrick, Veronen, and Resick (1982) modified SIT to treat rapesurvivors based on the i dea that the anxiety and fear that rape survivors experience during theirtrauma generalizes to other objectively safe situations. SIT treatment components include education, skills training (muscle relaxationtraining, breathing retraining, role -playing, guided self -talk, assertiveness training, and thought stopping [i.e., actively and forcefully ending negative thoughts by thinking 146 Advice to Counselors: SIT Phases SIT is a preventi on and treatment approach that has three overlapping phases. It is often seen as a complementary approach to other interventions for traumatic stress. Phase 1: C onceptualization and education. This phase has two main objectives. The initial goal is to develop a collaborative relationship that supports and encourages the client to confront stressors and learn new coping strategies. The next objective is to increase the client 's understanding of the nature and impact of his or her stress and awareness of alternative coping skills. Many cognitive strategies are used to meet these objectives, including self -monitoring activ ities, Socratic questio n\u00ad ing, identifying strengths and evidence of resilience , and modeling of coping strategies. Phase 2: Skill acquisition and rehearsal. This phase focuses on developing coping skills and using coping skills that the individual already p ossesses. This process includes practice across setting s, so that the individual begins to generalize the use of his or her skills across situations through r ehearsal, rehearsal, and more rehearsal. Phase 3: I mplementation and following through. The m ain objective is to create more challenging circumstances that elicit higher stress levels for the client. By gradually increasing the challenge, the client can practice coping strategies that mimic more realistic circumstances. Through successful negotiation, the client builds a greater sense of self- efficacy. Common strategies in this phase include imagery and behavioral rehearsal, modeling, role- playing, and graded in vivo exposure. Source: Meichenbaum, 2007 . Pa rt 1, Chapter 6\u2014Trauma -Specific Services \"STOP \" and then redirecting thoughts in a more positive direction]), and skills applic a\u00ad tion. The goal is to help clients lear n to ma n\u00ad age their anxiety and to decrease avoidant behavior by using effective coping strategies. Randomized controlled clinical trials have indicated that SIT reduces the severity ofPTSD compared with waitlist controls andshows comparable efficacy to exposure therapy.At follow -up (up to 12 months after trea t\u00ad ment) , gains 1999; Foa, Rothbaum, Riggs, & Murdoc k, 1991). Other therapies Numerous interventions introduced in the past 20 years focus on traumatic stress. For some interventions, the evidence is limited , and for other othe rs, it is evolving. One exa m\u00ad ple is the traumatic incident reduction (TIR) approach . This brief memory -oriented inte r\u00ad vention is designed for children, adolescents,and adults who have experienced traumaticstress (Va lentine & Smith, 2001). Listed in SAMHSA 's NREPP , the intervention is de\u00ad signed to process specific traumatic inciden ts or problematic themes related to the trauma,including specific feelings, emotions, sensa\u00adtions, attitudes, or pain. It involves having cl i\u00ad ents talk through the traumatic incident repeatedly with the anticipation that changes in affect will occur through out the repetitions. TIR is a client -centered approach. Integrated Models for Trauma This section covers models specifically d e\u00ad signed to treat trauma -related symptoms along with either mental or substance use disorders at the same time. Integrated treatme nts help clients work on several presenting problems simultaneously throughout the treatment, apromising and recommended strategy (Dass-Brailsford & Myrick, 2010; Najavits, 2002b; Nixon & Nearmy, 2011). Thus far, research is limited, but what is available suggests that integrated treatment models effectively reduce 147 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services substance abuse, PTSD symptoms, and other mental disorder symptoms. TIP 42, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Co -Occurring Disorders (Center for Substance Abuse Trea t\u00ad ment , 2005c), offers a detailed description of integrated treatment. In contrast with inte\u00ad grated models, other model types include si n\u00ad gle (treatment of only one disorder),sequential (treatment of one disorder first,then the other), or parallel (concurrent tr eat\u00ad ment of multiple disorders delivered by sep a\u00ad rate clinicians or in separate programs that donot necessarily address the interactions b e\u00ad tween symptoms and disorders). Similar to single models, integrated treatment models are designed for use in a variety of settings (e.g., outpatient, day treatment,and/or residential substance abuse and mental health clinics/programs). Most models listedare manual- based treatments that address trauma -related symptoms, mental disorders, and substance use disorders at the same time. Additional approaches and further details onthe selected approaches can be found atNREPP ( http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov) . Addiction and Trauma Recovery Integration Model The Addiction and Trauma Recovery Int e\u00ad grated Model (ATRIUM; Miller & Guidry, 2001) integrates CBT and relational treatment through an emphasis on mental, physical, and spiritual health. This 12 -week model for ind i\u00ad viduals and groups blends psychoeducational, process, and expressive activities, as well as information on the body 's responses to addi c\u00ad tion and traumatic stress and the impact oftrauma and addiction on the mind and spirit.It helps clients explore anxiety, sexuality, self - harm, depression, anger, physical complaints and ailments, sleep difficulties, relationshipchallenges, and spiritual disconnection. It was designed primarily for women and focuses ondevelopmental (childhood) trauma and inter\u00adpersonal violence, but it recognize s that other types of traumatic events occur. The ATRIUM model consists of three phases of treatment. The first stage, or \"outer circle, \" consists of the counselor collecting data from the client about his or her trauma history, of\u00ad fering psychoeducation on the nature of tra u\u00ad ma, and helping the client assess personal strengths. ATRIUM actively discourages the evocation of memories of abuse or other tra u\u00ad ma events in this phase. The second stage, or\"middle circle, \" allows clients and counselors to address trauma symptoms more directly andspecifically encourages clients to reach out toand engage with support resources in the community. The middle circle also emphasi z\u00ad es learning new information about trauma anddeveloping additional coping skills. The thirdstage of the program, the \"inner circle, \" focus\u00ad es on challenging old beliefs that arose as aresult of the trauma. For instance, the conceptof \"nonprotecting bystander \" is used to repr e\u00ad sent the lack of support that the traumatized person experienced at the time of the trauma. This representation is replaced with the \"pr o\u00ad tective presence\" of supportive others today. ATRIUM was used in one of the nine study sites of SAMHSA 's Women, Co -Occurring Disorders and Violence Study. Across all sites,trauma -specific models achieved more favor a\u00ad ble outcomes than control sites that did not use trauma -specific models (Morrissey et al. , 2005). There has not yet been a study of ATRIUM per se, however. A manual descri b\u00ad ing the theory behind this model in greaterdepth, as well as how to implement it, is pub\u00adlished under the title Addictions and Trauma Recovery: Healing the Body, Mind, and Spirit(Miller & Guidry, 2001). 148 Part 1, Chapter 6\u2014Trauma -Specific Services Beyond Trauma: A Healing Journey fo r Women Beyond Trauma (Covington, 2003) is a curri c\u00ad ulum for women 's services based on theory, research, and clinical experience . It was devel\u00ad oped for use in residential, outpatient, and correctional settings; domestic violence pr o\u00ad grams; and mental health clinics. It uses behavioral techniques and expressive arts and is based on relational therapy. Although thematerials are designed for trauma treatment,the connection between trauma and substance abuse in women 's lives is a theme throughout. Beyond Trauma has a psychoeducational co m\u00ad ponent that defines trauma by way of its pr o\u00ad cess as well as its impact on the inner self(thoughts, feelings, beliefs, values) and the outer self (behavior and relationships, includ\u00ading parenting). Co ping skills are emphasized; specific exercises develop emotional wellness. Concurrent Treatment of PTSD and Cocaine Dependence Concurrent Treatment of PTSD and Cocaine Dependence (CTPCD) is a 16 -session, twice - weekly individual outpatient psychotherapy model designed to treat women and men withco-occurring PTSD and cocaine dependence (Coffey, Schumacher, Brimo, & Brady, 2005). CTPCD combines imagery and in vivo exp o\u00ad sure therapy (in which the client becomes d e\u00ad sensitized to anxiety -producing stimuli through repeated exposure to them) f or the treatment of PTSD with elements of CBT for substance dependence. To balance the dual needs of abstinence skill building and prompttrauma treatment, the first five sessions focus on coping skills for cocaine dependence. Ses\u00adsion six transitions into exposure therapy, which begins in earnest in session seven and is combined with CBT for the treatment of su b\u00ad stance abuse. CTPCD helps reduce substance use andPTSD symptoms. The use of any illicit drug,as measured by urine screens, was quite low during th e 16-week treatment trial and didn 't escalate during the second half of treatment \u2014 when most exposure sessions occurred. PTSDsymptoms dropped significantly over the course of treatment, as did self -reported d e\u00ad pressive symptoms; however, the dropout rate was high (Coffey, Dansky, & Brady, 2003). CTPCD was reformulated into Concurrent Prolonged Exposure (COPE ; Mills et al., 2012), which was compared with treatment as usual in a high -complexity clinical sample of individuals who had PTSD and substance dependen ce. Both treatment conditions result\u00ad ed in improvements in PTSD with no diffe r\u00ad ence at 3 months (though COPE showed significantly greater improvement at 9months); moreover, the two conditions did not differ in impact on substance use outcomes,depression, or anxiety. Integrated CBT Integrated CBT is a 14 -session individual therapy model designed for PTSD and sub\u00adstance use. It incorporates elements such as psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, and breathing ret raining (McGovern , Lamber - Harris, Alterman, Xie, & Meier , 2011). A ran\u00ad domized controlled trial showed that both integrated CBT and individual addiction treatment achieved improve ments in substance use and other measures of psychiatric sym p\u00ad tom severity with no difference between the treatments. Seeking Safety Seeking Safety is an empirically validated,present -focused treatment model that helps clients attain safety from trauma and substanceabuse (Najavits , 2002a ). The offers clinician guid e\u00ad lines and client h andouts and is available in 149 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services several languages. Training videos and other implementation materials are available online (http://www.seekingsafety.org ). Seeking Safety is flexible; it can be used for groups and ind i\u00ad viduals, with women and men, in all settings and levels of care, by all clinicians, for all types of trauma and substance abuse. Seeking Safety covers 25 topics that address cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, and case management domains. The topics can be conducted in any order, using as few or as many as are possible within a client 's course of treatment. Each topic represents a coping skill relevant to both trauma and substance abuse,such as compassion, taking good care of you r\u00ad self, healing from anger, coping with triggers, and asking for help. This treatment modelbuilds hope through an emphasis on ideals and simple, emotionally evocative language and quotations. It attends to clinician proces s\u00ad es and offers concrete strategies that are thought to be essential for clients dealing withconcurrent substance use disorders and hist o\u00ad ries of trauma. More than 20 published studies (which include pilot studies, randomized controlled trials, and multisite trials representing v arious investig a\u00ad tors and populations ) provide the evidence base for this treatment model. F or more infor\u00ad mation , see SAMHSA 's NREPP Web site (http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov ) as well as the \"Outcomes\" section of the Seeking Safety Web site (http://www.seekingsafety.org/3 -03\u00ad 06/studies.html) . Study samples included peo\u00ad ple with chronic, severe trauma symptoms andsubstance dependence who were diverse in ethnicity and were treated in a range of set\u00ad tings (e.g., criminal justice, VA centers , adole s\u00ad cent treatment, homelessness services, publicsector). S eeking Safety has shown positive outcomes on trauma symptoms, substance abuse, and other domains (e.g., suic idality, HIV risk, social functioning, problem -solving, sense of meaning); consistently outperformedtreatment as usual; and achieved high satisfac\u00ad tion ratings from both clients and clinicians. It has been translated into seven languages, and a version for blind and/or dyslexi c individuals is available. The five key elements of Seeking Safety are: 1. Safety as the overarching goal (helping clients attain safety in their relationships,thinking, behavior, and emotions). 2. Integrated treatment (working on traumaand substance abuse at the same time). 3. A focus on ideals to counteract the loss of ideals in both trauma and substance abuse. 4. Four content areas: cognitive, behavioral,interpersonal, and case management. 5. Attention to clinician processes (addres s\u00ad ing cou ntertransference, self -care, and other issues). Substance Dependence PTSD Therapy Substance Dependence PTSD Therapy (Triffleman, 2000) was designed to help cli\u00adents of both sexes cope with a broad range of traumas. It combines existing treatments forPTSD and substance abuse into a structured,40-session ( 5-month, twice -weekly) individual therapy that occurs in two phases. Phase I is \"Trauma -Informed, Addictions -Focused Treatment \" and focuses on coping skills and cognitive interventions as well as creating asafe environment. Phase I draws on CBT models, anger management, relaxation training,HIV risk reduction, and motivational e n\u00ad hancement techniques. Phase II, \"Trauma - Focused, Ad dictions -Informed Treatment, \" begins with psychoeducation about PTSD fo l\u00ad lowed by \"Anti-Avoidance I, \" in which a mod i\u00ad fied version of stress inoculation training is taught in two to four sessions. Following this is \"Anti-Avoidance II, \" lasting 6 to 10 sessio ns, in which in vivo exposure is used . 150 Part 1, Chapter 6\u2014Trauma -Specific Services Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Educ a\u00ad tion and Therapy (TARGET; Ford & Russo, 2006; Frisman, Ford, Lin, Mallon, & Chang, 2008) uses emotion and information pr o\u00adcessing in a present -focused, strengths -based approach to education and skills trainin g for trauma survivors with severe mental, substance use, and co -occurring disorders across diverse populations. TARGET helps trauma survivors understand how trauma changes the brain 's TARGET: The Seven -Step FREEDOM Approach Focus: Being focused helps a person pay attention and think about what's happening right now instead of just reacting based on alarm signals tied to past trauma. This step teaches participants to use the SOS skill (Slow down, Orient, Self- check) to pay attention to body signals and the immediate environment and to use a simple scale to measure stress and control levels . Recognize triggers: Recognizing trauma triggers enables a person to anticipate and reset alarm signals as he or she learns to distinguish between a real threat and a reminder. This step helps pa r\u00ad ticipants identify personal triggers, take control, and sho rt-circuit their alarm reactions. Emotion self -check: The goal of this skill is to identify two types of emotions. The first are \"alarm\" or reactive emotions such as terror, rage, shame, hopelessness, and guilt. Because these emotions are the most noticeab le after trauma, they are the alarm system's way of keeping a person primed and ready to fend off further danger. The second type of emotion, \"main\" emotions, include pos i\u00ad tive feelings (e.g., happiness, love, comfort, compassion) and feelings that represen t positive stri v\u00ad ings (e.g., hope, interest, confidence). By balancing both kinds of emotions, a person can reflect and draw on his or her own values and hopes even when the alarm is activated. Evaluate thoughts: When the brain is in alarm mode, thinking tends to be rigid, global, and cat a\u00ad strophic. Evaluating thoughts, as with identifying emotions, is about achieving a healthier balance of positive as well as negative thinking. Through a two -part process, participants learn to evaluate the situation and their options with a focus on how they choose to act \u2014moving from reactive thoughts to \"main\" thoughts. This is a fundamental change from the PTSD pattern, which causes problems by taking a person straight from alarm signals to automatic survival reactions. Define goals: Reactive goals tend to be limited to just making it through the immediate situation or away from the source of danger. These reactive goals are necessary in true emergencies but don't reflect a person's \"main\" goals of doing worthwhile things and ultimately achieving a good and meaningful life. This step teaches one how to create \"main\" goals that reflect his or her deeper hopes and values. Options: The only options that are available when the brain's alarm is turned on and won't turn off are automatic \"flight/fight\" or \"freeze/submit\" reactive behaviors that are necessary in emergencies but often unhelpful in ordinary living. This step helps identify positive intentions often hidden by the more extreme reactive options generated by the alarm syst em. This opens the possibility for a greater range of options that take into consideration one's own needs and goals as well as those of others. Make a contribution: When the brain's alarm is turned on and reacting to ordinary stressors as if they were emergencies, it is very difficult for a person to come away from experiences with a feeling that they have made a positive difference. This can lead to feelings of alienation, worthlessness, or spiritual distress. The ultimate goal of TARGET is to empower adu lts and young people to think clearly enough to feel in control of their alarm reactions and, as a result, to be able to recognize the contribution they are making not only to their own lives, but to others' lives as well.

The 33 sessions are divided into the following general topic areas: Part I -empowerment introduces gender identity concepts, interpersonal boundaries, and self- esteem. Part II -trauma recovery concentrates on sexual, physical, and emotional abuse and their rel a\u00ad tionship to psychiatric symptoms, substance abuse, and relational patterns and issues. Part III -advanced trauma recovery issues addresses additional trauma issues, such as blame and the role of forgiveness. Part IV -closing rituals allows participants to assess their progress and encourages them to plan for their continued healing, either on their own or as part of a community of other survivors. Part V -modifications or supplements for spec ial populations provides modifications for su b\u00ad groups such as women with serious mental illness, incarcerated women, women who are parents, women who abuse substances, and male survivors.

TARGET can be presented in individual therapy or gender -specific psychoeducational groups, and it has been adapted for individuals who are deaf; it has also been translated intoSpanish and Dutch. TARGET is a resilience - buildin g and recovery program not limited to individual or group psychotherapy ; it is also designed to provide an educational curriculum and milieu intervention that affects all areas of practice in school, therapeutic, or correctionalprograms. TARGET is listed in SAMHSA's NREPP ( http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov) . Trauma Recovery and Empowerment trauma recovery and empowerment mo d\u00ad el (TREM) of therapy (Fallot & Harris, 2002; Harris & Community Connections TraumaWork Group, 1998) is a manualized groupintervention designed for female trauma surv i\u00advors with severe mental disorders. TREM addresse s the complexity of long -term adapt a\u00ad tion to trauma and attends to a range of diff i\u00ad culties common among survivors of sexual andphysical abuse. TREM focuses mainly on d e\u00ad veloping specific recovery skills and currentfunctioning and uses techniques that are effe c\u00ad tive in trauma recovery services. The model's content and structure, which cover 33 topics,are informed by the role of gender in women 's experience of and coping with trauma. TREM can be adapted for shorter- term res i\u00ad dential settings and outpatient substance abuse treatment settings, among others. Adaptationsof the model for men and adolescents are available. The model was used in SAMHSA 's Women, Co -Occurring Disorders and Vi o\u00ad lence Study for three of the nine study sites and in SAMHSA's Homeless Families pr o\u00ad gram, and it is listed in SAMHSA 's NREPP. This model has been used with clients in sub\u00adstance abuse treatment ; research by Toussaint , VanDeMark, Bornemann, and Graeber (2007) shows that women in a residential sub\u00adstance abuse treatment program showed si g\u00ad nificantly better trauma treatment outcomes using TREM than they did in treatment as usual, but no difference in substance use. 152 Part 1, Chapter 6\u2014Trauma -Specific Services Triad Women 's Project The Triad Project was developed as a part of SAMHSA 's Women, Co -Occurring Disorders and Violence Stud y. It is a comprehensive, trauma -informed, consumer -responsive int e\u00ad grated model designed for female trauma sur\u00advivors with co -occurring substance use and mental disorders who live in semirural areas. Triad integrates motivational enhancement forsubstance use disorders, DBT , and intensive case management techniques for co -occurring mental disorders. This program is a 16 -week group intervention for women that uses int e\u00ad grated case management services, acurriculum -based treatment group, and a peer support grou p (Clark & Fearday, 2003). Emerging Interventions New interventions are emerging to address traumatic stress symptoms and disorders. The following section s summarize a few interven\u00ad tions not highlighted in prior chapters ; this is not an exhaustive list. In addition to specific interventions, technology is beginning toshape the delivery of care and to increase a c\u00ad cessibility to tools that complement trauma - specific treatments. Numerous applications are available and evolving. For more informationon the role of technology in the delivery of care, see the planned TIP , Using Technology - Based Therapeutic Tools in Behavioral HealthServices (SAMHSA, planned g). Couple and Family Therapy Trauma and traumatic stress affects significantrelationships, including the survivor's family. Although minimal research has targeted the effectiveness of family therapy with traumasurvivors, it is important to consider the needs of the individual in the context of their rel a\u00ad tionships. Family and couples therapy may be key to recovery. Family members may exper i\u00ad ence secondary traumatization silently, lack understanding of traumatic stress symptoms ortreatment, and/or have their own histories oftrauma that influence their willingness to sup\u00adport the client in the family or to talk about anything related to trauma and its effects.Family members can engage in similar pa t\u00ad terns of avoidance and have their own triggers related to the trauma being addressed at the time. A range of couple and family therapies have addressed traumatic stress and PTSD,but few studies exist that support or refute their value. Current couple or family therapies that have some science -based evidence include behavioral family therapy, behavioral maritaltherapy, cognitive -behavioral couple s trea t\u00ad ment, and lifestyle management courses (Riggs, Monson, Glynn, & Canterino, 2009). Mindfulness Interventions Mindfulness is a process of learning to be pr e\u00ad sent in the moment and observing internal experience (e.g., thoughts , bodily sensations) and external experience ( e.g., interactions with others) in a nonjudgmental way. Mindfulness challenge s limiting beliefs that arise from trauma , quell s anxiety about future events, and simply help s one stay grounded in the present. It plays a significant role in helping individualswho have been traumatized observe their ex\u00adperiences, increase awareness, and tolerate uncomfortable emotions and cognitions. To date, mindfulness- based interventions a p\u00ad pear to be valuable as an adjunct to trauma - specific interventions and in decreasing ar ous\u00ad al (Baer, 2003). It may also help individuals tolerate discomfort during exposure- oriented and trauma processing interventions. Overall,mindfulness practices can help clients in ma n\u00ad aging traumatic stress, coping, and resilience.In a study of firefighters, mindfulness was associated with fewer PTSD symptoms, d e\u00ad pressive symptoms, physical symptoms, andalcohol problems when controlling for other variables (Smith et al., 2011). 153 Becoming an Observer and Learning To Tolerate Discomfort: The Leaf and Stream Metaphor The following exercise, \"leaves floating on a stream,\" is a classic. Many clinicians and authors pr o\u00ad vide renditions of this mindfulness practice. The main objectives are to stand back and observe thoughts rather than get caught up in them. Simply stated, thoughts are just thoughts. Thoughts come and go like water flowing down a stream. We don't need to react to the thoughts; instead, we can just notice them. Conduct the mindfulness exercise for about 10 minutes , then process afterward. Take time to a l\u00ad low participants to visualize each sense as they imagine themselves sitting next to the stream. For example, what does it look like? What do they hear as they sit next to the stream? Don't rush the exercise. As you slowly make the statements detailed in the following two paragraphs, take time in between each statement for participants to be in the exercise without interruption; simply offer gen\u00ad tle guidance. Begin to sit quietly, bringing your attention to your breath. If you feel comfortable, close your eyes. As you focus on breathing in and out, imagine that you are sitting next to a stream. In your imagina\u00ad tion, you may clearly see and hear the stream, or you may have difficulty visualizing the stream. Fo l\u00ad low along with the guided exercise; either way, it will work just as well. Now begin to notice the thoughts that come into your mind. Some thoughts rush by, while others linger. Just allow yourself to notice your thoughts. As you begin to notice each thought, imagine putting those words onto a leaf as it floats by on the stream. Just let the thoughts come, watching them drift by on the leaves. If your thoughts briefly stop, continue to watch the water flow down the stream. Eventua lly, your thoughts will come again. Just let them come, and as they do, place them onto a leaf. Your attention may wander. Painful feelings may arise. You may feel uncomfortable or start to think that the exercise is \"stupid.\" You may hook onto a thought \u2014rehashing it repeatedly. That's okay; it's what our minds do. As soon as you notice your mind wandering or getting stuck, just gently bring your focus back to your thoughts, and place them onto the leaves. Now, bring your attention back to your breath for a moment, then open your eyes and become more aware of your environment. Facilitated Questions: What was it like for you to observe your thoughts? Did you get distracted? Stuck? Were you able to bring yourself back to the exercise after getting distracted ? In what ways was the exercise uncomfortable? In what ways was the exercise comforting? Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services For clients and practitioners who want to d e\u00ad velop a greater capacity for mindf ulness, see Kabat -Zinn's books Wherever You Go, There You Are: Mindfulness Meditation In Everyday Life (1994) and Full Catastrophe Living: Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to FaceStress, Pain, and Illness (1990). For clinical applications of mindful ness, see Mindfulness - Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression: A NewApproach to Preventing Relapse (Segal et al. , 2002) and Relapse Prevention: Maintenance Strategies in the Treatment of Addictive Beha iors (Marlatt & Donovan , 2005). Pharmacological Therapy Pharmacotherapy for people with mental, sub\u00ad stance use, and traumatic stress disorders needs to be carefully managed by physicians who are well versed in the treatment of each condition. Medications can help manage andcontrol symptoms; however, they are only apart of a comprehensive treatment plan. There 154 Part 1, Chapter 6\u2014Trauma -Specific Services are no specific \"antitrauma \" drugs; rather , cer\u00ad tain drugs target specific trauma symptoms. Clients receiving pharmacotherapy need car e\u00ad ful assessment. Some clients with preexistingmental disorders may need further adjustmentin medications due to the physiological effects of traumatic stress. In addition, sudden wit h\u00ad drawal from a pattern of self -administered substances can not only lead to dangerous le v\u00ad els of physical distress, but also exacerbate theemergence of more severe PTSD symptoms.Distress after trauma often lessens over time,which can sometimes make the use of medic a\u00ad tions unnecessary for some individuals. Some trauma survivors do not develop long -term psychological problems from their experiences that require medication ; others may simply refuse the initiation of pharmacotherapy or theuse of additional medications. Concluding Note Behavioral health counselors can best serve clients who have experienced trauma by providing integrated treatment that combines therapeutic models to target presenting symp\u00adtoms and disorders . Doing so acknowledges that the disorders interact with each other. Some models have integrated curricula ; others that address trauma alone can be combined with behavioral health techniques with which the counselor is already familiar. In part, the choice of a treatment model or general approach will depend on the level ofevidence for the model, the counselor 's trai n\u00ad ing, identified problems, the potential for pr e\u00ad vention, and the client 's goals and readiness for treatment. Are improved relationships withfamily members a goal? Will the client be satisfied if sleep problems decrease, or is the goal resolution of broader issues? Are there substance use or substance- related disorders? Is the goal abstinence? Col laborating with clients to decide on goals, eliciting what they would like from treatment, and determiningwhat they expect to happen can provide some clues as to what treatment models or tec h\u00ad niques might be successful in keeping client s engaged in recover y. 155 .

Chapter 1, \"Trauma -Informed Organ i\u00ad zations, \" focuses on specific organizational strategies that will help develop a trauma -informed culture in behavioral health settings. Numerous strategies are presented, including organizational co m\u00ad mitment to trauma -informed care (TIC) , trauma -informed organ i\u00ad zatio nal assessment, implementation of universal screening for trauma, and creation of a peer support environment. Chapter 2, \"Building a Trauma -Informed Workforce, \" focuses on organizational activities that foster the development of a trauma - informed workforce , including recruiting, hiring , and retaining trauma -informed staff; providing training on evidence -based and emerging trauma -informed best practices; developing competen\u00ad cies specific to TIC; addressing ethical considerations; providing trauma -informed sup ervision; and preventing and treating secon d\u00ad ary trauma in behavioral health service providers. The strategies described in the following sections can help superv i\u00ad sors and other administrative staff members create a trauma - informed behavioral health environ ment. As a starting point, the administration should identify key personnel and consumers to guide the organizational change process and the organizational as\u00adsessment. Administrators and supervisors need to plan for anddemonstrate an ongoing commitment to these strategies, or staff may perceive development activities as comprising yet another idea or demand from the agency that is short -lived beyond the initial thrust of training. 159 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services Creating a trauma -informed organization is a fluid, ongoing process; it has no completion date. Consumer demographics change across time, exposure to specific types of trauma may become more prevalent , and k nowledge of best and evidence -based practices (EBPs) will continue to advance. A trauma -informed organization continues to demonstrate acommitment to compassionate and effective practices and organizational reassessments, and it change s to meet the needs of consumers with histories of trauma. It is encouraging that recent Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ( SAMHSA) data indicates that the majority of over 10,000 pr o\u00ad grams they surveyed state that they provide trauma -related care (Capezza & Najavits, 2012). However, there remains a major need to TIC Framework in Behavioral Health Services \u2014Trauma -Informed Organizations make TIC consistently high -quality, routine, and pervasive across treatment systems. The following stages form the basis of crea t\u00ad ing a trauma -informed organization: 1.Commit to creating a trauma -inform ed agency. 2.Create an initial infrastructure to initiate, support, and guide changes. 3.Involve key stakeholders, including co n\u00ad sumers who have histories of trauma. 4.Assess whether and to what extent the organization 's current policies, procedures, and operatio ns either support TIC or i n\u00ad terfere with the development of a trauma - informed approach. 5.Develop an organizational plan to impl e\u00ad ment and support the delivery of TIC within the agency. 160 Trauma -Informed Services and Service Systems \"A trauma- informed servic e system and/or organization is one in which all components of the system have been reconsidered and evaluated in the light of a basic understanding of the role that violence and trauma play in the lives of people seeking mental health and addiction servic es. A 'trauma \u00ad informed' organizational environment is capable of supporting and sustaining 'trauma -specific' se r\u00ad vices as they develop. A trauma -informed system recognizes that trauma results in multiple vulner a\u00ad bilities and affects many aspects of a survivor's life over the lifespan, and therefore coordinates and integrates trauma -related activities and training with other systems of care serving trauma survivors. A basic understanding of trauma and trauma dynamics...should be held by all staff and should be used to design systems of services in a manner that accommodates the vulnerabilities of trauma sur\u00ad vivors and allows services to be delivered in a way that will avoid retraumatization and facilitate co n\u00ad sumer participation in treatment. A trauma -informed serv ice system is knowledgeable and competent to recognize and respond effectively to adults and children traumatically impacted by any of a range of overwhelming adverse experiences, both interpersonal in nature and caused by natural events and disasters. The re should be written plans and procedures to develop a trauma -informed service system and/or trauma -informed organizations and facilities with methods to identify and mo n\u00ad itor progress. Training programs for this purpose should be implemented.\" Source: Jennings, 2009, pp. 111- 112. Seminal Resource for Administrators As you investigate how best to implement or improve trauma -informed services within your organizat ion or across systems, review the influential work, Using Trauma Theory to Design Service Systems: New Directions for Mental Health Services. (Harris & Fallot, 2001c) Part 2, Chapter 1 \u2014Trauma -Informed Organizations 6. Create collaborations between provider s and consumers and among service provi d\u00ad ers and various community agencies. 7. Put the organizational plan into action. 8. Reassess the implementation of the plan and its ability to meet the need s of co n\u00ad sumers and to provide consistent TIC on an ongoing basis. 9. Implement quality improvement measures as needs and problem areas are identified. 10. Institute practices that support sustainabi l\u00ad ity, such as ongoing training, clinical s u\u00ad pervision, consumer pa rticipation and feedback, and resource allocation. Strategy #1: Show Organ izational and Administrative Commitment to TIC Foremost, administrators need to understand the impact that trauma can have on people 's lives. The consistent delivery of TIC is only as effective as the organization 's commitment , which must extend to administrative practices with staff members, program policies and pr o\u00adcedures, program design, staffing patterns, use of peer support, staff and peer training and supervision, organizational assessment andconsumer feedback, and resources to upholdtrauma -informed principles and practices. Even short -term change is not sustainable without the agency 's continual commitment. Typically, desirab le organizational change doesn 't occur by accident . It comes from steadfast leadership, a convincing message thatchange is necessary and beneficial for staff andconsumers, and resources that support change.Many people naturally resist change; thus, an organization 's commitment includes a will\u00ad ingness to discuss with staff members the im\u00ad pact and role of trauma in their service setting,patience in planning and implementation, and 161 Advice to Administrators: Managing Staff Reactions to Implementation of New Processes or Ideas A common hurdle for administrators after i n\u00ad troducing a new process or idea is the staff assumption that it will require more work. Frontline staff members are often inundated with many responsibilities beyond face- to-face time with clients. In addition, a common mi s- perception is that if you begin to address trauma, you will have difficulty containing it. In addition to administrative buy -in, administr a\u00ad tors must promote rather than simply announce the implementation of trauma -informed se r\u00ad vices. Promotion includes educating staff about the rationale for trauma -informed services, o f\u00ad fering opportunities for discussion and input from staff and consumers, providin g training focused on trauma -informed skills, and so forth. For example, the San Diego Trauma -Informed Guide Team (2012) created a promotional br o\u00ad chure on how TIC can make staff jobs easier: Focuses on root problem Is preventative Increases support system Facilitates collaboration Shares workload Empowers client Provides consistency in agencies/ systems Uses evidence -based best practices TIC may be cost-effective, lead to less intensive services and less use of services, prevent undue stress for staff member s and clients, and pre\u00ad vent client crises caused by old policies that could retraumatize trauma survivors. the ability to tolerate the uncertainty that na t\u00ad urally accompanies transitions. Strategy #2: Use Trauma - Informed P rinciples in Strategic Planning Strategic planning provides an opportunity to explore and develop short - and long -term goals. The planning process often begins with reevaluating the organizations ' values, mission, Statement Example As behavior al health service providers, we strive to be traum a aware \u2014to understand the dynam ics and impact of trauma on the lives of individuals, families, and communi ties. We strive to cre ate a trauma- sensitive culture by demonstrating, through consumer empower\u00ad ment, program design, and direct care, an un\u00ad derstanding of the relationships among trauma, substance abuse, and mental illness. Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services an d vision, yet agencies cannot adequately develop a trauma -informed strategic plan without obtaining specific information about internal (staff, resources, processes) and exter\u00adnal environmental (referral constellation,chan ges in health care, funding sources, State and Federal standards, community needs, co n\u00ad sumer demographics, etc.) factors and influ\u00adences. Data gathered through staff, consumer,organizational, and community assessments shapes the direction of the plan, includingprojected demands, challenges, obstacles, strengths , weaknesses, and resources. At the conclusion of this planning process, the orga n\u00ad ization will have specific goals, objectives, andtasks to meet the needs of their stakeholders and to address any ant icipated challenges. Id e\u00ad ally, strategic planning should define key steps in developing or refining trauma -informed services within the organization. Strategy #3: Review and Update Vision, Mission, and Value Statements Vision, mission, and value statements provide a conceptual framework for TIC development and delivery. They should not be created in isolation; they should reflect voices from the community, populations, and other stakehold\u00aders that the organization serves. These stat e\u00ad ments develop through input, discussion, andassessment. They are not static ; they evolve as needs, populations, or environments change. 162 Advice to Administrators: How To Create Vision, Value, and Mission Statements Define the organization's vision, values, and mission to be compatible with TIC. Emphasize the orga n\u00ad izational culture needed to provide TIC. An outgrowth of that cultur al shift may include an enhanced working environment for employees and consumers that is noncoercive and reduces conflicts , re\u00ad straint, and seclusion. Even if the current mission statement is appropriate, change it anyway to sy m\u00ad bolize intended change within the organization. To define or redefine the vision, values, and mission: Involve consumers, all levels of staff , and leadership, including the director/CEO. Review : \u00ad Organizational priorities to identify and manage conflicting priorities. \u00ad Resources to assess whether reallocation is necessary for change (e.g., to hire peer support specialists, to furnish comfort rooms). Operationalize the vision, values, and mission at the level of individual departments Evaluate progress at regular staff meeting s to ensure that changing the culture of care stays on the agenda . Source: New Logic Organizational Learning, 2011 . Part 2, Chapter 1 \u2014 Trauma -Informed Organizations Strategy #4: Assign a Key Staff Member To Facilitate Change Prior to the development of an oversight co m\u00ad mittee, a senior staff member with the author i\u00ad ty to initiate and implement changes should be assigned to oversee the developmental process.By assigning a trauma -aware senior staff me m\u00ad ber who is committed to trauma -informed services, it is more likely that the organiz a\u00ad tion's and committee 's goals, objectives, and plans will remain in focus. This senior staff member is responsible for ongoing develo p\u00ad ment and facilitation of the oversight commi t\u00ad tee; management of the initial organizationalassessment, reassessments, and other evaluativeand feedback processes; and facilitation andoversight of the implementation plan and sub\u00adsequent changes, including policies and proc e\u00ad dures to ensure delivery of TIC. Strategy #5: Create a Trauma -Informed Oversight Committee The role of the oversight committee includes providing ongoing input and direction in theinitial organizational assessment, strategic plan, plan implementation, reevaluation and development of trauma -informed policies and procedures, and future reassessments. The committee monitors progress and uses real - time data to forge a clear pathway to new pr o\u00ad cesses that support TIC. The committee should involve stakeholders from the comm u\u00ad nity, consumers, specialists, staff members, and administrators. Leadership involvement is necessary. Stakeholders may be alumni, family members, community -based organizations, and other institutions that interact with the agency or would benefit from trauma - informed services. Initially, the agency must educate the commi t\u00ad tee on the organization 's mission, values, and vision as well as the task at hand \u2014developing trauma -informed services. To ease potential conflicts or confusi on about the organization 's structure, the guidelines, expectations, and roles of the committee need to be commun i\u00ad cated directly to committee members as well as the organization as a whole, including board members, support and professional staff, su\u00adperviso rs, and so forth. The committee also needs to know the extent of their power andthe necessary lines of communication before , during, and after evaluating and implementingchanges in the organization. 163 Advice to Administrators: Ten Steps to Quality Impr ovement 1. Identify new goals or problems. 2. Gather input from each level of the organi\u00ad zation, including consumers and other key stakeholders. 3. Analyze the feedback. 4. Explore improvement options and the potential barriers associated with each. 5. Select the overall approach and specific strategies to address barriers (anticipate barriers, and try to address them before they occur). 6. Develop an implementation plan, and then present the plan to staff members and other key stakeholders not directly i n\u00ad volved in the quali ty improvement process. 7. Implement the plan. 8. Reassess the new plan. 9. Evaluate the results and determine if new goals or additional problems or issues need to be addressed. 10. Repeat the first nine steps. Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services Including consumers and/or those who have lived through trauma is vital . They have unique knowledge, experiences , and perspe c\u00ad tives on the impact of treatment design, deli v\u00ad ery, policies, and procedures. They offer firsthand information on practices that can potentially retraumatize clients in behavioral health settings and can suggest preventive, alternative practices and solutions. Consumercommittee members keep staff and admini s\u00ad trators aware of the goal of achieving TIC. Strategy #6: Conduct an Organizational Self - Assessment of Trauma - Informed Services An org anizational self -assessment evaluates the presence and/or the effectiveness of cur\u00ad rent trauma -informed practices across each service and level of the organization. This assessment allows an organization to see how it functions within the context of trauma - informed principles and provides feedback to inform the development or revision of the implementation plan for TIC. In essence, this assessment process can serve as a blueprint forchange and as a benchmark of compliance with and progress in implementing trauma - informed practices across time. Overall, it is a process of identifying organizational strengths,weaknesses, opportunities, and threats relatedto the implementation and maintenance ofTIC. Refer to Appendix F for sample organ i\u00ad zational assessment to ols for the organization and the consumer. The self -assessment should obtain feedback from key stakeholders, particularly consumers, family members, referral sources, community organizations, and all levels of the organiz a\u00ad tion's staff, including nonclinical and clinical staff, supervisors, and administrative perso n\u00ad nel. Similar to the universal screening process, an organizational self -ass essment is only as effective as the steps taken after data are gat h\u00ad ered and analyzed. From this assessment, animplementation plan should be establishedthat highlights the goals, objectives, steps,timeframe, and personnel responsible in over\u00adseeing the specific objective. Assessmentshouldn 't be a once -and-done project. Timely and regularly scheduled or ganizational asses s\u00ad ments should follow to assist in quality i m\u00ad provement. For an explanation of more detailed steps to take in conduct ing an organ i\u00ad zational self -assessment, see Chapter 4 of the planned Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP), Improving Cultura l Competence (SAMHSA, planned c). Strategy #7: Develop an Implementation Plan Implementation plans should evolve from consumer participation, demographic profiles 164 Exhibit 2.1 -1: TIC Planning Guidelines The following publications provide samples of organizational guidelines for implementing TIC.

Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services Strategy #8: Develop Policies and Procedures To Ensu re Trauma - Informed Practices and T o Prevent Retraumatization In the early stage of evaluating current services and planning for TIC, the committee needs to assess practices, procedures, and policies thatmay have been or could be retraumatizing to any individual, at any level of the organization,from consumers to administrators. Programs that are not trauma informed are as likely to be unaware of the impact of trauma on staff as they are to be unaware of its influence on con\u00ad sumers. In the initial review, careful scrutiny should be used to eliminate any practice that is p otentially harmful, including seclusion and restraint practices, th erapeutic activities that are shaming, treatment planning without co l\u00ad laboration, any medical inquiry without privacy , and so forth. Policies and procedures are the buildingblocks of each agency. They guide the service process and, if followed, they provid e an o p\u00ad portunity for the agency to deliver consistentresponses and care. Policies and procedures must incorporate trauma -informed practices across all domains and standards, such as a d\u00ad missions, plant/environmental standards,screening and assessment processes, referrals (to other services, including hospitalization, orfor further evaluations), treatment planning,confidentiality, discharge, and more. Theyalso need to be updated periodically to inco r\u00ad porate new science and to meet the changingneeds of consumers. By regularly reviewingand adapting administrative and clinical poli\u00ad cies and procedures in response to ever - changing needs and evidence, the agency canprovide staff members with good guidelines for providing trauma -informed services that are consi stent yet flexible. Strategy #9: Develop a Disaster Plan Facilities are often required to develop disaster plans, but specific requirements vary from State to State. From the outset, developing a disaster plan in behavioral health services is essential. Many clients in behavioral health services have lived with trauma, so proactive steps that reduce the impact of a new traumamay prevent worsening of symptoms and d e\u00ad crease the risk for more pervasive effects. (See also Technical Assistance Publication 34, Dis\u00ad aster Planning Handbook for Behavioral HealthTreatment Programs [SAMHSA, 2013].) 166 Part 2, Chapter 1 \u2014Trauma -Informed Organizations Most disaster events cannot be accurately a n\u00ad ticipated. Even so, behavioral health organiz a\u00ad tions can take steps to reduce the impact of a disaster event on program functio ning and on the lives of clients. Each service or program should develop a disaster response committee that meets regularly to develop, maintain, andadapt policies and procedures to respond todisasters affecting the program. Committee planning efforts may include: 1. Creat ing a disaster response team of pr o\u00ad gram staff members tasked with coord i\u00ad nating program administration and services in a disaster event. 2. Establishing a communication process forinforming staff and clients of the status ofprogram function ing and for coordinating staff assignments during and shortly afterthe disaster event. 3. Outlining a process to inform clients and their families of available services, their lo\u00adcation, and contact information for acces s\u00ad ing services to meet clients' critical needs. 4. Developing plans for service provisionduring a disaster e vent and service imple\u00ad mentation after the event. 5. Creating special plans for high -risk or special needs clients who need services during and shortly after the disaster. E x\u00ad amples of this are clients who are home\u00ad less, in detoxification services ormethadone programs, on prescribed psy\u00adchopharmaceuticals, or at risk for suicide. 6. Making plans for maintaining the security of client records, program records, and f a\u00ad cilities during and shortly after t he event. 7. Coordinating ahead with other communityresources and services to ensure that clients at high risk or with special needs get the services they require as soon as possible. 8. Prioritizing how services will start back upafter a disaster event. 9. Provi ding special services after the event to clients at high risk for trauma reactions and symptoms. 10. Establishing a postdisaster debriefing pr o\u00ad cess to review disaster responses, services,and outcome s. Some specific disaster events, such as hurr i\u00ad canes, may sometimes offer opportunities for planning and preparation in advance of thedisaster event. This preparation time is usually just a few days, but it allows programs to make advance preparation s and take advance action to establish lines of communication, stockpile resources, prepare for evacuation of clients,and protect client and program records. Strategy #10: Incorporate Universal Routine Screenings A key element of trauma -informed services is the institution of universal routine screening across all services, regardless of the individual 's path in accessing services (e.g., primary care , hospitalization, outpatient). Considering the prevalence of trauma among individuals whoseek services for mental and substance use disorders, the implementation of screening is paramount. Without screening, clients are not identified as trauma survivors. Subsequently,they miss recovery opportunities and trea t\u00ad ment services that would be more likely tomeet th eir needs , while also running a higher risk of being retraumatized by unexaminedorganizational policies, procedures, and prac\u00adtices. For more information on the rationale,processes, and instruments of universal screen\u00ading for trauma, refer to Part 1, Chapt er 4. Strategy #11: Apply Culturally Responsive Principles Providers must be culturally competent when incorporating evidence -based and best prac \u00ad tices as well as trauma -informed treatment 167 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services models within the organization. Clients ' views of behavioral health differ according to race, ethnicity, and culture (refer to the plannedTreatment Improvement Protocol [ TIP], Im\u00ad proving Cultural Competence [SAMHSA, planned c]). Likewise, cultures attach different meanings to trauma , and responses to trauma will vary considerable across cultures ( see Part 3, the online literature review, for more i n\u00ad formation ). For example, trauma survivors who come from a collective society or culture,in which the goals of the group take prec e\u00ad dence over the goals of the individual, may be more focused on the well -being of their family or the family 's response to the trauma surv i\u00ad vors' experience. Often, this view runs in o p\u00ad position to the individualistic perspective ofmany behavioral health services. Subsequently, treatment providers who are not culturally competent may interpret collective values as asign of resistance or avoidance in dealing withtraumatic stress. CMHS (2003) outlines pri n\u00ad ciples of cultural competence in disaster work applic able across all forms of trauma: 1. Recognize the importance of culture andrespect diversity. Those who value culture and diversity understand their own cu l\u00ad tures, attitudes, values, and beliefs, and they work to understand the cultures of others. This includes being able to com\u00ad municate effectively with those from othercultures, respecting others' feelings about personal space, knowing about others' s o\u00ad cial organization, understanding how timeis viewed, and being aware of others ' be\u00ad liefs about the effects of their behaviors. 2. Maintain a current prof ile of the culturalcomposition of the community . This i n\u00ad cludes describing the community 's popul a\u00ad tion in terms of race and ethnicity, age,gender, religion, refugee and immigrantstatus, housing status, income levels, r u\u00ad ral/urban ba lance, unemployment, la n\u00ad guages spoken, literacy, schools, andbusinesses. 3. Recruit workers who are representative ofthe community or service area . If the wor k\u00ad ers who are available do not match the community, they should have the personal attributes, knowledge, and skills to developcultural competence. 4. Provide ongoing cultural competence train\u00ading to staff. Topics should include cultural values and traditions, family values, li n\u00ad guistics and literacy, immigration exper i\u00ad ences and status, help -seeking behaviors, techniques and strategies for cross -cultural outreach, and the avoidance of stereotypes and labels (DeWolfe & Nordboe, 2000b). 5. Ensure that services are accessible, appr o\u00ad priate, and equitable . In planning disaster work or TIC, community asso ciations and organizations are invaluable. Gaining theiracceptance requires time and energy. 6. Recognize the role of help-seeking beha v\u00ad iors, traditions, and natural support ne t\u00ad works . Culture includes traditions that dictate whom, or wh ich groups , to seek in times of need; how to handle suffering and loss; and how healing takes place. These customs and traditions are respected by aculturally responsive disaster relief program. 7. Involve community leaders and organiz a\u00ad tions representing diverse cultural groups as \"cultural b rokers.\" Collaborating with community leaders is an effective means oflearning about the community, establishingprogram credibility, and ensuring that se r\u00ad vices are culturally responsive. 8. Ensure that services and information are culturally and linguistically responsive . Communication with individuals who do not speak English, who are illiterate in all languages or have limited literacy, and whoare deaf or hard of hearing is essential toservice provision. Local radio stations, te l\u00ad evision outlets, and newspapers that are multicultural are an excellent venue for educational information after a disaster. 168 For more detailed infor mation on EBPs, visit the National Registry of Evidence - Based Programs and Practices (NREPP) Web site ( http://nrepp.samhsa.gov ). For more specific research -oriented info r\u00ad mation on trauma and trauma -specific treatments, refer to the literature review in Part 3 of this TIP , available online. For an introduction to peer support services, see What Are Peer Recovery Support Services? (Center for Sub\u00ad stance Abuse Treat ment, 2009e). Part 2, Chapter 1 \u2014Trauma -Informed Organizations Using survivors ' friends or relatives as i n\u00ad terpreters is not recommended , as survi\u00ad vors may be uncomfortable discussing personal matters with family members orfriends. Asking children to interpret canplace too heavy a responsibility on them and reverses parents' and children 's roles. 9. Assess and evaluate the program 's level of cultural responsiveness . Self-assessment and process evaluation can help keep aprogram on track. A variety of strategies can be used for collecting data and co m\u00ad municating findings to stakeholders. Strategy #12: Use Science-Based Knowledge Along with culturally responsive services, trauma -informed organizations must use science -based knowledge to guide program development and the implementation of ser\u00advices, policies, procedures, and practices.Thisincludes the adoption of EBPs ( see Part 1, Chapter 6 , and Part 3 , Section 1 , to review definition, treatments, and resources for EBPs ). TIC research is quite new; interpret the se lim\u00ad ited studies and information cautiously.Chambless and Hollon 's (1998) criteria, which are still the benchmark for EBPs, are valuable resources for administrators. Look closely at who was included \u2014and excluded \u2014from treatment studies. Often, the types of severe,chronic, and unstable cases seen in community settings are excluded from treatment studies.Evidence -based interventions should be a primary consideration in selecting appropriate treatment models for peopl e with mental il l\u00ad ness, substance use disorders, and co -occurring psychological trauma. Nonetheless, other var i\u00ad ables must also be contemplated before adop t\u00ad ing EBP s in an organization, including the cultural appropriateness of the practice; the strength of its clinical focus on strengths - based strategies; training and compe tence of clinical staff; the cost of training, materials, and implementation; and the ease of mai n\u00ad taining EBP fidelity amidst staff turnover. Strategy #13: Create a Peer- Support Environment The main purpose of peer support services is to provide co n- sumer mentoring,support, and care coordination for cli- ents with histories of mental illness or substance abuse. The goa ls are to help others deal with personal and environmental barriers that impede recovery and achieve wellness. Peer support acco m\u00ad plishes this through many activities, includingadvocacy, support during crises and recovery activities, modeling, education, and assistance in accessing available resources. Peer support program s send a powerful message to staff members, consumers, and the community \u2014 that recovery is possible through support, co l\u00ad laboration, and empowerment. These pro\u00ad grams reinforce the trauma -informed premise that organizations need to reflect the popul a\u00ad tions that they serve and involve consumers inplanning, implementing, monitoring, and d e\u00ad livering recovery services. Notably, peer support services have the poten\u00ad tial to be cons iderably flexible to meet client needs at each stage of recovery. Specifically,peer support services can be incorporated 169 \"Peer recovery support s ervices are ev i\u00ad dence based and have been demonstra t\u00ad ed to promote positive health outcomes and control the cost of healthcare. These services are offered by a trained individual with lived experience and recovery from a mental illness, substance use and/or chronic health conditions. Peer recovery support services minimally include chronic illness self -management, whole health and wellness promotion and engagement, relapse prevention, life skill coaching, and insurance and health systems navigation.\" (Daniels et al., 2012, p. 22) Advic e to Administrators: Sample Peer Support Staff Tasks Use active listening skills help peers identi\u00ad fy areas of dissatisfaction and benefits of changing beliefs, thoughts, and behavior. Use problem -solving skills to help peers identify barriers to recovery and develop plans to meet peer -determined goals. Facilitate recovery support groups. Link clients with community resources. Work with the treatment team to advocate for client s and to remove recovery barriers. Participate in consumer panels to educate staff about the consumer perspective and about peer support . Participate in hospital -wide committees and workgroups Source: New Logic Organizational Learning, 2011 . Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services across the continuum of care , starting with outreach services and extending into long \u00ad term recovery services. Peer support specialists can enhance consumer motivation to change,to initiate services, and/or to engage in reco v\u00ad ery activi ties. They can play powerful liaison roles by supporting clients entering treatmentand explaining what to expect from services. They can ease the transition into treatment,from one service to the next, from one mo\u00addality to another (e.g., inpatient group to ou t\u00ad patient group), and beyond formal treatment.More over, peer support services create an a t\u00ad mosphere focused on mutuality rather thanpathology. They provide living models of r e\u00ad silience and promote hope\u2014that recovery is possible and attain able. Administrators should familiarize themselves with how other organizations have impl e\u00ad mented peer support programs, current curri c\u00ad ula, certifications and training processes, competencies and ethics, and peer supportservice State standards or recommendations, ifapplicable. The Carter Center 's Summit in 2009, The Pillars of Peer Support Services,supported in part by SAMHSA and CMHS , highlighted the numero us elements necessary to develop a strong, vital peer workforce (Daniels et al., 2010). These elements include: Clear job and service descriptions. Job-related competencies and competenc e- based testing processes. Peer support certifications. Ongoing continuing education. Media and technology access for peer sp e\u00ad cialists . Sustainable funding . Research and evaluation components. Code of ethics and conduct . Competenc e-based training for supervisors . Multilevel support and program supportteams. Strategy #14: Obtain Ongoing Feedback and Evaluations Obtain f eedback on and evaluations o f organ i\u00ad zational performance on a regular basis. Give consumers a clear avenue for offering feedback at any time, and make evaluations assessing the organization 's progress toward providing trauma -informed services standard practice. Without feedback and further evaluation , or\u00ad ganizations cannot assess whether they are 170 Creating Sanctuary The sanctuary model is a trauma -based therapeutic approach that has been used in inpatient, res i\u00ad dential, therapeutic community, and outpatient settings with children, adolescents, and adults. It provides a template for changing social service delivery syst ems so that they are better equipped to respond to the complex needs of trauma survivors. Sanctuary is informed by four knowledge areas: \"the psychobiology of trauma, the active creation of nonviolent environments, principles of social learning, and an understanding of the ways in which complex adaptive systems grow, change, and alter their course \" (Bloom et al., 2003, p. 174). The sanctuary model describes a stage- based approach to healing that is referred to as SAGE: safety, affect modulation, grieving, and emancipation. This model is nonlinear; an individual does not neces\u00ad sarily move from one stage to another in a straight path, but progress in one area does affect pro\u00ad gress in other areas (Bloom, 1997; Bloom et al., 2003). SAGE is a cognitive- behavioral translation of the sanctuary model (Bills, 2003). Early in treatment, the focus es are typically on safety and affect management. Safety encompasses four domains: physical, psychological, social, and moral (Bloom, 1997; see http://www.sanctuaryweb.com for further details and a curriculum). Part 2, Chapter 1 \u2014T rauma -Informed Organizations meeting trauma -informed objectives. ng process for TIC implement a\u00ad tion gives the organization additional information necessary to combat new obst a\u00ad cles and threats and to understand what works. Regular monitoring equips organizations with the ability to formulate different strategies tomeet objectives as well as to respon d to the changing needs of the population. Ongoingevaluation and consumer feedback are essen\u00adtial in improving the quality of services. Strategy #15: Change the Environment To Increase Safety Practices that generate emotional and physical safety are necessary. Another aspect of creatingsafety is reevaluating the physical facilities andenvironment to enhance safety and to circu m\u00ad vent preventable retraumatization. Think howtraumatizing it would be if you were a female rape survivor and a night counselor was co n\u00ad ducting a room check at 2:00 a.m. , or a male security guard was walking the women 's resi\u00ad dential wing. What wo uld it be like if you were sitting with your back to the door in asmall office during an intake interview, if your history included a physical assault and ro b\u00adbery? For most, it would at least increase anx i\u00ad ety; for others it would be retraumatizing.Trauma -informed providers must carefully assess environmental safety. Although you are likely to identify some facility issues that coulderode safety for trauma survivors, a safe env i\u00ad ronment will only be established if regularfeedback is obtained from consumers about their experiences with the program. Strategy #16: Develop Trauma -Informed Collaborations TIC is about collaboration with consumers, staff members, key stakeholders, and other agencies. Collaborative relationship s provide opportunities for consumers to access the most appropriate services as needs arise. Ratherthan wait ing for a cris is or a dire need for a service to investigate available resources, it is far more efficient and compassionate to esta b\u00ad lish relationships within the agency and with other community resources before these needs arise. No agency can meet the needs of every client; referral agreements and/or collaborative arrangements that integrate the delivery of TIC, including support services (e.g., housing, legal, medical) , are important . 171 IN THIS CHAPTER Introduction Workforce Recruitment, Hiring, and Retention Training in TIC Trauma -Informed Counselor Competencies Counselor Responsibilities and Ethics Clinical Supervision and Consultation Secondary Traumatization Counselor Self -Care Building a Trauma \u00ad2 Informed Workforce Introduction For an organization to embrace a trauma- informed care (TIC) model fully, it must adopt a trauma -informed organizational mi s\u00ad sion and commit resources to support it. This entails implementing an agency -wide strategy for workforce development that is in alignment with the values and principles of TIC and the organiz a\u00ad tion's mission statement. Without a fully tra ined staff, an organiz a\u00ad tion will not be able to implement the TIC model. However,simply training behavioral health professionals in TIC is not enough. Counselors will not be able to sustain the kind of focus required to adopt and implement a trauma -inform ed philosophy and services without the ongoing support of administrators andclinical supervisors. An organizational environment of care for the health, well -being, and safety of, as well as respect for, its staff will enhance the ability of counselors to provide the best possible trauma -informed beha v\u00ad ioral health services to clients. This culture of ca re must permeate the organization from top to bottom. Behavioral health program administrators should aim to strengthen their workforce; doing so \"requires creating environments that support the health and well \u00ad being, not only of persons with mental and substance use cond i\u00ad tions , but of the workforce as well \" (Hoge, 2007, p. 58). An organ i\u00ad zational cultur e of care, safety, and respect demands activities that foster the development of trauma -informed counselors. This cha p\u00ad ter focuses on key workforce developmen t activities , such as: Recruiting, hiring, and retaining trauma- informed staff . Training behavioral health service providers on the principles of , and evidence -based and emerging best practices relevant to , TIC. Developing and promoting a set of counselor competencies sp e\u00ad cific to TIC. 173 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services TIC Framework in Behavioral Health Services \u2014Building a Trauma -Informed Work force the importance of organization -wide support and active involvement in workforce recrui t\u00ad ment, hiring, and retention in behavioral health systems. One of the key findings of this report is that the work environment itself in many behavioral health settings can be toxic to the workforce and may hinder the delivery ofindividualized, respectful, collaborative, andclient -centered care to service recipients. Fa c\u00ad tors such as the downward pressure on orga ni\u00ad zations for higher productivity of counselors increase caseloads and decrease wages of be\u00ad havioral health staff members and may create a high -stress environment that contributes to low morale and worker dissatisfaction. Other factors that often contribute to low retention of qualified counselors in behavioral healthsettings include the lack of professional career Delineating the responsibilities of counse\u00adlors and addressing ethical considerationsspecifically relevant to promoting TIC. Providing trauma -informed clinical super\u00ad vision . Committing to prevention and treatment of secondary trauma of behavioral hea lth professional s within the organization . Addressing each of these areas is essential tobuilding a trauma- informed workforce and an organizational culture that supports TIC . Workforce Recruitment, Hiring, and Retention An Action Plan for Behavioral Health Workforce Development (Hoge et al., 2007) emphasizes 174 Who Is a Trauma Champion? \"A champion understands the impact of vio\u00ad lence and victimization on the lives of people seeking mental health or addiction services and is a front -line worker who thinks 'trauma first.' When trying to understand a person's beha v\u00ad ior, the champion will ask, 'is this related to abuse and violence?' A champion will also think about whether his or her own behavior is hur t\u00ad ful or insensitive to the needs of a trauma su r\u00ad vivor. The champion is there to do an identified job\u2014he is a case manager or a counselor or a residential specialist \u2014but in addition to his or her job, a champion is there to shine the spo t\u00ad light on trauma issues.\" Source: Harris & Fallot, 2001a, p. 8. Part 2, Chapter 2 \u2014B uilding a Trauma -Informed Workforce ladders, fragile job security, the lack of clinical supervision, and an inability to influence the organization in which they are working (Hoge et al., 2007). Added to this mix is the intensity of working with people with the co -occurring conditions of trauma -related mental and substance use disorders and the risk of secondary traumat i\u00ad zation of counselors. In creating and sustai n\u00ad ing a trauma- informed workforce, organizations need to foster a work enviro n\u00ad ment that parallels the treatment philosophyof a trauma- informed system of care. Doing so allows counselors to count on a work env i\u00ad ronment that values safety, endorses collabor a\u00ad tion in the making of decisions at all levels, and promotes counselor well- being. Recruitment and Hiring in a Trauma -Informed System of Care In a 2007 technical report ( Jennings, 2007 b), the National Center for Trauma -Informed Care identified several priorities for organiz a\u00ad tions with regard to recruitment and hiring trauma -informed staff, including: Active recruitment of and outreach to pr o\u00ad spective employees who are trauma - informed or have formal education in providing trauma- informed or trauma - specific services in settings such as universi\u00adties, professional organizations, professional training and conference sites, peer support groups, and consumer advocacy groups. Hiring counselors and peer suppo rt staff members with educational backgrounds and training i n trauma -informed and/or trauma -specific services and/or lived exp e\u00ad rience of trauma and recovery. Providing incentives, bonuses, and promo\u00adtions for staff members during recruitment and hiring that take into consideration prospective employees' trauma -related ed\u00ad ucation, training, and job responsibilities. In addition to hiring behavioral health profe s\u00ad sional s with formal professional education and training, organizations should also \"routinely survey the demographics and other characte r\u00ad istics of the population served and recruit a workforce of similar composition \" (Hoge et al., 2007, p. 297). Essentially, this means a c\u00ad tively engaging in outreach to consumer adv o\u00ad cacy groups, recovery -oriented programs , community and faith -based organizations, and former clients/consumers with the intention ofrecruiting potential employees whose knowledge and expertise comes from theirlived experience of trauma, resilience, andrecovery. Support staff members, peer support workers, counselors in training , and appre n\u00ad tices can be recruited from this population and offered incentives, such as tuition reimburse\u00ad ment, training stipends, and professional mentoring with the goal of developing a tra u\u00ad ma-informed workforce from within the d e\u00ad mographic served. Jennings (2007 b) calls these staff members \"trauma champions \" who can provide needed e xpertise in a trauma- informed organization to promote trauma-informed policies, staff development, andtrauma -based services consistent with the mi s\u00ad sion of the organization (p. 135). 175 Advice to Administrators: Preventing Turnover and Increasing Workforce Retention To prevent behavioral health staff turnover and increase retention of qualified, satisfied, and highly committed trauma -informed counselors, consider: Offering competitive wages, benefits, and performance incentives that take into account educ a\u00ad tion, training, and levels of responsibility in providing trauma -informed or trauma -specific services. Creating a safe working environment that includes both the physical plant and policies and pr o\u00ad cedures to prevent harassment, stalking, and/or violence in the workplace and to promote r e\u00ad spect ful interactions amongst staff at all levels of the organization. Establishing an organizational policy that normalizes secondary trauma as an accepted part of working in behavioral health settings and views the problem as systemic \u2014not the result of ind i\u00ad vidual pathology or a deficit on the part of the counselor. Instituting reasonable, manageable caseloads that mix clients with and without trauma -related concerns. Letting staff offer input into clinical and administrative policies that directly affect their work e x\u00ad perience. Providing vacation, health insurance (which includes coverage for psychotherapy/personal cou n\u00ad seling), and other benefits that promote the well -being of the staff. Implementing regular, consistent clinical supervision for all clinical staff members. Providing ongoing training in trauma -informed services offered by the organization. Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services As with hiring behavioral health professional s who are in recovery from s ubstance use diso r\u00ad ders, the organization should be transparent and explicit in its recruitment and hiring prac\u00adtices of trauma survivors in recovery. The o r\u00ad ganization can be transparent by advertisingthe mission statement of the organization as part of the recruitment process and inviting applicants who are in recovery from trauma toapply. The needs of behavioral health staffmembers who are in recovery from both sub\u00adstance use and trauma -related conditions and working in a trauma- informed system of care should be addressed in the organization 's on\u00ad going training, clinical supervision, and staffdevelopment policies and practices. Workforce Retention Staff turnover is rampant in behavioral healthsettings. It is costly to the organization, and as a result, it is costly to clients. A strong ther a\u00ad peutic relationship with a counselor is one of the largest factors in an individual 's ability to recover from the overwhelming effects oftrauma. When behavioral health professionals leave an organization prematurely or in crisis as a result of chronic levels of high stress orsecondary traumatization, clients must deal with disruptions in their relationships withcounselors. Some of the organizational factors that contribute to chronic levels of high stressand often lead to high staff turnover include expecting counselors to maintain high cas e\u00ad loads of clients who have experienced trauma ; not providing trauma -informed clinical super\u00ad vision and training to counselors ; and failing to provide adequate vacation, health insu r\u00ad ance, and other reasonable benefits that sup\u00adport counselor s' well-being. Other factors that may have a more profound impact on staffretention include failing to acknowledge the reality of secondary traumatization, promotingthe view that counselors' stress reactions are a personal failure instead of a normal response to engaging with clients ' traumatic material, and not supporting personal psychotherapy forcounselors (Saakvitne, Pearlman, & Trauma t\u00ad ic Stress Institute/Center for Adult & Adoles\u00adcent Psychotherapy, 1996). Research on promoting counselo r retention in behavioral health settings demonstrates that 176 Part 2, Chapter 2 \u2014Building a Trauma -Informed Workforce behavioral health staff members are interested in the same kind of work environment and benefits as employees in many other fields. They include a \"living wage with healthcare benefits; opportunit ies to grow and advance; clarity in a job role; some autonomy and inputinto orientation and training forassigned responsibilities; a decent and safe physical work environment; a competent and cohesive team of coworkers; the support of asupervisor; and rewards for exceptional per\u00adformance \" (Hoge et al. , 2007, p. 18). When an organization 's administration values its staff by providing competitive salaries and benefits, a safe working environment, a rea\u00adsonable and manageable workload, input intothe making of clinical and administrative pol i\u00ad cy decisions , and performance incentives, it helps behavioral health workers feel connectedto the mission of the organ ization and become dedicated to its sustainability and growth.This type of work environment demonstrates both a level of respect for counselors (similarto the level of respect a trauma -informed or\u00ad ganization displays toward clients) and an appreciation fo r the complexity of their job responsibilities and the stress they face whenworking with people who have experiencedtrauma in their lives. To retain behavioral health professionals working in a trauma - informed setting, wages and performance i n\u00ad centives should be tied not only to education,training, and work experience, but also to le v\u00ad els of responsibility in working with clients who have experienced trauma. Training in TIC Training for all staff members is essential in creating a trauma- informed organizat ion. It may seem that training should simply focus on new counselors or on enhancing the skill level of those who have no prior experience inworking with trauma, but training should , in fact, be more systematic across the organiz a\u00ad tion to develop fully sustainable trauma- informed services. All employees, including administrative staff members , should receive an orientation and basic education about the prevalence of trauma and its impact on theorganization 's clients. To ensure safety and reduction of harm, training should cover d y\u00ad namics of retraumatization and how practicecan mimic original sexual and physical abuseexperiences, trigger trauma responses, andcause further harm to the person. Training for all employees must also educate them \"about the impacts of culture, race, ethnicity, gender,age, sexual orientation, disability, and socio \u00ad economic status on individuals' experiences of trauma \" (Jennings, 2007a , p. 5). All clinical and direct service staff members, regardless of level of experience, should receive more indepth training in screening and as\u00adsessment of substance use and trauma -related disorders; the relationship s among trauma , substance use disorders, and mental disorders; how to understand difficult clien t behaviors through a trauma -informed lens; how to avoid retraumatizing clients in a clinical setting; thedevelopment of personal and professional boundaries unique to clinical work with tra u\u00ad matized clients; how to identify the signs ofsecondary traumatization in themselves; andhow to develop a comprehensive personal andprofessional self -care plan to prevent and/or ameliorate the effects of secondary traumat i\u00ad zation in the workplace. All clinical staff members who work with traumatized clients should rec eive additional training in evidence - based and promising practices for the trea t\u00ad ment of trauma (for information on locatingtraining, see Appendix B.) This might include training done within the agency by experts in the field or training received by attend ing a d\u00ad vanced trauma trainings. Administrat ors 177 Case Illustration: Larry Larry is a 28 -year- old clinical socia l worker who just finished his master's program in social work and is working in a trauma -informed ou t\u00ad patient program for people with substance u se disorders. He is recovering from alcohol use disorder and previously worked in a residential rehabilitation program as a recovery support counselor. There, his primary responsibilities were to take residents to Alcoholics Anon y\u00ad mous (AA) meetings, monitor their particip a\u00ad tion, and confront them about their substance use issues and noncompliance with the pr o\u00ad gram's requirement of attendance a t 12- Step meetings. In Larry's new position as a counselor, he con\u00ad fronts a client in his group regarding her di s\u00ad comfor t with attending AA meetings. The client reports that she feels uncomfortable with the idea that she has to admit that she is po w\u00ad erless over alcohol to be accepted by the group of mostly men. She was sexually abused by her stepfather when she was a child a nd began drinking heavily and smoking pot when she was 11 years old. The client reacts angrily to Larry's intervention. In supervision, Larry discusses his concerns regarding the client's resistance to AA and the feedback that he provided to her in group. Beyond focusing supervision on Larry's new role as a counselor in a trauma -informed pr o\u00ad gram, the clinical supervisor recommends that Larry take an interactive, multisession, compu t\u00ad er-assisted training on the 12-Step facilitation (TSF) model. The TSF model introduces clients to and assists them with engaging in 12- Step recovery support groups. The agency has the computer -based training available in the office, and Larry agrees to use follow -up coaching sessions with his supervisor to work on impl e\u00ad mentation of the approach. The supervisor recognizes that Larry is falling back on his own recovery experience and the strategies he r e\u00ad lied on in his previous counseling role. He will benefit from further training and coaching in an evidence- based practice that provi des a no n- aggressive, focused, and structured way to facilitate participation in recovery support groups with clients who have trauma histories. Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services should provide the time and financial r e\u00ad sources to clinical staff members for this pr o\u00ad fessional development acti vity. Jennings (2007a ) suggests that, whenever possible, \"trainings should be multi -system, inclusive of staff in mental health and substance abuse, health care, educational, criminal justice, socialservices systems and agencies, and promotingsystems int egration and coordination \" (p. 5). Moreover, criminal justice settings , schools, military/veteran programs, and other places inwhich behavioral health services are providedmay benefit from approaches that are sensitive to the special circumstances and cultures ofthese environment s. For example, in exploring trauma -informed correctional care, Miller and Najavits (2012, p. 1) observe: Prisons are challenging settings for trauma - informed care. Prisons are designed to house perpetrators, not victims. Inmates arrive shac k\u00ad led and are crammed into overcrowded hou s\u00ad ing units; lights are on all night, loud speakersblare without warning and privacy is severely limited. Security staff is focused on maintain\u00ading order and must assume each inmate is po\u00adtentially violent. The correctional environment is full of unavoidable triggers, such as pat downs and strip searches, frequent disciplinefrom authority figures, and restricted mov e- ment... .This is likely to increase trauma - related behaviors and symptoms that can be difficult for prison staff to manage ....Yet, if trauma -informed principles are introduced, all staff can play a major role in minimizing trig\u00adgers, stabilizing offenders, reducing critical in\u00adcidents, deescalating situations, and avoidingrestraint, seclusion o r other measures that may repeat aspects of past abuse . The Need for Training Behavioral health service providers working with clients who have mental, substance use, and trauma- related disorders need to have the best knowledge, skills, and abilities. Substanceabuse counselors, in particular, require additio n\u00ad al training and skill development to be able toextend trauma -informed services (within the 178 Exhibit 2.2 -1: Clinical Practice Issues Relevant to Counselor Training in Trauma - Informed Treatment Settings Some substance abuse counseling strategies commonly used to work through clients' denial and minimization of their substance use issues may be inappropriate when working with trauma sur\u00ad vivors (e.g., highly confrontational models can remind trauma survivors of emotional abuse). Training: The Stages of Change model of addiction treatment can help counselors shift from the traditional confrontation of denial to conceptualizing clients' ambivalence about changing substance use patterns as a normal part of the precontemplation stage of change. This method is a respectf ul cognitive -behavioral approach that helps counselors match counseling strategies to their assessment of where each client is in each stage of change, with the ultimate goal of helping clients make changes to health risk behaviors. (Connors, Donovan, & DiClemente, 2001 ). The 12 -Step concept of powerlessness (Step 1) may seem unhelpful to trauma survivors for whom the emotional reaction to powerlessness is a major part of their trauma (particularly for victims of repetitive trauma, such as child abuse or intimate partner violence). It can be confus\u00ad ing and counterproductive to dwell on this concept of powerlessness regarding trauma when the therapeutic objective for trauma -informed counseling methods should be to help clients empower themselves. For people in recovery, powerl essness is a paradox, sometimes misunde r\u00ad stood by both counselors and clients, in that the acknowledgment of powerlessness often cr e\u00ad ates a sense of empowerment. Most clients, with support and respectful guidance from a counselor, will come to understand that powerlessness (as used in 12 -Step programs) is not an inability to stand up for oneself or express a need, and it does not mean for one to be powerless in the face of abuse. With this understanding, clients may become more open to participating in 12-Step groups as a resource for their recovery from substance use disorders. When clients co n\u00ad tinue to struggle with this concept and decline to participate in 12 -Step recovery efforts, they may benefit from referral to other forms of mutual -help programs or recovery support groups in which the concept of powerlessness over the substance of abuse is not such a significant issue. Training: The TSF model can help counselors develop a more supportive and understanding approach to facilitating clients' involvement in 12-Step recovery groups (if this is a client - generated recovery goal). \"Although based on standard counseling models, TSF differs from them in several ways. These differences include TSF's strong emphasis on therapist support, di s\u00ad couragement of aggressiv e 'confrontation of denial' and therapist and highly f o\u00ad cused and structured format\" (Sholomskas & Carroll, 2006, p. 939). Another well -intentioned, but often misguided, approach by counselors who have not had fo r\u00ad mal or extensive training is \"digging\" for trauma memories without a clear therapeutic rationale or understanding of client readiness. In doing so, the counselor may unintentionally retraumatize the client or produce other harmful effects. In early intervention, it is sufficient simply to acknowledge and validate the pain and suffering of the client without uncovering or exploring specific trauma memories. The counselor who is insufficiently trained in trauma -informed clinical (Continued on the next page.) Part 2, Chapter 2 \u2014Building a Trauma -Informed Workforce limits of their professional licensure and scope of practice) to clients who have co -occurring substance use, trauma -related, o r mental diso r\u00ad ders. Many clinical practice issues in traditional substance abuse treatment are inconsistent with trauma -informed practice, which needs to be addressed with further training. Similarly, me n\u00ad tal health clinicians often need t raining in substance abuse treatment , as they typically do not have background s or experience in that domain. More over, s everal surveys indicate that clinicians consistently perceive the co m\u00ad bination of trauma and substance abuse as harder to treat than either one alone ( Najavits, Norman, Kivlahan , & Kosten, 2010). It is thus key to emphasize cross -training as part of TIC. Exhibit 2.2 -1 addresses these issues and offers suggestions for additional training. 179 Exhibit 2.2 -1: Clinical Practice Issues Relevant to Counselor Training in Trauma - Informed Treatment Settings (continued) practice may also press agendas that are ultimately unhelpful, such as insisting that the client forgive an abuser, pursue a legal case against a perpetrator, or engage in trauma treatment, even when the client may not be ready for such steps. These efforts are particularly inappropriate for clients in early recovery from substance use disorders. The first goal in treatment is stabilization Training: The Seeking Safety model of treating substance abuse and posttraumatic stress disor\u00ad der (PTSD) can help counselors focus on the primary goal of stabilization and safety in TIC. This model emphasizes safety as the target goal, humanistic themes such as honesty and compassion, and mak ing cognitive -behavioral therapy accessible and interesting to clients who may otherwise be difficult to engage (Najavits, 2002a). Treatment should be client -centered; it should acknowledge the client's right to refuse counsel\u00ad ing for trauma -related issues . It is important to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of ex\u00ad ploring trauma -related concerns, and then, following an open discussion, to allow clients the right to choose their path. This discussion should be part of the informed consent process at the start of treatment. Clients also have the right to change their minds. Training: Motivational interviewing , a client -centered, nonpathologizing counseling method, can aid clients in resolving ambivalence about and committing to changing health risk beha viors including substance use, eating disorders, self-injury, avoidant and aggressive behaviors assoc i\u00ad ated with Westra, & Rollnick, 2008; Kress & Hoffman, 2008). Training in MI can help counselors remain focused on the client's agenda for change, discuss the pros and cons of treatment options, and emphasize the personal choice and autonomy of clients. Exhibit 2.2 -2: Guidelines for Training in Mental Health Interventions for Trauma - Exposed Populations After a year of collaboration in 2002, the Task Force on International Trauma Training of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies published a consensus -based set of recommen\u00ad dations for training. Core curricular elements of the recommended training include: Competence in listening. Recognition of psychosocial and mental problems to promote appropriate assessment. Familiarity with established interventions in the client population. Full understanding of the local context, including help-seeking expectations, duration of trea t\u00ad ment, attitudes toward intervention, cost -effectiveness of intervention, and family attitudes and involvement. Strategies for solving problems on the individual, family, and community levels. Treatment approache s for medically unexplained somatic pain. Collaboration with existing local resources and change agents (e.g., clergy, traditional healers, informal leaders). Self-care components. Source: Weine et al., 2002. Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services In addition to the training needs of substance abuse counselors, all direct care workers inmental health settings , community- based pr o\u00ad grams, crisis intervention settings, and crimi\u00adnal justice environments should receive training in TIC. Guidelines for training in assisting trauma -exposed populations are pr e\u00ad sented in Exhibit 2.2 -2. Continuing Educa tion Research on the effectiveness of single -session didactic and/or skill -building workshops 180 Advice to Administrators: Trauma -Informed Staff Training Establish training standards for the evidence -based and promising trauma -informed practice models (such as Seeking Safety) adopted by your organization. Bring expert trainers with well -developed curricula in TIC and trauma -specific practices into your organization. Select a core group of clinical supervisors and senior counselors to attend multi session training or certification programs. These clinicians can then train the rest of the staff. Use sequenced, longitudinal training experiences instead of single -session seminars or work \u00ad shops. Emphasize interactive and experiential learning activities over purely didactic training. Provide ongoing mentoring/coaching to behavioral health professionals in addition to regular clinical supervision to enhance compliance with the principles and practices of TIC and to foster counselor mastery of trauma -speci fic practice models. Build organization -wide support for the ongoing integration of new attitudes and counselor skills to sustain constructive, TIC-consistent changes in practice patterns. Provide adequate and ongoing training for clinical supervisors in the theory and practice of clini\u00ad cal supervision and the principles and practices of TIC. Include information and interactive exercises on how counselors can identify, prevent, and am e\u00ad liorate secondary traumatic stress (STS) reactions in staff trainings. Offer cross -training opportunities to enhance knowledge of trauma -informed processes throug h\u00ad out the system. Part 2, Chapter 2 \u2014B uilding a Trauma -Informed Workforce demon strates that immediate gains in counse\u00ad lor knowledge and skills diminish quickly after the training event (Martino, Canning -Ball, Carroll, & Rounsavill e, 2011). Consequently, organizations may be spending their scarce financial resources on sending counselors tothis kind of training but may not be reaping adequate returns with regard to long -lasting changes in counselor skills and the develo p\u00ad ment of tra uma-informed and trauma -specific counselor competencies. Hoge et al. (2007)suggest the implementation of training strat e\u00ad gies for behavioral health professional s that have proven to be effective in improving coun\u00adselor skills, attitudes, and practice approa detailing; auditing of practice with feedbackto the reminders; the use of opinionleaders to influence pract ice; and patient - mediated interventions, such as providing i n\u00ad formation on treatment options to persons inrecovery, which in turn influences the practice patterns of their providers \" (p. 124). Trauma -Informed Counselor Competencies Hoge et al. (2007) identified a number ofcounselor competencies in behavioral healthpractices that are consistent with the skills needed to be effective in a trauma -informed system of care. They include person -centered planning, culturally competent care,development of therapeutic alliances, sharedresponsibility for decisions, collaboratively developed recovery plans, evidence -based practices , recovery -and resilience -oriented care, interdisciplinary and consumer/client advocacy. Inaddition, cou nselor competencies critical to the effective delivery of services to clients withtrauma -related disorders include : Screening for and assessment of traumahistory and trauma -related disorders , such as mood and anxiety disorders. Awareness of difference s between trauma - informed and trauma -specific services. 181 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services Understanding the bidirectional relatio n\u00ad ships among substance use and mental di s\u00ad orders and trauma. Engagement in person -centered counseling. Competence in delivering trauma -informed and trauma- specific evidence -based inte r\u00ad ventions t hat lessen the symptoms associa t\u00ad ed with trauma and improve quality of life for clients. Awareness of and commitment to couns e\u00ad lor self -care practices that prevent or lessen the impact of secondary traumatization onbehavioral h ealth workers. Exhibit 2.2 -3 provides a checklist of competen\u00ad cies for counselors working in trauma -informed behavioral health settings. Administrators and clinical supervisors can use this checklist toassess behavioral health professional s' unde r\u00ad standing of trauma awareness and counselingskills and determine the need for additional training and clinical supervision. Counselor Responsibilities and Ethics Treating all clients in an ethical manner is an expectation of all healthcare providers. It is ofspecial importance when working with clients who have trauma -related disorders, as their trust in others may have been severely shaken.Counselors who work with traumatized ind i\u00ad viduals on a regular basis have special respo n\u00ad sibilities to their c lients because of the nature of this work. Administrators and clinical s u\u00ad pervisors in trauma -informed organizations should develop policies that clearly define the counselors' job and should provide education about the role of counselors in the organiz a\u00ad tion and their responsibilities to clients. General Principles Regarding Counselor Responsibilities The following are some general principles governing the responsibilities of counselors who provide behavioral health services forclient s with histories of tra uma: Counselors are responsible for routinely screening clients for trauma tic experiences and trauma- related symptoms (Ouimette & Brown, 2003; see also Treatment I m\u00ad provement Protocol [ TIP] 42, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Co- Occurring Disord ers, Center for Substance Abuse Treatment [CSAT] , 2005 c). Counselors should offer clients with sub\u00adstance use and trauma -related disorders continuing mental health services if it is within their professional license and scope of practice to do so . Counselor s are responsible for referring clients with substance use disorders and co - occurring trauma -related disorders to treatment that addresses both disorders when the treatment falls outside of the counselor 's professional license and scope of practice (Ouimet te & Brown, 2003). Counselors should refer clients with sub\u00adstance use disorders and co -occurring trauma -related disorders to concurrent pa r\u00ad ticipation in mutual- help groups if appro\u00ad priate (Ouimette & Brown, 2003). Counselors have a responsibility to practic e the principles of confidentiality in all inte r\u00ad actions with clients and to respect clients' wishes not to give up their right to priv i\u00ad leged communication.

Part 2, Chapter 2 \u2014B uilding a Trauma -Informed Workforce Ethics in Treating Traumatized Clients All behavioral health professional s must co n\u00ad form to the ethical guidelines established by their profession 's State licensing boards and/or certifying organizations. State licensing boardsfor substance abuse counseling, psychiatry,social work, psychology, professional counsel\u00ading, and other behavioral health professions provide regulatory stand ards for ethical pra c\u00ad tice in these professions. These boards alsohave specific procedures for responding tocomplaints regarding the actions of profes\u00adsional caregivers. Additionally, national profe s\u00ad sional societies have standards for ethical practices . Members of these organizations are expected to practice within the boundaries andscope of these standards. Some of these stan d\u00ad ards are quite explicit, whereas others are more genera l; most approach professional ethics not as a rigid set of rules, but rather , as a process of making ethical decision s. Clinical supervisors are responsible for i n\u00ad form ing counselors of their ethical responsi\u00ad bilities with regard to their own organization 's policies and procedures, monitoring superv i\u00ad sees' reading and understanding the codes of ethics of professional organizations and Statelicensing boards, and promoting counselorunderstanding of ethics and how to make d e\u00ad cisions ethically as a regular part of clinicalsupervision, team meetings, and counselortraining. Administrato rs can support high ethical standards by creating an organization - wide ethics task group consisting of counse\u00adlors, supervisors, and administrators who meetregularly to review and revise clinical policies in line with State and Federal law and profes\u00adsional codes of ethics. Administrators may also act as a support mechanism for counselors who need additional consultation regardingpotential ethical dilemmas with clients. The Green Cross Academy of Traumatology pr o\u00ad vides ethical guidelines for the treatment ofclients who have experienced trauma ; these guidelines are adapted in Exhibit 2.2-5. 185 Exhibit 2.2 -5: Green Cross Academy of Traumatology Ethical Guidelines for the Treatment of Clients Who Have Been Traumatized Respect for the dignity of clients Recognize and value the personal, social, spiritual, and cultural diversity present in society, wit h\u00ad out judgment. As a primary ethical commitment, make every effort to provide interventions with respect for the dignity of those served. Responsible caring Take the utmost care to ensure that interventions do no harm. Have a commitment to the care of those served until the need for care ends or the responsibility for care is accepted by another qualified service provider. Support colleagues in their work and respond promptly to their requests for help. Recognize that service to survivors of trauma can exact a toll in stress on providers. Maintain vigilance for signs in self and colleagues of such stress effects, and accept that dedication to the service of others imposes an obligation to sufficient self -care to prevent impaired functioning. Engage in continuing education in the appropriate areas of trauma response. Remain current in the field and ensure that interventions meet current standards of care. Integrity in relationships Clearly and accurately represent your training, competence, and credentials. Limit your practice to methods and problems for which you are appropriately trained and qualified. Readily refer to or consult with colleagues who have appropriate expertise; support requests for such referrals or consultations from clients. Maintain a commitment to confidentiality, ensuring that the rights of confidentiality and privacy are maintained for all clients. Do not provide professional services to people with whom you already have either emotional ties or extraneous relationships of responsibility. The one exception is in the event of an emer\u00ad gency in which no other qualified person is available. Refrain from entering other relationships with present or former clients, especially sexual rel a\u00ad tionships or relationships that normally entail accountability. Within agencies, ensure that confidentiality is consistent with organizational policies; explicitly inform individuals of the legal limits of confidentiality. Responsibi lity to society Be committed to responding to the needs generated by traumatic events, not only at the ind i\u00ad vidual level, but also at the level of community and community organizations in ways that are consistent with your qualifications, training, and com petence. Recognize that professions exist by virtue of societal charters in expectation of their functioning as socially valuable resources. Seek to educate government agencies and consumer groups about y our expertise, services, and standards; support efforts by these agencies and groups to ensure social benefit and consumer protection. If you become aware of activities of colleagues that may indicate ethical violations or impairment of functioning, seek first to resolve the matter through direct expression of concern and offers of help to those colleagues. Failing a satisfactory resolution in this manner, bring the matter to the attention of the officers of professional societies and of governments with jurisdiction over pr o\u00ad fessional misconduct. Clients' universal rights All clients have the right to: Not be judged for any behaviors they used to cope, either at the time of the trauma or after the trauma. Be treated at all times with respect, dignity, and concern for their well -being. Refuse treatment, unless failure to receive treatment places them at risk of harm to self or others. (Continued on the next page.) Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services 186 that create a safe therapeutic container. Some clients, especially those with longstanding disorders, bring a history of client -counselor relationshi ps to counseling. Clients who have been traumatized may need help understan d\u00ad ing the roles and responsibilities of both the counselor and the client. Clients with trauma - related conditions may also have special needs Exhibit 2.2 -5: Academy of Traumatology Ethical Guidelines for the Treatment of Clients Who Have Been Traumatized (continued) Be regarded as collaborators in their own treatment plans. Provide their informed consent before receiving any treatment. Not be discriminated against based on race, culture, sex, religion, sexual orientation, socioec o\u00ad nomic status, disability, or age. Have promises kept, particularly regarding issues related to the treatment contract, role of coun\u00ad selor, and program rules and expectations. Procedures for introducing clients to treatment Obtain informed consent, providing clients with information on what they can expect while receiving professional services. In addition to general information provided to all new clients, clients present\u00ad ing for treatment who have histories of trauma should also receive information on: The possible short -term and long -term effects of trauma treatment on the client and the client's relationships with others. The amount of distress typically experienced with any particular trauma treatment. Possible negative effects of a particular trauma treatment. The possibility of lapses and relapses when doing trauma work, and the fact that these are a normal and expected part of healing. Reach ing counseling goals through consensus Collaborate with clients in the design of a clearly defined contract that articulates a specific goal in a specific time period or a contract that allows for a more open- ended process with periodic evalua\u00ad tions of progress and goals. Informing clients about the healing process Clearly explain to clients the nature of the healing process, making sure clients understand. Encourage clients to ask questions about any and all aspects of treatment and the therapeutic relationship. Provide clients with answers in a manner they can understand. Encourage clients to inform you if the material discussed becomes overwhelming or intolerable. Inform clients of the necessity of contacting you or emergency services if they feel suicidal or homicidal, are at risk of self-injury, or have a sense of being out of touch with reality. Give clients written contact information about available crisis or emergency services. Inform clients about what constitutes growth and recovery and about the fact that some trauma symptoms may not be fully treatable. Address unrealistic expectation s clients may have about counseling and/or the recovery process. Level of functioning Inform clients that they may not be able to function at the highest level of their ability --or even at their usual l evel--when working with traumatic material. Prepare clients to experience trauma -related symptoms, such as intrusive memories, dissociative reactions, reexperiencing, avoidance behaviors, hypervigilance, or unusual emotional reactivity.

Part 2, Chapter 2 \u2014B uilding a Trauma -Informed Workforce Boundaries in therapeutic relationships Maintaining appropriate therapeutic bound a\u00ad ries is a primary ethical concern for behavioral health professionals. Counselors working with clients who have substance use, trauma - related, and other mental disorders may feel challenged at times to maintain boundaries 187 Advice to Clinical Supervisors: Recognizing Boundary Confusion Clinical supervisors should be aware of the following counselor behaviors that can indicate boundary confusion with clients: The counselor feels reluctant or embarrassed to discuss specific interactions with a client or d e\u00ad tails of the client's treatment in supervision or team meetings. The counselor feels possessive of the client, advocates with unusual and excessive vehemence for the client, or expresses an unreasonable sense of overresponsibility for the client. The counselor becomes defensive and closed to hearing ideas from the supervisor or the trea t\u00ad ment team members about approaches to working with a client and/or exploring his or her own emotional reactions to a client. The clinician begins or increases personal self-disclosu re to the client and is not able to identify legitimate clinical reasons for the self -disclosure. Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services in establishing appropriate boundaries in the counseling setting ; they may be particularly vulnerable and not understand or appreciate the need for professional boundaries, includ\u00ading not engaging in dual relationships. Forexample, some clients might experience acounselor 's boundary around not giving the client his or her personal phone number foremergency calls as a rejection or abando n\u00ad ment. Cultural considerations also influence therapeutic boundaries. Administrators, in collaboration with clinical supervisors, are responsible for creating poli\u00adcies regarding counselor and client boundariesfor various issues (e.g., giving and receiving gifts, counselor personal disclosure, and cou n\u00ad selor roles and responsibilities when attendingthe same 12 -Step meetings as clients) ; policies should be specific to their organization and conform to State and Federal law and beha v\u00ad ioral health professional codes of ethics. Clin i\u00ad cal supervisors are responsible for trainingcounselors in the informed consent process and effective ways to discuss boundaries withclients when they enter treatment. Guidelines for establishing and maintaining boundaries in thera peutic relationships , adapted from the Green Cross Academy of Traumatology, are given in Exhibit 2.2 -6. Clients with trauma histories may be especia l\u00ad ly vulnerable to counselor behaviors that are inconsistent or that are experienced by the client as boundary violations. Examples ofsuch behavior include: being late for appoin t\u00ad ments, ending counseling sessions early, r e\u00ad peatedly and excessively extending the sessiontime, canceling or \"forgetting \" appointments multiple times, spending time in the sessiontalking about their own needs and life exper i\u00ad ences, exploring opportunities for contact ou t\u00ad side the therapeutic relationship (includingmaking arrangements to meet at AA or other12-Step recovery group meetings), and enfor c\u00ad ing rules differently for one client t han for another . Due to the complex dynamics that can arise inthe treatment of clients with trauma histories,regularly scheduled clinical supervision, where issues of ethics and boundaries can be di s\u00ad cussed, is recommended for counselors. Formore inform ation on how clinical supervision can be effectively used, see TIP 52, Clinical Supervision and the Professional Development of the Substance Abuse Counselor (CSAT, 2009b). Boundary crossing and boundary violation Although guidelines and codes of ethics a re useful tools in helping clinical supervisors and counselors understand the boundaries between counselor s and client s, they are open to inter\u00ad pretation and are context -bound. Given these limitations, it is crucial to educate counselors 188 in TIC settings regarding the boundary issues that ma y arise for clients wh o have been tra u- matized and to give counselors a conceptual framework for understanding the contextual nature of boundaries. For example, it would be useful for clinical supervisors to discuss wit h Exhibit 2.2 -6: Boundaries in Therapeutic Relationships Procedures for Establishing Safety Roles and boundaries Counselor roles and boundaries should be established at the start of the counseling relationship and reinforced periodically, particularly at times when the client is experiencing high stress. Ongoing Relationships and the Issue of Boundaries Dual relationships Dual relationships and inappropriate interactions with clients are to be avoided. It is important to tell clients at the beginning of counseling that contact between the counselor and the client can only occur within the boundaries of the professional relationship. This information is part of the informed consent process. Relationships outside these boundaries include sexual or romantic relationships, a counselor also se rving as a client's sponsor in 12 -Step programs, and any kind of relationship in which the counselor exploits the client for financial gain. Sexual contact Never engage in any form of sexual contact with clients. Do not reward sexualized behaviors with attention or reactivity. Directly clarify the boundaries of the therapeutic relationship, and address the underlying mot i\u00ad vations of persisting sexualized behavior. Set limits on a client's inappropriate behaviors while maintaining an ethos of care. Maintain r e\u00ad spect for the dignity and worth of the client at all times. Understand that a client's attempt to sexualize a therapeutic relationship may reflect an early history of abuse, difficulty understanding social norms, or a variety of psychological problems. Readdress the absolute inappropriateness of sexual and/or romantic behavior in a nonlecturing, nonpunitive manner. If sexual behavior between clients occurs in a treatment program, counselors should consult wit h a clinical supervisor. Document the nature of the contact and how the issue is addressed. If a counselor has sexual contact with a client, he or she should take responsibility by ceasing counseling practice, referring clients to other treatment providers , and notifying legal and pr o\u00ad fessional authorities. If a counselor is at risk for engaging with a client sexually but has not acted on it, the counselor should immediately consult with a supervisor, colleague, or psychotherapist. Boundaries Counselors sh ould use care with self- disclosure or any behaviors that may be experienced as intr u\u00ad sive by the client, including: Personal disclosures made for the counselor's own gratification. Sexualized behavior with the client. Excessively intrusive questions or stat ements. Interrupting the client frequently. Violating the client's personal space . Interpersonal touch, which might activate intrusive memories or dissociative reactions or be ex\u00ad perienced as a boundary violation by the client. Being consistently late for a ppointments or allowing outside influences (such as telephone calls) to interrupt the client's time in a counseling session.

Part 2, Chapter 2 \u2014Building a Trauma -Informed Workforce 189 Case Illustration: Denise Denise is a 40- year-old licensed professional counselor w orking in an inpatient eating disorder pr o\u00ad gram. She has had extensive training in trauma and eating disorder counseling approaches and has been working as a clinician in mental health settings for 15 years. Denise is usually open to sugges\u00ad tions from her supervisor and other treatment team members about specific strategies to use w ith clients who have trauma histories and eating disorders. However, in the past week, her supervisor has noticed that she has become defensive in team meetings and individual supervision when discussing a recently admitted young adult who was beaten and raped by her boyfriend; subsequently, the cl i\u00ad ent was diagnosed with PTSD and anorexia. When the clinical supervisor makes note of the change in Denise's attitude and behavior in team meetings since this young woman was admitted, initially Denise becomes defensive, saying that the team just doesn't understand this young woman and that the client has repeatedly told Denise, \"You're the only counselor I trust.\" The clinical supervisor recognizes that Denise may be experiencing secondary traumatization and boundary confusion due to working with this young woman and to the recent increase in the number of clients with co -occurring trauma -related disorders on her caseload. After further ex ploration, Denise reveals that her own daughter was raped at the same age as the young woman and that hear\u00ad ing her story has activated an STS reaction in Denise. Her way of coping has been to become overly responsible for and overprotective of the young woman. With the nonjudgmental support of her supervisor, Denise is able to gain perspective, recognize that this young woman is not her daughter, and reestablish boundaries with her that are appropriate to the inpatient treatment setting. Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services counselors the distinction between boundary crossings and boundary violations in clinical practice. G utheil and Brodsky (2008) define boundary crossing as a departure from the customary norms of counseling practice inrelation to psychological, physical, or social space \"that are harmless, are nonexploitative, and may even support or advance the therapy \" (p. 20). Examples of boundary crossings i n\u00ad clude taking phone calls from a client betweensessions if the client is in crisis or telling aclient a story about the counselor 's recovery from trauma (without offering specific pe r\u00ad sonal information or graphic/detailed descri p\u00ad tion of the trauma) with the intention ofoffering hope that it is possible to recover. Gutheil and Brodsky (2008) define boundary violations as boundary crossings that are un\u00adwanted and dangerous and which exploit the client , stating that \"s ome boundary crossings are inadvisable because of their intent (i.e.,they are not done in the service of the patient's well- being and growth, involve extra ther a\u00ad peutic gratification for the therapist) and/or their effect (i.e., they are not likely to benefit the patient and entail a significant risk ofharming the patient) \" (pp. 20 -21). An exa m\u00ad ple of a bou ndary violation would be when a counselor invites a client to attend the same AA meetings the counselor attends or shares drinking and drugging \"war stories \" for the counselor 's own gratification. Two key ele\u00ad ments in understanding when a boundary crossing becomes a boundary v iolation are the intent of the counselor and the damaging e f\u00ad fect on the client. Maintaining a standard ofpractice of nonexploitation of the client is theprimary focus for clinical supervisors andcounselors in determining when boundar y crossings become boundary violations. Context is also an important consideration in determining the acceptability of boundary crossings. For example, it may be acceptable for a counselor in a partial hospitalization pr o\u00ad gram for serious mental illness to have a cupof coffee at the kitchen table with a resident,whereas for a counselor in an outpatient men\u00adtal health program, having a cup of coffee witha client at the local coffee shop would be amuch more questionable boundary crossing. 190 Advice to Clinical Supervisors and Administrators: Adopting an Evidence -Based Model of Clinical Supervision and Training Just as adopting evidence- based clinical practices in a trauma -informed organization is important in provid ing cost -effective and outcome- relevant services to clients, adopting an evidence- based mo d\u00ad el of clinical supervision and training clinical supervisors in that model can enhance the quality and effectiveness of clinical supervision for counselors. This will ultimately enhance client care. One of the most commonly used and researched integrative models of supervision is the discrimina\u00ad tion model, originally published by Janine Bernard in 1979 and since updated (Bernard & Goodyear, 2009). This model is conside red a competence -based and social role model of supervision; it i n\u00ad cludes three areas of focus on counselor competencies (intervention, conceptualization, and perso n\u00ad alization) and three possible supervisor roles (teacher, counselor, and consultant). Counsel or competencies: Intervention: The supervisor focuses on the supervisee's intervention skills and counseling stra t\u00ad egies used with a particular client in a given session. Conceptualization: The supervisor focuses on how the supervisee understands what is happen\u00ad ing in a session with the client. Personalization: The supervisor focuses on the personal style of the counselor and countertrans\u00ad ference responses (i.e., personal reactions) of the counselor to the client. Supervisor roles: Teacher: The supervisor tea ches the supervisee specific counseling theory and skills and guides the supervisee in the use of specific counseling strategies in sessions with clients. The supervisor as teacher is generally task -oriented. The supervisor is more likely to act as a teach er with begin \u00ad ning counselors. Counselor: The supervisor does not act as the counselor's therapist, but helps the counselor reflect on his or her counseling style and personal reactions to specific clients. The supervisor as counselor is interpersonally sensitive and focuses on the process and relational aspects of coun\u00ad seling. Consultant: The supervisor is more of a guide, offering the supervisee advice on specific clinical situations. The supervisor as consultant invites the counselor to identify topics a nd set the age n\u00ad da for the supervision. The supervisor is more likely to act as a consultant with more advanced counselors. This model of supervision may be particularly useful in working with counselors in TIC settings, b e\u00ad cause the supervisor's response to the supervisee is flexible and specific to the supervisee's needs. In essence, it is a counselor -centered model of supervision in which the supervisor can meet the most relevant needs of the supervisee in any given moment. For a review of other theories and methods of clinical supervision, refer to TIP 52, Clinical Supervision and Professional Development of the Substance Abuse Counselor (CSAT, 2009b). Part 2, Chapter 2 \u2014B uilding a Trauma -Informed Workforce Clinical Super vision and Consultation Organizational change toward a TIC model doesn 't happen in isolation. Ongoing support, supervision, and consultation are key ingred i\u00ad ents that reinforce behavioral health profe training in trauma- informed and trauma -specific counseling methods and en\u00adsure compliance with practice standards and consistency over time. Often, considerable energy and resources are spent on the transi\u00ad tion to new clinical and programmatic ap\u00adproaches , but without long -range planning to support those changes over time. The new treatment approach fades quickly, making ithard to recognize and lessening its reliability. 191 Case Illustration: Arlene Arlene is a 50-year- old licensed substance abuse counselor who has a personal history of trauma, and she is actively engaged in her own recovery from trauma. She is an experienced counselor who has several years of training in trauma -informed and trauma -specific counseling practices. Her clinical supervisor, acting in the role of consultant, begins the supervision session by inviting her to set the agenda. Arlene brings up a clinical situation in which she feels stuck with a client who is acting out in her Seeking Safety group (for more information on Seeking Safety, see Najavits, 2002a). Arlene reports that her client gets up suddenly and storms out of the group room two or three times during the session. The supervisor, acting in the role of the counselor and focusing on personaliz a\u00ad tion, asks Arlene to reflect on the client's behavior and what feelings are activated in her in response to the client's anger. Arlene is able to identify her own experience of hyperarousal and then paralysis as a stress reaction related to her prior experience of domestic violence in her first marriage. The supervisor, acting in the role of teacher and focusing on conceptualization, reminds Arlene that her client is experiencing a \"fight -or-flight\" response to some experience in the group that reminds her of her own trauma experience. The supervisor then suggests to Arlene that her own reactions are normal responses to her previous history of trauma, and that when her client is angry, Arlene is not reexperiencing her own trauma but is being activated by the client's traumatic stress reaction to being in group. In this way, the supervisor highlights the parallel process of the client -counselor's stress reactions to a perceived threat based on prior trauma experiences. The supervisor, acting again as a consultant and focusing on personalization this time, invites Arlene to reflect on the internal and external resources she might be able to bring to this situation that will help remind her to ground herself so she can lessen the impact of her stress reactions on her coun\u00ad seling strategy with this client. Arlene states that she can create a list of safe people in her life and place this list in her pocket before group. She can use this list as a touchstone to remind her that she is safe and has learned many recovery skills that can help her stay grounded, maintain her bound a\u00ad ries, and deal with her client's behavior. The clinical supervisor, acting as a consultant and now focu s\u00ad ing on intervention, asks Arlene if she has some specific ideas about how she can address the client's behavior in group. Arlene and the clinical supervisor spend the remainder of the session discussing different options for addressing the client's behavior and helping her feel safer in group. Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services Ongoing supervision and consultation sup\u00ad ports the organizational message that TIC is the standard of practice. It normalizes secon d\u00ad ary traumatization as a systemic issue (not the individual pathology of the counselor) andreinforces the need for counselor self- care to prevent and lessen the impact of secondary traumatization. Quality clinical supervision fordirect care staff demonstrates the organiz a\u00ad tion's commitment to implementing a fully integrated, trauma -informed system of care. Supervision and Consultat ion Historically, there was an administrative beliefthat counselors who had extensive clinical experience and training would naturally be the best clinical supervisors. However, research does not support this idea (Falender &Shafranske, 2004). Although a competentclinical supervis or needs to have an extensive clinical background in the treatment of sub\u00adstance use, trauma -related, and other mental disorders, it is also essential for any counselormoving into a supervisory role to have exten\u00adsive training in the theory and practice of clin\u00ad ical supervision before taking on this role. Inparticular, clinical supervisors in trauma - informed behavioral health settings should be educated in how to perform clinical superv i\u00ad sion (not just administrative supervision) ofdirect service staff and i n the importance of providing continuous clinical supervision andsupport for staff members working with ind i\u00ad viduals affected by trauma . Clinical 192 Part 2, Chapter 2 \u2014Building a Trauma -Informed Workforce supervision in a TIC organization should f o\u00ad cus on the following priorities: General case consultation Specialized consultation in specific and unusual cases Opportunities to process clients' traumatic material Boundaries in the therapeutic and superv i\u00ad sory relationship Assessment of secondary traumatization Counselor self -care and stress management Personal growth and profession al deve l\u00ad opment of the counselor Supervision of counselors working with tra u\u00ad matized clients should be regularly scheduled,with identified goals and with a supervisorwho is trained and experienced in workingwith trauma survivors. The styles and types ofsupervision and consultation may vary accor d\u00ad ing to the kind of trauma work and its context.For instance, trauma counseling in a majornatural disaster would require a different a p\u00ad proach to supervision and consultation thanwould co unseling adults who experienced childhood developmental trauma or counsel\u00ading clients in an intensive early recovery treatment program using a manualizedtrauma -specific counseling protocol. Competenc Competenc e-based clinical supervision models identify the knowledge and clinical skills each counselor needs to master , and they use targeted learning strategies and evaluationprocedures, such as direct observation of coun\u00adselor sess ions with clients, individualized coaching, and performance -based feedback. Studies on competenc e-based supervision ap\u00ad proaches have demonstrated that these models improve counselor treatment skills and prof i\u00ad ciency (Martino et al., 2011). Whichever model of clinical supervision an organization adopts, the key to successful trauma -informed clinical supervision is the recognition that interactions between the su\u00ad pervisor and the counselor may parallel those between the counselor and the client. Clinical superv isors need to recognize counselors' trauma reactions (whether they are primary orsecondary to the work with survivors of tra u\u00ad ma) and understand that a confrontational or punitive approach will be ineffective and likely retraumatize counselors. Clinical supervisors should adopt a respectful and collaborative working relationship withcounselors in which role expectations are clearly defined in an informed consent process similar to that used in the beginning of thecounselor -client relationship and in whic h exploring the nature of boundaries in bothclient -counselor and counselor -supervisor relationships is standard practice. Clear role boundaries, performance expectations, opendialog, and supervisor transparency can go along way toward creating a safe an d respectful relationship container for the supervisor andsupervisee and set the stage for a mutually enhancing, collaborative re lationship. This respectful, collaborative supervisory relatio n\u00ad ship is the main source of training and profe s\u00ad sional growth for the counselor and for the provision of quality care to people with behav\u00ad ioral health disorders. Secondary Traumatization The demands of caregiving exact a price frombehavioral health professional s that cannot be ignored; otherwise, they may become ineff ec\u00ad tive in their jobs or, worse, emotionally orpsychologically impaired. In a study of Mas\u00ad ter's level licensed social workers, 15.2 percent of respondents to a survey reported STS as a result of indirect exposure to trauma material at a level that meets the diagnostic criteria forPTSD. This rate is almost twice the rate of PTSD in the general population. The author 193 Advice to Clinical Supervisors: Recognizing Secondary Traumatization Some counselor behaviors that demonstrate inconsistency to clients may be outward mani\u00ad festations of secondary traumatization, and they shou ld be discussed with counselors through a trauma -informed lens. It is imper a\u00ad tive that clinical supervisors provide a non\u00ad judgmental, safe context in which counselors can discuss these behaviors without fear of reprisal or reprimand. Clinical supervisors should work collaboratively with supervisees to help them understand their behavior and e n\u00ad gage in self- care activities that lessen the stress that may be contributing to these behaviors. STS is a trauma - related stress reaction and set of symptoms r esulting from exposure to another individual's traumatic experiences rather than from exposure directly to a traumatic event. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services concluded that be- havioral health pr o- fessional s' ex perience of STS is a contri b\u00ad u ting factor in staff turnover and one reason why ma ny behavioral health ser vice professionals leave the field (Bride, 2007). Se c\u00ad on dary traumatization of behavioral health workers is a significant organizational issue for clinical supervisors and administrators in sub\u00adstance abuse and mental health treatment pro\u00ad grams to address. To prevent or lessen the impact of secondary traumatization on behavioral health profe s\u00ad sionals, clinical supervisors and administrators need to understand secondary trauma from the ecological perspective described in Part 1,Chapter 1 of this TIP . The orga nization itself creates a social context with risk factors that can increase the likelihood of counselors exp e\u00ad riencing STS reactions, but it also containsprotective factors that can lessen the risk andimpact of STS reactions on staff members. Organizatio ns can lessen the impact of the risk factors associated with working intrauma -informed organizations by mixing caseloads to contain clients both with and without trauma -related issues, supporting ongoing counselor training , providing regular clinical supe rvision , recognizing counselors' efforts, and offering an empowering work environment in which counselors share in the responsibility of making decisions and can offer input into clinical and program policiesthat affect their work lives. When organization s support their counselors in their work with clients who are trauma\u00ad tized, counselors can be more effective, more productive, and feel greater personal and pr o\u00adfessional satisfaction. In addition, counselors develop a sense of allegiance toward the o r\u00ad ganization, thus decreasing staff turnover. If organizations do not provide this support,counselors can become demoralized and have fewer emotional and psychological resources to manage the impact of clients' traumatic material and outward behavioral expression s of trauma on their own well- being. Providing counselors with the resources to help them build resilience and prevent feeling over\u00adwhelmed should be a high priority for admi n\u00ad istrators and clinical supervisors in TIC organizations. Risk and Protective Fact ors Associated With Secondary Traumatization Clinical and research literature on trauma d e\u00ad scribes a number of factors related to the d e\u00ad velopment of secondary trauma reactions andpsychological distress in behavioral health professional s across a wide range of practice settings, as well as individual and organiz a\u00ad tional factors that can prevent or lessen the impact of STS on staff. The risk and protec\u00ad tive factors model of understanding secondary trauma is based on the ecological perspective 194 Advice to Clinical Supervisors: Recognizing STS in Counselors Who Are In Recovery For counselors who are in recovery from a sub\u00ad stance use or mental disorder, the develo p\u00ad ment of STS may be a potential relapse concern. As Burke, Carruth, and Prichard (2006) point out, \"a return to drinking or illicit drug use as a strategy for dealing with second\u00ad ary trauma reactions would have a profoundly detrimental effect on the recovering couns e\u00ad lor\" (p. 292). So too, secondary trauma may ignite the reappearance of depressive o r anxie\u00ad ty symptoms associated with a previous mental disorder. Clinical supervisors can address these risk factors with counselors and support them in engaging with their own recovery support network (which might include a peer support group or an individual counselor) to develop a relapse prevention plan. Part 2, Chapter 2 \u2014B uilding a Trauma -Informed Workforce outlined in Part 1, Chapter 1 of this TIP . The terms \"compassion fatigue, \" \"secondary traumatization, \" and \"burnout \" are used in the literature, sometimes interchangeably and sometimes as distinctconstructs. As stated in the terminology por\u00ad tion of the \"How This TIP Is Organized\" sec\u00adtion that precedes Part 1, Chapter 1 , of this TIP , the term \"secondary traumat ization \" re\u00ad fers to traumatic stress reactions and psych o\u00ad logical distress from exposure to anotherindividual 's traumatic experiences; this term will be used throughout this section, although the studies cited may use other terms. Risk factors Individual risk factors that may contribute tothe development of STS in behavioral health professionals include preexisting anxiety ormood disorders; a prior history of personal trauma; high caseloads of clients with trauma - related disorders; being younger in age and new to the field with little clinical experience ortraining in treating trauma- related conditions; unhealthy coping styles, including distancingand detachment from clients and co -workers; and a lack of tolerance for strong emotions ( Newall & M acNeil, 2010). Other negative coping strategies include substance abuse, ot h\u00ad er addictive behaviors, a lack of recreational activities not related to work , and a lack of engagement with social support. A recent study of trauma nurses found that low use ofsupport systems, use of substances, and a lack of hobbies were among the coping strategies that differed between nurses with and without STS (Von Rueden et al., 2010). Other r e\u00ad searchers found that clinic ians who engaged in negative coping strategies, such as alcohol andillicit drug use, were more likely to experience intrusive trauma symptoms (Way, Van Deusen, Martin, Applegate, & Janle, 2004). Numerous organizational factors can contrib\u00ad ute to the development of STS in counselors who work with clients with trauma -related disorders. These risk factors include organiz a\u00ad tional constraints , such as lack of resources for clients, lack of clinical supervision for counse\u00adlors, lack of support from colleagues, and lack of acknowledgment by the organizational cu l\u00ad ture that secondary traumatization exists andis a normal reaction of counselors to client trauma (Newall & M acNeil, 2010). In a study of 259 individuals providing mental healthcounseling services, counselors who spentmore time in session with clients with trauma - related disorders reported higher levels oftraumatic stress symptoms (Bober & Regehr,2006). Counselors may be more at risk fordeveloping secondary traumatization if the organization does not allow for balancing thedistribution of trauma and non trauma c ases amongst staff members. Protective factors Much of the clinical and research literature focuses on individual factors that may lessenthe impact of STS on behavioral health pr o\u00ad fessional s, includ ing male gender , being older, having more years of professional experience, 195 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services having specialized training in trauma - informed and trauma -specific counseling practices, lacking a personal trauma history , exhibiting personal autonomy in the wor k\u00ad place , using positive personal coping styles, and possessing resilience or the ability to find meaning in stressful life events and to rebound from adversity ( Sprang, Clark, & Whitt - Woosley, 2007). Some of these factors, like positive personal coping styles and the abi lity to find meaning in adversity, can be developedand enhanced through personal growth work,psychotherapy, engagement with spiritual practices and involvement in the spiritualcommunity, and stress reduction strategies like mindfu lness meditation. A recent mult i- method study of an 8 -week workplace min d\u00ad fulness training group for social workers andother social service workers found that min d\u00ad fulness meditation increased coping strategies,reduced stress, and enhanced self -care of the participants ; findings suggested that workers were more likely to practice stress manag e\u00ad ment techniques like mindfulness at their place of work than at home (McGarrigle & Walsh, 2011). Organizations can supportcounselors' individual efforts to enhance posi\u00ad tive personal coping s tyles, find meaning in adversity, and reduce stress by providing time for workers during the workday for personal self-care activities, like mindfulness meditation and other stress reduction practices. One of the organizational protective factors identified in the literature that may lessen the negative impact of secondary traumatizationon behavioral health professionals is providing adequate training in trauma -specific counse l\u00ad ing strategies, which increases providers ' sense of efficacy in helping clients with trauma - related disorders and reduces the sense of hopelessness that is often a part of the work (Bober & Regehr 2006). One study found thatspecialized trauma training enhanced job sa t\u00ad isfaction and reduced levels of compassion fatigue, suggesting tha t \"knowledge and trai n\u00ad ing might provide some protection against the deleterious effects of trauma exposure \" (Sprang et al., 2007, p. 272). Another prote c\u00ad tive factor that may lessen the chances of d e\u00ad veloping secondary traumatization is having a diverse case load of clients. Organizations \"must determine ways of distributing wor k\u00ad load in order to limit the traumatic exposure of any one worker. This may not only serve toreduce the impact of immediate symptoms butmay also address the potential longitudinal effects\" (Bober & Regehr, 2006, p. 8) . Emotional support from professional co l\u00ad leagues can be a protective factor. A study of substance abuse counselors working with cli\u00ad ents who were HIV positive found that wor k\u00ad place support from colleagues and supervisors most effectively prevented burnout (Shoptaw, Stein, & Rawson, 2000). This support was associated with less emotional fatigue anddepersonalization , along with a sense of grea t\u00ad er personal accomplishment. In a study of d o\u00ad mestic violence advocates, workers whoreceived more support from professional peers were less likely to experience secondary tra u\u00ad matization (Slattery & Goodman, 2009). In addition, counselor engagement in relatio n\u00ad ally based clinical supervision with a trauma - informed supervisor acts as a protec tive agent. Slattery and Goodman (2009) note that \"f or the trauma worker, good supervision can no r\u00ad malize the feelings and experiences, provide support and information about the nature andcourse of the traumatic reaction, help in theidentification of tran sference and counter- transference issues, and reveal feelings orsymptoms associated with the trauma \" (p. 1362). Workers who reported \"engaging, au\u00ad thentic, and empowering relationships withtheir supervisors\" were less likely to experience STS (p. 1369). Thus, it is not simply the fr e\u00ad quency and regularity of clinical supervision, 196 Part 2, Chapter 2 \u2014Building a Trauma -Informed Workforce but also the quality of the supervision and the quality of the supervisor -counselor relatio n\u00ad ship that can lessen the impact of STS on behavioral health professional s. Engagement with a personal practice of spirit\u00ad uality that provides a sense of connection to alarger perspective and meaning in life is a n\u00ad other protective factor that can lessen the i m\u00ad pact of STS on counselors (Trippany, Kress, & Wilcoxon, 2004). Although recovering c oun\u00ad selors may look to support groups for connec\u00ad tion to a spiritual community, other behavioralhealth professionals might find support forenhancing spiritual meaning and connectionin church, a meditation group, creative en\u00addeavors, or even volunteer work. The key is forcounselors to develop their own unique r e\u00ad sources and practices to enhance a sense ofmeaningful spirituality in their lives. Clinical supervisors should be aware of spiritual en\u00adgagement as a protective factor in preventingand lessening the impact of STS and should support clinicians in including it in their self - care plans, but they should take care not topromote or reject any particular religious beliefsystem or spiritual practice. Another protective factor that may lessen the impact of workers' STS is a culture of empo w\u00ad erment in the organization that offers couns e\u00ad lors a sense of autonomy, a greater ability to participate in making decisions about clinical and organizational polic ies, and obtaining support and resources that further their pro\u00ad fessional development. Slattery & Goodman(2009) surveyed 148 domestic violence adv o\u00ad cates working in a range of settings. The a u\u00ad thors found that those workers \"who reported a high level of shared power were less likely toreport posttraumatic stress symptoms, despite their own personal abuse history or degree ofexposure to trauma \" (p. 1370). To the degree that organizations can provide a cultural co n\u00ad text within which behavioral health profe s\u00adsional s have autonomy and feel empowered, they will be able to lessen the impact of STSon their professional and personal lives. Self - efficacy and empowerment are antidotes to the experience of powerlessness that often acco m\u00ad panies trauma. Strategies for Preventing Secondary Traumatization The key to prevention of secondary traumat i\u00ad zation for behavioral health professionals in a trauma -informed organization is to reduce risk and enhance protective factors. Organiz a\u00ad tional strategies to prevent secondary trauma\u00ad tization include: Normalize STS throughout all levels of the organization as a way to help counselors feel safe and respected, enhancing the like\u00adlihood that they will talk openly about theirexperiences in team meetings, peer superv i\u00ad sion, and clinical supervision. Implement clinical workload policies andpractices that maintain reasonable stan d\u00ad ards for direct -care hours and emphasize balancing trauma- related and nontrauma \u00ad related counselor caseloads. Increase the availability of opportunities forsupportive professional relationships by promoting activities such as team meetings,peer supervision groups, staff retreats, and counselor training that focuses on under\u00ad standing secondary traumatization and self - care. Administrators and clinical superv i\u00ad sors should provide time at work for coun\u00adselors to engage in these activities. Provide regular trauma -informed clinical supervision that is relationally based. S u\u00ad pervisors should be experienced and trainedin trauma- informed and trauma -specific practices and provide a competence- based model of clinical supervision that promotes counselors' professional and personal devel\u00ad opment. Supervision limited to case consul\u00adtation or case management is insufficient to 197 Exhibit 2.2 -7: Counselor Strategies To Prevent Secondary Traumatization Strategies that counselors can use (with the support and encouragement of supervisors and admini s\u00ad trators) to prevent secondary traumatization include: Peer support: Maintaining adequate social support, both personally and professionally, helps prevent isolation and help s counselors share the emotional distress of working with traumatized individuals. Supervision and consultation: Professional consultation will help counselors understand second\u00ad ary traumatization, their own personal risks, the protective factors that can help them prevent or lessen its impact, and their countertransference reactions to specific clients. Training : Ongoing professional training can improve counselors ' understanding of trauma and enhance a sense of mastery and self-efficacy in their work. Personal psychotherapy or counseling : Being in counseling can help counselor s become more self-aware and assist them in managing the psychological and emotional distress that often a c\u00ad companies working with clients who have trauma histories in a number of behavioral health set\u00ad tings. Maintaining balance in one's life : Balancing work and personal life, developing positive coping styles, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can enhance resilience and the ability to manage stress. Engaging in spiritual activities that provide meaning and perspective : Connection to a spiritu\u00ad al community a nd spiritual practices (such as meditation) can help counselors gain a larger per\u00ad spective on trauma and enhance resilience. Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services reduce the risk for secondary traumatiz a\u00ad tion and promote counselor resilience. Provide opportunities for behavioral health professional s to enhance their sense of a u\u00ad tonomy and feel empowered within the organization. Some of these activities i n\u00ad clude soliciting input from counselors onclinical and administrative policies that af\u00adfect t heir work lives, including how to best balance caseloads of clients with and wit h\u00ad out histories of trauma; inviting represen t\u00ad atives of the counseling staff to attendselected agency board of directors and/or management team meetings to offer inputon workforce development; and invitingcounselors to participate in organizationaltask forces that develop trauma -informed services, plan staff retreat s, or create mech\u00ad anism s to discuss self -care in team meet\u00ad ings. Administrators and clinicalsupervisors should ass ess the organization 's unique culture and develop avenues forcounselor participation in activities thatwill enhance their sense of empowermentand efficacy within the organization. Exhibit 2.2 -7 highlights some specific strat e\u00ad gies that individual counsel ors can engage in to prevent secondary traumatization. Assessment of Secondary Traumatization Counselors with unacknowledged STS can harm clients, self, and family and friends by becoming unable to focus on and attend to their needs or those of others. They may feelhelpless or cynical and withdra w from support systems. Exhibit 2.2 -8 describes some emo\u00ad tional, cognitive, and behavioral signs thatmay indicate that a counselor is experiencingsecon dary traumatization. Clinical supervisors should be familiar with the manifestations of STS in their counselors and should address signs of STS immediately. Stamm (2009-2012) has developed and r e\u00ad vised a self -assessment tool, the P rofessional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL), thatmeasures indicators of counselor compassionfatigue and compassion satisfaction. Compa s\u00ad sion fatigue \"is best defined as a syndrome consisting of a combination of the symptoms 198 Exhibit 2.2 -8: Secondary Traumatization Signs The following are some indicators that counselors may be experiencing secondary traumatization. Psychological distress Distressing emotions: grief, depression, anxiety, dread, fear, rage, shame Intrusive imagery of client's traumatic material : nightmares, flooding, flashbacks of client discl o\u00ad sures Numbing or avoidance : avoidance of working with client's traumatic material Somatic issues: sleep disturbances, headaches, gastrointestinal distress, heart palpitations, chronic physiological arousal Addictive/compulsive behaviors : substance abuse, compulsive eating, compulsive working Impaired functioning : missed or canceled appointments, decreased use of supervision, d e\u00ad creased ability to engage in self -care, isolation and alienation Cognitiv e shifts Chronic suspicion about others Heightened sense of vulnerability Extreme sense of helplessness or exaggerated sense of control over others or situations Loss of personal control or freedom Bitterness or cynicism Blaming the victim or see ing everyo ne as a victim Witness or clinician guilt if client reexperiences trauma or reenacts trauma in counseling Feeling victimized by client Relational disturbances Decreased intimacy and trust in personal/professional relationships Distancing or detachment from client, which may include labeling clients, pathologizing them, judging them, canceling appointments, or avoiding exploring traumatic material Overidentification with the client, which may include a sense of being paralyzed by one's own responses to the c lient's traumatic material or becoming overly responsible for the client's life Frame of reference Disconnection from one's sense of identity Dramatic change in fundamental beliefs about the world Loss or distortion of values or principles A previous sense of spirituality as comfort or resource decreases or becomes nonexistent Loss of faith in something greater Existential despair and loneliness Sources: Figley, 1995; Newall & MacNeil, 2010; 2, Chapter 2 \u2014B uilding a Trauma -Informed Workforce of secondary traumatic stress and professional burnout \" (Newall & MacNeil, 2010, p. 61). Although secondary traumatization as a rea c\u00ad tion to exposure to clients' trauma material is similar to PTSD, burnout is a more general type of psychological distress related to the pressures of working in high -stress enviro n\u00ad ments over time. Burnout may ofsecondary traumatization and/or a contri b\u00ad uting factor in the development of secondary traumatization. The ProQOL includes STS and burnout scales that have been validated in research studies (Adams, Figley, & Boscarino,2008; Newall & MacNeil, 2010). This tool can be used in individual and group clinical supervision, trainings on self -care, and team meetings as a way for counselors tocheck in with themselves on their levels of stress and potential signs of secondary traumatization. 199 Case Illustration: Gui Gui is a 48-year-old licensed substance abuse counselor who has worked in a methadone maint e\u00ad nance clinic for 12 years. He originally decided to get his degree and become a counselor because he wanted to help people and make a difference in the world. Over the past 6 months, he has felt fatigued a great deal, gets annoyed easily with both clients and coworkers, and has developed a cynical attitude about the world and the p eople who come to the clinic for help. During this time, the clinic has been forced to lay off a number of counselors due to funding cutbacks. As a result, Gui and the remaining counselors have had a 20 percent increase in the number of weekly client contact hours required as part of their job duties. In addition, the level and severity of clients' trauma -related and other co- occurring disorders, poverty, joblessness, and homelessness has increased. Gui is a valued employee, and when Gui discusses his thoughts that he might want to leave the clinic with his clinical supervisor, the supervisor listens to Gui's concerns and explores the possibility of having him fill out the ProQOL to get a pulse on his stress level. Gui agrees and is willing to discuss the results with his supervisor. He is not surprised to see that he scores above average on the bur n\u00ad out scale of the instrument but is very surprised to see that he scores below average on the second\u00ad ary traumatic stress scale and above average on the compassion satisfaction scale. He begins to feel more hopeful that he still finds satisfaction in his job and sees that he is resilient in many ways that he did not acknowledge before. Gui and the clinical supervisor discuss ways that the supervisor and the organization can lessen the impact of the stress of the work environment on Gui and support the development of a self-care plan that emphasizes his own ability to rebound from adversity and take charge of his self -care. Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services The compassion satisfaction scale allows counselors to reflect on their resilience and reminds them of why they choose to work withpeople with substance use and trauma -related disorders, despite the fact that this work can lead to secondary traumatization. The compas\u00ad sion satisfaction subscale reminds counselors that they are compassionate, that one of thereasons they are in a helping profession is that they value service to others, and that helpingbrings meaning and fulfillment to their lives.Exhibits 2.2 -9 through 2.2- 11 present the most recent ve rsion of the ProQOL. Addressing Secondary Traumatization If a counselor is experiencing STS, the organ i\u00ad zation should address it immediately. Clinical supervisors can collaborate with counselors to devise an individualized plan that is accessible,acceptabl e, and appropriate for each counselor and that addresses the secondary stress rea c\u00ad tions the counselor is experiencing, providingspecific self -care strategies to counteract the stress. Decisions about strategies for addres s\u00ad ing secondary traumatization shou ld be based on the personal preferences of the counselor,the opportunity for an immediate interventionfollowing a critical incident, and the couns e\u00ad lor's level of awareness regarding his or her experience of STS. Counselors may need to talk about what the y are experiencing, feeling, and thinking. These experiences can be pr o\u00ad cessed in teams, in consultations with co l\u00ad leagues, and in debriefing meetings tointegrate them effectively (Myers & Wee,2002). If a critical incident evokes secondary traum a\u00ad tization among staff --such as a client suicide, a violent assault in the treatment program, or another serious event --crisis intervention should be available for workers who would like to participate. Any intervention should be voluntary and tailored to each worker' s ind i\u00ad vidual needs (e.g., peer, group, or individual sessions); if possible, these services should be offered continuously instead of just one time. 200 Exhibit 2.2 -9: PRoQOL Scale COMPASSION SATISFACTION AND COMPASSION FATIGUE (PRoQOL) VERSION 5 (2009) When you [help] people you have direct contact with their lives.

Part 2, Chapter 2 \u2014Building a Trauma -Informed Workforce 201 Exhibit 2.2 -10: Your Scores on the ProQOL: Professional Quality of Life Screening Based on your responses, place your personal scores below. If you have any concerns, you should discuss them with a physical or mental healthcare professio nal. Compassion Satisfaction _____________ Compassion satisfaction is about the pleasure you derive from being able to do your work well. For example, you may feel like it is a pleasure to help others through your work. You may feel positively about your colleagues or your ability to contribute to the work setting or even the greater good of society. Higher scores on this scale represent a greater satisfaction related to your ability to be an effective caregiver in your job. The average score is 50 (SD 10; alpha scale reliability .88). About 25% o f people score higher than 57 and about 25% of people score below 43. If you are in the higher range, you probably derive a good deal of professional satisfaction from your position. If your scores are below 40, you may either find problems with your job, or there may be some other reason \u2014for example, you might derive your satisfaction from activities other than your job. Burnout_____________ Most people have an intuitive idea of what burnout is. From the research perspective, burnout is one of the elements of Compassion Fatigue (CF). It is associated with feelings of hopelessness and difficulties in dealing with work or in doing your job effectively. These negative feelings usually have a gradual onset. They can reflect the feeling that your efforts make no difference, or they can be associated with a very high workload or a non -supportive work environment. Higher scores on this scale mean that you are at higher risk for burnout. The average score on the burnout sca le is 50 (SD 10; alpha scale reliability .75). About 25% of pe o\u00ad ple score above 57 and about 25% of people score below 43. If your score is below 43, this probably reflects positive feelings about your ability to be effective in your work. If you score above 57 you may wish to think about what at work makes you feel like you are not effective in your position. Your score may reflect your mood; perhaps you were having a \"bad day \" or are in need of some time off. If the high score persists or if it is reflective of other worries, it may be a cause for concern. Secondary Traumatic Stress_____________ The second component of Compassion Fatigue (CF) is secondary traumatic stress (STS). It is about your work related, secondary exposure to extremely or traumatically stressful events. Developing problems due to exposure to other's trauma is somewhat rare but does happen to many people who care for those who have experienced extremely or traumatically stressful events. For example, you may repeatedly hear stories about the traumatic things that happen to other people, commonly called Vicarious Traumatization. If your work puts you directly in the path of danger, for example, field work in a war or area of civil violence, this is not secondary exposure; your exposure is primary. However, if you are exposed to others' traumatic events as a result of your work, for example, as a therapist or an emergency worker, this is secondary exposure. The symptoms of STS are usually rapid in onset and associated with a particular event. They may include being afraid, having difficulty sleeping, having images of the upsetting event pop into your mind, or avoiding things that remind you of the event. The average score on this scale is 50 (SD 10; alpha scale reliability .81). About 25% of people score below 43 and about 25% of people score above 57. If your score is above 57, you may want to take some time to think about what at work may be frightening to you or if there is some other reason for the elevated score. While higher scores do not mean that you do have a problem, they are an ind i\u00ad cation that you may want to examine how you feel about your work and your work environment. You may wish to discuss this with your supervisor, a colleague, or a healthcare professional. \u00a9 B. Hudnall Stamm, 2009- 2012.

Compassion Satisfaction Scale Co py your rating on each of these questions on to this table and add them up. When you have added then up you can find your score on the table to the right. Burnout Scale On the burnout scale you will need to take an extra step. Starred items are \"reverse scored.\" If you scored the item 1, write a 5 beside it. The reason we ask you to reverse the scores is because scientifically the measure works better when these questions are asked in a positive way though they can tell us more about their negative form. For example, question 1. \"I am happy\" tells us more about the effects of helping when you are not happy so you reverse the score.

Part 2, Chapter 2 \u2014Building a Trauma -Informed Workforce 203 Advice to Clinical Supervisors: Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Psychometric Measures Using a psychometric measure such as the ProQOL has advantages and disadvantages. It is i m\u00ad portant to understand that all tests measure averages and ranges but do not account for individual circumstances. If you use the ProQOL in clinical supervision, present it as a self -assessment tool. Let counselors opt out of sharing their specific results with you and/or your team if it is administered in a group. If counselors choose to share scores on specific items or scales with you , work collaboratively and r e\u00ad spectfully with them to explore their own understanding of and meaning s attached to their scores. If this tool is not presented to supervisees in a nonjudgmental , mindful way, counselors may feel as if they have failed if their scores on the secondary traumatization scale are above average or if their scores on the compassion satisfaction scale are below average. High scores on the compassion f a\u00ad tigue and burnout scales do not mean that counselors don' t care about their clients or that they aren't competent clinicians. The scores are simply one way for you and your supervisees to get a sense of whether they might be at risk for secondary traumatization, what they can do to prevent it, how to address it, and how you can support them. The potential benefits of using a self-assessment tool like the ProQOL in clinical supervision are that it can help counselors : Reflect on their emotional reactions and behaviors and identify possible triggers for secondary traumatization. Assess their risk levels. Examine alternative coping strategies that may prevent secondary traumatization. Understand their own perceptions of themselves and their job satisfaction, affirming what they already know about their risk of secondary traumatization and their compassion satisfaction. Reflect on different factors that might contribute to unexpected low or high scores, such as the day of the week, the intensity of the workload, whether they have just come back from the weekend or a vacation, and so forth . Increase self -awareness and self -knowledge, b ecause scores on specific items or scales bring to consciousness what is often outside of awareness. Realize how resilient they are emotionally, mentally, physically , and spiritually. Become aware of and open up conversations about self -care and self -care activities and r e\u00ad sources, such as supportive coworkers, team members, and social networks outside of work. If used regularly , self -assessment tools can help counselors and clinical supervisors monitor STS lev\u00ad els, indicate significant positive and negative changes, and suggest action toward self- care in speci f\u00ad ic areas. Clinical supervisors should fill out the ProQOL and review results with their own supervisors, a peer supervisor, or a colleague before administering it to supervisees. Doing so enables supervisors to gauge their own reactions to the self- assessment and anticipate potential reactions from supervisees. Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services The objective of debriefing a critical incident that evokes STS reaction s in counselors is to help them dissipate the hyperarousal associa t\u00ad ed with traumatic stress and prevent long \u00ad term aftereffects that might eventually lead to counselor impairment. Because clinical super\u00advisors may also be experiencing secondary traumatization, it is advisable for administr a\u00ad tors to invite an outside trauma c onsultant into the organization to provide a safe spacefor all staff members (including clinical supe r\u00ad visors) to address and process the critical stress incident. For noncrisis situations, secondary traumatization should be addressed in clinical supervisi on. Clinical supervisors and counse\u00ad lors should work collaboratively to incorporate regular screening and self -assessment of STS into supervision sessions. 204 Advice to Clinical Supervisors: Is it Supervision or Psychotherapy? Although there are some aspects of clinical supervision that can be therapeutic and parallel the therapeutic and emotional support that occurs between the counselor and the client, clinical supervisio n is not therapy. As a result, it is important for clinical supervisors to maintain appropriate boundaries with supervisees when addressing their STS reactions at work. When does the process in supervision cross over into the realm of practicing therapy w ith a supervisee? One clear indicator is if the super\u00ad visor begins to explore the personal history of the counselor and reflects directly on that his\u00ad tory instead of bringing it back to how the counselor 's history influences his or her work with a particular client or with clients with trauma histories in general. Clinical supervisors should focus only on counselor issues that may be directly affecting their clinical functioning with clients. If personal issues arise in clinical supervision, counselors should be encouraged to address them in their own counseling or psychotherapy. When STS issues arise, the clinical supervisor should work with counselors to review and revise their self -care plans to determine what strategies are working and whether additional support, like individual psychotherapy or counseling, may be warranted. Exhibit 2.2 -12 outlines some guidelines for clinical supervisors in addressing secondary trauma in behavioral health professionals work\u00ad ing with clients who have substance use, men\u00ad tal, and trauma- related disorders. Counselor Self -Care In light of the intensity of therapeutic work with clients with co -occurring substance use , mental, and trauma -related disorders and the vulnerability of counselors to secondary tra u\u00ad matization, a comprehensive, individualized self-care plan is highly recommended. Balance is the key to the development of a self -care Exhibit 2.2 -12: Clinical Supervisor Guidelines for Addressing Secondary Traumatization 1. Engage cou nselors i\u00ad ence of STS. 2. Address signs of STS with counselors in clinical supervision. 3. Work collaboratively with counselors to develop a comprehensive self- care plan and evaluate its effectiveness on a regular basis. 4. Provide counselors a safe and nonjud g\u00ad mental environment within which to pr o\u00ad cess STS in individual and group supervision or team meetings. 5. Provide counselors with a safe and non\u00ad judgmental place within which to debrief critical stress incident s at work; bring in an outside consultant if needed. 6. Support and encourage counselors to e n\u00ad gage in individual counseling or psycho\u00adtherapy, when needed, to explore personal issues that may be contributing to secondary traumatization at work. plan\u2014a balance between home and work, a balance between focusing on self and others, and a balance between rest and activity (Saakvitne , Perlman , & Traumatic Stress Institute/ Center for Adult & Adolescent Psychother apy 1996). Counselor self-care is also about balancing vulnerability, which al\u00ad lows counselors to be present and available when clients address intensely painful content, with reasonabl e efforts to preserve their sense of integrity in situations that may threaten the counselors' faith or worldview ( Burke et al., 2006). A comprehensive self -care plan should include activities that nourish the physical, psychological/mental, emotional/rela tional, and spiritual aspects of counselors' lives. The literature on counselor self -care advocates for individual, team, and organizational strat\u00ad egies that support behavioral health profe s\u00ad sionals working with clients who have Part 2, Chapter 2 \u2014Building a Trauma -Informed Workforce 205 Case Illustration: Carla Carla is a 38- year- old case manager working in an integrated mental health and substance abuse agency. She provides in- home case management services to home- bound clients with chronic health and/or severe mental health and substance abuse problems. Many of her clients have PTSD and chronic, debilitating pain. Both her parents had alcohol use disorders , and as a result, Carla became the caretaker in her family. She loves her job; however, she often works 50 to 60 hours per week and has difficulty leaving he r work at work. She often dreams about her clients and wakes up early , feeling anxious. She som e\u00ad times has traumatic nightmares, even though she was never physically or sexually abused, and she has never experienced the trauma of violence or a natural disaster. She drinks five cups of coffee and three to four diet sodas every day and grabs burgers and sweets for snacks while she drives from one client to the next. She has gained 20 pounds in the past year and has few friends outside of her coworkers. She has not taken a vacation in more than 2 years. She belongs to the Catholic church down the street, but she has stopped going because she says she is too busy and exhausted by the time Sunday rolls around. The agency brings in a trainer who meets with the case management department and guides the staff through a self-assessment of their current self- care practices and the development of a compr e\u00ad hensive self- care plan. During the training, Carla acknowledges that she has let her work take over the rest of her life and needs to make some changes to bring her back into balance. She writes out her self- care plan, which includes cutting back on the caffeine, calling a friend she knows from church to go to a movie, going to Mass on Sunday, dusting off her treadmill, and planning a short vacation to the beach. She also decides that she will discuss her plan with her supervisor and begin to ask around for a counselor for herself to talk about her anxiety and her nightmares. In the next superv i\u00ad sion session, Carla 's supervisor reviews her self-care plan with her and helps Carla evaluate the effec\u00ad tiveness of her self- care strategies. Her supervisor also begins to make plans for how to cover Carla 's cases when she takes her vacation. Trauma -I nformed Care in Behavioral Health Services substance use and trauma -related disorder s. Counselors are responsible for develop ing comprehensive self -care plan s and committing to their plans, but clinical supervisors and a d\u00ad ministrators are responsible for p romot ing counselor self -care, supporting implement a\u00ad tion of counselor self -care plans, and modeling self-care. Counselor self -care is an ethical im\u00ad perative; just as the entire trauma -informed organization must commit to other ethical issues with regard to the delivery of services to clients with substance use, mental, and trauma - related dis orders, it must also commit to the self-care of staff members who are at risk for secondary traumatization as an ethical co n\u00ad cern. Saakvitne and colleagues (1996) suggest that when administrators support counselor - self-care, it is not only cost -effective in that it reduces the negative effects of secondary traumatization on counselors (and their cl i\u00adents), but also promotes \"hope -sustaining b e\u00ad haviors \" in counselors, making them more motivated and open to learning, and thereby improving job performance and client care. A Comprehensive Self -Care Plan A self -care plan should include a self - assessment of current coping skills andstrategies and the development of a holistic, comprehensive self -care plan that addresses the following four domains: 1. Physical self -care 2. Psychological self -care (includes cogn i\u00ad tive/mental aspects) 3. Emotional self -care (includes relational aspects) 4. Spiritual self -care Activities t hat may help behavioral health workers find balance and cope with the stress 206 Advice to Clinical Supervisors: Spirituality The word \"spiritual\" in this context is used broadly to denote finding a sense of meaning and purpose in life and/or a connection t o something greater than the self. Spiritual mea n\u00ad ings and faith experiences are highly individual and can be found within and outside of specific religious contexts. Engaging in spiritual practices, creative endea v\u00ad ors, and group/community activities can f oster a sense of m eaning and connection that can cou n\u00ad teract the harmful effects of loss of meaning, loss of faith in life, and cognitive shifts in worldview that can be part of secondary tra u\u00ad matization. Counselors whose clients have trau\u00ad ma-related disorder s experience fewer disturbances in cognitive schemas regarding worldview and less hopelessness when they engage in spiritually oriented activities, such as meditation, mindfulness practices, being in n a\u00ad ture, journaling, volunteer work, attending church , and finding a spiritual community (Burke et al., 2006). Clinical supervisors can encourage counselors to explore their own spirituality and spiritual resources by staying open and attuned to the multidimensional nature of spiritual mea n\u00ad ing of supervisees and refraining from imposing any particular set of religious or spiritual beliefs on t hem. A strong sense of spiritual connection can enhance counselors' resilience and ability to cope with the sometimes overwhelming effects of clients' trauma material and tr auma -related behavior (including suicidality) on counselors' faith in life and sense of meaning and purpose. Modeling Self -Care \"Implementing interventions was not always easy, and one of the more difficult coping strat\u00ad egies to apply had to do with staff working long hours. Many of the staff working at the support center also had full-time jobs working for the Army. In addition, many staff chose to volunteer at the Family Assistance Center and worked 16\u00ad to 18 -hour days. When we spoke with them about the importance of their own self- care, many barriers emerged: guilt over not working, worries about others being disappointed in them, fear of failure with respect to being una\u00ad ble to provide what the families might need , and a 'strong need to be there.' Talking with people about taking a break or time off proved problematic in that many of them insisted that time off was not needed, despite signs of fa\u00ad tigue, difficulty concentrating, and decreased productivity. Additiona lly, time off was not modeled. Management, not wanting to fail the families, continued to work long hours, despite our requests to do otherwise. Generally, ind i\u00ad viduals could see and understand the reasoning behind such e ndeavors. Actually making the commit ment to do so, however, appeared to be an e ntirely different matter. In fact, our own team, although we kept reasonable hours (8 to 10 per day), did not take a day off in 27 days. Requiring time off as part of membership of a Disaster Response Team might be one way to solve this problem.\" \u2014Member of a Disaster Response Team at the Pentagon a fter September 11 Source: Walser, 2004, pp. 4-5. of working with clients with t rauma -related disorders include talking with colleagues about difficult clinical situations , attending wor k\u00ad shops , participating in social activities with family and friends , exercising , limiting client sessions, balancing caseloads to include clients with and without trauma histories , making sure to take vacations , taking breaks during the workday, listening to music , walking in nature , and seeking emotional support in both their personal and professional lives (Saakvitne et al. , 1996). In addition, regular clinical su\u00ad pervision and personal psychotherapy or coun-seling can be positive coping strategies for lessening the impact of STS on counselors. Still, each counselor is unique, and a self -care approach that is helpful to one counselor may not be helpful to another. Exhibits 2.2 -13 and 2.2-14 offer tools for self -reflection to help counselors discover which specific self -care activities might best suit them. The worksheet can be used privately by counselors or by clini\u00ad cal supervisors as an exercise in individual su\u00adpervision, group supervision, team meetings, or trainings on counselor self -care.

The Comprehensive Self- Care Worksheet is a tool to help counselors (and clinical superv i\u00ad sors) develop awareness of their current coping strategies and where in the four domains they need to increase their engagement in self -care activities. Once completed, clinical supervisors should periodically review t he plan with their supervisees for effectiveness in preventing and/or ameliorating secondary traumatization and then make adjustments as needed. Essential Components of Self -Care Saakvitne and colleagues (1996) describe three essential components, the \"ABCs, \" of self -care that effectively address the negative impact of secondar y traumatization on counselors: 1. Awareness of one's needs, limits, feelings, and internal/external resources. Awareness involves mindful/nonjudgmental attention to one 's physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual needs. Such attention r e\u00ad quires quiet time and space that supports self-reflection. 2. Balance of activities at work, between work and play, between activity and rest, and between focusing on self and focusing on others. Balance provides stability and helps counselors be more grounded when stress levels are high. 3. Connection to oneself, to others, and to something greater than the self. Connec\u00adtion decreases isolation , increases hope, diffuses stress, and helps counselors sh are the burden of responsibility for client care. It provides an anchor that enhances cou n\u00ad selors' ability to witness tremendous suf\u00ad fering without getting caught up in it.

Clinical supervisors can help counselors re\u00ad view their self -care plans through the ABCs by reflecting on these questions: 1. Has the counselor accurately identified his or her needs, limits, feelings, and internal and external resources in the four domains (physical, psychological/mental, emotio n\u00ad al/relational, spiritual) ? 2. Has the counselor described self -care a c\u00ad tivities that provide a balance between work and leisure, activity and rest , and a focus on self and others? 3. Has the counselor identified self -care a c\u00ad tivities that enhance connection to self, others , and something greater than self (or a larger perspective on life)? Supervisors should make their own self -care plans and review them periodically with their clinical supervisors, a peer supervisor, or a colleague. Part 2, Chapter 2 \u2014Building a Trauma -Informed Workforce 209 Exhibit 2.2-15: The Ethics of Self -Care The Green Cross Academy of Traumatology was originally established to serve a need in Oklahoma City following the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Below are adapted examples of the Academy's code of ethics with regard to worker self-care. Ethical Principles of Self -Care in Practice These principles declare that it is unethical not to attend to your self- care as a practitioner, because sufficient self- care prevents harming those we serve. Stand ards of self -care guidelines : Respect for the dignity and worth of self: A violation lowers your integrity and trust . Responsibility of self -care: Ultimately it is your responsibility to take care of yourself \u2014and no situation or person can justify neglecting this duty . Self-care and duty to perform: There must be a recognition that the duty to perform as a helper cannot be fulfilled if there is not, at the same time, a duty to self-care. Standards of humane practice of self- care: Universal right to wellnes s: Every helper, regardless of her or his role or employer, has a right to wellness associated with self- care. Physical rest and nourishment: Every helper deserves restful sleep and physical separation from work that sustains them in their work role. Emoti onal r est and nourishment: Every helper deserves emotional and spiritual renewal both in and outside the work context. Sustenance modulation: Every helper must utilize self -restraint with regard to what and how much they consume (e.g., food, drink, drugs, stimulation) since improper consumption can co m\u00ad promise their competence as a helper. Commitment to self -care: Make a formal, tangible commitment: Written, public, specific, measurable promises of self-care. Set deadlines and goals: The self -care plan should set deadlines and goals connected to specific activities of self -care. Generate strategies that work and follow them: Such a plan must be attainable and followed with great commitment and monitored by advocates of your self -care.

Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services Commitment to Self -Care One of the major obstacles to self -care is giv\u00ad ing in to the endless demands of others, both at work and at home. It is therefore essential for counselors with the support of clinical su\u00adpervisors to become \"guardians of [their] boundaries and limits \" (Saakvitne et al. , 1996, p 136). Creating a daily schedule that includes breaks for rest, exercise, connection withcoworkers, and other self -care activities can support counselors in recognizing that they arevaluable individuals who are worthy of takingthe tim e to nourish and nurture themselves, thus increasing commitment to self -care. A n\u00adother way to support counselors in commi t\u00ad ting to self -care is for supervisors and admi n\u00ad istrators to model self -care in their own professional and personal lives. Understanding that counselor self -care is not simply a luxury or a selfish activity, but rather, an ethical imperative (Exhibit 2.2 -15) can foster counse lors' sense of connection to their own values and accountability to the people they serve as competent and compassionate caregivers. Clinical supervisors and admini s\u00ad trators can reinforce this sense of accountabi l\u00ad ity while supporting counselors by providing a caring, trauma -informed work environment 210 Part 2, Chapter 2 \u2014Building a Trauma -Informed Workforce that acknowledges and normalizes secondary traumatization and by offering reasonable r e\u00ad sources that make it possible for counselors todo their work and take care of themselves at the same time. Preventing second ary traumat i\u00ad zation and lessening its impact on counselors once it occurs is not only cost -effective with regard to decreasing staff turnover and poten\u00ad tial discontinuity of services to clients; it is also the ethical responsibility of a trauma - informed orga nization. 211 .

As warfare techniques and strategies changed, so did the depiction of soldiers ' traumatic stress reactions. The advent of heavy explosives in World War I led to the attrib u\u00ad tion of symptoms to \"shell shock, \" giving a more physiological description of the effects from explosions (Benedek & Ursano, 2009).On the civilian side, the industrial revolutiongave rise to larger and more dramatic catastro\u00adphes, including industrial and railway acc i\u00ad dents. These, as well as other disasters, are noted in occupational health histories, new s\u00ad papers, and contemporary literature. Even with a more physical explanation of traumatic stress ( i.e., shell shock), a prevailing attitude remained that the traumatic stress response was due to a character flaw. For i n\u00ad stance, a soldier 's pain at that time was often seen as a symptom of homesickness. In spite of the efforts of Charcot, Janet, and Freud,who described the psychogenic origi n of symptoms as a response to psychological trauma (Lasiuk & Hegadoren, 2006), WorldWar II military recruits were screened in a t\u00ad tempt to identify those \"who were afflicted with moral weakness, \" which would prevent them from entering military service. At the same time, there were new treatment innovations for war -related trauma during World War II. One approach treated soldiers in the field for what was then called \"battle fatigue \" by allowing some time for rest before returning to battle. During the Ko rean and Vietnam wars, approaches began to focus more on the use of talk therapy. It was not until the post -Vietnam era that interest in d e\u00ad veloping treatment alternatives started to take hold. During this time, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (then called the Veterans Administration) developed group therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Beyond being cost -effective, the technique was well suited to the symptoms of the veterans andfostered socialization and reintegration(Greene et al., 2 004). The publication of the American PsychiatricAssociation 's (APA' s) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition (DSM -III), in 1980 marked the introduction of PTSD as a diagnosis, inspired by symptoms presented by veterans of the Vietnam W ar (Benedek & Ursano, 2009). The diagnosis inthis iteration required the identification of a specific stressor \u2014a catastrophic stressor that was outside the range of usual human exper i\u00ad ence (APA, 1980)\u2014and classified PTSD as 267 Historical Approaches to Trauma Healing and Recovery First Generation of Approaches to Trauma Healing and Recovery The first generation approaches to trauma healing and recovery focused on individual and clinical interventions to ad dress the symptoms of PTSD and moved toward integration of trauma effects into ongoing life activities. The rapidly developing recognition of additional groups with violence and trauma histories \u2014beyond those with war and captivity experiences (e.g., surviv ors of natural disasters and terrorism, refugees and immigrants fleeing homeland violence and persecution) \u2014 presented issues and needs that incited a second generation of approaches to trauma healing and recovery. Second Generation of Approaches to Trauma Healing and Recovery The second generation approaches focused on psychosocial education and empowerment models designed to tap into self -healing forces to energize personal and social movement. These approaches often are based on group and peer support models, and provide both support and education on the management of trauma and its affects. These approaches are not designed to replace clinical or alternative therapies ; rather, they provide a social context for care. Concurrent to the development of psychosocial educational empowerment approaches, we also learned that if the approaches are not implemented in organizations or programs that are trauma - informed, they will not take root and may lose effectiveness. Trauma -Informed Care: A New Paradigm for Public Health Services Trauma -informed care is a new paradigm for organizing public mental health and human services. Trauma -informed care changes the opening question for those seeking services from \"What is wrong with you?\" (patient or consumer) to \"What has h appened to you?\" (survivor). Trauma- informed care is initiated by assumption that every person seeking services is a trauma survivor who designs his or her own path to healing, facilitated by support and mentoring from the service provider. In a trauma -informed environment, survivors are empowered to proactively set goals and to manage progress toward those goals. For most existing organizations or programs, that requires movement from a traditional \"top down \" hierarchical clinical model to a psychosocial empowerment partner\u00ad ship that embraces all possible tools and paths to healing. In a pluralistic public health system with many levels and types of services and treatment, this is coming to be accepted as a \"sine qua non,\" or \"without which not,\" for humane, dignified, cost- effective, genuinely person- centered support and assistance in moving forward. Source: Salasin, 2011, p. 18 . Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services an anxiety disorder (Lasiuk & Hegadoren, 2006). Beginning with this definition, thebody of research grew, and the scope of appli\u00adcation began to broaden, but not without co n\u00ad siderable debate on what constituted a trauma. The social revolution that began in the 1960s, combined with the women 's movement and the call for more attention to diverse and di s\u00ad enfranchised groups, set the stage for an i n\u00ad crease in the acknowledgement and treatmentof victims of interpersonal violence and crime-related trauma (Figley, 2002). The introduc\u00adtion of rape trauma syndrome as a conditionhighlighted the psychological consequences ofsexual assault and the subsequent lack of sup\u00adport from society and the social services sy s\u00ad tem (Kramer & Green, 1997). Subsequently,research began to focus more on interpersonal violence, thus leading to the identification ofrisk factors and treatment approaches unique to this form of violence and tr auma (Olff, Langeland, Drajer, & Gersons, 2007). 268 Appendix C \u2014Historical Account of Trauma With input from international and national mental health organizations and research, the DSM -IV further modified the definition of trauma to include a broader interpretation ofthe identified stressor (Andr easen, 2010). DSM -5 has modified defin i\u00ad tion of trauma, b ut the criterion requires being explicit as to whether qualifying traumaticevents were experienced directly, witnessed, orexperienced indirectly (APA , 2013b). Paralleling the change in DSM criteria,cognitive -behavioral therapy for traumatic stress was developed along with other skills-based approaches (Greene et al., 2004). Researchers, such as Foa, Resick , D'Zurilla, and Michenbaum, added to the body ofknowl edge and gave clinicians a variety of tools; these approaches continue to developand show efficacy even today. There was alsorenewed interest in the long -and short -term effects of childhood sexual abuse and domestic violence. Interest in documenting the effects of trauma expanded further, including tra u\u00ad matic brain injury, significant orthopedic inj u\u00ad ries, and multiple traum as (Starr et al., 2004). So too, the consumer movement in health care began. Consumers insisted on patient rights,humane treatment, and involvement in the treatment process; as a result, the paternalisticapproach to health care began to change. As consumers set the initial stage and Federal agencies (e.g., the Substance Abuse and Men\u00adtal Health Services Administration and its centers) and national organizations promotedthe need for trauma -informed policies and care, national studies began to demonstrate the prevalence of traumatic experiences. R e\u00ad search including the Adverse ChildhoodExperience s and the Women, Co -Occurring, and Violence studies clearly demonstrated the pervasive long -term impact of trauma, rei n\u00ad forcing the call for trauma -informed policies and care. (For more information on the deve l\u00ad opment of trauma -informed care, see Harris and as well as Jennings, 2004. ) 269 Appendix D\u2014 Screening and Assessment Instruments This appendix provides a selected sample of available tools for screening and assessment of tra u\u00ad matic events and trauma -related symptoms. This is not an exhaustive list , nor does this list focus on screening instruments that capture a broader range of symptoms related to trauma (such as sleep hygiene and dissociation) or other features important in providing trauma -informed care (e.g., resilience level, coping skill style, resource availability). For more information on a broad range of available instruments, refer back to Part 1, Chapter 4. Many of the instruments listed below use criteria found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text R evision (DSM -IV-TR; APA, 2000), but w ith the release of the DSM -5 (APA, 2013a), instruments will evolve, and new versions will be available under the same contact info r\u00ad mation.

TIPs are developed under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Knowledge Application Program (KAP) to improve the treatment capabilities of the Nation's alcohol and drug abuse treatment service system. A Quick Guide clearly and concisely presents the primary information from a TIP in a pocket -sized booklet. Each Quick Guide is divided into sections to help readers quickly locate relevant material. Somecontain glossaries of terms or lists o f resources. Page numbers from the original TIP are referenced so providers can refer back to the source document for more information. Also based on TIPs, KAP Keys are handy, durable tools. Keys may include assessment or screening i n\u00ad struments, checklists, and summaries of treatment phases. Printed on coated paper, each KAP Keys set is fastened together with a key ring and can be kept within a treatment provider's reach and consulted fr e- quently.The Keys allow you, the busy clinician or p rogram administrator, to locate information easily and to use this information to enhance treatment services.
