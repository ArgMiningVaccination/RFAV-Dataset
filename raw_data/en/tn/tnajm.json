I had a caring group of nurses and doctors and a volunteer who met me on admission and helped me through the whole process. They helped me feel better, and I am thankful for them. Now, people say thanks to me! I get great satisfaction from that. John Schiller, Camillus, Heart Volunteer for ten years.
