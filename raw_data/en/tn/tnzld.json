Through emphasis on the interconnectedness of Spirit and its relationship to man as explored by thinkers of German Romanticism, Anthroposophy encourages us to find universal enlightenment through spiritual interaction with the arts. The unifying power of art through its mediums is addressed by Steiner and contemporaries such as W. Kandinsky, A. Schoenberg, and P. Mondrian. The development of the philosophy of Anthroposophy, and sub-sequentially Waldorf education, argues for the interaction between art forms that culminates in a universally expressed embodied spirit. Concepts like 'the music in art' and the 'voice of color' specifically influence Waldorf arts education theory, particularly in the Waldorf specific 'dance art' form of Eurhythmy. This capstone seeks to highlight the philosophical framework behind Eurhythmy, and trace the arc of influences that Steiner embodied while crafting his theory of this art form.
