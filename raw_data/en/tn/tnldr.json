There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility in either women or men.Several social media posts have claimed that COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility among males and females and are designed to depopulate the world. However, there is no proof to say that COVID-19 vaccines affect reproductive health. WHO's Dr. Soumya Swaminathan has mentioned that these are common myths. She has explained that the vaccines were developing to stimulate the body's immune response against a particular virus or bacteria. Soumya added that the \"COVID vaccine stimulates both antibody response and a cell-mediated immune response against the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,\" and that would not interfere with the human reproductive system in any way. According to the CDC, \"If you are trying to become pregnant, you do not need to avoid pregnancy after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.\" In addition, the CDC clarifies that the scientists are continuing their study and research on the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines. Previously, Logically has debunked the facts of fake news regarding the Pfizer vaccine and reproductive health. The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a lot of potentially dangerous misinformation. For reliable advice on COVID-19, including symptoms, prevention, and available treatment, please refer to the World Health Organization or your national healthcare authority. "}
