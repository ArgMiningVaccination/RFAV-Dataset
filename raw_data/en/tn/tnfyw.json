University with three campuses: The Frost campus and Medical Center campus in St. Louis Missouri, and the Madrid campus in Spain. The University was founded in 1818 and is the oldest university west of the Mississippi River. Saint Louis University began when Louis William DuBourg, bishop of Louisiana, opened St. Louis Academy in a one-story house. DuBourg offered land to the Society of Jesus for a Native American School which became chartered as Saint Louis University in 1832. The U.S. campus moved to its present site on Grand Boulevard in 1888. The University's mission is the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity . The University seeks excellence in the fulfillment of its corporate purposes of teaching, research, health care and service to the community. It is dedicated to leadership in the continuing quest for understanding of God's creation and for the discovery, dissemination and integration of the values, knowledge and skills required to transform society in the spirit of the Gospels. As a Catholic, Jesuit university, this pursuit is motivated by the inspiration and values of the Judeo-Christian tradition and is guided by the spiritual and intellectual ideals of the Society of Jesus. Trudy Busch Valentine School of Nursing The Trudy Busch Valentine School of Nursing has achieved a national recognition and has been a leader in nursing education since it was founded in 1928. The School has achieved nationally recognized for its innovative and pioneering comprehensive curricula, including bachelor's, master's, post-master's NP certificates, and doctoral (DNP and Ph.D.) programs. 8 Founded in 1928, the Trudy Busch Valentine School of Nursing offered certificate and Bachelor of Science in nursing degree programs. The accelerated baccalaureate program was the first of its kind in the nation, established in 1971. Graduate programs in nursing leading to the master's degree, were offered beginning in 1935. Students for the accelerated generalist master's degree in nursing were admitted fall 2010. The Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program is a terminal professional degree for nurses in advanced practice; the first cohort of students was admitted in fall 2008. The Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing (Ph.D.) degree was approved in 1989 and admitted students in 1990. It was the first Ph.D. nursing program in Missouri. Accreditation Saint Louis University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA) and has been continuously accredited since 1916. Inquiries on accreditation may be made to the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. In the United States, Ph.D. nursing programs are not accredited by an external agency. However, the School of Nursing doctoral faculty evaluates the Ph.D. nursing program using the AACN's document, The Research-Focused Doctoral Program in Nursing: Pathways to Excellence for program evaluation. Copies of the document may be obtained from the AACN website. 9 Mission Statement The mission of the School of Nursing is education of \"the whole person\"\u2014mind, body, heart and spirit, within a dynamic, diverse and technological society. The School of Nursing, an integral unit of Saint Louis University, seeks to fulfill its mission of education and leadership in the development of nursing as a discipline and profession through teaching, research, practice, and service in ways consistent with the Catholic, Jesuit values of the University. The School of Nursing acts responsibly by setting priorities and exercising stewardship to assure the best use of its resources. The School, through the teaching component of the mission prepares students at baccalaureate, master's, post-master's, and doctoral levels for professional nursing practice and interprofessional collaboration to care for the whole person, the \"cura personalis\". The School creates a student- centered environment both on campus and with distance education that recognizes and actively addresses the diverse learning needs of students and an academic climate that promotes intellectual inquiry among faculty and students. The School, through the research component of the mission, advances the active engagement of faculty and the involvement of students in the innovative scholarly process of discovery, dissemination, and translation of knowledge. The School promotes interprofessional collaboration in the conduct of research to maintain or improve health. The School, through the service/practice component of the mission, promotes quality health care of individuals, families and communities to alleviate ignorance, poverty, injustice and hunger; extend compassionate care to the ill and needy; and to maintain and improve the quality of life for all persons. Saint Louis University School of Nursing faculty, staff, students, and graduates provide this holistic care by working with people in diverse environments to maintain or improve health. Approval body: GFA Reviewed and revised: January 22, 2018 Philosophy The Trudy Busch Valentine School of Nursing, as an integral component of Saint Louis University, upholds the Judaeo- Christian philosophy and mission of the University to pursue truth for the greater Glory of God and for the service of humanity. The faculty of the School of Nursing believes that all persons are created by God and possess intrinsic worth and dignity. We believe the very origin of nursing lies in the fundamental capacity to care for those in need. Recognition of cura personalis requires that acceptance, compassion and respect characterize relationships among faculty, staff, administrators, and students in the School, and relationships with individuals, families, and communities and other health care professionals in nursing practice settings. The 10 School of Nursing provides a collegial environment of academic freedom in which students develop knowledge, insight, values, accountability, and professional competence. Study of the liberal arts provides an essential foundation for the development of an educated person. Such an education assists students to develop greater knowledge of self, of God, of other people, and of the world in which they live. Attributes, such as intellectual insights, collaboration, communication, logical and analytical skills, and the exercise of independent judgment, are acquired through study of the humanities and the biological, physical, behavioral, and social sciences. This foundation also facilitates the study and practice of professional nursing. Nursing as a profession and as a discipline is concerned with the promotion and maintenance of health, prevention of illness, care and rehabilitation of sick and disabled persons, and compassionate care of the dying. As a discipline developing its own science, nursing continues to expand its body of knowledge and to identify its articulations with the theories and practices of other relevant disciplines. Nursing education is a collaborative endeavor of faculty and students in which each contributes and shares talents to enhance learning. Faculty members, having achieved expertise, facilitate each student's search for knowledge and self-actualization. Given students' individual abilities, interests, and career goals and changing societal needs, the faculty provides a range of educational programs and uses a variety of teaching methods. All educational experiences are designed to help students develop as critically reflective and socially responsible persons who are capable of making informed, prudent ethical decisions. The faculty encourages student self- assessment and evaluation, thereby preparing graduates for continuing personal and professional development. The faculty believes that continuing education is an integral component of nursing education and offers continuing education programs as a community service. Initial preparation for professional nursing practice at Saint Louis University is organized around explicit concepts that structure the nursing content in the curriculum; such structure facilitates learning. Upon completion of the baccalaureate generalist program, the graduate possesses the theoretical base in nursing and related disciplines and the skills - both interpersonal and technological - required for practice. The graduate demonstrates the ability to integrate knowledge with skills and to collaborate with individuals, families, communities and other health care professionals in nursing practice settings. The graduate is prepared to begin a career in the practice of nursing in a variety of health care settings with individuals of diverse cultural backgrounds and ages. Education at the baccalaureate level prepares graduates for advanced study in nursing. Master's education provides for the attainment of advanced knowledge and the ability to apply nursing theories in practice and for the development of clinical leadership skills. Upon completion of the master's generalist program, the graduate is prepared with the ability to provide leadership for nursing care at the microsystem level. Nurse practitioner education at the master's level provides for the mastery of a methodology for advanced practice to address patient needs within a population focus. Graduates of the master's program contribute to the development of nursing through their practice, leadership, scholarly activities, and involvement in professional associations. Education at the master's level prepares graduates for doctoral- level study in nursing. Doctoral education provides leadership for the continuing development of nursing as a discipline and a profession. The Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) prepares nurses for advanced practice 11 with the specialized knowledge and skills needed to diagnose and manage health and illness and improve the quality of health care in all practice settings using evidence and outcome-based methodologies. DNP graduates demonstrate clinical expertise and promote high quality patient- centered care with an emphasis on interprofessional collaboration within the health care delivery system. The Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing (Ph.D.) fosters commitment to knowledge generation and expanding the science of the discipline. As stewards of the profession, graduates apply methods of knowledge discovery to advance nursing scholarship and practice. The study of nursing as a scientific discipline is complemented by advanced study in related disciplines to address complex healthcare issues.

There are two methods of participation. Students may attend PhD classes on-campus or from a distance. Whether on-campus or at a distance, students participate with faculty in a live, real-time classroom using advanced audiovisual technologies. Most doctoral nursing courses are offered on Fridays and require real-time (synchronous) participation by all students. Distance students must have a computer, webcam, reliable Internet , and private space for class participation. Students typically begin course work in the fall semester. Spring semester admission is possible with some constraints in course scheduling and availability due, in part, to course prerequisites. International students often begin in the summer taking English courses, based on their level of English proficiency. PhD Program Admission Requirements Applicants for admission are considered individually based on the following admissions requirements. Ph.D. admissions faculty of the School of Nursing review and evaluate all applications and may request interviews with applicants who meet the following criteria: Graduate Education application for admission to classified status. 15 Official transcripts from all colleges and universities attended. Cumulative grade point average of 3.25 on a 4.0 system. Recommendations from three individuals (preferably supervisors, academics with master's or Ph.D. prepared nurses) who can describe the applicant's academic and professional accomplishments and potential for success in a Ph.D. nursing program. Current, unencumbered registered professional nurse licensure in the state/country of residence/employment or eligibility for licensure in the State of Missouri. Curriculum vitae. Written statement describing the applicant's goals for PhD education, clinical and leadership experience, career goals, research interests, and plans for study on-campus or distance learning. Evidence of high potential for scholarship, leadership in nursing, and conducting nursing research. Additional criteria to be admitted into the Post MSN to Ph.D. Option: o Master's degree in nursing from a nationally accredited program Additional criteria to be admitted into the Post BSN to Ph.D. Option: o A bachelor's degree in nursing from a nationally accredited program. o Two years of RN clinical experience required. Applications will ordinarily include an interview to discuss personal goals for school and assess writing skills. Note: Ordinarily, applicants to the Ph.D. nursing program are not admitted on Probationary status. In the unlikely event a student is admitted on probation, the Graduate Education Catalog policy applies. English Proficiency for International Students Scores on IELTS must be 6.5. TOEFL scores should be 213 (computer-based), 80 (Internet- based), or 550 (paper-based). Duolingo testing with video interview and on the spot writing test may be also required. English listening and writing skills are critical for student success. Ordinarily, international students with a 6.0 score enroll in INTO SLU EAP (English for Academic Purposes) classes in the summer session prior to beginning their program of studies and take English classes their entire first year. This may not be needed if students completed their master's degree in an English-speaking country. Students below 6.0 will require English proficiency before beginning nursing PhD courses. Lack of English proficiency will inhibit a student's progression in the program. NOTE: EAP (English for Academic Purposes) courses that are 4000-level are not taken for graduate credit. EAP courses do not count toward the PhD degree. Program Statistics Pre- or Co-requisite Completion of a graduate course in advanced statistics, NURS 6805 Introduction to Applied Statistics in Research (or equivalent), within the last five years is a required prerequisite to NURS 6806. Most students take this in the summer at the end of their first year of PhD courses. BSN-PhD students can take this prior to PhD courses or at the end of their first year of PhD courses. Students who receive a course grade of \"C\" or lower in the program prerequisite course will be asked to repeat the course. Students complete 39 credits of Ph.D. course work exclusive of this pre- or co-16 requisite. Several courses at Saint Louis University satisfy the NURS 6805 prerequisite, and may be offered at variable times: ORES 5010 Introduction to Biostatistics for Health Outcomes Research (Fall online) PSY 5790 Applied Univariate Statistics (Fall onsite, typically limited to psychology students) BST 5000 Principles of Biostatistics (Fall onsite & online, Spring onsite) SOC 5050 Quantitative I: Applied Inferential Statistics (Fall onsite) Course offerings may change, so please check the course catalog before planning.

Credit for 18 credits from the Master's degree are accepted. Students must complete 80% of total credits at Saint Louis University, exclusive of advanced standing credits or inter-university credits. Up to 20% of credits of PhD course work may be transferred in. This would be the equivalent of 9 credit hours for PhD students. Students should check with the Program Director to determine equivalence of any substitute for a required course. See general information: https://catalog.slu.edu/academic-policies/office-admission/graduate/transfer-credit/ Course Level Typically, students take electives at the 5000 or 6000 level on a topic in their area of interest. No more than 6 credits of 4000-level coursework may satisfy the requirements of a Doctoral degree, per Graduate Education. Independent Studies and Directed Studies Doctoral degree students may apply no more than six credits in Research Topics (6970) or Graduate Reading (6980), or a combination thereof to their course requirements, per Graduate Education. Students wishing to take an independent study (IS) should discuss this with their advisor, who must approve the topic and determine the best faculty member to direct the topic. Faculty may not always be available to teach an IS due to workload issues. An application form may need to be completed and submitted to the registrar. 19 Students work with the faculty member to plan the readings, activities, assignments, and times to meet for the IS and document this on the IS syllabus (see PhD Connections for the form). The course title should be changed after the semester so that the transcript will indicate the topic of the IS. A directed study may be conducted for a regular course in a semester when it is not usually offered, and the faculty member can offer it as an independent study. The usual syllabus is used and the regular course name. Technology Requirements Computer: Students are required to have a laptop computer with microphone and web cam to participate in class.

Internet Connectivity See the Bandwidth for Online Learning Recommendations posted on the SLU Academic Tech Commons site. Smartphones and Tablets Mobile Apps for tablets and smartphones are available for some of the products used for course content delivery such as Canvas, Panopto and Zoom. Not all features are necessarily 20 available in these apps or on mobile devices. All students should have access to a computer to complete their program of study. *Please have all necessary hardware, software including browser and plug-ins well in advance of the course. Also, test your computer capabilities and Internet access prior to enrolling in the course. Academic Standards Academic Standards for the Nursing PhD Program There are several policies that impact student enrollment and progression. See the Graduate Education web site and Catalog and Policies for University wide policies and for forms noted below. https://www.slu.edu/academics/graduate/index.php Please note that academic decisions can be appealed (see below in the Handbook for the Academic Appeals Policy). Continuous Enrollment Students are required to maintain continuous enrollment (spring and fall) during their PhD program until graduation). Summer courses are optional. Full-time Status Full time status for a graduate student is defined by the University as 6 or more credit hours per semester in formal courses - spring and fall, or 3 or more credits in the summer. The following also apply: o Full-time: All graduate students holding full appointments as Fellows, Trainees, or Graduate Assistants. o Full-time: All graduate students registered for NURS 6959 Special Study for Examinations. o Full-time: All graduate students while completing their dissertation if they are registered for NURS 6999 Dissertation Research, even if for zero credits . Attendance Course policies in each syllabus will identify specific faculty requirements, but the University has an Attendance Policy see the web site: https://www.slu.edu/madrid/academics/academic-resources/policies-procedures.php 21 Leave of Absence If a student is unable to enroll during a regular semester (spring/fall), a leave of absence should be designated. This could be for personal or family situations. Students can apply for a leave of absence from the graduate nursing program for a semester and up to a period of no more than one year. The request should be made to the Program Director and Associate Dean by completing the Petition for Leave of Absence with corresponding documentation and support from the faculty advisor. A leave of absence stops the time-to-complete clock. Note there is also a Parental Leave policy. See form: https://www.slu.edu/registrar/pdfs/leave_of_absence.pdf Incomplete Courses Students may request a temporary grade of INCOMPLETE (I) for coursework that they will not be able to complete by the last class due to extraordinary circumstances. Students must request the mark of Incomplete. A grade of Incomplete may not be requested to avoid an unsatisfactory grade. University policy stipulates that the student and the instructor agree in writing to the conditions for clearing the incomplete by submitting the \"Petition for Course Extension\" form by the date grades are due. The student initiates the form and it must be completed and signed by the instructor and student. The form needs to be submitted to the registrar before grades are due to avoid a missing grade in a class. A mark of Incomplete must be cleared within a maximum of one year after the course was taken, or by the date stated on the form. University registrar will change incomplete grades to a grade of \"F\" if the course is not completed by the approved deadline. If a student has 2 incompletes they will be placed on probationary status. Ordinarily, PhD students with two incomplete courses or missing grades will not be allowed to register for additional course work until at least one incomplete grade has been removed or a missing grade assigned. Students with two incomplete courses will not be allowed to hold assistantships. See the following for the form to request an incomplete: https://www.slu.edu/registrar/pdfs/course_extension.pdf Dropping a Course The University has deadlines for dropping a course - check the web site from the Registrar to see due dates and regulations for each semester. https://www.slu.edu/registrar/ Time to Complete Degree and Petitions for Extension PhD Students should complete their work within a 7-year time limit. The time clock begins when the student takes their first class as a Classified student. Those who are not finished must apply for an extension. A maximum of two extensions beyond the ordinary time to degree will be allowed. Any request for an extension of time to complete the degree must be made on the relevant Graduate Education form, Petition for an Extension of the Time Period to Complete Degree Requirements. Students will need to register for 1 extra dissertation credit each semester during an extension. 22 Academic Advising On admission to the program, each PhD nursing student is assigned to the Program Director as an academic advisor. The advisor will help get the student registered for their first semester, and during that first semester, help set up a plan of study. After the first to second year, as a student's scholarly focus develops, another faculty member may be an appropriate match and can become the academic advisor and then dissertation chair. The student may request a change to a different faculty member as advisor/chair by discussing this with the program director. BSN to PhD student will work with the Program Director as their advisor. They may conduct their research topics course with a faculty member with interests related to the student's interests. Annual Reviews PhD students will participate in an annual evaluation of their academic progress. The purpose of this review is to assess each student's academic progression, and scholarly achievements; this allows for direction and recommendations. Students are expected to complete the annual review process with their academic advisor/chair each year in the spring. Additional reviews may be recommended. If a student does not participate in the required annual review process, future scholarship eligibility and assistantships will be at risk. The annual meeting will include the student and academic advisor/dissertation chair. The student review includes feedback on progress in the program, for example: maintaining appropriate grades, cumulative GPA; timely completion of coursework (including incomplete or no grades), academic issues, written exams and dissertation; achievement of skill acquisition and scholarly development. Students will submit the PhD student annual review form describing their progress and activities. The form is ideally submitted to the faculty no later than one week before the formal review meeting is held in the spring. Students who are making successful progress toward their degree will be given a satisfactory rating along with recommendations that will help them to continue advancing through the program. Students who are not meeting all expectations will be given a rating of satisfactory with reservations and recommendations to improve their performance . If a student is not making satisfactory progress, a rating of unsatisfactory will be given and comments put on the form by the faculty member. An additional review will be scheduled in the following semester or as determined by the advisor. The student, the advisor/dissertation chair, and the Director of the Ph.D. program sign the annual review. (An e-mail acknowledgement from students from a distance may be acceptable.) The student's signature indicates only that the student has seen the review and not necessarily that he or she agrees with it. A copy of the student's self-report and the feedback will be given to the student. 23 The first two pages will be sent to the Dean (or designee) and others as required by the University. See the Appendix for the Annual Self-Report and Evaluation Form. Academic Standing, Academic Probation, and Dismissal Suspension or Dismissal Students who are judged guilty of an act of serious academic dishonesty or other infraction may be suspended for a specified time-period or dismissed altogether. Suspension or dismissal may also be warranted for other reasons not listed above, such as unauthorized solicitation or distribution of controlled substances, endangering oneself or another person, or abusing alcohol or illicit drugs. Good Standing Classified students are in good academic standing when they are making progress toward a degree within the time-period established for that degree by the University (7 years for PhD students). Students will not be advanced to candidacy or be eligible to graduate or continue an assistantship while not in good academic standing. Students are not in good standing if any of the following conditions are true: They are on academic probation (based on grades or misconduct) Their transcripts reflect more than 2 incomplete grades. Their time to degree has expired. They have been placed under temporary suspension for academic deficiencies or misconduct (see Academic Integrity/Ethical Behavior section - see below in Handbook). They have been formally dismissed from the University. Graduate students are expected to complete academic work at the \"B\" level. The Classified student's cumulative grade point average in academic work must be at least 3.00 to advance to candidacy, and to fulfill degree requirements and graduate. If the cumulative grade point average of Classified students falls below 3.00 (on the four-point scale, \"B\" = 3.00), students are automatically placed on academic probation (not to be confused with Probationary admission). To continue degree pursuit, students must progress toward a 3.00 cumulative average and are expected to emerge from academic probation within nine credits or one academic year during which coursework registrations are recorded. Students may not be advanced to candidacy status while on academic probation. PhD students may not hold assistantships while on probation. 24 Grading Scale for Ph.D. Nursing Courses The following are the final grades designated by the Graduate Education office for 500 and 600- level offerings carrying two or more credits, exclusive of Thesis or Dissertation Research, the quality-point values (per credit-hour) and the descriptions: A 94 - 100 4.0 High intellectual initiative and achievement A- 92 - 93 3.7 Approaching high achievement B+ 90 - 91 3.3 Above average B 85 - 89 3.0 Clearly acceptable performance B- 82 - 84 2.7 Somewhat below average C+ 80 - 81 2.3 Achievement of questionable predictability C 77 - 79 2.0 Below expected achievement C- 75 - 76 1.7 D 70 - 74 1.0 F < 70 0.0 For most 500 and 600-level offerings carrying zero or one semester hour of credit, one of these two final grades may be assigned: \"S\" - Satisfactory or\"U\" Unsatisfactory. Neither of these two grades influences the student's term or cumulative GPA. (The Graduate Education office does not permit \"Pass/No Pass\" grading.) For Dissertation Credits and for Special Study for Examinations, Degree Study (all zero-credit), one of these three grades are assigned at the end of the academic term (IP\" In Progress, \"S\", or Satisfactory, or \"U\" Unsatisfactory. As the students takes dissertation hours, the grade of IP is assigned. The grade of \"S\" may be assigned only once: at the successful completion and approval of the final dissertation project. At the close of a term, if progress has been made, the \"IP\" grade is appropriate. Students must register for \"0\" credit hours each spring and fall after completing 12 credit hours until successfully completing their dissertation. If/When a \"U\" grade is assigned; no credit toward fulfillment of the required hours is earned and the student must repeat the hours. Adjacent to a Special-Study-for-Examinations entry in the student record, \"IP,\" \"S,\" and \"U\" indicate that the exam was not taken, was passed, and was failed, respectively. At the end of a term for a course at any level that a student audits, the instructor assigns one of these two grades: \"AU\" Audit (satisfactorily) or \"W\" Authorized withdrawal (or unsatisfactory audit) Neither of these entries into the permanent record influences the student's term or cumulative GPA or counts toward credit hours earned for degree. If a student completes an authorized withdrawal between the end of the Late Registration period and the middle day of the academic term, a designation of \"W\" is entered into the grade field for that entry in the permanent record. Withdrawals beyond the mid-term date are ordinarily not allowed. Graduate work is designated 5000 and 6000 level coursesumbers and under the policies of the 25 Graduate Education office. For courses taken at the 4000, 7000, or 8000 levels, final grades are assigned within the schemes of the Schools or Colleges of the University offering that academic work. Course Assignments Student should complete original work in each class and assignments cannot be submitted to more than one class, which would be considered self-plagiarism, and may result in failure of a course. Progression through the program should support student completion of the dissertation. Students should identify theory and philosophy related to their area of interest in their first year. In their second year, students learn more about research methods and synthesizing the literature. Students should keep a portfolio of completed papers as content may be developed to include in the dissertation literature review. Failure of courses If a student receives a grade below a B- in a core nursing course (NURS 6000 or higher), the course must be repeated. A second failure of a course will result in dismissal. If a student fails two graduate courses in one semester, the student will be dismissed from the PhD program. Students may receive a grade of C in a non-nursing elective course without repeating it but must maintain a GPA of at least 3.0. Grades below C will require repeating the course. Repetition of Courses A graduate student may repeat a course to improve their grade only one time. If not successful on the second attempt, or if the required grade is not achieved in two separate courses, the student will be dismissed. Appeal of an Academic Decision Students may appeal an academic decision. For a course grade, the student should talk to the faculty member first, then follow the steps outlined in the SON appeals policy. See the appendix for the entire School Appeals policy (see entire policy in the Appendix). Program dismissal or other significant appeals are heard by the School of Nursing AP&G Committee. Also see the policy on Academic Appeals in the current Academic Catalog . 26 Directives for Scientific Writing: APA Format The most recent edition (currently 7th edition) of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA; http://www.apastyle.org ) is the required format for scientific writing in nursing courses in the Ph.D. program, on the written preliminary examinations, and on the dissertation. For course papers to be submitted to a journal for publication, students should follow the journal's author guidelines as to the accepted format. Students are strongly encouraged to use EndNote to format papers written in the Ph.D. Nursing Program. It may be downloaded through the ITS website. Authorship as a Student (Papers and Presentations) Students are encouraged to write papers and present at meetings about studies or projects from courses, projects with faculty or activities from other opportunities. However, they need to be mindful of ethical principles of authorship and publishing and appropriate representation as a Saint Louis University student. This is covered in the Scientific Integrity course, but students should check with their advisor or chair BEFORE submitting any outside materials related to courses or the dissertation. Students should be mindful that content from their published articles cannot be copied into the dissertation directly without permission, but may be revised or paraphrased and referenced, like any other publication. Articles for the dissertation should be reviewed by the committee before submission (See section on dissertation later). Authorship should be negotiated when the student plans to submit a paper for publication or an abstract for a presentation, or when beginning a project with faculty members. Guidelines for who should qualify as an author should be followed. See the web site of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors for expected criteria for authorship (ICMJE: www.icmje.org ). Permission should be sought before including faculty or anyone as an author, and guidelines for authorship should be followed. All authors should review the final paper before submission. When publishing a paper from a class, the student should consider faculty feedback and revise the paper accordingly. Faculty members may be willing to review papers again for any other recommendations. Students can consider asking faculty members to serve as co-authors of appers, if their contribution to the paper warrants it. Students should discuss this option with the faculty members, If authorship is not warranted, then the student may consider acknowledging the faculty help on the paper or helpful feedback. Permission to acknowledge faculty or others should be obtained before submitting papers. Students working on faculty projects may be included as authors if they meet authorship criteria. If students play minor roles in projects, it may be more appropriate to give an acknowledgement. Funding for work should be acknowledged in publications. Scholarships from the Trudy Busch Valentine School of Nursing at Saint Louis University and any other fundings source should be acknowledged . 27 Student posters should prominently display the Saint Louis University logo and the Trudy Busch Valentine School of Nursing name. Poster templates for the SON are available in PhD Connections and University logos should be used. The student's name should appear under the poster title, then Trudy Busch Valentine School of Nursing, Saint Louis University (see above). If the student has graduated and is employed at another university, but the dissertation research was conducted as a doctoral student, Saint Louis University School of Nursing should still be acknowledged . If employed, the former student may also indicate the current employer, or use business cards to distribute indicating the new employer/position. Projects that are unrelated to the student's work or the School of Nursing may be published but the student should not represent themselves as a SLU student. Research projects listing affiliation with SLU as a student must be approved by the SLU Institutional Review Board. Author affiliations should note Ph.D. student status at Saint Louis University. Additional affiliations may be included depending on the content and context of the paper. Funding sources should be considered for acknowledgement (research grants, scholarships). 28 Academic Integrity/Ethical Behavior Saint Louis University Academic Integrity Policy Preamble Saint Louis University is a community of learning in which integrity and mutual trust are vital. Since the mission of the University is \"the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity,\" acts of falsehood violate its very reason for existence. They also demean and compromise the activities of teaching, research, health care and community service that are its primary mission. Since the University seeks to prepare students and faculty for lives of integrity and occupations of trust, it regards all acts of academic dishonesty as matters of serious concern. Such dishonesty also undermines the academic assessment process, which in turn impairs the ability of the University to certify to the outside world the skills and attainments of its graduates. Such dishonesty allows those who engage in it to take unfair advantage of their peers and undermines moral character and self-respect. The Academic Integrity Policy sets out principles that are implicit in the ethos of the University but that call for explicit formulation to guide the practice of the entire institution. In establishing necessary definitions and minimal procedures to be followed in adjudicating violations, it also allows academic units to set forth the details of their own honesty policies in ways appropriate to their disciplines. Units are responsible for acquainting their students with professional requirements beyond those minimal standards as relevant to particular disciplines. 1. Responsibilities of Members of the Community To create a learning environment in which high standards of academic integrity are prized requires the efforts of everyone in the University community. Faculty are responsible for adhering to high standards of academic integrity in their own research and professional conduct; for laying out relevant parts of the policy on their syllabi and assignments; explaining key terms to students and following procedures for reporting and adjudicating possible violations both in and out of their academic unit. Furthermore, faculty are encouraged to create assignments that minimize the possibility of academic dishonesty through clear expectations and to help to create an environment in which academic integrity is uppermost'. Students are responsible for adhering to University standards of academic integrity, helping to create an environment in which academic integrity is respected, and reporting violations of the policy to instructors, department chairs, or administrators, as appropriate. Staff are responsible for calling the attention of their supervisors to possible violations of academic integrity, for modeling high standards of academic integrity in their own professional conduct and research and for otherwise supporting a community of academic honesty and trust. Academic integrity is honest, truthful, and responsible conduct in all academic endeavors. 29 Academic administrators such as Deans, Chairs and Directors are responsible for addressing and managing cases of academic dishonesty in accordance with University policies and those of their academic units. One exception is that alleged violations of academic integrity in scientific research will be addressed in accordance with the Research Integrity Policy of the University. Administrators in academic units are also responsible for providing students or others charged with violations of academic integrity appropriate notice of the charges and the opportunity to respond in ways laid out in unit and University policies. 2. Violations of Academic Integrity Definitions to guide academic units in setting and applying their academic integrity policies are as follows (more than one violation may apply): Falsification entails misrepresentations of fact for academic gain. Instances include: 1. Lying to or deceiving an instructor about academic work. 2. Fabricating or misrepresenting documentation or the data involved in carrying out assignments. 3. Fabricating, misrepresenting, or altering in unauthorized ways information in academic records belonging to an instructor or to any academic department or administrative unit in the University. Plagiarism involves the representation of someone else's thoughts, words, and/or data as if they were one's own or \"self-plagiarism\" which is the use of material prepared for one class and submitted to another without proper citation and without the permission of the instructor. Instances include: 1. Quoting directly from someone else's written, artistic or spoken work without using quotation marks or indented quotations and without giving proper credit to the author or artist; for example, cutting and pasting text from the internet and making it appear to be your own work. 2. Paraphrasing or incorporating someone else's ideas, concepts, arguments, observations, images, objects, music, or statements without giving proper credit. 3. Submitting as one's own work a paper or other assignment/project that has been prepared, either wholly or in part, by another person, group, or commercial firm without citation or acknowledgment. Cheating involves the use of unauthorized assistance to gain an advantage over others. Instances include: 1. Copying from another student's examination or using unauthorized assistance, aids, technological resources such as cell phones, calculators, translation software or Internet based applications in taking quizzes or examinations. 2. Using resources beyond those authorized by the instructor to complete assignments such as writing papers, preparing reports, giving oral presentations, making models, multi-media projects, sound recordings, creating visual materials such as drawings, videos, or photographs or presenting material on the internet. 3. Acquiring, disseminating, or using tests or any other academic forms of assessment belonging to an instructor or a member of the staff through any means (including social media) without prior approval. 4. Influencing, or attempting to influence, any University employee in order to affect a grade or evaluation. 30 5. Hiring or otherwise engaging someone to impersonate another person in taking a quiz or examination or in fulfilling other academic requirements. Sabotage entails disrupting or seeking to prevent the academic pursuits of others. It includes: 1. Interfering with work or undermining the academic success of others in the university community in an intentional way for the purpose of negatively impacting that person's academic performance. 2. Modifying, stealing, or destroying intellectual property such as computer files, library materials, artwork, personal books or papers. 3. Performing any action that would impact research outcomes such as lab tampering, falsification of data, or destruction of research resources. Collusion involves unauthorized collaboration with another person or persons for the purpose of giving or gaining an academic advantage in such activities as completion of assignments or examinations without explicit permission of the instructor. Collusion may include any or all of the other violations of academic integrity as defined above. For example, if two students developed a plan that enabled them to improve their performance on an assignment that was supposed to be completed independently, they would be guilty of collusion. Concealment entails failing to call to the attention of a faculty member or administrator violations of academic integrity that an academic unit requires be reported. Graduate Education, Date Approved: June, 2015 For more information about Reporting and Adjudicating Violations of Academic Integrity, Submitting and Conducting an Appeal to the Office of the Provost, and Confidentiality see the full version of the Academic Integrity Policy https://www.slu.edu/academics/graduate/university-wide_academic_integrity_policy_final_6-26- 15.pdf Additional Statement on Academic Integrity for the Trudy Busch Valentine School of Nursing I. Purpose Common to the health care professions are expectations of integrity, honesty, and truthfulness which are tantamount to the standards of ethical conduct for the professional. These basic expectations are in accord with those held within the academic community. Students in the School of Nursing programs are therefore expected to be honest in their academic professional work. The School of Nursing seeks to provide an atmosphere conducive to academic and professional honesty. II. Policy A. Policy Statement Saint Louis University supports an environment of trust and integrity. Faculty and students share responsibility for upholding academic integrity. Violating academic integrity is not consistent with such an environment. Violations of academic integrity include but are not limited to cheating, 31 plagiarism, and falsifying, or fabricating facts. Professional integrity is violated by any dishonesty in meeting the responsibilities inherent in clinical practice. Breaches of academic integrity include but are not limited to: copying from another student's test paper or allowing another student to copy one's work. submitting material authored by another person but represented as the student's own work whether draft or final submission. copying a passage or text directly from a book, journal, or electronic source, or using extensive paraphrasing without indicating the source or without using a recognized style for citing sources. taking a test or writing a paper for another student. submitting an assignment or paper as new work when this same assignment had been completed for a prior course. using non-approved technology during a class. collaborating with another person to commit breaches of academic integrity. Breaches of professional integrity include but are not limited to: 1. falsifying information and data 2. violating confidential information 3. violating professional code of ethics Sanctions for Academic Misconduct Sanctions for a violation of academic or professional integrity may include but are not limited to disciplinary probation, suspension, and dismissal from the University. The Academic and Professional Integrity Policy is consistent with the University's Academic Integrity Statement. Sanctions should be selected and imposed with three goals in mind: To assist in the education of the student responsible for the academic misconduct To encourage, in keeping with the University's mission, an honest intellectual environment To maintain the integrity of the academic program and the rights of all individuals Sanctions deemed appropriate by the Admissions, Progression, and Graduation Committee and Dean of the School of Nursing may be: Warning A formal written warning Professional Probation for Academic Misconduct Probationary status imposed with or without restrictions for a definite period of time not to exceed one calendar year. A student is subject to immediate suspension or dismissal if involved in any act of misconduct, including violations of terms of probation, while on professional probation for academic misconduct. Suspension Involuntary separation of the student from the School of Nursing or University for a definite period of time after which the student is eligible to return. The length of time for the suspension will be determined by the Admissions, Progression, and Graduation Committee and stated in the report to the Dean of the School of Nursing. The disciplinary sanction of 32 suspension is not recorded on the student's permanent academic record. The student is subject to immediate dismissal if involved in any act of misconduct after the suspension has been lifted. Dismissal Involuntary separation of the student from the School of Nursing or University without provision for a return in the future. In accordance with the University-wide code of student's rights and responsibilities, the disciplinary sanction of dismissal is required to be recorded on the student's permanent academic record. Approved 5/7/07 Revised: 7/24/08, (Modified for Ph.D. nursing students 6/6/2013) Additional Statement on Academic Integrity for the Ph.D. Nursing Program The University is a community of learning where students and faculty share the responsibility for maintaining academic, professional, and research integrity (SLU Office of Academic Affairs, 2004). Consistent with its Catholic Jesuit mission, the University is committed to a community and environment that supports inclusion and diversity. This includes respect for individuals with social identities similar to and different from one's own (SLU, nd). Academic integrity is characterized by \"honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility\" (Center for Academic Integrity, 1999). Examples of academic dishonesty include cheating, falsification, interfering with the work of another, working with another to promote dishonest behaviors, and plagiarism. Plagiarism consists of \"claiming credit for the words, ideas and concepts of others\" (APA, 2009, p. 170). This may occur if text is copied from a source without adequate paraphrasing or if author recognition is not provided in a recognized format. Other examples of dishonesty are listed in the School of Nursing SLU Graduate Education Catalog (see current catalog). Professional integrity is demonstrated by behaviors that reflect honesty, respect, and responsibility within the clinical and research environments. Civil behavior is expected in the classroom and through all forms of discourse and communication including course and university email. Responsible behavior is also expected through the use of social media: use of one's personal email when expressing personal views and business rather than university email, use of wording that does not imply discrimination, and not posting confidential university information (i.e., lectures or other materials; SLU Marketing and Communications Web Services, nd). Examples of behaviors that do not reflect integrity include use of cell phones or texting during class, violation of research participant confidentiality, and behaviors that are not consistent with nursing standards (Fowler, 2008). Research integrity promotes the ethical principles of justice, respect, beneficence, autonomy, and protection of vulnerable populations. Examples of research misconduct include data fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, not addressing conflict of interests, and inappropriate authorship (USDHHS, Office of Research Integrity, 2011). Possible consequences for a violation of academic, professional, or research integrity include grade reduction, failure in a class, disciplinary actions, dismissal from the program, and other actions (see current Graduate Education Catalog ). Revision Approved: Ph.D. Nursing Program Committee, May 7, 2013 33 Trudy Busch Valentine School of Nursing Graduate Social Media Integrity Policy Generally defined, social media is the use of a website or mobile device to connect with people who share personal or professional interests. With communities numbering in the hundreds of millions of members, social media sites have become important venues where individuals or groups can share their knowledge and opinions, express creativity, connect and collaborate with others who have similar interests and are readily accessible. Examples of social media include but are not limited to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and weblogs or \"blogs.\" Many organizations, including Saint Louis University, have their own social media sites and also actively participate in social media on a corporate or organizational level. Primum non nocere (first do no harm): think, before posting. There is no such thing as a \"private\" social media site. Search engines can turn up posts and pictures years after publication. Do not post information that may harm the College, colleagues, or classmates. Avoid posting while feeling emotional about a subject - wait until you are calm and clear-headed. Admit mistakes. Be upfront and be quick with your correction. If posting to a blog, modify earlier posts when necessary and clearly indicate the change. Keep in mind that your parents, siblings, roommates, internship site supervisors and future employers will read your blog or social media posts, as well as prospective students, their parents, alumni, professors and college administrators. The tone and content of all electronic conversations should remain professional. Respect among colleagues and co-workers must occur in an inter-professional environment. Posts should contain only factual information. Be judicious. All statements must be true and not misleading, and all claims must be substantiated and approved. Do not comment on anything related to legal matters, litigation, or any parties that are in litigation. Individuals are responsible for the content of their own internet and social media blogs/posts, pictures, etc. including but not limited to any legal liability incurred (defamation, harassment, obscenity, privacy issues regarding students or patients, etc.). Do not post any content that is inappropriate. Inappropriate content includes, but is not limited to, material that is obscene, defamatory, profane, libelous, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful, or embarrassing to another person or entity. Medical advice on a social networking site should never be provided. Be mindful of the copyright and intellectual property rights of others when posting. Unlawful use of another's mark or intellectual property is not acceptable merely because that use occurs on social media . Respect copyright and fair use laws-from SLU. If you are ever in doubt, please refer to the University's Copyright Policy, or contact the Office of the General Counsel for guidance. Maintain Confidentiality: Do not post confidential or proprietary information about Saint Louis University, its students, professors, or employees. Do not post any class content or information on any social media sites. 34 Do not use SLU's logo or image for any endorsements or on any social media sites Use good ethical judgment and follow College policies and federal requirements, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, (HIPAA), and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, (FERPA). All material posted on the Internet via email, social media, or otherwise, is considered public and permanent; published information can be recovered. Be aware that your relationship to SLU and the College of Nursing can be discovered on the Internet. Infractions to this policy will be addressed as a violation of Academic Integrity and handled per that policy. Other Standards-Related Policies and Information More information about Community Standards, and drug and alcohol policies and how to report or appeal is posted on the University web site: https://www.slu.edu/life-at-slu/community-standards/index.php Health risks and available treatment options may also be found in the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Policy. Plus, the Student Health & Counseling Center is always an on-campus resource available for students (or call 314-977-2323 ). https://www.slu.edu/life-at-slu/student- health/index.php Harassment Saint Louis University affirms that harassment because of sex. Race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital status, military status, veteran's status, pregnancy, or any other protected classification is detrimental to its mission and values. The University endeavors to take steps reasonably necessary to prevent such behavior from occurring, including providing education and training to faculty, staff, and students as to their rights and responsibilities, informing person of the appropriate procedures for reporting inappropriate behavior, promptly investigating complaints, and imposing appropriate sanctions. See the University policy with information about making a complaint at this web site: https://www.slu.edu/human-resources/pdfs/policies/harassment-policy.pdf 35 Course-Related Information NURS 6999 Dissertation Research Ph.D. candidates must successfully complete 12 credits of Dissertation Research. No more than 6 dissertation credits can be taken in any one semester. If the dissertation is not yet finished after completing these 12 credits, students may register for 0 credits of NURS 6999 Dissertation Research, as long as they do not require an extension of time (graduate students must complete PhD program within 7 years). If on an extension, students will have to register for additional dissertation credits, at least 1 per semester. Students may NOT register for more than 6 credits of dissertation research in one semester. Students may begin registering for dissertation credits once the preliminary exam has ben successfully completed and course work is finished. Zero (0) Credit Fees Even when registered for \"0\" credit hours, graduate students will be assessed the student activity fee and the Busch Student Center fee with the exception that students enrolled in courses outside the metropolitan area will not be charged the Busch Student Center fee. Area of Concentration (Cognate Courses) Area of concentration or cognate courses are three elective courses chosen with the assistance of the advisor/mentor that individually and collectively enhance the depth of understanding of the student's chosen area of concentration . These three courses may be chosen from other schools or departments at the University. Commonly courses are taken from health care ethics, public health, psychology, sociology, education, public policy, and business. The student should be aware of pre- requisite courses in these departments. For more course information and options, see the Graduate Education Catalog website (see http://www.slu.edu/services/registrar/catalog/20162017.html ). Students may transfer in courses or take courses at local schools who have a cooperative agreement with SLU (see below Inter-University Program). Students may enroll in Research Topics (NURS 6979) and/or Graduate Reading/Independent Study (NURS 6989) courses guided by a faculty member; these courses may be used as part of area of concentration. With the faculty's permission to register, student complete an \"application\" form describing the course title, number of credit hours, objectives, content, and evaluation methods which needs to be approved by the supervising faculty member and by the Ph.D. nursing program director (See Appendix E including the Title Change From). Typically, only one of these courses may be used for the area of concentration. Faculty may not be available every semester for supervising independent studies, so students should plan early with their advisor/chair. 36 Nurse Educator Courses A set of education courses is available for students to achieve teaching competencies to serve in academic settings as faculty. Students who select the Nurse Educator courses will complete 9 credit hours of nursing education courses. The nursing education courses are available online only (usually asynchronous learning). Students who receive funds from the federal Nurse Faculty Loan Program (NFLP), are expected to take these 9 credit hours of courses. If students received a master's degree focused on nursing education, they may have taken some of this content, and will not need to repeat any courses already taken. NURS 5570 Curriculum Development in Nursing Education (2 credits) NURS 5580 Instructional Strategies and Evaluation for Nurse Educators (2 credits) NURS 5590 Practicum in Nursing Education (2 credits) NURS 6816 Research Issues in Nursing Education (3 credits) Minors A student has the option to declare a secondary area of study (\"minor\") from a graduate department at the University in lieu of an area of concentration. The student initiates a petition to Ph.D. Nursing Program to enroll in 15 credit hours of course work in the non-nursing discipline. Permission from the discipline's department chairperson is required. See Written and Oral Preliminary Examinations for more information about how the declared minor effects these tests. Inter-University Exchange Consortium - Course Options at Other Connected Universities Students may take courses at other universities in the Exchange program, if they meet the following requirements: The student is enrolled at SLU full-time and is in good academic standing. The course is not available at SLU. The course is required or recommended for your major or minor. The course is approved by your advisor, department chair, and dean. Tuition is paid to SLU at our rates. Classes are computed into the student's GPA. See the information provided by the Registrar with a list of participants and how to register: https://www.slu.edu/registrar/register/inter-university-program.php 37 Qualifying Examinations The preliminary qualifying exams include a written and oral component. The purpose is for students to demonstrate integration of what they learned in their completed theory, philosophy, stats, qualitative, quantitative, and scientific integrity courses. This is intended to be a formative and growth-producing process. The purpose is not for students to have extensive knowledge of any topic. The purpose is for students to demonstrate that they can propose a beginning study using both paradigms, qualitative and quantitative. Ph.D. nursing students must successfully pass a qualifying examination in order to continue in the program. Students will take the exam on completion of identified core courses (ordinarily after the student's second year of study) The qualifying examination is designed to determine the students' ability to integrate and synthesize foundational material. Completed courses must include: Theory Development in Nursing Knowledge Development in Nursing: Philosophical Perspectives Quantitative Methods in Nursing Research Qualitative Methods in Nursing Research Applied Statistics for Nursing Research I and II Issues of Scientific Integrity in Nursing and Health Research Process For written component, students will write two research proposals (one qualitative and one quantitative) on a topic that will be assigned to them. They will have 2 days. The students will receive a review article on their assigned topic on the morning of the first day to use as a base for their proposals. They will turn in both proposals at the end of the second day. The proposals will be review by the student's chair or advisor and two other faculty members. They will identify any strengths and weaknesses then meet with the student to discuss the proposals -2-3 weeks later. Students will describing their proposals and choices made when writing them. They will have the opportunity to discuss any adjustments they would consider after deliberating on their 38 proposals. They should be prepared to defend their decisions and answer questions from faculty about the proposals. A pass or fail is assigned for the entire qualifying exam process and it is assigned after the oral discussion. If a student fails, the committee will recommend some remediation for that semester to help the student address any shortcomings. Students will retake their preliminary exam (written and oral portions) the following January. If a student fails on the second attempt (fail by 2 graduate faculty), the student will be dismissed. If a student who failed the exam has exceeded the seven-year time to degree, a petition to extend the time to re-take the exam is not usually approved. See the Academic Appeals policy. Dissertation Guidelines & Format Options The following sections are included here and students are encouraged to review them all when beginning the dissertation and check again at each step of the process: Introduction, Chairperson and Committee, Formats: Traditional and SLU-SON Alternative, Proposal Defense/ Oral Exam, Study Conduct and IRB, Dissertation Defense, and Final Steps. Introduction The dissertation is \"original\" research conducted by the student over 12 credit hours and written as a document. The research study may be on any topic and use any design or method as approved by the dissertation chairperson and committee. Students work with their dissertation chairperson as primary mentor to plan the study and develop a timeline for the research. The timeline should identify how many of the 12 credit hours of dissertation research (NURS 6999) should be allotted and what students are expected to have completed each semester. Students should meet with their chairperson each semester at least once to discuss progress, and plan how many credits to take the next semester. Annual reviews should be conducted. All graduate students registered for 1 or more hours of dissertation research are considered full-time. Zero credit hour registration for NURS 6999 is allowed, but not until the student has successfully completed 12 hours of NURS 6999. The student is still considered full time when taking any dissertation credits. Students are not required to be registered for summer unless they plan to 39 graduate in the summer or want to get credit during the summer. Students on an extension must pay for at least 1 credit hour per semester until completing their dissertation. Chairs must work with the Administrative Assistant for the PhD Program to register students for dissertation credits (NURS 6999). For NURS 6999, a grade of \"In Progress (IP)\" will be submitted at the end of the semester if the student is making satisfactory progress. An \"Unsatisfactory (U)\" indicates satisfactory progress has not been made in a given semester. Credit hours taken in association with a grade of \"U\" will not be credited toward the total of 12 hours in NURS 6999 required for graduation. Students can also petition for Course Extensions if needed (see Petitions and Forms). The grade of \"Satisfactory (S)\" will only be assigned when the student has successfully completed and defended the dissertation and the dissertation committee has fully accepted the document (i.e., their final registration). Chairperson and Committee Members Students are encouraged to interview faculty for a potential chairperson of the dissertation committee by discussing mutual research interests. Faculty must have PhD Mentoring status to chair a dissertation. The choice of a chairperson is by mutual agreement between the faculty member and the student. The ideal arrangement is that the student will conduct the dissertation research in an area similar in topic or methods to the research experience of the selected chairperson in order to receive mentoring in the area. Circumstances may arise in which the ideal is not possible. No member of the faculty is compelled to chair a dissertation committee or serve on a committee. This may be due to a student conducting research in an unrelated area, research of no interest to the faculty, or the time commitment exceeds the faculty's workload. The dissertation chairperson shall have primary, secondary, or joint appointment at the School of Nursing and hold Graduate Faculty with Ph.D. Mentor status at the School of Nursing. Ordinarily, the chairperson shall be tenured and have a full-time appointment at the University and active in research and scholarship. After the chairperson has been determined, the dissertation committee is proposed by the student in consultation in agreement with the dissertation chairperson. It is possible to have 2 co-chairs for a committee (workload would need to be determined and submitted to the Associate Dean). The dissertation committee shall have at least three members, two of whom should be full-time graduate faculty at the School of Nursing. External Committee Members If desirable, a faculty member who holds Graduate Faculty status in another University school, college, or department may be appointed as one of the three committee members. External members to the University can also serve as a committee member provided, they have a terminal degree in the field and their expertise and scholarly record are relevant to the students' dissertation. The chair should obtain approval for faculty outside of SLU from the program Director and Students are encouraged to interview faculty for a potential chairperson of the dissertation committee by discussing mutual research interests. The choice of a chairperson is by mutual agreement between the faculty member and the student. 40 Associate Dean for Graduate Education for member outside the University (see PhD Connections for form). Additional members can be appointed to the dissertation committee, as needed. The student may request and/or the chairperson may recommend an additional consultant (s) on the research. However, a consultant is advisory only and will not have responsibility or authority to approve the dissertation research. All members of the dissertation committee have the responsibility to advise the student throughout the research process. The committee has the authority and responsibility to require high quality research including requiring portions of the dissertation to be rewritten. All committee members have equal voting rights to approve the proposed research plan and the final document (including the oral proposal defense). The chairperson of the dissertation committee is the primary mentor and advisor of the student throughout the research process. Ordinarily, the chairperson of the dissertation committee works most closely with the student during the dissertation process. The chairperson will provide timely, detailed feedback to the student, identifying those elements that need revision, as will other committee members. During the dissertation process, it is the student's responsibility to initiate contacts with the chairperson and provide ongoing reports on the progress of the research. It is the chairperson's responsibility to provide a mentored experience to the student by helping them define the scope of the project, giving ongoing guidance and evaluative feedback on the contextual, methodological, and intellectual development of the dissertation research. It is the responsibility of the entire committee to establish an expectancy of high achievement from the student and to provide timely input and feedback to the student at the appropriate stage of the dissertation process. If a dissertation committee member leaves the University, the member must be replaced unless the dissertation is nearly complete, or the member has an essential role on the committee. In the latter case, approval from the program Director and Associate Dean for Graduate Education will be obtained (request for outside committee member). When the chairperson of a committee leaves and cannot be readily replaced, a new chairperson must be identified. If there is a chairperson and co- chairperson, and the chairperson leaves the University, the co-chairperson automatically assumes 41 the chair position; the former chairperson may remain on the committee. If the dissertation final defense takes place within a few months of the chairperson's departure, the requirement of the new chair may be waived. The University's Office of Graduate Education should be notified of all changes of a committee through the Doctoral Candidacy advisor. A retired faculty member with emeritus status may remain as a member or chair of a committee if easily accessible by real-time communication and is still professionally active. Retired faculty who may not be accessible and/or do not remain professionally active should be replaced on committees and the revised committee approved by the program director and the Associate Dean for Graduate Education. Disputes between the student and one or more committee members or among committee members that cannot be resolved will be brought to the attention of the Program Director and if not resolved, the Associate Dean for Graduate Education. Members of the committee may be changed only when necessary or appropriate and with the approval of the program director and Associate Dean for Graduate Education. Dissertation Formats Students may choose either a traditional or an alternative dissertation format. Both formats require a dissertation committee, a dissertation research study and proposal defense, IRB approval, completion of at least 12 hours of dissertation credits, and a dissertation document reporting the study findings as a final product. Ordinarily, students initiate their dissertation research after completing the qualifying examination and required courses (some difference may apply with the alternative dissertation - see below). A student (or candidate) may change the dissertation format once. Students are encouraged to consider the descriptions below when choosing their format, as well a s their anticipated employment situation. School of Nursing Traditional Dissertation Format The traditional dissertation format ordinarily includes four or five chapters; however, the findings may result in additional chapters (for example, qualitative studies may include separate chapters to address each theme from the study). The chapters are ordinarily ordered as described below. 1. Introductory chapter - provides a statement of the problem, a brief background and significance, and the research question(s) or hypothesis(es) to be tested. 2. Analytic literature review chapter - describes the significance of the project and need for the study by addressing current state of the science, the quality of what is known, and describing how the proposed research fills an identified gap in the literature. Note: this chapter may be combined with Chapter 1 into a single chapter if four chapters are desired. 42 3. Methods chapter - a detailed presentation and justification of the design, research methods and analytic procedures to conduct the investigation. The methods provide a detailed blueprint for conducting the study. 4. Results chapter(s) - reporting findings of the research study in considerable detail. 5. Discussion chapter - describes the findings in the context of current literature and provides implications of the results, draws the appropriate conclusions, and lays out an agenda for future research, practice, and policy on the issues addressed in the dissertation. 6. Supplemental tables and figures can be included in an appendix. The dissertation committee approves the proposal before the study is started (typically chapters 1- 3). and approves the students' progress for setting a date for the dissertation defense. The student is encouraged to review and follow the formatting guidelines described in the \" Policies and Procedures for Thesis, Project and Dissertation Formatting\" document that is provided by the Doctoral Candidacy Advisor. This document provides detailed instructions for how to write the dissertation document that are required by the University and needed before submission of the document to ProQuest. See this web page: https://www.slu.edu/academics/graduate/pdfs/slu_formatting_guide.pdf School of Nursing Alternative Dissertation Format The Trudy Busch Valentine Alternative Dissertation Format permits the doctoral candidate the option of compiling three (or more) publishable manuscripts approved by the committee for the dissertation document. The manuscripts are related to a central theme, and each becomes a chapter within the dissertation. The final dissertation includes an introductory chapter (topic significance, key background, introduction of manuscripts), three chapters of related publishable manuscripts, and a discussion chapter covering the set of papers as a whole with implications for future research, practice, and policy. Because substantial evidence of scholarship is expected for the Ph.D. degree, a student will ordinarily be the sole or first author of each manuscript. The student must be the first author on at least two manuscripts but may be the second author on one manuscript. The committee members ordinarily approve manuscripts prior to submission to a journal. One first-authored manuscript must have been fully accepted for publication in a scholarly journal before the student can graduate. Journals targeted for possible publication of the manuscripts should be of high quality, scholarly, and respected in the academic/clinical community (e. g. indexed in PubMed; avoiding predatory journals). Targeted journals must have the full support of the dissertation committee. There is no single means of identifying journal quality (i.e. impact factor) in nursing. Few nursing journals are highly ranked and specialty journals may have lower impact factors. If there is a question as to the quality of a journal, students should seek advice from their committee chairperson and a University librarian. The process for completing the alternative dissertation study is generally the same as the traditional dissertation described above. Students write a study proposal, hold a proposal defense, submit to IRB, and complete the dissertation study. The student may develop a plan for an alternative 43 dissertation and begin submitting manuscripts prior to the proposal defense (e. g. theory or review papers). In this case, the student should setup a Presumptive Committee and complete a memorandum of agreement to obtain approval of manuscripts (see details below). The dissertation committee approves the study proposal before the study is started and approves the students' papers before submitted as the dissertation is completed. Selecting a Dissertation Format There are pros and cons to each dissertation format that students should consider. Both formats require a completed dissertation study. The student should discuss their choice with their dissertation chairperson to make a final choice. Traditional Dissertation Pros Cons Provides a full description of the study Provides an opportunity to write a thorough literature review Faculty support and mentor student to consider strategies for dissemination of research findings (e.g., presentation, manuscript or book) Papers from the dissertation can be published after graduation Completion and graduation depend on how fast the student works and completes the study and dissertation document Traditional dissertation may be a long document Dissertation chapters ty pically will require revision to be publishable SON Alternative Format Pros Cons Provides three publishable papers by graduation Dissertation work may be started before prelims with a memorandum of agreement Encourages writing succinctly for publishable manuscripts Student gets experience with the publication process (submission, addressing reviewers and making revisions, handling rejection, etc.) Having publications may strengthen the resume for applying for academic positions or tenure-track, or future grant submissions Graduation depends on journal acceptance of a first-authored paper, so can be delayed Papers published during doctoral work may or may not count for tenure after graduation 44 Memorandum of Agreement for the Nontraditional Dissertation The memorandum of agreement (MOA) is completed by students who choose the non-traditional dissertation and submitted for approval by the committee. The MOA may be completed during course work prior to the qualifying exam. In this case, the student can begin writing and publishing papers. However, in this case the chairperson and committee members are considered presumptive until the student is officially approved in the process of advancing to doctoral candidacy. All members of the presumptive dissertation committee and the Ph.D. nursing program director must approve and sign the nontraditional dissertation memorandum of agreement before it can be accepted. The student still will need to develop a proposal for their dissertation study, hold a Proposal Defense to advance to candidacy before conducting their study. In the MOA, students describe the theme of the dissertation and content of the three anticipated manuscripts. No presumption of approval of dissertation plans is appropriate until the MOA is negotiated and signed by all members of the presumed committee and the Ph.D. nursing program director. Papers submitted as assignments in courses may be used as dissertation manuscripts, but still require full committee approval to be part of the nontraditional dissertation. Ordinarily, none of the manuscripts for the nontraditional, three-article dissertation have submitted for publication until the MOA has been officially approved by the committee, but a paper published while in the doctoral program could be considered by the committee for inclusion. The nontraditional dissertation format ordinarily includes at least five chapters. The first chapter provides a statement of the problem, its background and significance, how the three manuscripts are thematically related, and an overview of the remaining chapters. Chapters two, three, and four are the article- length manuscripts themselves. Chapter five is a scholarly discussion of the implications of the study, presents conclusions based on the set of papers, and lays out an agenda for practice, policy, and future research on the issues addressed in the dissertation. Dissertation Proposal Defense / Oral Examination DRAFT A proposal defense is needed for the committee to approve the dissertation study and serves as the student's oral examination. . The defense takes place after chapters 1-2 or 1-3 are completed that include the methods for the dissertation study. The date for the proposal defense will be set with the chairperson and dissertation committee when they have had time to review and approved the proposal and agreed on a date. The committee for the oral examination/proposal defense must have a minimum of five members unless an exception has been granted by the Office of Graduate Education. The dissertation committee ordinarily has 3 members. These members should be The formation of a presumptive committee does not presume or guarantee a student's successful completion of the qualifying examination and advancement to candidacy. 45 included in the proposal defense as well as two additional faculty members determined by the student with their Dissertation Chair. The committee should be sent the proposal at least two weeks before the scheduled exam, depending on faculty schedules. To schedule the exam/proposal defense, students must complete the \"Doctoral Oral Examination Form\"; the form must be received by the Doctoral Candidacy Specialist at least two weeks prior to the date of the exam. Upon receipt of the form, the Doctoral Candidacy Specialist will send a decision result form to the committee chairperson prior to the exam or proposal defense. No examination or proposal defense is to occur without the result form in hand. This oral exam is scheduled by the student and chairperson. This may be conducted via zoom. The form for scheduling the exam is available at this link: https://www.slu.edu/academics/graduate/pdfs/ge_oral_exam_fillable.pdf This meeting will include group discussion to strengthen the proposal. The student will present a 15-20-minute presentation on their dissertation study. The committee will then ask questions to determine the acceptability of the proposal and rationale for the components. At the conclusion of the examination, the student will be asked to leave the room while the members of the committee vote privately without discussion via ballot (hand ballot or e-mailed ballot). If two of the five members of the committee vote to fail, the student fails the qualifying exam. After voting and discussion with the other committee members, the chairperson notifies the student of the results. The Committee Chair will complete the Results form for the oral examination/proposal defense to send to the Doctoral Candidacy Advisor. Upon receipt of the form, the Doctoral Candidacy Specialist will send a decision result form to the committee chairperson prior to the exam or proposal defense. Once the proposal is approved, students will proceed to submit their study proposal to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for approval, if the research includes human subjects (see more information below on IRB). No data collection may be conducted before obtaining approval. Regarding the research proposal, the chair will also complete a Proposal Approval Form with recommendations for the final proposal that is signed by the student and committee. The student is expected t o make changes recommended by the committee. A copy of the form should be sent to the PhD program director. If a student fails the oral exam, the student will make revisions in the proposal and a second exam can be taken. The student may not retake the oral exam in the same semester (per Graduate Education). The same committee members will re-examine the student unless members have left the University or are unavailable; in which case, the committee chairperson and the student will choose the replacement(s). A committee member from outside the School of Nursing (a SLU faculty member from another program) must be present at a second exam/proposal defense, per University policy. A student who fails a second attempt, will not be allowed to conduct their dissertation study or continue in the program. Students may appeal this decision (see appeals policy in Appendix). 46 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Policies and Procedures Dissertation studies involving human subjects must be submitted to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and approved. The following definitions apply: Research means a systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. (d) Research means a systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. Human subject means a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains: (1) data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or (2) identifiable private information.\" When a proposal is submitted, a Scientific Pre-Review must be conducted. This is typically done by a committee member who is not listed as part of the research team (i.e., would not participate in data collection or analysis of data). The research team ordinarily includes the Chair and may include other team members or a statistician. If all committee members will be on the research team, the PhD Program Director or other faculty member can be asked to conduct the Pre-Review. When approved, the student may conduct the study, analyze the data and write the final dissertation. Approval must be obtained before any data collection can begin. Proposals for studies are submitted through the University electronic system https://eirb.slu.edu/ Student use their SLU ID and password to use the system. The detailed protocol is pasted into the main body from the student's study proposal. Any data collection forms, consent forms, recruitment materials, and HIPPA forms or waiver all must be submitted. See the IRB guidelines for detailed instructions. Content on protection of human subjects is provided in NURS 8012 and as noted below. Training (Known as CITI Training) All researchers including doctoral students must complete training in human subjects' research to obtain approval for a research study. For most, this is completed during your doctoral course in Scientific Integrity. If you are working on a study with a faculty member as a research assistant or doing a project sooner than this class, you will need to complete it before commencing this work. They will need to submit your name to the IRB to designate you as a member of their research team and have this addendum approved before you can begin any research work (i.e., data collection, analysis or contact with subjects). The current training approved for SLU researchers is offered by the Collaborative Institutional Review Board Training Initiative (CITI). This is a national online training program with multiple modules and is free to take. You can access the training through the IRB web page at SLU.edu. Students take the Biomedical Research Investigators Human Subjects training, regardless of your planned dissertation topic or methods. The training takes approximately 6-8 hours to complete. 47 You do not have to complete the training in one session. The completion certificate is automatically sent to the SLU IRB so you should not have to submit a certificate to them. However, you can go back and print your completion certificate any time if needed for class, or if you go work at a new University. Students who work on NIH funded grants with faculty may be required to complete an additional module through NIH entitled \"Good Clinical Practice.\" IRB Submission Process Complete the project proposal and get approval from the dissertation committee (written proposal and Dissertation Proposal Defense). Complete the Biomedical IRB CITI training on scientific integrity and research with human subjects (this will normally be completed during the NURS 6812 course). Note that the IRB will want a letter of approval from any sites where the study will be conducting, which should be submitted to the IRB with the proposal. Complete the IRB forms online (https://eirb.slu.edu/). Sections of the written proposal can be pasted directly into the online form. Note that the background must be brief for the IRB online form. The student must submit all data collection forms, informed consent forms, recruitment materials, etc. with the proposal. Once completed, the online form can be downloaded as a pdf for final approval by the chair. All committee members or others who will participate in the study (data collection, conduct of study procedures, examining raw data) need to be identified as \"Research Team Members.\" They need to have CITI training. The Dissertation Chair must be identified as the \"Department Chair/Advisor.\" As a last step, a faculty member is assigned to complete a scientific \"Pre-Review\" of the proposal. This pre-review is to assure that the project is scientifically appropriate and that students have addressed all potential issues related to projects with human participants. This is required by the IRB and suggested changes from the pre-review must be addressed prior to final submission to the IRB. For PhD students, a committee member who is not listed as a research team member must complete the Pre-Review. If there is not a committee member who is not a team member, the PhD program director or another faculty member can be asked to serve as the Pre-Reviewer. Ideally the student sends a PDF of the proposal for Pre- Review prior to submitting the proposal so changes can be made before the proposal is formally submitted. The student's chair should approval any changes. Once final changes are made, the final version of the proposal is then submitted within the eIRB and the Pre-Reviewer will sign off on the proposal in the electronic system. The student completes the obligations page and select Submit. NOTE: PI (student) must be the one who checks the responsibilities/signature box on the PI Obligations page. 48 The student will be notified when the IRB review is complete. The IRB usually requests some additional changes. Once these are completed and checked by the IRB, the student will get final approval and may begin data collection. Students should use only the approved forms for study procedures, found in the eirb. Once approved, any changes in personnel or study protocols (i.e., change in number of potential subjects for recruitment, changes in data collection forms, etc.) must be approved by the IRB through submission of an amendment. Unless the changes are substantial; this approval is generally quick. Finally, at graduation, student PIs should CLOSE their IRB protocols. If in the rare case the student PI wishes to transfer the study to a new PI (such as their committee chair) for additional work after graduation, the student should contact the IRB for instructions on how to do so. Research and Health Insurance and Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) The IRB will include managing personal health information for HIPAA. Under HIPAA, certain identifying pieces of health information are protected from casual scrutiny or use by unauthorized personnel. HIPAA regulations govern the circumstances of collection, access to and use of this Protected Health Information (PHI): names, postal addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, e- mail addresses, dates (including birth dates), social security numbers, medical record, and health plan numbers, account numbers, certificate/license numbers, vehicle identifiers including license plate numbers, device identifiers, names of relatives, Web URLs, IP address numbers, biometric identifiers, photographs and comparable images, and any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code. Saint Louis University faculty and student researchers submitting Institutional Review Board protocols for review (see below) must have completed HIPAA training and incorporated the most recent applicable HIPAA assurances with or in their IRB protocol. Dissertation Defense The public, oral defense of the final dissertation is required of all PhD students. The oral defense of the dissertation cannot occur until the student has advanced to Ph.D. candidacy, successfully completed at least 12 credit hours of NURS 6999 Dissertation Research and has committee approval. Graduate Educations provides a \"Calendar of Deadlines\" each semester that lists dates for requesting graduation in a semester and provides dates when dissertation requirements must be submitted for students to graduate. Student must submit an Application for Degree through MySLU. For completing the dissertation, the student writes the results of their study and discussion for review. When the chairperson approves the latter chapters, the complete draft is then circulated to the other members of the dissertation committee who should have time to give feedback to the 49 student in advance of the oral defense of the dissertation. The chapters could also be circulated to the other members of the committee as the committee chair approves each chapter. The date for the oral dissertation defense will be set with the chairperson and dissertation committee who determines an agreed upon date and time. Once the date is set, a Notification (application) of Readiness form for the public oral presentation of the Ph.D. dissertation must be submitted to the Office of Graduate Education, This should be at least two weeks prior to the anticipated date . The student should send the title, date and information to the PhD director (preferably a flyer) , who will send a notice to all PhD students and faculty members who may wish to attend. The student/chair should post flyers in the School of Nursing building for other faculty members. The oral defense is announced publicly to the School of Nursing faculty and students (and the University community at large through Newslink). Students are requested to send the slides for zoom meeting at least a day ahead of the meeting for faculty to use, as type on slides can be small on laptops or some screens. Ordinarily, students are on-campus at the School of Nursing for the public defense of the dissertation, but zoom is also acceptable. The form for Graduate Education to schedule the Defense can be found on this website: https://www.slu.edu/academics/graduate/pdfs/ge_readiness_fillable.pdf The dissertation presentation should include an introduction by the chair, followed by a 20 to 30- minute presentation of the dissertation by the candidate. This is followed by questioning from committee members. When the committee has completed their questions, the student will take questions from the audience. The questions may pertain to the methodology, findings, implications, or future research that the candidate anticipates. After the questions, the committee retires to decide on the acceptability of the dissertation and its defense. The oral defense is also evaluated by faculty attending the presentation for program assessment. When feasible, the oral presentation of the defense will be video recorded for students at a distance and possible later viewing. Consent to video record students and the committee is implied as part of the process of the dissertation defense; written permission is not needed. Exception to the implied consent for video recording must be submitted in writing to the program director. The committee approves the dissertation two ways - the oral defense , and the written dissertation document. The ballots for each are signed by all committee members before the dissertation can be accepted and the student can graduate. Both signed forms must be submitted to the Candidacy Advisor to graduate, and by the date required by Graduate Education for the next conferral date. Final Steps to Completing the Dissertation Document Once the committee has approved and signed off on the dissertation document, The Doctoral Candidacy Advisor at the Office of Graduate Education will review a draft of the dissertation and must approves the final format of the dissertation document, per the required formatting guidelines. 50 Students are required to submit their final product to ProQuest for digital archiving and publication via Dissertation Abstracts International. This must be completed before degree conferral can be received. Students can choose to embargo the dissertation document (hold the release) for up to 2 years. This may be done to protect the work for patent and/or proprietary purposes. Most nursing journals do not consider dissertations in ProQuest to be prior publications, but the student may choose to hold the dissertation until after papers are published through the embargo process. If the student is including any copyrighted figures or measures (if published in a journal they may be copyrighted), then they must obtain permission to include this in the dissertation document. See the journal or publication web page for instructions on obtaining permissions. For non-traditional dissertations, at least one paper will have been published. Ordinarily, the author(s) of a manuscript submitted to a journal transfers copyright to the journal. (Exceptions may be open source or open access journals.) Even though the student and/or faculty member(s) have authored a published article, permission to use it must be secured by the student from the owner of the copyright (the journal) for its inclusion in the dissertation document for ProQuest. If the journal does not give permission for including the full manuscript in ProQuest, the student may write a new abstract (not copied from the published manuscript) for that paper's chapter and list the reference to the published article. Additional information on using copyrighted material as part of the dissertation may be found in the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 6th edition. The Doctoral Candidacy advisor at the Office of Graduate Education may also provide valuable assistance. For further information, see ProQuest at https://www.proquest.com/ Graduation -Conferral of Degree The deadline for the Application for Degree is up to one semester before and within about the first two weeks of the semester of graduation. After this time you must complete a Petition for Late Application for Graduation and a $50 late graduate application fee will be assessed. The final degree conferral can be awarded when all requirements are met prior to the published conferral dates. If any requirements are not completed, the degree will be deferred to the next 51 published conferral date. See the Academic Catalog for further details. Students will receive their diploma by mail within a few weeks of graduation from the Registrar at Saint Louis University. Doctoral students are invited to participate in Graduation ceremonies, typically held in May and December. Students may participate in graduation ceremonies early if close to completing their dissertation. The PhD Program Director will need to know what students are planning to attend graduation so that the students name, photo, and dissertation title can be included in the nursing graduation program. The faculty and students attend graduation in academic regalia. In the Pre-Commencement ceremony, all students are called by name and walk across the stage. Doctoral students have their dissertation title announced and carry their hood up on stage and their Chair places their doctoral hood over their head (PhD hoods are provided by the School of Nursing). They then shake hands, etc. The University-wide Commencement occurs in Chaifetz Arena. In this ceremony (about 1 hour in length) students are not recognized individually, but rather, each school's graduates stand as they are presented to the University President. There is usually a renowned speaker and a lot of \"pomp and circumstance.\" Scholarships and Other Funding Several options are available to support PhD students. These include Scholarships, Assistantships, and the Nurse Faculty Loan Program (NFLP). See descriptions below. Several scholarships are available targeted to PhD nursing students. Students can explore the option through MySLU tools - Scholarship Suite, which is where applications and management of scholarships are managed. Scholarship funds are typically dispersed in July or August for the next academic year (spring/fall); additional funds may be available later in the year. These funds are only for tuition support. The amount of funds may vary from year to year. Marion Bender Scholarship Through the generosity of the late Ms. Marion Bender, Saint Louis University School of Nursing offers scholarship funds to U.S. Ph.D. nursing students that are applied to graduate tuition at Saint Louis University. Funding preference will be given to assist in achieving a more diverse population consistent with the needs of the nursing discipline and professional nursing workforce. Preference will also be given to those who live/work in and serve rural communities or demonstrate commitment to conduct research with underserved or disadvantaged populations . Eligible students apply annually for this scholarship. International students are not eligible. Shaw-Engler and Hoppe Scholarships Shaw-Engler Scholarship fund was established through the generosity of Orena Marge Shaw to honor her long-time friend and colleague, Evelyn Engler who was adjunct faculty and preceptor for 52 SLU students at the VA Hospital in St. Louis. Mrs. Hoppe and her husband were 1951 graduates from Saint Louis University, she from the School of Nursing and he from the School of Medicine. After graduation, the couple married and returned to Houston, their hometown; they had no children. Dr. Hoppe died in 2002, and Mrs. Hoppe eventually moved to Charlotte, N.C., to live with her niece, Mary Smiley Johnston. Mrs. Hoppe died in July 2017. Funding preference for these two scholarships is for students who demonstrate excellence in PhD Education and those who demonstrate a significant financial need. NANDA Scholarship NANDA originated at Saint Louis University! Faculty members Kristine Gebbie and Mary Ann Lavin called the first Task Force to Name and Classify Nursing Diagnoses. Members met in St. Louis. A Clearinghouse was established at St. Louis University that served as a depository for nursing diagnosis materials and the National Conference Group on the classification of Nursing Diagnoses for many years. The clearinghouse staff published a newsletter, coordinated plans for national conferences and distributed bibliographies on each diagnostic category developed. NANDA later developed into an international organization to promote nursing diagnoses. Funding supports PhD students with an interest in conducting research related to a nursing diagnosis, or nursing diagnosis domain. Potter Qualitative Scholarship Funded by Dr. Patricia Potter, graduate of the program. The purpose of the Potter Scholarship Fund is to support PhD students conducting qualitative research studies. The study can address any area of health. Ph.D. nursing students must have applied, be admitted and enrolled in the Ph.D. nursing program and be in good academic standing at the University. The one-time support is for those conducting a qualitative research dissertation. Application form is in this manual.

Admission, Progression and Graduation Policy can be found in the respective Saint Louis University School of Nursing program handbooks and University Catalogs. Appeal of an Academic Decision: (e.g. Course grade, clinical probation, etc.) A grade may be appealed only if there is evidence of capricious or arbitrary grading, abuse of discretion or lack of due process. An appeal gives the student the opportunity to present evidence that the assigned grade was capricious and/or arbitrary; there was abuse of discretion; or there was a lack of due process. If a student believes the above is true, the student must: 1. Appeal to the faculty member who assigned the grade. 2. Appeal beyond the faculty member is to be made to the course coordinator. The student meets with the course coordinator with supporting evidence. 3. If a resolution is not obtained, the student contacts the option coordinator. 4. If a resolution is not obtained, the student contacts the appropriate SON administrator: Associate Dean of Undergraduate and Prelicensure Education. Associate Dean of Graduate Education. Program Director, Ph.D. 5. If resolution is not obtained, the student can appeal to the Admissions, Progression and Graduation Committee (APG). See below for specific procedures. It is the responsibility of the APG committee Chair to communicate the Committee's appeal decision to the student. The option coordinator, faculty mentor/advisor, and the appropriate administrator of the student's program are also informed of the decision and are responsible for follow up. Appeal of a Program Dismissal: A student has the right to appeal a program dismissal. The appeal process gives the student the opportunity to explain extenuating circumstances or conditions which adversely affected their behavior or academic performance. Thu student must present plans for preventing future problems if the requested reinstatement is granted. The appeal is heard by the School of Nursing AP&G Committee. The Committee makes the decision to grant or deny the student's appeal. It is the responsibility of the Chair of the APG Committee to communicate the Committee's decision to the student. The Director/Option Coordinator of the student's program is also promptly informed of the committee's decision on the student's appeal and is responsible for follow-up with the student. Admission, Progression, and Graduation Committee Procedures: Following posting of course grades, the appropriate SON administrator identifies those students who have not met all curricular and academic requirements as described in the respective program student handbook and/or catalog. 74 The appropriate SON administrator communicates in writing to the student(s) notifying them concerning their status in the School of Nursing. The letter will explain the specific issue and the appeal process. A copy of the letter is sent to the student's mentor and/or advisor and the APG chairperson. The student must acknowledge receipt of the notification in writing. When a student chooses to appeal, a request must be made in writing to the appropriate APG Committee Chairperson. The request must be made within 10 business days following receipt of written notification communicating the academic issue. The appeal letter should, at a minimum, include the following: 1. A concise statement of the purpose of the appeal. 2. A description of the relevant circumstances that may have influenced the student's academic performance. 3. The student's plan for future success. A hearing is scheduled based on the availability of a majority of the committee members. The administrator of the student's program will not be a voting member of the hearing committee. If a committee member(s) believes they cannot fairly review the evidence and render a decision, the committee member should recuse themselves from the meeting. The student is provided with a list of the committee members prior to the scheduled appeal. At the student's request, the APG Committee Chairperson will make a substitution of one committee member, which may include the APG Committee Chairperson, if the student believes that the committee member may not render an impartial decision. The student is encouraged to attend the hearing meeting of the APG Committee. If the student is unable to attend the meeting in person, the student may arrange to have a conference phone meeting with the committee. The student is responsible for informing the APG Committee Chairperson whether she/he is attending the meeting in person, meeting via a telephone conference call, or not attending the meeting at all. If the student will be attending the meeting either in person or via a conference call, the Committee Chairperson will discuss the hearing process with the student prior to the hearing. A student may submit a written request to the APG Committee Chairperson that he/she be accompanied by one person at the hearing. The person may attend the meeting and speak to the petitioner but is not allowed to address the committee. If the designated person is an attorney, disclosure must be provided. The designated person may not be a student in the same academic program. Recording of the committee hearing is not permitted. Prior to the APG Committee hearing, the Committee Chairperson will contact the student's faculty mentor and /or advisor and the faculty involved in courses pertinent to the appeal inviting them to provide germane information regarding the student's appeal. Information from the mentor and faculty must be submitted to the APG Committee Chairperson in writing prior to the hearing. No later than the day of the hearing, the Committee members are provided with a copy of the student's appeal letter and the completed APG Committee Summary form. The appropriate SON administrator may provide information related to any previous academic issues. 75 The hearing will proceed as follows: 1. APG Committee Chairperson describes the academic eligibility issue including a review of the applicable policy and pertinent background information. 2. Faculty member(s) may be invited to provide information to the committee. 3. The student joins the hearing and an introduction is made of all those present. 4. The student will make a statement to the committee. 5. The committee members will ask the student questions germane to the issue. 6. The student will make a final statement to the committee, and then be excused from the meeting room. 7. The committee will discuss the issue in a private session and make a majority decision regarding the appeal. The Committee Chairperson will vote only in case of a split decision. 8. If the appeal is granted, the committee will make recommendation(s) regarding progression. The recommendation of the committee will be documented on the confidential Progression Committee Summary Form. This form will be kept in an APG Committee file in the appropriate Associate Dean's office until the student graduates or three years from the date of appeal. Minutes of each meeting will be maintained. The decision regarding the student's appeal will be communicated to the student by the APG Chairperson via the student's SLU e-mail within 24 hours of the Committee meeting. Within five business days, a letter will be sent to the student using traceable mail. If the appeal is granted, the decision will be stated, as appropriate, in the letter. A copy of the letter will be sent to the appropriate SON administrators and the appropriate University department(s). A copy of the letter will be placed in the student's file. If the appeal is denied, the student can file an academic grievance with the Dean of the School of Nursing. At the APG Committee meeting toward the end of the academic year, the appropriate SON administrators will report on the students who were granted an appeal granted in the past year. An assessment will be made determining whether the student has met the recommendation(s) of the appeal conditions.
