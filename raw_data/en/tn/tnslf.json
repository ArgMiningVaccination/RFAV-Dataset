This app is so much more than remedies, the Healthy Life section has easy tools for total wellbeing that you didn't know you needed (Chromotherapy!). All the info is free, but I encourage you to pay $1/month for no ads and support the people that made this app possible. Grateful for this! Absolutely love this app and the content. It's easy to navigate and love the updates bar of new info. I enjoy reading the research, so I appreciate their in-text citing of studies, but they don't have a reference section, so I'm often googling the names and topic to find the article. With ads, I get annoyed not being able to exit out. The 'x' to close the ad is in the top left corner, with half of it outside the screen. I've tried every possible angle to close it down. I mostly just have to exit the whole app, refresh it, and log back in. But totally appreciate that this is free for us to access! I finally found a winner Wow I have been searching high and low for an app like this one. I have even searched for physical books on health. I wanted something that has lots of info. And this happened to be a winner for me. I'm grateful for it because, it's downloaded on my iPhone Just the same way as a digital book. It's fully loaded with remedies, recipes, exercise for the body, mind and more. I can carry this important tool with me and share with others.
