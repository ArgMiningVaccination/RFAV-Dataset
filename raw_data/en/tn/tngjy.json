As Simon Hoggart [comments today](http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2009/aug/15/simon-hoggarts-week) \"There are few tribes more loathsome than the American right\". In the forefront has been a far-right lobby group, Conservatives for Patients' Rights (CPR). Even I was surprised to read in the [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/05/10/ST2009051002320.html) \"The campaign is being coordinated by CRC Public Relations, the group that masterminded the \"Swift boat\" attacks against 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, John F. Kerry\" [CRC Public Relations](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=CRC_Public_Relations) is a conservative PR firm previously known as Creative Response Concepts. 'Creative' appears to mean 'lying', but I guess that is what PR is all about. The founder of CPR, Rick Scott, has an interesting background. According to [Stephen Barrett](http://www.insurancereformwatch.org/opposition/cpr.shtml) \"In 1987, he founded and became chief operating officer of a hospital chain that grew into the 23 billion-dollars-a-year Columbia/HCA. In 1997, a few weeks after the FBI raided HCA hospitals in five states, Scott was ousted as CEO and three executives were indicted on charges of Medicare fraud. The FBI's investigation found that the hospital chain had been overbilling Medicare and giving kickbacks to doctors who steered patients to its hospitals. The overbilling included upcoding lesser procedures to get higher reimbursements and billing for lab tests that were not medically necessary and were not ordered by physicians. The situation was settled with a set of guilty pleas and criminal and civil fines totalling $1.7 billion. The U.S. Department of Justice referred to the matter as the \"largest health care fraud case in U.S. history.\" Disgracefully, Karol Sikora, a former oncologist at the Hammersmith Hospital, supported CPR on US television. See [Karol Sikora makes a fool of himself](http://nhsblogdoc.blogspot.com/2009/05/karol-sikora-makes-fool-of-himself.html) at NHSblogdoctor. I quote \"Karol Sikora had been duped by a slick American businessman into providing a \"rent-a-quote\" service for a notorious right-wing American organisation\" This post was reproduced on the US site, [ Trusted.MD](http://trusted.md/feed/items/system/2009/05/14/karol_sikora_makes_a_fool_of_himself) Sikora now works for the UK's only private university and a private cancer treatment company. He is also famous for [claiming, falsely,](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/may/22/karol-sikora-honorary-professor-imperial-college) to be a professor at Imperial College (he has an honorary contract with the Imperial College Hospital Trust but nothing with the University). And for promoting a load of nonsense about alternative medicine (a lot more on that coming up shortly). This is why love the NHS Europe as a whole gets better health care for less money than in the USA. The fact that every US doctor has a financial interest in ordering expensive treatments whether they are needed or not, is an obscenity. The fact that over 40 million Americans have no insurance is an obscenity (see [The brutal truth about America's healthcare](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-brutal-truth-about-americarsquos-healthcare-1772580.html)). Just look at the numbers (Source: WHO/OECD Health Data 2009) Health spending as a share of GDP. US 16% UK 8.4% Public spending on healthcare (% of total spending on healthcare) US 45% UK 82% Health spending per head US $7,290 UK $2,992 Practising physicians (per 1,000 people) US 2.4 UK 2.5 Nurses (per 1,000 people) US 10.6 UK 10.0 Acute care hospital beds (per 1,000 people) US 2.7 UK 2.6 Life expectancy: US 78 UK 80 Infant mortality (per 1,000 live births) US 6.7 UK 4.8 My experience Yes I know this is anecdote, but it matters a lot to me. I already posted a [version of this story](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=645#uclh), but this seems like the time to repeat it. On December 13th 1984, my wife had a subarachnoid haemorrhage when she was seven months pregnant. After an initial misdiagnosis by an obstetrician at St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey, she was moved to UCH and diagnosed very quickly. The next morning I was called to see the neurourgeon, the great Alan Crockard. He was sitting surrounded by medical students some of whom I'd taught the previous year. He told me my wife had had a subarachnoid haemorrhage (at 33!) and they would operate straight away. And \"I have to ask you, if we can save only the mother or the baby, which shall it be\". It's as well to write that down because even 24 years later I can't say it without a lump rising in my throat. That same day she had neurosurgery to pin an aneurysm at the Maida Vale Neurosurgical Hospital, part of the UCLH group (it no longer exists). The surgeon, Alan Crockard, came out of theatre after five hours, looking rather tired and said \"it was adhered to the optic chiasma on one side and about a millimetre from the pituitary on the other. It was a bit tricky but I think we got it\". Obstetricians were in theatre too because all this was done with the baby still in situ |After a week in intensive care, under heavy sedation, Margaret's blood pressure was not low enough and they decided to deliver the baby. At about 4 pm on a snowy Christmas Eve, a team of neurosurgeons and a team of obstetricians gathered and soon after, Andrew Stuart Colquhoun emerged in a small incubator to be whisked off in an ambulance to the Special Care Baby Unit at UCH (run, at that time, by | Andrew (at 9 days) and Dad. Jan 2, 1985. Click for album. Once Margaret was well enough, she was given a side room in a neurosurgical ward with a cot for Andrew by her bed, an arrangement that gave the neurosurgical nurses some fun. They were in UCLH continuously until 27th April before Margaret had recovered enough to go home, [ [Full photo album here](http://www.dcscience.net/ac-birth/index.html)] Now they are both fine.and [Andrew is 6 7 (200.5 cm)](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/dc-bits/andrew.html).. It is episodes like this that make one very proud of the NHS. She and Andrew were in hospital continuously for more than four months. Not a penny changed hands. Heaven knows what it would have cost in the USA, or even of insurance would have covered such a gargantuan bill. | | Margaret & Andrew, with carer, Anna, June 2, 1985 | | Andrew (left) playing cricket in Bangladesh, Feb 2005. My own experience is trivial compared with that of Margaret and Andrew, but it has been as near perfect as anyone could wish. I had a lumbar spinal fusion (L3 - L4) in 1995, after several attempts at less drastic solutions. I've had two artificial hips. They allowed me to walk across the Alps for my 65th birthday. Then a few trivial things like bilateral hernia and DVT (I had been scanned and was on anticoagulant therapy within 4 hours of walking into UCLH's Accident and Emergency). And now it looks as though I'll be getting a partial or total nephrectomy too. And not a penny has changed hands. The NHS is a beautiful thing. OK it has has the usual excessive number of managers and HR-bollocks, like most big companies. It isn't perfect but it is a great deal closer to perfection than the US system. | | Approaching Seescharte (2600 m) at 08.20, 21 August 2001. Memminger H\u00fctte visible below.

In [ The Swiss Menace](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/17/opinion/17krugman.html?_r=2) he points out that Obama's scheme is nothing like the NHS anyway, but more like that in Switzerland. \"The plans on the table would, roughly speaking, turn America into Switzerland \u2014 which may be occupied by lederhosen-wearing holey-cheese eaters, but wasn't a socialist hellhole the last time I looked.\" \"In Britain, the government itself runs the hospitals and employs the doctors. We've all heard scare stories about how that works in practice; these stories are false.\" \"So we can do this. At this point, all that stands in the way of universal health care in America are the greed of the medical-industrial complex, the lies of the right-wing propaganda machine, and the gullibility of voters who believe those lies.\" Comparing US and UK cancer statistics . As Ben Goldacre says, \"I think you'll find it's a bit more complicated than that\". There's an interesting analysis at [Cancer Research UK](http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2009/08/17/we-need-to-be-careful-when-comparing-us-and-uk-cancer-care/) The [US uses the PSA blood test far more widely]than we do in the UK - despite questions over how effective it is at spotting cancers that would actually kill, as opposed to those that cause no symptoms. As a result, the USA has one of the [highest recorded rates]of prostate cancer in the world. So although it's undoubtedly 'better' at spotting prostate cancers, it's also fair to say that some of these Americans will never die from their disease. This ' [overdiagnosis]' inflates the survival statistics, at the expense of ' [overtreating]' men - which is [expensive]and can cause long-term side effects (which can need further treatment). In fact the age-standardised death rates per 100,000 people are almost the same in the UK (all races) when compared with the USA (whites only). What is different is that far more cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed in the USA. If the rate of 'real' (potentially fatal) prostate cancer were similar in both countries then both countries have much the same success in treating it, If, on the other hand, US men had a genuinely higher incidence of real prostate cancer, the US would be doing better, There is no way to distinguish between these two interpretations, This post has been [translated into Belorussian](http://onlinepharmacycheck.com/~doc/cnmed-be).. Chinese medicine and herbal medicine are i [n the news at the moment](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2007). There is a real risk that the government could endorse them by accepting [ the Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235). In my view traditional Chinese medicine endangers people. The proposed 'regulation' would do nothing to protect the public. Quite on the contrary, it would add to the dangers, by giving an official stamp of approval while doing nothing for safety. The government's idea of improving safety is to make sure that practitioners are 'properly trained'. But it is the qualifications that cause the danger in the first place. The courses teach ideas that are plain wrong and often really dangerous. Why have government (and some universities) not noticed this? That's easy to see. Governments, quangos and university validation committees simply don't look. They tick boxes but never ask what actually goes on. Here's some examples of what goes on for them to think about. They show clearly the sort of dangerous rubbish that is taught on some of these 'degrees'. These particular slides are from the University of Westminster, but similar courses exist in only too many other places. Watch this space for more details on courses at Edinburgh Napier University, Middlesex University and the University of East London Just a lot of old myths. Sheer gobbledygook, SO much for a couple of centuries of physiology, It gets worse. Plain wrong. Curious indeed. The fantasy gobbledygook gets worse. Now it is getting utterly silly. Teaching students that the brain is made of marrow is not just absurd, but desperately dangerous for anyone unlucky (or stupid) enough to go to such a person when they are ill. Here's another herbal lecture., and this time the topic is serious. Cancer. Herbal approaches for patients with cancer. I've removed the name of the teacher to spare her the acute embarrassment of having these dangerous fantasies revealed. The fact that she probably believes them is not a sufficient excuse for endangering the public. There is certainly no excuse for the university allowing this stuff to be taught as part of a BSc (Hons). First get them scared with some bad statistics. No fuss there about distinguishing incidence, age-standardisation and death rates. And no reference. Perhaps a reference to the simple explanation of [statistics at Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=153) might help? Perhaps this slide would have been better ( [from CDC](#)). Seems there is some mistake in slide 2. Straight on to a truly disgraceful statement in slide 3 The is outrageous and very possibly illegal under the Cancer Act (1939). It certainly poses a huge danger to patients. It is a direct incentive to make illegal, and untrue claims by using weasel words in an attempt to stay just on the right side of the law. But that, of course, is standard practice in alternative medicine, Slide 11 is mostly meaningless. \"Strengthen vitality\" sounds good but means nothing. And \"enhancing the immune system\" is what alternative medicine folks always say when they can think of nothing else. Its meaning is ill-defined and there is no reason to think that any herbs do it. The idea of a 'tonic' was actually quite common in real medicine in the 1950s. The term slowly vanished as it was realised that it was a figment of the imagination. In the fantasy world of alternative medicine, it lives on. Detoxification, a marketing term not a medical one, has been extensively debunked quite recently. The use of the word by The [Prince of Wales' company](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=920), Duchy Originals recently [fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/05/there-goes-my-knighthood.html), and his herbal 'remedies' were [ zapped by the MHRA (](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8035072.stm)Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority). And of course the [ antioxidant myth](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=90) is a long-disproved hypothesis that has become a mere marketing term. \"Inhibits the recurrence of cancer\"! That sounds terrific. But if it is so good why is it not even mentioned in the two main resources for information about herbs? In the UK we have the National Library for Health Complementary and Alternative Medicine Specialist Library (NeLCAM), now a [part of NHS Evidence. It ](http://www.library.nhs.uk/cam/) was [launched in 2006](http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/News/2006/May/NeLCAM+launch+-+NHS+Complementary+Medicine+website+goes+live.htm). The clinical lead was none other than [Peter Fisher](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Peter+Fisher%22), clinical director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, and the Queen's homeopathic physician. The library was developed with the School of Integrated Health at the [University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22University+of+Westminster%22) (where this particular slide was shown to undergraduates). Nobody could accuse these people of being hostile to magic medicine, It seems odd, then, that NeLCAM does not seem to thnk to think that Centella asiatica, is even worth mentioning. In the USA we have the National Center for Alternative and Complementary Medicine (NCCAM), an organisation that is so friendly to alternative medicine that it has spent a billion dollars on research in the area, though it has produced not a single good treatment for that vast expenditure. But NCCAM too does not even mention Centella asiatica in [its herb list](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm). It does get a mention in [Cochrane reviews](http://search.cochrane.org/search?q=centella&restrict=cochrane_org&scso_colloquia_abstracts=colloquia_abstracts&client=my_collection&scso_evidence_aid=evidence_aid&scso_review_abstracts=review_abstracts&lr=&output=xml_no_dtd&sub_site_name=Cochrane_Reviews_search&filter=0&site=my_collection&ie=&oe=&scso_registered_titles=registered_titles&scso_newsletters=newsletters&scso_cochrane_org=this_site&proxystylesheet=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2Fsearch%2Fgoogle_mini_xsl%2Fcochrane_org.xsl&btnG=Search) but only as a cosmetic cream and as an unproven treatment for poor venous circulation in the legs. What on earth is a \"lymph remedy\". Just another marketing term? \"especially valuable in the treatment of breast, throat and uterus cancer.\" That is a very dramatic claim. It as as though the hapless students were being tutored in doublespeak. What is meant by \"especially valuable in the treatment of\"? Clearly a desperate patient would interpret those words as meaning that there was at least a chance of a cure. That would be a wicked deception because there isn't the slightest reason to think it works. Once again there this wondrous cure is not even mentioned in either NELCAM or NCCAM. Phytolacca is mentioned, as Pokeweed, in Wikipedia but no claims are mentioned even there. And it isn't mentioned in Cochrane reviews either. The dramatic claims are utterly unfounded. Ah the mistletoe story, again. NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) lists [ three completed assessments](http://search.cochrane.org/search?q=centella&restrict=cochrane_org&scso_colloquia_abstracts=colloquia_abstracts&client=my_collection&scso_evidence_aid=evidence_aid&scso_review_abstracts=review_abstracts&lr=&output=xml_no_dtd&sub_site_name=Cochrane_Reviews_search&filter=0&site=my_collection&ie=&oe=&scso_registered_titles=registered_titles&scso_newsletters=newsletters&scso_cochrane_org=this_site&proxystylesheet=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2Fsearch%2Fgoogle_mini_xsl%2Fcochrane_org.xsl&btnG=Search). One concludes that more research is needed. Another concludes that \"Rigorous trials of mistletoe extracts fail to demonstrate efficacy of this therapy\", and the third says \"The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak\". NCCAM [says of mistletoe](http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/pdq/cam/mistletoe) - More than 30 human studies using mistletoe to treat cancer have been done since the early 1960s, but major weaknesses in many of these have raised doubts about their findings (see [Question 6](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/21.cdr#Section_21)). - Very few bad side effects have been reported from the use of mistletoe extract, though mistletoe plants and berries are poisonous to humans (see [Question 7](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/25.cdr#Section_25)). - The [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&version=Patient&language=English)(FDA) has not approved mistletoe as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition (see [Question 8](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/28.cdr#Section_28)). - The FDA does not allow injectable mistletoe to be imported, sold, or used except for [clinical](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&version=Patient&language=English)research (see [Question 8](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/28.cdr#Section_28)). Cochrane reviews lists conclusions. [For example](http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003297.html) \"The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak\". Anthroposophy is one of the highest grades of fantasy you can find. A post on that topic is in the works. \"Indicated for cancers . . . colon/rectal, uterine, breast, lung\". A cure for lung cancer? That, of course, depends on how you interpret the weasel words \"indicated for\". Even [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuja_occidentalis) makes no mention of any claims that Thuja benefits cancer. NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) doesn't mention Thuja for any indication. Neither does NCCAM. Nor Cochrane reviews. That is not the impression the hapless students of this BSc lecture were given. In my view suggestions that you can cure lung cancer with this tree are just plain wicked. Pure snake oil, and not even spelled correctly, Harry Hoxsey's treatment centres in the USA were closed by court order in the 1950s. At least this time it is stated that there is no hard evidence to support this brand of snake oil. More unfounded claims when it says \"treated successfully many cancer patients\". No references and no data to support the claim. It is utterly unfounded and claims to the contrary endanger the public. Gerson therapy is one of the most notorious and unpleasant of the quack cancer treatments. The Gerson Institute is on San Diego, but their clinics are in Mexico and Hungary. It is illegal in the USA. According to the [American Cancer Society](http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3x_Gerson_therapy.asp) you get \"a strict low-salt, low-fat, vegetarian diet and drinking juice from about twenty pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables each day. One glass of juice is consumed each hour, thirteen times a day. In addition, patients are given several coffee enemas each day. Various supplements, such as potassium, vitamin B12, pancreatic enzymes, thyroid hormone, and liver extracts, are used to stimulate organ function, particularly of the liver and thyroid.\". At one time you also got several glasses of raw calf liver every day but after infections killed several people []](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Gerson#cite_note-mmwr-6) carrot juice was given instead. [Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=21853) says \"there is no evidence to show that Gerson therapy works as a cure for cancer\", and \"The Gerson diet can cause some very serious side effects.\" Nobody (except perhaps the Price of Wales) has any belief in this unpleasant, toxic and expensive folk-lore. Again patients are endangered by teaching this sort of stuff. And finally, the usual swipe at vaccines. It's nothing to do with herbalism. but just about every alternative medicine advocate seems to subscribe to the anti-vaccination lobby.. It is almost as though they have an active preference for things that are known to be wrong. They seem to believe that medicine and science are part of an enormous conspiracy to kill everyone. Perhaps this dangerous propaganda might have been ameliorated if the students had been shown this slide ( [from a talk by Melinda Wharton](http://www.cga.ct.gov/coc/PDFs/immunization/wharton_ppt.pdf)). Left to people like this, we would still have smallpox, diphtheria. tetanus and rabies, Take a look at [Vaccine-preventable diseases](http://wolfsden.wordpress.com/2008/08/27/vaccine-preventable-diseases/). This is the sort of 'education' which the Pittilo report wants to make compulsory. [Smallpox in Baltimore,](http://www.williams.edu/resources/chapin/exhibits/disturbing1.html) USA, 1939. This man was not vaccinated. Conclusion This selection of slides shows that much of the stuff taught in degrees in herbal medicine poses a real danger to public safety and to public health. Pittilo's idea that imposing this sort of miseducation will help safety is obviously and dangerously wrong. The Department of Health must reject the Pittilo recommendations on those grounds. Follow-up The much-delayed public [consultation on the Pittilo report](http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations/Liveconsultations/DH_103567) has just opened.

It is now over a year since the Report to Ministers from \"The Department of Health Steering Group on the Statutory Regulation of Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Other Traditional Medicine Systems Practised in the UK\" [ [download the report](http://dcscience.net/acupunc-steering-group-2008.pdf)]. The chair of the steering group was Professor R. Michael Pittilo, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of The Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen. The reason thet the report is so disastrously bad in its assessment of evidence is that it was written entirely by people with vested interests. The committee consisted of five acupuncturists, five herbalists and five representatives of traditional Chinese medicine (plus eleven observers). There was not a single scientist or statistician to help in the assessment of evidence. And it shows: The assessment of the evidence in the report was execrable. Every one of the committee members would have found themselves out of work if they had come to any conclusion other than that their treatment works, Disgracefully, these interests were not declared in the report, though they are not hard to find. The university of which the chair is vice-chancellor runs a [course in homeopathy](http://www.rgu.ac.uk/nursing/courses/page.cfm?pge=34374), the most discredited of the popular forms of alternative medicine. That tells you all you need to know about the critical faculties of Michael Pittilo. The two main recommendations of this Pittilo report are that - Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine should be subject to statutory regulation by the Health Professions Council - Entry to the register normally be through a Bachelor degree with Honours Let's consider the virtue of these two recommendations. Regulation by the Health Professions Council (HPC) breaks their own rules For a start, this should be ruled out by the HPC's own rules, which require \" [Practise based on evidence of efficacy](http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/newprofessions/criteria/)\" as a condition for registration. Since there is practically no \"evidence of efficacy\", it follows that the HPC can't regulate acupuncture, herbal and Chinese medicine as Pittilo recommends. Or so you'd think. But the official mind seems to have an infinite capacity for doublespeak. The HPC published a report on 11 September 2008, [Regulation of Medical Herbalists, Acupuncturists and Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners](http://www.hpc-uk.org/assets/documents/100023FEcouncil_20080911_enclosure07.pdf). The report says 1. Medical herbalists, acupuncturists and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners should be statutorily regulated in the public interest and for public safety reasons. 2. The Health Professions Council is appropriate as the regulator for these professions. 3. The accepted evidence of efficacy overall for these professions is limited, but regulation should proceed because it is in the public interest. In other words, the [HPC simply decided to ignore its own rules](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1284), Its excuse for doing so is that regulation would protect \"public safety\" . But it simply would not do that. It is ell known that some Chinese herbs are adulterated with dangerous substances, but laws against that already exist. Trading Standards are much more likely to take appropriate action than the HPC. The Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) already deals with the licensing of herbal medicines. and, despite the fact that it recently betrayed its trust by allowing them to be labelled in a misleading way, they are the people to do it, not the HPC. The [Pittilo report](http://dcscience.net/acupunc-steering-group-2008.pdf) (page 11) says In future, it is hoped that more Government funding can be allocated to research into traditional/herbal medicines and acupuncture and that grants will become available to encourage practitioners to undertake postgraduate research work. So they are asking for more government money. In March 2007, the Chinese Government pledged to spend over $130 million over the next five years on research into the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine. It is to be hoped that this money will be targeted effectively to evaluate TCM. It seems to have escaped the notice of Pittilo that roughly 100 percent of trials of Chinese medicine done in China come out positive. Elsewhere, very few come out positive,(see Vickers et al., 1998, Controlled Clinical Trials, 19, 159-166: [download reprint](/Vickers_1998_Controlled-Clinical-Trials.pdf)) The Department of Health would be unwise to rely on Chinese research. Remember that modern acupuncture was not so much a product of ancient wisdom, but rather it stems from nationalist propaganda by Mao Tse-Tung, who needed a cheap way to keep the peasants quiet, though he was too sensible to use it himself. The [HPC report](http://www.hpc-uk.org/assets/documents/100023FEcouncil_20080911_enclosure07.pdf) (page 5) cites these with the words \" . . . a lack of evidence of efficacy should not prevent regulation but that the professions should be encouraged and funded to strengthen the evidence base.\" This sentence seems to assume that the outcomes of research will be to strengthen the evidence base. Thus far, precisely the opposite has been the case. The Pittilo group has apparently not noticed that the US National Institutes of Health has already spent a billion dollars on research in alternative medicine and failed to come up with a single effective treatment. There are better ways to spend money on health. See, for example [$2.5B Spent, No Alternative Med Cures found. ](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=7804031).An enornous amount of research has already been done and the outcomes have produced no good treatments, The proposed regulation would endanger the public, not protect it. The excuse given by the HPC for breaking its own rules is that it should do so to protect the public. Likewise [Ann Keen, Health Minister, said](http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/News/Recentstories/DH_103585): \"Patient safety is paramount, whether people are accessing orthodox health service treatments or using alternative treatments\" So first we need to identify what dangers are posed by acupuncture, herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. - Acupuncture is fairly safe. Its biggest danger lies in the unjustified claims that are routinely made for what can be achieved by being impaled by needles. This poses a danger that people may use acupuncture in place of treatments that work - Herbal medicines are unstandardised, so even the very few that may work are dangerous to patients because the dose of active principle is unknown and varies from one batch to another. Taking a herbal medicine is a bit like swallowing a random number of tablets, False health claims pose a danger to patients too, when they cause patients to avoid treatments that work. - Traditional Chinese Medicine is probably the most dangerous. Like the other two, the medicines are unstandardised so the dose is never known. False health claims abound. And in addition to these dangers, many cases have been found of Chinese medicines being adulterated with poisonous substances or with conventional drugs. The form of regulation proposed by Pittilo would do little or nothing to protect the public from any of these dangers. The proposals accept the herbal and Chinese medicine as traditionally practised. Nothing would be done about one of the major dangers, [ the lack of standardisation](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=205). That is a problem that was solved by pharmacologists in the 1930s, when international standards were set for the biological activity of things like tincture of digitalis, and assays were devised so that different batches could be adjusted to the same potency. Now, 80 years later, it is being proposed by Pittilo that we should return to the standards of safety that existed at the beginning of the last century. That is a threat to public safety., but the proposed regulation would do nothing whatsoever to protect the public from this dangerous practice. On the contrary, it would give official government sanction to it. The other major danger is that patients are deceived by false health claims. This is dangerous (as well as dishonest) because it can cause patients to avoid treatments that work better, The internet abounds with claims that herbs can cure anything from diabetes to cancer. Many are doubtless illegal, but regulators like the HPC have traditionally ignored such claims: they are left to Trading Standards, Advertising Standards and the Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) to deal with. The MHRA already also has responsibility for monitoring side effects. The HPC would not do this. The analogy with chiropractic and the GCC The foolishness of allowing statutory regulation for unproven treatments has recently been illustrated quite dramatically by the case of chiropractic. Chiropractors have had statutory regulation by the General Chiropractic Council, which was established by the Chiropractors Act of 1994. The [ British Chiropractic Association (BCA)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1775) recently decided to sue the science writer, Simon Singh, for defamation when he cast doubt on some of the claims made by chiropractors, in particular their claims to be able to cure colic and asthma in children. That led to close examination of the claims. In fact there is no reason to think that spinal manipulation w [orks for asthma](/ernst-chiro-asthma.pdf), or that it works [for colic](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1775). In fact there is quite good evidence that the claims are false. The result was that about 600 well-justified complaints have been lodged with the GCC (enough to bankrupt the GCC if the complaints are dealt with properly). The point of this story is that the statutory regulator had nothing whatsoever to prevent these false health claims being made. Two of the complaints concern practices run by the chair of the GCC. Worse, the GCC actually endorsed such claims. The statutory regulator saw its duty to defend chiropractic (apart from a handful of cases of sexual misdemeanours), not to protect the patient from false health claims. The respectability conferred by statutory regulation made false health claims easier and endangered the public. It would be a disaster if the same mistake were made again. On 11th December 2008 I got a letter form the HPC which said in our opinion a lack of evidence of efficacy would not impede our ability to set standards or deal with complaints we receive. The vast majority of cases we consider are related to conduct. But perhaps that is because they haven't tried \"regulating\" quacks before. Now that the public is far more conscious about health fraud than it used to be, one can predict confidently that the HPC would be similarly overwhelmed by a deluge of complaints about the unjustified health claims made by acupuncturists, herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. There is no shortage of them to complain about. The education problem The Pittilo report recommends that the entry level for registration should be a bachelors degree with honours. At first sight it seems reasonable to ask that practitioners should be 'properly qualified', but when one looks at what is actually taught on these degrees it becomes clear that they endanger, rather than protect, the public, There are two very big problems with this recommendation. Firstly, you can't have a bachelors degree with honours until after you have decided whether or not there is anything useful to teach. If and when any of the subjects under consideration and shown to work to a useful extent, then it would be quite reasonable to establish degrees in them. Even the report does not pretend seriously that that stage has been reached. The proposal to set up degrees in subjects, at least some of which are quite likely to have no more than placebo value, is self-evidently nonsense, The time for degrees, and the time for government endorsement by statutory regulation, is after the therapies have been shown to work, not before. The absurdity of thinking that the public will be protected because a practitioner has a degree in, say, acupuncture, is shown with startling clarity by a [recently revealed examination paper](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1950) in acupuncture' You can [download the entire exam paper](http://www.dcscience.net/SalfordChineseMedicine.pdf). Here are a few highlights from it. So students, in 2009, are being taught the crudest form of vitalism. Teaching of traditional Chinese medicine is just as bad. Here are two slides from a course run by the University of Westminster. The first 'explains' the mysterious and entirly mythical \"Qi\". So \"Qi\" means breath, air, vapour, gas, energy, vitalism. This is meaningless nonsense. The second slide shows the real dangers posed by the way Chinese medicine is taught, The symptoms listed at the top could easily be a clue to serious illness, yat students are taught to treat them with ginger. Degrees like this endanger the public. There are more mind-boggling slides from lectures on [Chinese medicine and cancer](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043): they show that what students are being taught is terrifyingly dangerous to patients. It is entirely unacceptable that students are being taught these ancient myths as though they were true, and being encouraged to treat sick people on their basis. The effect of the Pittilo recommendations would be to force new generations of students to have this sort of thing forced on them. In fact the course for which this exam was set has already closed its doors. That is the right thing to do. Here's another example. The course leader for \"BSc (Hons) Herbal Medicine\" at the [Graeme Tobyn BA](https://www.uclan.ac.uk/health/schools/school_of_nursing/divisions/graeme_tobyn_profile.php). But Tobyn is not only a herbalist but also an astrologer. In an [interview he said](http://www.skyscript.co.uk/tobyn.html) \"At the end I asked her if I could cast her horoscope. She threw up her hands and said, 'I knew this would happen if I came to an alternative practitioner.\" \"I think the ruler of the ascendant was applying to Uranus in the ninth house, which was very pertinent.\" This would be preposterous even in the life style section of a downmarket women's magazine, The Pittilo report wants to make degrees run my people like this compulsory. Luckily the Univerity of Central Lancashire is much more sensible and the [course is being closed.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899) The matter is, in any case, being taken out of the hands of the government by the fact that universities are closing degrees in complementary medicine, including courses in some of those under discussion here, The [University of Salford](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885) and the [University of Central Lancashire](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899) have recently announced the closure of all the degree programmes in complementary and alternative medicine. The largest provider of such degrees, the [University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329) has already shut down two of them, and the rest are being assessed at the moment. It is likely that the rest will be closed in the future. The revelation that Westminster had been teaching its first year students that \" [amethysts emit high yin energy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=227)\" and that students had been taught to [diagnose disease and choose treatments by means of a dowsing pendulum](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812), showed very clearly the sort of utter nonsense that undergraduates were being forced to learn to get a 'bachelors degree with honours'. It stretches credulity to its limits to imagine that the public is protected by degrees like this. Precisely the opposite is true. The universities have recognised this, and shut the degrees. One exception is Professor Pittilo's own university which continues to run a [course in homeopathy](http://www.rgu.ac.uk/nursing/courses/page.cfm?pge=34374), the most discredited of all the popular types alternative medicine. A simpler, more effective and cheaper way to protect the public I must certainly agree with the minister that protection of the public is an important matter. Having established that the Pittllo recommendations are more likely to endanger the public than protect them, it is essential to suggest alternative proposals that would work better. Luckily, that is easy, because mechanisms already exist for dealing with the dangers that were listed above. The matter of adulteration, which is serious in traditional Chinese medicine, is a matter that is already the responsibility of the Office of Trading Standards. The major problem of false claims being made for treatment is also the responsibility of the Office of Trading Standards, which has a statutory duty to enforce the Unfair Trading Consumer Protection Regulations of May 2008. [These laws state, for example, that](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=790) \"One of the 31 commercial practices which are in all circumstances considered unfair is \"falsely claiming that a product is able to cure illnesses, dysfunction or malformations\" The monitoring of false claims, and of [side effects of treatments](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122525561/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0), is also the responsibility of the Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA). Rather than setting up complicated, expensive and ineffective 'regulation' by the HPC, all that need to be done is to ensure that the MHRA and/or Trading Standards have the funds to enforce existing laws. At the moment, they are not being implemented effectively, so I'd recommend that responsibility for enforcing the law against false health claims be transferred entirely to the MHRA, which has much more expertise in such matters than Trading Standards This would be both cheaper and more effective than the present system in which the responsibility is divided between the two organisations in an unclear way. This proposal would protect the public against unsafe and adulterated treatments, and it would protect the public against false and fraudulent claims. That is what matters. It would do so more effectively, more cheaply and more honestly than the Pittilo recommendations. There would be no reduction in patient choice either, There is no proposal to ban acupuncture, herbal medicine or traditional Chinese medicine. All that is necessary is to ensure that they don't endanger the public. Since the root of the problem lies in the fact that the evidence for the effectiveness is very weak. the question of efficacy, and cost-benefit ratio, should be referred to NICE. This was recommended by the House of Lords Report (2000). It is recommended again by the Smallwood report (sponsored by the Prince of Wales Foundation). It is baffling that this has not been done already. It does not seem wise to spend large amounts of money on new research at the moment, in the light of the fact that the US National Institutes of Health has already spent over $1 billion on such research without finding a single useful treatment. The results of all this research has been to show that hardly any alternative treatment are effective. That cannot be ignored. Conclusion Recent events show that the halcyon days for alternative medicine are over. When the Pittilo report first appeared, it was greeted with derision in the media. For example, in The Times [Alice Miles wrote](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/alice_miles/article4159652.ece) \"This week came the publication of the Report to Ministers from the Department of Health Steering Group on the Statutory Regulation of Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Other Traditional Medicine Systems Practised in the UK. Otherwise known as twaddle.\" In the Independent, [Dominic Lawson wrote](http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-so-now-we-will-have-degrees-in-quackery-852858.html) So now we will have degrees in quackery. What, really, is the difference between acupuncture and psychic surgery? People will no doubt continue to use it and that is their right and their responsibility. But if the government were to accept the recommendations of the Pittilo report it would be seen, quite rightly, as being anti-scientific and of posing a danger to the public. Fortunately there is a better, and cheaper, way to protect the public. Follow-up Margaret McCartney's blog [in the Financial Times](http://blogs.ft.com/healthblog/2009/08/05/the-force-and-consultation-on-the-pittilo-report-on-alternative-health-therapies/) puts rhw view of a GP with her usual sense, humour and incisiveness. \"This report would, if implemented, create lots more nonsense exam papers funded by a lot more public money - and would produce practitioners without the absolutely crucial skill of how to assess evidence and reject or use it appropriately\" The Times has covered the story (with some interesting comments) [Consultation on how to regulate complementary and alternative therapies](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/alternative_medicine/article6737965.ece) Times Higher Education [UK-wide consultation on CAM regulation is launched](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=407695&c=2) Excellent response from Andy Lewis.
