But the right to manufacture and sell drugs and medicines has to be given cautiously. Hence the government has stringent rules for granting licenses for the manufacturing and selling of drugs and medicine. The Act that governs the end to end process from manufacture to the sale of drugs in India is the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. Section 3(b) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act,1940 defines \"drug\" to include all medicines and devices for the use of human beings or animals internally or externally, and all substances planned to be used for or in the diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disorder or disease in animals or human beings, including preparations applied on the human body for the purpose of repelling insects like mosquitoes; it also includes all substances that can be used for the destruction of insects and all components of a drug - like empty gelatin capsules. The definition was amended in 1964, to include Ayurvedic and Unani Drugs. The access to medicines and drugs must be restricted and regulated to ensure that such goods are not abused or misused by individuals. Thus, all pharmacists, wholesalers, retailers, manufacturers, sellers, dealers and importers of drugs, cosmetics, ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani drugs have to mandatorily obtain drug license under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. The purpose of the drug license is to grant permission to allow enterprises or individuals to engage in businesses related to drugs and cosmetics. No enterprise or individual can operate a business dealing in drugs, medicines or cosmetics without obtaining a drug license in India.

The government also exercises control in the aspects related to import and export of medicines, sale of the drug to a minor, consumption of schedule H & X drugs, etc., that requires thorough monitoring and cautious execution.
