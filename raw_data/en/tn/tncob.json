Just as good nutrition and exercise benefit everyone, regardless of their age or condition, so does chiropractic. What is Chiropractic? Chiropractic is the science, art and philosophy of detecting and correcting the vertebral subluxation complex (VSC). What is VSC? VSC is a serious health condition in many people that develops from the cumulative effects of physical, chemical and/or emotional stress. These stresses overload and \"short circuit\" the nerve system by causing the vertebrae (bones of the spine) to subluxate (misalign) interfering with the delicate nerves that exit the spine. These nerves are responsible for sending vital messages that control and coordinate every cell, tissue, organ and system of the body. Wouldn't I feel it if I had VSC? Not necessarily. In many cases VSC is not felt until the problem progresses and serious damage has already occurred. What happens if VSC is not corrected? If VSC is not corrected, spinal decay begins and, over time, becomes more severe. It will become permanent and more difficult to correct the longer VSC is neglected. The quality and length of your life will decline as this condition worsens. How common is VSC? Although a common problem, VSC is not normal. Most people get their first VSC during the birth process, even when the delivery is normal and only standard procedures are used. According to Abraham Towbin, M.D. from Harvard Medical School, \"spinal cord and brainstem injuries often occur and frequently escape diagnosis\". Should I be checked for VSC? Your answers to the questions below can help determine if you should be checked for Vertebral Subluxation Complex by a Doctor of Chiropractic. 1. Have you experienced any physical, chemical and/or emotional stress in your life? __Yes__No 2. Are you interested in prevention and wellness? __Yes__No 3. Do you experience any pain/discomfort, during regular daily activities? __Yes__No 4. Do you have a lowered resistance to colds/flu or would like to get sick less often? __Yes__No 5. Do you take medications that give \"temporary relief of symptoms\", but have not fixed the problem? __Yes__No 6. Do you attribute these problems to just \"getting older\" or worry that in the future you won't be able to do the things you enjoy most? __Yes__No 7. Have you been told to or are you tired of \"living with it\"? __Yes__No 8. Would you like to experience less stress and discomfort, take less medications, while increasing your energy, performance, immune function and quality of life? __Yes__No 9. Were you born? __Yes__No 10. Is it true that your doctor has never evaluated your spine and nerve system for subluxations and interferences? __Yes__No If you or someone you care about answered \"yes\" to 5 or more of these questions, an appointment should be made with a Doctor of Chiropractic to determine if you have VSC and if chiropractic can help. How is VSC treated? Since VSC are misalignments of the spine affecting the nerves, the only way to correct them is to realign the spine through chiropractic adjustments. Consequently, if your condition/symptoms are caused or aggravated by VSC, the underlying cause (VSC) will need to be corrected for true healing to take place. There is no alternative. Many people spend years covering up the resultant symptoms with drugs without ever knowing or fixing the cause. They need stronger and stronger medications as time goes on, to cover the worsening symptoms as the underlying condition progresses. How safe are chiropractic adjustments? When performed by a Doctor of Chiropractic, adjustments, even on newborns, are over 5000 times safer than taking an aspirin, making chiropractic the safest of the healing professions. Chiropractors are the only professionals trained in the detection and correction of VSC. They have 4 years of post-graduate work specializing in training in this area. No other health practitioner is qualified to determine if chiropractic care is needed. Chiropractic Care Saves Money Miron Stando, Ph.D, Oakland University, conducted a study comparing the health care costs for chiropractic and medical patients. The database he used came from the records of MEDSTAT Systems, Inc., a health benefits management consulting firm, which processes insurance claims for many of the country's largest corporations. The database was comprised of 395,641 patients. After reviewing claims, patients who receive chiropractic care, either solely or in conjunction with medical care, experienced significantly lower health care costs. Specifically, total insurance payments were 30% higher for those who elected to have medical care only. The lower costs for chiropractic patients were attributed both to lower inpatient and outpatient costs. It also indicated that chiropractic treatment substitutes for other forms of outpatient care. What types of conditions can be helped with chiropractic? Although numerous research studies (for more information visit www.jvsr.com) have determined chiropractic is very effective for a variety of pain and symptoms. Chiropractic in its truest form does not treat symptoms or conditions. Chiropractic gets results by correcting subluxations. This will help any and all parts of the body function and heal better. Proper nerve function, which benefits everyone, is the goal of chiropractic care. The following are topics and just some of many problems that have responded well to chiropractic care. - Asthma - Bed-wetting - Blood Pressure - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome - Colic - Colds & Flu - Digestive Problems - Disc Problems & Back Surgery - Allergies - Arthritis - Ear infections - Fatigue - Fever - Headaches - Hip, Sacroiliac & Leg Problems - Hyperactivity & Learning Disorders - Immune Function - Infants & Babies - Low Back Pain - Menstrual Health & PMS - Mid-Back & Ribs - Migraines & Cluster Headaches - Neck Problems - Numbness & Tingling in Extremities - Pregnancy - Sciatica & Leg Pain - Shoulder, Arm & Hand Problems - Sinus Trouble - Sports - Stress - TMJ Problems Are you addressing the 4 essentials of health? What makes them essential is that you'll die without them. These basic physiological needs are food, water, oxygen and nerve function. Most people are aware of the first three, but don't realize there is a more important fourth, nerve function. What makes nerve function the most important of the essentials? Well, which one would cause you to die the fastest if it was taken away? Without food you can live a few weeks, without water a few days, without oxygen a few minutes and without nerve function you'll die instantly. If you are alive you have all four on some level, but it's the quality of each that will determine your level of health. If you eat a poor diet, drink a lot of alcohol and caffeine and smoke, they won't only adversely affect your health, they could over time, cause an untimely death. Having poor nerve function is no different.
