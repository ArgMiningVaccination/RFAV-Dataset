WHEREAS, pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act (Act) as amended, 42 U.S.C. secs. 7401 et seq., the Commonwealth of Kentucky is required to prepare and submit to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a state implementation plan and revisions to such plan as appropriate to attain and maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and protect human health; and WHEREAS, pursuant to KRS Chapter 224, the Cabinet is designated as the air pollution control agency of this Commonwealth for all purposes of the Act and within that organization is the Department for Environmental Protection Division for Air Quality; and WHEREAS, pursuant to KRS Chapter 77, the District is authorized to control air pollution in Jefferson County; and WHEREAS, the Kentucky Air Pollution Control Commission granted concurrent jurisdiction to the District on Januar y 26, 1971; and WHEREAS, the intent of the Cabinet and the District is to operate an effective air pollution control program in Jefferson County as authorized under KRS Chapters 77 and 224 through joint implementation of necessary control strategies; and WHEREAS, Governor Brereton Jones, through a letter dated September 29, 1993, opted into the federal reformulated gasoline requirements effective January 1, 1995; and WHEREAS, at that time, reformulated gasoline provided substantive environmental benefits o ver conventional gasoline when first imposed in the Louisville area; and WHEREAS, the federal EPA mandated improved quality in conventional gasoline beginning in 2011; and WHEREAS, consequently, the environmental benefits of reformulated gasoline compared to conventional gasoline no longer provide as significant of an environmental benefit as in the past; NOW, THEREFORE, Be it resolved by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky: Section 1. The Energy and Environment Cabinet and the Louisvill e Metro Air Pollution Control District shall coordinate together to conduct an analysis to: (1) Quantify the health and environmental benefits of the federal reformulated gasoline requirements; and CHAPTER 3 11 (2) Estimate the related costs associated with the federal reformulated gasoline requirements to identify cost-effective compensating emission reductions from other potential air pollution control strategies that are equivalent to, or greater than, the emission reductions achieved by federal reformulated gasoline requirements, and document that those emission reductions are quantifiable, permanent, surplus, and enforceable. Section 2. Pursuant to Section 110(l) of the Act, the Cabinet and District shall, upon a determination that equivalent, or greater, emissio n reductions from other sources are attainable and more cost -effective to offset the reformulated gasoline requirement, draft a revision to the applicable Kentucky state implementation plan to: (1) Remove the federal requirements for reformulated gasoline from Jefferson County and partial areas of Bullitt and Oldham Counties, effective 180 days from the date of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's approval of the revision to the state implementation plan; (2) Implement the air pollution contr ol strategies necessary to achieve equivalent, or greater, emission reductions than those achieved by federal reformulated gasoline requirements that are more cost -effective than what is incurred as a result of reformulated gasoline; (3) Ensure that the ai r pollution control strategies do not unnecessarily impede or limit economic development of new facilities and economic growth at existing facilities; and (4) Provide for reasonable notice and a public hearing for such draft. The state implementation plan revision shall not interfere with any applicable requirement concerning attainment of NAAQS and reasonable further progress, or any other applicable of Section 110 of the Act. Section 3. Once Sections 1. and 2. of this Resolution have occurred, the Gen eral Assembly requests the Governor to petition the federal EPA to opt -out of the federal reformulated gasoline requirements in Jefferson County and partial areas of Bullitt and Oldham Counties, in accordance with 40 CFR 80.72, provided alternative air pol lution control strategies, identified in the revision of the applicable Kentucky state implementation plan, can achieve equivalent, or greater, emission reductions that are more cost -effective than the existing reformulated gasoline requirement and that th e chosen strategies are able to attain and maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and protect human health.

(b) A \"qualified United States financial institution\" means, for purposes of those provisions of this section specifying those institutions that are eligible to act as a fiduciary of a trust, an institution that: 1. Is organized or, in the case of a United States branch or agency office of a foreign banking organiz ation, licensed under the laws of the United States or any state thereof and has been granted authority to operate with fiduciary powers; and 2. Is regulated, supervised, and examined by federal or state authorities having regulatory authority over banks a nd trust companies. (c) For purposes of subsection (3)(f)1. of this section, \"reciprocal jurisdiction\" means a jurisdiction that meets one (1) of the following: 1. A non -U.S. jurisdiction that is subject to an in -force covered agreement with the United Sta tes, each within its legal authority, or, in the case of a covered agreement between the United States and the European Union, is a member state of the European Union; 2. A U.S. jurisdiction that meets the requirements for accreditation under the NAIC's fi nancial standards and accreditation program; 3. A qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (3)(e)4. of this section, which is not otherwise described in this paragraph, and which meets certain additional requirements , consistent with the terms and conditions of in -force covered agreements, as specified by the commissioner in administrative regulation; or 4. Any other jurisdiction contained on the list of reciprocal jurisdictions published by the commissioner in accord ance with subsection (3)(g) of this section. (d) As used in this section :[, ] 1. \"Covered agreement\" means an agreement entered into pursuant to the Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 31 U.S.C. secs. 313 and 314, and that is current ly in effect or in a period of provisional application and addresses the elimination, under specified conditions, of collateral requirements as a condition for entering into any reinsurance agreement with the ceding insurer domiciled in this state or for a llowing the ceding insurer to recognize credit for reinsurance; and 2. \"NAIC\" means National Association of Insurance Commissioners. ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY 198 (2) (a) Credit for reinsurance shall be allowed a ceding insurer as either an asset or a deduction from liability on account of reinsurance ceded only when the reinsurer meets the requirements of: 1. Subsection (3)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), [or ](f), or (h) of this section; and 2. Paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this subsection. (b) The commissioner may promulgate adm inistrative regulations pursuant to subsection (8)(a)2. of this section that establish specific additional requirements relating to or setting forth: 1. The valuation of assets or reserve credits; 2. The amount and forms of security supporting reinsurance arrangements described in that subsection; and 3. The circumstances pursuant to which credit will be reduced or eliminated. (c) For reinsurers meeting the requirements of subsection (3)(c) of this section, the requirements of paragraph (i)[(g)] of that sub section shall also be met. (d) For reinsurers meeting the requirements of subsection (3)(d) of this section, the requirements of paragraphs (i)[(g)] and (j)[(h)] of that subsection shall also be met. (e) For reinsurers meeting the requirements of subsectio n (3)(e) of this section, the requirements of paragraph (j)[(h)] of that subsection shall also be met. (3) (a) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is authorized to transact insurance or reinsurance in Kentucky. (b) 1. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is accredited as a reinsurer in Kentucky. An accredited reinsurer is one which: a. Files with the commissioner evidence of its submission to Kentucky's jurisdiction; b. Submits to Kentucky's authority to examine its books and records; c. Is licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one (1) state, or in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, is entered through and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one (1) state; d. Files annually with the commissioner a copy of its annual statement filed with the insurance regulatory official of its state of domicile and a copy of its most recent audited financial statemen t; and e. Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commissioner that it has adequate financial capacity to meet its reinsurance obligations and is otherwise qualified to assume reinsurance from domestic insurers. An assuming insurer meets the requirements o f this subdivision at the time of its application if: i. It maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount that is not less than twenty million dollars ($20,000,000); and ii. Its accreditation has not been denied by the commissioner within ninet y (90) days after submission of its accreditation application. 2. Credit shall not be allowed a ceding insurer under this paragraph if the assuming insurer's accreditation has been revoked by the commissioner after notice and hearing. (c) Credit shall be a llowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is domiciled and licensed in or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, is entered through a state which employs standards regarding credit for reinsurance substa ntially similar to those applicable under this section and the assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien insurer: 1. Maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount not less than twenty million dollars ($20,000,000); and 2. Submits to the authority of the commissioner to examine its books and records. However, subparagraph 1. of this paragraph shall not apply to reinsurance ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system. CHAPTER 50 199 (d) 1. Cred it shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that maintains a trust in a qualified United States financial institution for the payment of valid claims of its United States policyholders and ceding insurers, their assigns, and su ccessors in interest. The assuming insurer shall report annually to the commissioner information substantially the same as that required to be reported on the NAIC annual statement form by authorized insurers to enable the commissioner to determine the suf ficiency of the trust. 2. a. In the case of a single assuming insurer, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account representing the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to business written in the United States and, in addition, except as provided in subdivision b. of this subparagraph, the assuming insurer shall maintain a trusteed surplus of not less than twenty million dollars ($20,000,000). b. At any time after the assuming insurer has permanently discontinued underwriting new business secured b y the trust for at least three (3) years, the commissioner may authorize a reduction in the trusteed surplus required by subdivision a. of this subparagraph, but only after a finding, based on an assessment of the risk, that the new required surplus level is adequate for the protection of United States ceding insurers, policyholders, and claimants in light of a reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development. The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and shall consider all material risk factors, including, when applicable, the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates, and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer's liquidity or solven cy. The minimum required trusteed surplus may not be reduced to an amount less than thirty percent (30%) of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers covered by the trust. 3. In the case of a grou p including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters: a. The trust shall consist of a trusteed account representing the respective underwriter's liabilities attributable to business written in the United States; b. The group shall maintain a trusteed surplus of which one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) shall be held jointly for the benefit of United States ceding insurers of any member of the group; c. The incorporated members of which group shall not be engaged in any business other t han underwriting as a member of the group and shall be subject to the same level of solvency regulation and control by the group's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members; and d. The group shall make available to the commissioner an annual certification of the solvency of each underwriter by the group's domiciliary insurance regulatory official and its independent public accountants. 4. In the case of a group of incorporated underwriters under common administration, the group shall: a. Compl y with the reporting requirements contained in subparagraph 1. of this paragraph; b. Have continuously transacted insurance business outside the United States for at least three (3) years immediately prior to making an application for accreditation; c. Maintain a trust in an amount not less than the group's several liabilities attributable to business ceded by United States ceding insurers to any member of the group pursuant to reinsurance contracts issued in the name of the group; d. Maintain an aggregate policyholders' surplus of at least ten billion dollars ($10,000,000,000); e. Maintain a joint trusteed surplus of which one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) shall be held jointly for the benefit of United States ceding insurers of any member of the group; and ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY 200 f. Each member of the group shall make available to the commissioner an annual certification of the member's solvency by the member's domiciliary insurance regulatory official and its independent public accountant. 5. The trust shall be establis hed in a form approved by the commissioner. The trust instrument shall provide that contested claims shall be valid and enforceable upon the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. The trust shall vest legal title to its as sets in the trustees of the trust for its United States policyholders and ceding insurers, their assigns, and successors in interest. The trust and the assuming insurer shall be subject to examination as determined by the commissioner. The trust shall rema in in effect for as long as the assuming insurer shall have outstanding obligations due under the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust. 6. No later than February 28 of each year, the trustees of the trust shall report to the commissioner in writing setting forth the balance of the trust and listing the trust's investments at the preceding year end and shall certify the date of termination of the trust, if so planned, or certify that the trust shall not expire prior to the next following December 31. (e) 1. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that: a. Has been certified by the commissioner as a reinsurer in this state; and b. Secures its obligations in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph. 2. In or der to be eligible for certification, the assuming insurer shall: a. Be domiciled and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in a qualified jurisdiction, as determined by subparagraph 4. of this paragraph; b. Maintain minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, in an amount to be determined by the commissioner by administrative regulation; c. Maintain financial strength ratings from two (2) or more rating agencies deemed acceptable by the commissioner by administrative regulation; d. Agree to sub mit to the jurisdiction of this state, appoint the commissioner as its agent for service of process in this state, and agree to provide security for one hundred percent (100%) of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by Unite d States ceding insurers if the assuming insurer resists enforcement of a final United States judgment; e. Agree to meet applicable information filing requirements as determined by the commissioner, both with respect to an initial application for certifica tion and on an ongoing basis; and f. Satisfy any other relevant requirements for certification as determined by the commissioner. 3. An association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, may be certified as a reinsurer in this state if the association satisfies the requirements of subparagraph 2. of this paragraph and: a. The association satisfies its minimum capital and surplus requirements through the capital and surplus equivalents (net of liabilities) of the association and its members, which shall include a joint central fund that may be applied to any unsatisfied obligation of the association or any of its members, in an amount determined by the commissioner to provide adequate protection; b. The incorporated members of the association are not engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the association and are subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the association's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members; and c. The association provides the commissioner an annual certification by the association's domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member within ninety (90) days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the association's domicili ary CHAPTER 50 201 regulator, or if a certification is unavailable, financial statements, prepared by independent public accountants, of each underwriter member of the association. 4. a. The commissioner shall create and publish a list of qualified jurisdictions under wh ich an assuming insurer licensed and domiciled in the qualified jurisdiction is eligible to be considered for certification by the commissioner as a certified reinsurer. b. In order to determine whether the domiciliary jurisdiction of an assuming insurer f rom a jurisdiction outside of the United States is eligible to be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction, the commissioner shall evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the reinsurance supervisory system of the jurisdiction outside of the United States, both initially and on an ongoing basis, and consider the rights, benefits, and the extent of reciprocal recognition afforded by the jurisdiction outside of the United States to reinsurers licensed and domiciled in the United States. A qualified jur isdiction shall agree to share information and cooperate with the commissioner with respect to all certified reinsurers domiciled within that jurisdiction. A jurisdiction may not be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction if the commissioner has determined that the jurisdiction does not adequately and promptly enforce final United States judgments and arbitration awards. Additional factors may be considered in the discretion of the commissioner. c. The commissioner shall consider the list of qualified jurisd ictions published through the NAIC's committee process when determining qualified jurisdictions. If the commissioner approves a jurisdiction as qualified that does not appear on the list, the commissioner shall provide justification in accordance with crit eria to be developed by the commissioner by administrative regulation. d. Jurisdictions within the United States that meet the requirements for accreditation under the NAIC's financial standards and accreditation program shall be recognized as qualified. e. If a certified reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction ceases to be a qualified jurisdiction, the commissioner may revoke or suspend the reinsurer's certification indefinitely, in lieu of revocation. 5. The commissioner shall assign a rating to each certifi ed reinsurer, giving due consideration to the financial strength ratings that have been assigned by rating agencies deemed acceptable to the commissioner by administrative regulation. The commissioner shall publish a list of all certified reinsurers and th eir ratings. 6. a. A certified reinsurer shall secure obligations assumed from United States ceding insurers pursuant to this paragraph at a level consistent with its rating as specified by administrative regulation promulgated by the commissioner. b. In order for a domestic ceding insurer to qualify for full financial statement credit for reinsurance ceded to a certified reinsurer, the certified reinsurer shall maintain security in a form acceptable to the commissioner and consistent with subsection (4) of this section, or in a multibeneficiary trust in accordance with paragraph (d) of this subsection, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph. c. If a certified reinsurer maintains a trust to fully secure its obligations subject to paragraph (d) of thi s subsection, and chooses to secure its obligations incurred as a certified reinsurer in the form of a multibeneficiary trust, the certified reinsurer shall maintain separate trust accounts for: i. Its obligations incurred under reinsurance agreements issu ed or renewed as a certified reinsurer with reduced security as permitted by this paragraph or comparable laws of other United States jurisdictions; and ii. Its obligation subject to paragraph (d) of this subsection. d. The commissioner shall not grant a c ertification pursuant to this paragraph unless the certified reinsurer agrees to bind itself, by language of the trust and agreement with the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of each trust account, to fund, upon termination of any applicabl e trust account, out of the remaining surplus of the trust any deficiency of any other trust account. ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY 202 e. The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection are not applicable to a multibeneficiary trust maintained by a c ertified reinsurer for the purpose of securing obligations incurred pursuant to this paragraph, except that the multibeneficiary trust shall maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of ten million dollars ($10,000,000). f. With respect to obligations incurred b y a certified reinsurer pursuant to this paragraph, if the security is insufficient, the commissioner shall reduce the allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency, and the commissioner may impose further reductions in allowable credit upo n finding that there is a material risk that the certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full when due. g. i. For purposes of this paragraph, a certified reinsurer whose certification has been terminated for any reason shall be treated as a certified reinsurer required to secure one hundred percent (100%) of its obligations. ii. As used in this subdivision, \"terminated\" includes revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender, and inactive status, except if the commissioner continues to assign a higher rating as permitted by this subsection, a certified reinsurer in inactive status or reinsurer whose certification has been suspended shall not be considered \"terminated.\" 7. If an applicant for certification has been certified as a reinsurer in an N AIC-accredited jurisdiction, the commissioner may defer to that jurisdiction's certification and the rating assigned by that jurisdiction, and the reinsurer shall be considered a certified reinsurer in this state. 8. A certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this state may request to maintain its certification in inactive status in order to continue to qualify for a reduction in security for its in - force business. An inactive certified reinsurer shall continue to comply with all applicab le requirements of this subsection, and the commissioner shall assign a rating that takes into account, if relevant, the reasons why the reinsurer is not assuming new business. (f) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insure r if: 1. The assuming insurer has its head office in, or is domiciled in, as applicable, and is licensed in, a reciprocal jurisdiction; 2. The assuming insurer has and maintains, on an ongoing basis: a. For assuming insurers that are not associations: i. Minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, calculated according to the methodology of its domiciliary jurisdiction, in an amount to be set forth in administrative regulation; and ii. A minimum solvency or capital ratio, as applicable, as set forth in a dministrative regulation; or b. For assuming insurers that are associations, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters: i. Minimum capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, calculated according to the methodology applicab le in its domiciliary jurisdiction, and a central fund containing a balance in amounts to be set forth by the commissioner in administrative regulation; and ii. A minimum solvency or capital ratio in the reciprocal jurisdiction where the assuming insurer h as its head office or is domiciled, as applicable, and is also licensed; 3. The assuming insurer agrees, and provides adequate assurance, in a form prescribed by the commissioner, to the following: a. To provide prompt written notice and explanation to the commissioner if the assuming insurer falls below the minimum requirements set forth in subparagraph 2. of this CHAPTER 50 203 paragraph, or if any regulatory action is taken against the assuming insurer for serious noncompliance with applicable law; b. To submit the ass uming insurer's consent, in writing, to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state and to the appointment of the commissioner as an agent for service of process. The commissioner may require that consent for service of process be provided to the commissi oner and included in each reinsurance agreement. Nothing in this subdivision of this subparagraph shall be construed to limit, or in any way alter, the capacity for the parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree to alternative dispute resolution mechanis ms, except to the extent such agreements are unenforceable under applicable insolvency or delinquency laws; c. To submit the assuming insurer's consent, in writing, to pay all final judgments, wherever enforcement is sought, obtained by a ceding insurer o r its legal successor, that have been declared enforceable in the jurisdiction where the judgment was obtained; d. To include in each reinsurance agreement, a provision requiring the assuming insurer to provide security in an amount equal to one hundred pe rcent (100%) of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded pursuant to that agreement if the assuming insurer resists enforcement of a final judgment that is enforceable under the law of the jurisdiction in which it was obtained o r a properly enforceable arbitration award, whether obtained by the ceding insurer or by its legal successor on behalf of its resolution estate; and e. i. To confirm that the assuming insurer is not presently participating in any solvent scheme of arrangem ent which involves this state's ceding insurers; and ii. To notify the ceding insurer and the commissioner, and to provide security in the amount of one hundred percent (100%) of the assuming insurer's liabilities to the ceding insurer, should the assuming insurer enter into a solvent scheme of arrangement referenced in subpart i. of this subdivision. The security required under this subdivision shall be in a form consistent with the provisions of subsections (3)(e) and (4) of this section, as specified by the commissioner in administrative regulation; 4. The assuming insurer or its legal successor provides, upon request of the commissioner, on behalf of itself and any legal predecessors, any documentation prescribed by the commissioner in administrative re gulation; 5. The assuming insurer maintains a practice of prompt payment of claims under reinsurance agreements, pursuant to criteria set forth by the commissioner in administrative regulation; and 6. The assuming insurer's supervisory authority confirms to the commissioner on an annual basis, as of the preceding December 31 or at the annual date otherwise statutorily reported to the reciprocal jurisdiction, that the assuming insurer complies with the requirements of subparagraph 2. of this paragraph. Nothing in this paragraph precludes an assuming insurer from providing the commissioner with information on a voluntary basis. (g) For purposes of paragraph (f) of this subsection: 1. a. The commissioner shall timely create and publish a list of reciprocal ju risdictions which shall include reciprocal jurisdictions as defined in subsection (1) of this section. b. The commissioner shall consider, and may approve, any other reciprocal jurisdiction: i. On the list of reciprocal jurisdictions published by the NAIC, through the NAIC committee process; and ii. That meets the criteria established by the commissioner by administrative regulation. c. The commissioner may remove a jurisdiction from the list of reciprocal jurisdictions upon a determination that the jurisdi ction no longer meets the requirements of a ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY 204 reciprocal jurisdiction, in accordance with a process established by the commissioner by administrative regulation, except, the commissioner shall not remove a reciprocal jurisdiction, as defined in subsection (1 ) of this section. Upon removal of a reciprocal jurisdiction from the commissioner's list, credit for reinsurance ceded to an assuming insurer that has its home office or is domiciled in that jurisdiction shall be allowed if otherwise allowed under this se ction. 2. a. The commissioner shall timely create and publish a list of assuming insurers that have satisfied the conditions, and to which cessions shall be granted, as set forth in subsection (3)(f) of this section. b. The commissioner may add an assuming insurer to the commissioner's list of assuming insurers under this subparagraph if an NAIC accredited jurisdiction has added such assuming insurer to its list of such assuming insurers, or if upon initial eligibility, the assuming insurer submits informat ion to the commissioner as required under subsection (3)(f)4. of this section and complies with any additional requirements that the commissioner may impose by administrative regulation, except to the extent that there is a conflict with an applicable cove red agreement. 3. a. If the commissioner determines that an assuming insurer no longer meets one (1) or more of the requirements of subsection (3)(f) of this section, the commissioner may revoke or suspend the eligibility of the assuming insurer for recogn ition under subsection (3)(f) of this section, in accordance with procedures set forth in administrative regulation. b. While an assuming insurer's eligibility is suspended, no reinsurance agreement issued, amended, or renewed after the effective date of t he suspension qualifies for credit except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with subsection (4) of this section. c. If an assuming insurer's eligibility is revoked, no credit for reinsurance may be granted after the effective date of the revocation with respect to any reinsurance agreements entered into by the assuming insurer, including reinsurance agreements entered into prior to the date of revocation, except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract are secured in a form acceptable to the commissioner and consistent with the provisions of subsection (4) of this section. 4. If subject to legal process of rehabilitation, liquidation, or conservation, as applicab le, the ceding insurer, or its representative, may seek and, if determined appropriate by the court in which the proceedings are pending, may obtain an order requiring that the assuming insurer post security for all outstanding ceded liabilities. 5. a. Credit may be taken under paragraph (f) of this subsection for reinsurance agreements entered into, amended, or renewed, on or after the effective date of this Act, and only with respect to losses incurred and reserves reported after the later of: i. The d ate on which the assuming insurer has met all eligibility requirements pursuant to paragraph (f) of this subsection; or ii. The effective date of the new reinsurance agreement, amendment, or renewal. b. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to alter or impair a ceding insurer's right to take credit for reinsurance, to the extent that credit is not available under paragraph (f) of this subsection, as long as the reinsurance qualifies for credit under any other provision of this section. 6. Nothing in this paragraph or paragraph (f) of this subsection shall be construed to: a. Limit or in any way alter the capacity of the parties to a reinsurance agreement to: i. Agree on requirements for security or other terms in the reinsurance agreement, except as e xpressly prohibited by this section or other applicable law; or ii. Renegotiate the agreement; or CHAPTER 50 205 b. Authorize an assuming insurer to withdraw or reduce the security provided under any reinsurance agreement except as permitted by the terms of the agreement . (h) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer not meeting the requirements of paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d), [or ](e), or (f) of this subsection, but only with respect to the insurance of risks located in jurisdictions where such reinsurance is required by applicable law or regulation of that jurisdiction or reinsurance ceded to a residual market mechanism reinsurance associatio n, or the members thereof, created pursuant to law or which has been voluntarily created as such by its members with the approval of the commissioner. (i)[(g)] If the assuming insurer is not authorized, certified, or accredited to transact insurance or reinsurance in Kentucky, the credit permitted by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this subsection shall not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees in the reinsurance agreements: 1. That in the event of the failure of the assuming insurer to perform its obliga tions under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the assuming insurer, at the request of the ceding insurer, shall submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in any state of the United States, shall comply with all requirements ne cessary to give the court jurisdiction, and shall abide by the final decision of the court or of any appellate court in the event of an appeal; and 2. To designate the Secretary of State or a designated attorney as its true and lawful attorney upon whom ma y be served any lawful process in any action, suit, or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the ceding insurer. This paragraph is not intended to conflict with or override the obligation of the parties to a reinsurance agreement to arbitrate their dis putes, if this obligation is created in the agreement.

(b) The term \"industrial concern\" means any domestic or foreign corporation, company, partnership, association, rural electric cooperative cor poration, or any other legal entity. (2) It is hereby determined and declared that the acquisition and financing of pollution control facilities for utilization by industrial concerns and utility companies by the issuance of bonds of cities and counties amortized by payments made by such industrial concerns and utility companies inures to the public interest, and constitutes the performance of a proper governmental purpose. It is the intent of this section to afford to cities and counties alternative metho ds of financing pollution control facilities to the end that atmospheric, solid waste and water pollution in the Commonwealth may be abated and controlled to the maximum possible extent. (3) As an alternative to the procedure set forth in KRS 103.200 to 1 03.285, inclusive, any city or county, for the purpose of financing the acquisition of pollution control facilities for any industrial concern or utility company, may issue negotiable bonds pursuant to KRS 103.200 to 103.285, inclusive, and either (a) loan the proceeds from the sale of such bonds to an industrial concern or utility company to finance the acquisition of such pollution control facilities, (b) sell such pollution control facilities to an industrial concern or utility company pursuant to agreem ent, or (c) lease such pollution control facilities from an industrial concern or utility company and sublease same to such industrial concern or utility company. In the event of use of such alternative financing procedure, such bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness of such city or county within the meaning of the Constitution of Kentucky, but shall be payable as to principal and interest solely from the revenues derived from payments, repayments, or sublease payments made by such industrial concern or utility company to such city or county in respect of such loan, sale or sublease. (4) In the event that an alternate procedure authorized by this section is to be utilized in the financing of pollution control facilities, (i) the provisions of KRS 103.20 0 to 103.285, inclusive, shall apply, except that the proceedings and procedures therein described shall contemplate and authorize a transaction in the form of (a) a loan of the proceeds from the sale of such bonds by such city or county to an industrial c oncern or utility company for the acquisition of such pollution control facilities, (b) a sale of such pollution control facilities to an industrial concern or utility company pursuant to agreement, or (c) a lease of such pollution control facilities from an industrial concern or utility company and sublease of same to such industrial concern or utility company; and (ii) the loan, sale, lease and sublease and any agreement or contract with respect thereto may include such provisions as such city or county s hall deem appropriate to effect the securing of the financing undertaken in respect of such pollution control facilities, including, but not by way of limitation, (a) the pledge of the general credit of any such industrial concern or utility company, (b) t he making of guarantees to an indenture trustee or to such city or county in respect of amortization of such bonds by any such industrial concern or utility company, (c) the creation of liens of security interests on any property or portion thereof of any such industrial concern or utility company, either senior or junior to, or ranking equally with, any other lien, security interest or rights of others, including any party or parties to any agreement in connection with such financing and/or its or their re spective security holders and indenture trustees or mortgage trustees, and (d) the pledge of other direct securities of such industrial concern or utility company in respect of such bonds. (5) In the event any city or county shall finance pollution contro l facilities pursuant to the express authority contained in this section, title to such pollution control facilities shall not be acquired by such city or county in the case of a loan or lease transaction, and, in the case of a sale transaction, title may pass at any time, and the statutory mortgage lien for which provision is made in KRS 103.250 shall not apply to any such pollution control facilities. (6) Bonds issued by cities and counties pursuant to the authority contained in this section may be cause d to mature as to principal in term or serial maturities not to exceed forty (40) [thirty (30)] years from date of issue.

Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky: Section 1. KRS 1.010 is amended to read as follows: It is the intent of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky that KRS 1.020 shall not eliminate the existing methods of describing points on, within, or above [of] the surface of the earth, as in metes and bounds or, in western Kentucky, the public land system, but rather to enhance these existing methods and establish a conformity for defining and stating the geographic positions or location s of points on, within, or above the surface of the earth and retracement purposes. Section 2. KRS 1.020 is amended to read as follows: (1) The Kentucky State Plane Coordinate System [ of 1983] , which is hereby adopted, means a system of plane coordinate s which have been established by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, through its [Ocean Service/] National Geodetic Survey , for defining and stating the geographic positions or locations of points on , within, or above the surface of the ear th within the Commonwealth of Kentucky. (2) For this system, the Commonwealth , through the Commonwealth Office of Technology, under the provisions of KRS 42.650 and advised by the Geographic Information Advisory Council, under the provisions of KRS 42.740, shall establish and publish a series of layered zones covered by geodetically referenced mapping projections adopted and supported by the National Geodetic Survey as a component of the National Spatial Reference System. Each series of zones shall be ident ified by the geodetic datum upon which they are defined and each zone shall remain uniquely and consistently defined throughout its implementation within a particular series [ shall be divided into a north zone and a south zone. The north zone shall be a La mbert conformal conic projection of the North American Datum of 1983, having standard parallels at north latitudes 37 degrees, 58 minutes, and 38 degrees, 58 minutes along which parallels the scale shall be exact. The origin of coordinates shall be at the intersection of the meridian 84 degrees, 15 minutes west of Greenwich, and the parallel 37 degrees, 30 minutes north latitude. This origin shall be given the coordinates: N=0, E=500,000.000 meters. The south zone shall be a Lambert conformal conic projecti on of the North American Datum of 1983, having standard parallels at north latitudes 36 degrees, 44 minutes, and 37 degrees, 56 minutes along which parallels the scale shall be exact. The origin of coordinates shall be at the intersection of the meridian 8 5 degrees, 45 minutes west of Greenwich, and the parallel 36 degrees, 20 minutes north latitude. This origin shall be given the coordinates: N=500,000.000, E=500,000.000 meters. The southern edge of the following counties shall delineate the boundary betwe en the north zone and the south zone: Bullitt, Spencer, Anderson, Woodford, Jessamine, Fayette, Clark, Montgomery, Menifee, Morgan, and Lawrence] . (3) One U. S. survey foot equals (1200)/(3937) meter. For conversion of meters to U. S. survey feet, multiply the meters by 3.28083333333 to twelve (12) significant figures. One international foot equals 0.3048 meter exactly. For conversion of meters to international feet, multiply the meters by 3.280839895. Unless otherwise originally established for an existing series, the base unit of linear measure for defining all zones within each series of the Kentucky State Plane Coordinate System shall be the meter. The specific constant for converting distances within each zone from the meter to the customary foot shall be: (a) The U.S. survey foot conversion factor as originally and exclusively specified for any existing series; and (b) The international foot conversion factor exclusively for each subsequent series established hereafter [When converting from meters to feet, the conversion factor defined by the U. S. survey foot shall be used] . (4) The plane coordinate values to be [for a point on the earth's surface,] used for[to] expressing [express] the geographic position or location of a[the] point in the appropriate zone of the Kentucky State Plane Coordinate System [this system,] shall consist of two (2) distances expressed in customary [U. S. survey] feet and decimals of a foot or meters and decimals of a meter [when using the Kentucky Coordin ate System of 1983] . When the values are expressed in customary feet, the meter to foot conversion factor for the respective Kentucky State CHAPTER 77 339 Plane Coordinate System series, as specified in subsection (3) of this section, shall be used. [For the Kentucky Coor dinate System of 1983, ] One (1) of the distances, to be known as the \"North y - coordinate, [\"northing\" or \"N] \"[,] shall give the distance north of the X axis [position in a north/south direction] . The other, to be known as the \"East x -coordinate,\" [\"easting\" or \"E\" ] shall give the distance east of the Y axis. The Y axis of any zone shall be parallel with the central meridian of that zone. The X axis of any zone shall be at right angles to the central meridian of that zone [position in an east/west direction. T hese coordinates shall be made to depend upon and conform to plane rectangular coordinates values for the monumented points of the North American National Geodetic Horizontal Network as published by the National Ocean Service/National Geodetic Survey, and whose plane coordinates have been computed on the systems established by the National Ocean Service/National Geodetic Survey. Any such station may be used for establishing a survey connection to the Kentucky Coordinate System of 1983] . (5) For purposes of describing the location of any survey station or land boundary corner in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, it shall be considered a complete, legal, and satisfactory description of the location to give the position of the survey station or land boundary corner on the Kentucky State Plane Coordinate System [ of 1983] . (6) Nothing contained in this section shall require a purchaser or mortgagee of real property to rely wholly on a land description any part of which depends exclusively upon the Kentucky State Plane Coordinate System [ of 1983] . (7) When any tract of land to be defined by a single description extends from one (1) into multiple mutually adjacent [ the other of the two (2)] zones, the position of all points on its boundaries shall [may] be referred exclus ively to one (1) of the multiple [either of the two (2)] zones. The zone which is used shall be named in the description. (8) No coordinates based on the Kentucky State Plane Coordinate System [ of 1983] , purporting to define the position of a corner [point] on a land boundary, shall be presented to be recorded in any public land records or deed records unless the corner [point] has been tied to a[an existing monumented horizontal] control monument or station established by conforming to [in conformity with] the standards of accuracy for boundary [ and specifications for first or second order geodetic] surveying as specified by administrative regulations duly promulgated under the provisions of KRS Chapter 322 [prepared and published by the Federal Geodetic Control Committee of the United States Department of Commerce. The survey used to tie a point into these monumented control stations shall conform to the standards and specifications of a minimum of third order accuracies as set forth by the Federal Geodetic Cont rol Committee. Standards and specifications of the Federal Geodetic Control Committee, or its successor, in force on the date of the survey shall apply. Publishing existing control stations, or the acceptance with intent to publish the newly established st ations, by the National Ocean Service/National Geodetic Survey shall constitute evidence of adherence to the Federal Geodetic Control Committee specifications. These requirements may be modified by a duly authorized state agency or local agency to meet loc al conditions] . (9) The use of the term [terms] \"KENTUCKY STATE PLANE COORDINATE SYSTEM [ OF 1983 NORTH ZONE\" or \"KENTUCKY COORDINATE SYSTEM OF 1983 SOUTH ZONE] \" on any map, report of survey, or other document shall be limited to coordinates based on the Kentucky State Plane Coordinate System as defined in this section. (10) If any provision of this section or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the section which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this section are severable.

(6) For purposes of this se ction, the full actuarial cost shall be determined by the County Employees Retirement System consulting actuary separately for the pension fund and the insurance fund using the assumptions and methodology established by the system specifically for determin ing the full actuarial cost of ceasing participation as of the employer's effective cessation date. For purposes of determining the full actuarial cost, the assumed rate of return used to calculate the cost shall be the lesser of the assumed rate of return utilized in the system's most recent actuarial valuation or the yield on a thirty (30) year United States treasury bond as of the employer's effective cessation date, but shall in no case be lower than the assumed CHAPTER 79 419 rate of return utilized in the system's m ost recent actuarial valuation minus three and one -half percent (3.5%).

Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky: Section 1. KRS 61.565 is repealed, reenacted, and amended to read as follows: (1) (a) Each employer participating in the State Police Retirement System as provided for in KRS 16.505 to 16.652, the County Employees Retirement System as provi ded for in KRS 78.510 to 78.852, and the Kentucky Employees Retirement System as provided for in KRS 61.510 to 61.705 shall contribute annually to the respective retirement system an amount determined by the actuarial valuation completed in accordance with KRS 61.670 and as specified by this section. Employer contributions for each respective retirement system shall be equal to the sum of the \"normal cost contribution\" and the \"actuarially accrued liability contribution.\" (b) For purposes of this section, t he normal cost contribution shall be computed as a percentage of pay and shall be an annual amount that is sufficient when combined with employee contributions to fund benefits earned during the year in the respective system [ or plan, including costs for t hose members who elect to participate in the 401(a) money purchase plan] . The amount shall be : 1. Paid as a percentage of creditable compensation reported for each employee participating in the system [ or plan] and accruing benefits ; and 2. The same percentage of pay for all employees who are participating in the same retirement system, except that separate percentage rates shall be developed in each system for those employers whose employees are participating in hazardous duty retirement coverage as provided by KRS 61.592 . (c) For purposes of this section, the actuarially accrued liability contribution shall be : 1. Computed by amortizing [an annual dollar amount that is sufficient to amortize] the total unfunded actuarially accrued liability of each sy stem over a closed period of thirty (30) years beginning with the 2019 actuarial valuation using the level percentage of payroll [level -dollar] amortization method , except that any increase or decrease in the unfunded actuarially accrued liability occurring after the completion of the 2019 actuarial valuation shall be amortized over a closed period of twenty (20) years beginning with the actuarial valuation in which the increase or decrease in the unfunded actuarially accrued liability is recognized. An incr ease or decrease in the unfunded actuarially accrued liability may result from, but not be limited to, legislative changes to benefits, changes in actuarial methods or assumptions, or actuarial gains or losses; 2. Paid as a percentage of payroll on the cre ditable compensation reported for each employee participating in the system and accruing benefits; and 3. The same percentage of pay for all employees who are participating in the same retirement system, except that separate percentage rates shall be devel oped in each system for those employers whose employees are participating in hazardous duty retirement coverage as provided by KRS 61.592 . [This method shall be used beginning with the 2019 actuarial valuation, and employer costs for the actuarially accrue d liability contribution shall be prorated to each employer as provided by paragraph (f) of this subsection. ] (d) The employer contributions computed under this section shall be determined using: 1. The entry age normal cost funding method; 2. An asset sm oothing method that smooths investment gains and losses over a five (5) year period; and CHAPTER 82 467 3. Other funding methods and assumptions established by the board in accordance with KRS 61.670. (e) Effective with the 2019 actuarial valuation, the amortization peri od for the Kentucky Employees Retirement System, the County Employees Retirement System, and the State Police Retirement System for liabilities accrued as of the 2019 actuarial valuation shall be reset to a new thirty (30) year closed period for purposes o f calculating the actuarially accrued liability contribution prescribed by paragraph (c) this subsection. [(f) The dollar value of the actuarially accrued liability contribution specified by paragraph (c) of this subsection payable by each individual syste m employer based upon the 2019 actuarial valuation shall be prorated based upon the individual employer's average percentage of the total creditable compensation reported by all employers in the specific system in fiscal years 2014 -2015, 2015 -2016, and 201 6-2017, except that the amount shall: 1. Not apply to any employer who ceases participation and pays the full actuarial cost of ceasing participation as provided by KRS 61.522; 2. Be adjusted for each remaining employer of a system to reflect any employer who ceases participation and who pays the full actuarial cost of ceasing participation as provided by KRS 61.522; and 3. Be a single amount for all executive branch departments, program cabinets and their respective departments and administrative bodies e numerated in KRS 12.020, and any other executive branch agencies administratively attached to a department, program cabinet, or administrative body enumerated in KRS 12.020.] (2) (a) Normal cost contribution rates and the actuarially accrued liability cont ribution shall be determined by the board on the basis of the annual actuarial valuation last preceding the July 1 of a new biennium. (b) The board may amend contribution rates as of July 1 of the second year of a biennium for the County Employees Retireme nt System , if it is determined on the basis of a subsequent actuarial valuation that amended contribution rates are necessary to satisfy the requirements of this section. (c) [Effective for employer contribution rates payable on or after July 1, 2014, thro ugh June 30, 2020, ] The board shall not have the authority to amend contribution rates as of July 1 of the second year of the biennium for the Kentucky Employees Retirement System and the State Police Retirement System. (3) The system shall advise each emp loyer prior to [the beginning of each biennium, or prior to ] July 1 [ of the second year of a biennium for employers participating in the County Employees Retirement System,] of any change in the employer contribution rate. Based on the employer contributio n rate, each employer shall include in the budget sufficient funds to pay the employer contributions as determined by the board under this section. (4) All employers, including the General Assembly , shall pay the full actuarially required contributions [contribution rate] , as prescribed by this section, to the Kentucky Employees Retirement System and the State Police Retirement System in fiscal years occurring on or after July 1, 2020 [July 1, 2014] .

(f) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) to (e) of this subsection, a consolidated return may be filed as provided in KRS 141.201 if the taxpayer makes an election according to KRS 141.201. (4) The use of a combined report does no t disregard the separate identities of the taxpayer members of the combined group. Each taxpayer member is responsible for tax based on its taxable income or loss apportioned or allocated to this state, which shall include, in addition to the other types o f income, the taxpayer member's share of apportionable income of the combined group, where apportionable income of the combined group is calculated as a summation of the individual net incomes of all members of the combined group.

(5) (a) Each taxpayer member is responsible for tax based on its taxable income or loss apportioned or allocated to this state, which shall include: 1. Its share of any income apportionable to this state of each of the combined groups of which it is a member, determined under subsection (6) of this section; 2.

Its net operating loss carryover. (b) No tax credit or post -apportionment d eduction earned by one (1) member of the group, but not fully used by or allowed to that member, may be used in whole or in part by another member of the group or applied in whole or in part against the total income of the combined group , except as provide d in paragraph (c) of this subsection . (c) If the taxable income computed pursuant to KRS 141.039 results in a net loss for a taxpayer member of the combined group, that taxpayer member has a Kentucky net operating loss, subject to the net operating loss l imitations and carry forward provisions of KRS 141.011. No prior year net operating loss carryforward shall be available to entities that were not doing business in this state in the year in which the loss was incurred. A Kentucky net operating loss carryo ver incurred by a taxpayer member of a combined group shall be deducted from income or loss apportioned to this state pursuant to this section as follows: 1. For taxable years beginning on or after the first day of the initial taxable year for which a comb ined unitary tax return is required under this section, if the computation of a combined group's Kentucky net income before apportionment to this state results in a net operating loss, a taxpayer member of the group may carry over its share of the net oper ating loss as apportioned to this state, as calculated under this section and in accordance with KRS 141.120 or 141.121, and it shall be deductible from a taxpayer member's apportioned net income derived from the unitary business in a future tax year to th e extent that the carryover and deduction is otherwise consistent with KRS 141.011; 2. Where a taxpayer member of a combined group has a Kentucky net operating loss carryover derived from a loss incurred by a combined group in a tax year beginning on or af ter the first day CHAPTER 91 763 of the initial tax year for which a combined unitary tax return is required under this section, then the taxpayer member may share the net operating loss carryover with other taxpayer members of the combined group if the other taxpayer me mbers were members of the combined group in the tax year that the loss was incurred. Any amount of net operating loss carryover that is deducted by another taxpayer member of the combined group shall reduce the amount of net operating loss carryover that m ay be carried over by the taxpayer member that originally incurred the loss; 3. Where a taxpayer member of a combined group has a net operating loss carryover derived from a loss incurred in a tax year prior to the initial tax year for which a combined uni tary tax return is required under this section, the carryover shall remain available to be deducted by that taxpayer member and any other taxpayer members of the combined group, but in no case shall the deduction reduce any taxpayer member's Kentucky appor tioned taxable income by more than fifty percent (50%) in any taxable year, other than the taxpayer member that originally incurred the net operating loss, in which case no limitation is provided except as provided by Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Co de. Any net operating loss carryover that is not utilized in a particular taxable year shall be carried over by the taxpayer member that generated the loss and utilized in the future consistent with the limitations of this subparagraph; or 4. Where a taxpa yer member of a combined group has a net operating loss carryover derived from a loss incurred in a tax year during which the taxpayer member was not a taxpayer member of the combined group, the carryover shall remain available to be deducted by that taxpa yer member or other taxpayer members, but in no case shall the deduction reduce any taxpayer member's Kentucky apportioned taxable income by more than fifty percent (50%) in any taxable year, other than the taxpayer member that originally incurred the net operating loss, in which case no limitation is provided except as provided by Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code. Any net operating loss carryover that is not utilized in a particular taxable year, shall be carried over by the taxpayer member that ge nerated the loss and utilized in the future consistent with the limitations of this subparagraph. (6) The taxpayer's share of the business income apportionable to this state of each combined group of which it is a member shall be the product of: (a) The ap portionable income of the combined group, determined under subsection (7) of this section; and (b) The taxpayer member's apportionment fraction, determined under KRS 141.120, including in the sales factor numerator the taxpayer's sales associated with the combined group's unitary business in this state, and including in the denominator the sales of all members of the combined group, including the taxpayer, which sales are associated with the combined group's unitary business wherever located. The sales of a pass-through entity shall be included in the determination of the partner's apportionment percentage in proportion to a ratio, the numerator of which is the amount of the partner's distributive share of the pass -through entity's unitary income included in the income of the combined group as provided in subsection (8) of this section and the denominator of which is the amount of pass -through entity's total unitary income. (7) The apportionable income of a combined group is determined as follows: (a) The total income of the combined group is the sum of the income of each member of the combined group determined under federal income tax laws, as adjusted for state purposes, as if the member were not consolidated for federal purposes; and (b) From the total i ncome of the combined group determined under subsection (8) of this section, subtract any income and add any expense or loss, other than the apportionable income, expense, or loss of the combined group. (8) To determine the total income of the combined gro up, taxpayer members shall take into account all or a portion of the income and apportionment factor of only the following members otherwise included in the combined group as provided in subsection (3) of this section: (a) The entire income and apportionme nt percentage of any member, incorporated in the United States or formed under the laws of any state, the District of Columbia, or any territory or possession of the United States, that earns less than eighty percent (80%) of its income from sources outsid e of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any territory or possession of the United States; ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY 764 (b) Any member that earns more than twenty percent (20%) of its income, directly or indirectly, from intangible property or service related activities th at are deductible against the apportionable income of other members of the combined group, to the extent of that income and the apportionment factor related to that income.

Refusal to allow entry and inspection of a facility or refusal to allow the division to collect or split samples shall make the facility inelig ible for fund participation; (m) Have inspectors on site at all tank system removals. Failure to comply with this provision shall make the facility ineligible for fund participation. A petroleum storage tank owner or operator may request through certified mail that the division schedule an inspector to be present at an upcoming tank removal. If the request is made at least two (2) weeks before the time for the removal and an inspector fails to be present at the time scheduled, the tank removal may proceed w ithout making the facility ACTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY 798 ineligible for fund participation unless the owner is notified by the division no later than ten (10) days prior to the proposed date that an inspector is not available on the proposed date, in which event a representative of the division shall contact the operator and schedule a new date. If no inspector is present at the rescheduled date, the removal may then proceed without penalty; and (n) Establish that the deadline for submission of final reimbursement requests under the pet roleum storage tank account is two (2) years after receipt of a no further action letter. (2) The division may advise the cabinet on the promulgation of administrative regulations concerning petroleum storage tanks. (3) The division may sue and be sued in its own name.

(6) The General Assembly recognizes that increasing taxes on tobacco products should reduce consumption, and therefore result in healthier lifestyles for Kentuckians.

The order shall include evidence of the danger or probable danger to the prisoners. When any such order is made, and a copy [ thereof] is given [furnishe d] to the jailer of the receiving jail [county designated] , he or she shall receive all such prisoners. If a[the] Circuit Judge is not in the county, the order of transfer may be made by a[the] District Judge, who shall deliver the order, or a copy thereof, to the circuit clerk for revision by the Circuit Court. (b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, before ordering the transfer of a prisoner from an originating jail to a receiving jail, a Circuit Judge shall receive a written agreement between the originating and receiving jails. The written agreement shall specify that the receiving jail has agreed to house the prisoner or prisoners and that the originating jail shall pay the prisoner's expenses in accordance with subsection (3)(a) and (b) of this section. If the Circuit Judge orders the transfer before receiving the written agreement, the receiving jail shall not be required to house the prisoner nor shall the receiving jail's jailer be subject to contempt for failing to obey the transf er order. (3) In the event a prisoner is transferred from an originating jail to a receiving jail, the receiving jail shall: (a) Charge no more than three (3) times the per diem amount determined according to KRS 431.215(2). However, the per diem rate char ged by the receiving jail shall not exceed the combined cost of the prisoner's room and board, administrative processing or booking, and any evidence -based programming the prisoner receives; (b) Perform only medically necessary procedures on the prisoners, as determined by the receiving jail's medical provider.

(4) The sheriff of the county of the originating jail shall be responsible for the transportation of any prisoners transferred pursuant to this section.

(5) To ensure the ongoing safety and security of the prisoners, any Circuit Judge who orders the transfer of a prisoner fro m an originating jail to a receiving jail shall review his or her transfer orders every sixty (60) days, with input from the originating and receiving jails.

The clerk shall file the receipt in his or her office. (b) The receiving jail [jailer] shall receive the prisoners and safely keep them until they are properly discharged. If the receiving jail's jailer fails to accept and keep such prisoners, that jailer [he] and his or her sureties shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as if the prisoners had been regularly committed by an order of the Circuit Court of his or her county. (3) (a) The sheriff [officer] conveying the prisoners to the receiving [designated] jail, and such guards as the judge directs him to take, not exceeding the number of guards allowed in taking convicts to the penitentiary, shall receive the compensation and mileage allowed by KRS 64.070 for taking convicts to the penitentiary. The compensation shall be allowed by the Circuit Judge directing the transfer and paid out of the State Treasury, unless there was no jail in the county or it was rendered insecure by the failure of the fiscal court to keep it in the requisite condition, in which case it shall be paid in accordance with paragraph (b) of this subsection [by the fiscal court of the county] . The Circuit Judge, in making the allow ance, shall state in the order out of which fund it shall be paid. The order of the judge directing the transfer shall be conclusive evidence that the transfer was proper and to the right jail, and shall be a justification to the receiving jail's jailer fo r holding any such prisoner in any action against him for false imprisonment. (b)[(2)] If a transfer of prisoners is necessary because there is no jail in the county or because the jail was rendered insecure by the failure of the fiscal court to keep it in the requisite condition, the cost of lodging the prisoners in the receiving jail[ of t he county to which they are transferred] shall be borne by the fiscal court of the county from which the transfer was made at a rate set by agreement between the two (2) fiscal courts involved.

(b) The accountabilit y system shall include an annual meaningful differentiation of all public schools in the state using multiple measures that describe the overall performance of each district, school, and student subgroup. Performance shall be based on a combination of acad emic and school quality indicators and measures, hereinafter called \"state indicators.\" The state indicators shall exclusively include : 1. [An annual overall summative performance evaluation of each school and district compared to goals established by the Kentucky Department of Education.

The clerk shall obtain the information required by this subsection for notation upon the certificate of title from the title lien statement described in KRS 186A.195 to be provided to the county clerk by the secured party. (10)[(8)] For all the costs incurred in the notation and discharge of a security interest on the certifi cate of title, the county clerk shall receive the fee prescribed by KRS 64.012. The fee prescribed by this subsection shall be paid at the time of submittal of the title lien statement described in KRS 186A.195.

KRS 186A.195 is amended to read as follows: (1) As used in this chapter, a title lien statement is a document to be su bmitted by the secured party to the county clerk. Upon submission of the title lien statement, the county clerk shall use the information contained therein to note the security interest on the certificate of title, in accordance with KRS 186A.190 (9)[(7)]. The county clerk may make title lien statements available to the general public. However, public availability of such statements is not necessary or effective to perfect a security interest in property required to be registered or titled in accordance with this chapter. (2) If a title lien statement and the required fees accompany the application for first title of any property in the name of an owner, the county clerk shall enter the information required by KRS 186A.190 (9)[(7)] into the automated system so as to produce a certificate of title in Frankfort bearing in addition to any other required information, the information designated by KRS 186A.190 (9)[(7)]. The clerk shall thereby produce, in accordance with design of the automated system, a certificate of registration, if required. (3) If a title lien statement and the required fees are not received at the time of application for first title of any property in the name of the owner due to owner's residency in another county, or if the form prescribed by KRS 186A.060 indicates a pending lien but the title lien statement does not accompany the application for title, the county clerk shall enter into the Automated Vehicle Information System (AVIS) the name and address of the lienholder and the county where t he lien is to be noted or that a lien is pending. The clerk shall indicate a title is not to be issued until the lien has been noted and fees, according to KRS 186A.190, paid in the county of the owner's residence or in thirty (30) days.

(4) Should a certificate of title be issued after the thirty (30) day period has expired without the notation of a security interest thereon, or should there be no prov ision made for a lien to be noted in the county of residence of the debtor within thirty (30) days and the title issued within that time, the secured party shall request from the debtor, and the debtor shall submit to the secured party, the certificate of title. The secured party shall submit the certificate of title along with the title lien statement to the county clerk of the county of the debtor's residence. The county clerk shall then enter the information required by KRS 186A.190 (9)[(7)] into the Auto mated Vehicle Information System (AVIS) and note on the certificate of title in the appropriate section the information described in that section. Following the notation of the appropriate information on the certificate of title, the county clerk shall ret urn the title to the debtor. (5) The security interest noted on the certificate of title shall be deemed perfected at the time the security interest attaches (KRS 355.9 -203) if the secured party tenders the required fees and submits a properly completed ti tle lien statement and application for first title or, in the case of property previously titled in the name of its CHAPTER 119 1273 debtor, the certificate of title to the appropriate county clerk within thirty (30) days of attachment. Otherwise, the security interest sha ll be deemed perfected at the time that such fees are tendered and such documents are submitted to the appropriate county clerk. Section 3. KRS 186A.200 is amended to read as follows: (1) With respect to a vehicle previously titled in the name of its de btor, the secured party shall, within thirty (30) days after execution of the security agreement, obtain the current certificate of title in the name of the debtor, with no more than one (1) prior lien indicated thereon, and present to the county clerk the certificate of title, which the secured party shall have the right to obtain from the debtor, together with the title lien statement and the required fees in KRS 186A.190 to the county clerk. (2) For failure to present both the title and title lien statem ent within the time prescribed by subsection (1) of this section, the secured party shall pay a penalty of two dollars ($2) to the county clerk as a prerequisite for noting the security interest on the title. (3) The county clerk shall enter the informatio n required by KRS 186A.190 (9)[(7)] into the automated system. (4) The county clerk shall record upon the title in the appropriate section the information designated by KRS 186A.190 (9)[(7)]. Signed by Governor April 24, 2020.
