' ~ I ~ PHYSIOLOGICAL AND NUTRITIONAL ADAPTATIONS OF MOOSE TO NORTHERN ENVIRONMENTS Charles C. Schwartz Alaska Department of Fish and Game, 34828 Kalifomsky Beach Road, Suite B, (Alces alces) exploit the boreal forest where food resources have high nutritive value during brief summers, and low quality and availability during long winters. To accommodate to this fluctuating environment, moose store large quantities of fat during summer and fall which helps to offset their winter energy deficit. Annual rhythms are keyed to this cycle. Intake rates vary seasonally and correspond with nutrient quality and forage availability. Moose are hyperphagic in summer and reduce food intake during winter. Activity budgets vary among environments and seasons with foraging and resting/ruminating occupying most of their time. Metabolism follows a circannual cycle that peaks in mid-summer with a nadir in late-winter; peak metabolism corresponds to maximum energy intake and storage. Moose are classified as seasonally adaptable concentrate selectors that choose a diet primarily of browse foliage and twigs. This diet is high in lignin as well as readily digestible nutrients. Energy and protein requirements are similar to other cervidae. Body composition, like metabolism and intake, is dynamic seasonally. Nutritional adaptations stabilize energy balance and allow moose to withstand energy shortages in a fluctuating environment. The ultimate goal of any wild ruminant is to efficiently acquire energy from a dynamic environment and maintain productivity. However, needs for food are often at odds with requirements for security, thermo\u00ad regulation, and mating. There are over 176 species (Morris 1965) of extant ruminants inhabiting most biomes in the world. Al\u00ad though the distribution of these mammals is largely constrained by climate and vegetation, physiological adaptations play a major role. Ruminants possess a vast array of morpho\u00ad logical, physiological, and behavioral adap\u00ad tations which makes each species efficient at capturing and processing energy. Under\u00ad standing how ruminants balance energy flows helps unravel trophic strategies. Moose are the largest cervid (Peterson 1952) and generally the most abundant wild ruminant of the extensive boreal forests of North America, the Soviet Union, and Scan\u00ad dinavia (Flerov, 1952,Peterson 1955, Danilov 1987). Moose of ecologi\u00ad cal and physiological adaptations which al\u00ad low them to successfully occupy one of the coldest regions on earth. ALCES SUPPLEMENT 1 (1992) pp. 139-155 The International Moose Symposia have served as a forum for information exchange betweenmoose biologist throughout the world. A major function of each conference includes invited reviewsofselected topics about moose; this paper is a review of moose nutrition and physiology. Gasaway and Coady (1974) pre\u00ad sented the first of such reviews at the sympo\u00ad sium held in Quebec City in 1973. By ne\u00ad cessity, much of their review contained in\u00ad formation gathered on other ruminant spe\u00ad cies, primarily domestic livestock; existing information about moose nutrition was very limited. Schwartz et al. (1987 c) presented the 2nd review at the symposium held in Uppsala, Sweden in 1984. Their review reflected the dramatic increase in the information base about the nutritional requirements of moose. It has been 6 years since Schwartz et al. (1987 c) prepared their review, and the extent of our knowledge about moose nutrition has advanced. I will synthesize much of the information about moose nutrition and use these data to show how moose flourish in the northern environment 139 NUTRITIONAL ADAPTIONS OF MOOSE- SCHW AR1Z ALCES SUPPLEMENT 1 (1992) Diet Choices and Diversity There is a great diversity in plant species eaten by moose through their circumpolar range (Peek 1974, Bergstrom and Hjeljord 1987, Eastman and Ritcey 1987, Joyal1987, Kumetsov 1987, Lavsund 1987, Thompson and Euler 1987) but these species do possess one common attribute. Food habits studies clearly demonstrate that moose choose diets primarily of leaves and/or stems of woody vegetation (Table 1). Exceptforaquaticplants and forbs in summer diets, deciduous or co\u00ad niferous browse in the form of twigs and leaves represents almost 100% of the diet in winter and >60% in spring and summer. Grasses rarely comprise more than 1% of the diet. Moose diets in specific areas are not di\u00ad verse; most studies indicate that >90% of diet contains fewer than 7 different plant species (Table 1). Similarly, the number of plant species comprising at least 5% of the diet rarely exceeds 7. Grasses and sedges, although available in most habitats are seldom con\u00ad sumed during seasons other than spring when their nutrient content and digestibility are high (Peek 1974). Only 1 study in spring (Houston 1968) and 2 studies in summer (Houston 1968, LeResche and Davis 1973) documented grasses comprising > 1% of the diet (Table 1). Food Availability Abundance of moose foods (generally measured as current annual growth) varies seasonally and among habitats (Table 2). For example, in Quebec, estimates of forage biomass (X:= 73-321 kg/ha) in summer varied among years and forest types; winter forage averaged only about 20% of summer biomass (Crete and Jordan 1982). Intheaspen(Populus tremuloides) dominated forest of Alberta, browse biomass ranged from 530-2,230 kg/ ha in summer to 17-105 kg/ha during winter in different forest type (Renecker 1987). Winter biomass averaged 33% of summer estimates. Risenhoover (1987) measured woody plant biomass in various habitats in both Isle Royale National Park and Denali National Park, dur\u00ad ing winter. Estimates ranged from 16-266 kg/ ha at Isle Royale and 23-222 kg/ha in Biomass estimates varied riparian willow (Salix spp) was most produc\u00ad tive, whereas an old bum was least produc\u00ad tive. Forage biomass also varies with seral age offorests. Parker and Morton (1978) demon\u00ad strated that in Newfoundland woody biomass (primarily balsam fir) increased from around 200 kg/ha in 2 year old clearcuts to over 2,000 kg/ha by 8 years where it peaked and gradu\u00ad ally declined. On the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, important browse species (mainly paper birch [Betula papyrifera], but some aspen and wil\u00ad low) tend to peak about 15 years after a fire (Spencer and Hakala 1964). Oldemeyer and Regelin (1987) estimated the biomass of im\u00ad portant browse species in seral stands of for\u00ad est. Browse production measured at 3, 10, 30, and 90 years post bum were at 37, 1399, 397, and 4 kg/ha, respectively. Similarly, in inte\u00ad rior Alaska, aspen forage was most abundant 1-5 years post bum (198 kg/ha in 1-year old stand), whereas birch (167 kg/ha in 11 year old stand) and willow (66 kg/ha in 16 year old stands) provided the most browse 10-16 years post bum (Wolf and Zasada 1979) in winter. Stands> 25 years of age generally had< 10 kg/ ha of forage. Moose density is often associ\u00ad ated with food abundance (Eastman andRitcey 1987, Joyal 1987, Oldemeyer and Regelin 1987, Thompson and Euler 1987, Schwartz et al. 1989), unless other forms of mortality (i.e., hunting,predation,diseaseandparasites)limit density. Diet Quality The nutritional quality of moose diets varies seasonally, but in general, spring and summer diets are 1.5 to 3 times more nutritious than winter diets (Table 3), depending upon which constituent is examined.

Mean diameter at point of browsing can vary among individual animals (Crete and Audy 1974), plant species, and habitats (Peek et al. 1971, Joyal 1976, Hubbert 1987, Risenhoover 1987); all of these can influences diet quality. Preferred species tend to be browsed to a greater diameter (Peek et al. 1971, Joyal1976), and moose demonstrate a clear preference for the largest available twigs (Risenhoover 1987). On most browse species, twigs from 2.5 to 5.5 mm were browsed more frequently than expected based on their availability (Risenhoover 1987). Variation in point of browsing between areas within a species is common as sug\u00ad gested by diameter of browsing of balsam fir (Abies balsamea) which was 3.2-11.1 mm (desMeules 1962)versus 1.8-7.8mm(Telfer 1969). browsing is more likely influ\u00ad enced by twig morphology than feeding behavior by moose towards a plant species. Point of browsing of paper birch did not vary as moose stocking rates increased from 1. 7 to 4.8 moose/km2 and level of utilization in\u00ad creased from 23 to 66% of the current annual growth (Hubbert 1987). Moose adjusted to greater density by browsing each plant at a greater intensity (i.e., they removed more current annual growth stems), but110t by eating poorer quality food (Hubbert 1987). At ex\u00ad tremely high stocking rates or when moose are confined to a winter range for long periods by deep snow, browse diameter (Renecker 1987) and utilization increase, bark stripping becomes more common (pers. observation), and diet quality declines. Seasonal Intake Rates Seasonalfluctuationinintakeof dry matter appears to be an inherent rhythm of northern ungulates. Studies with moose (Schwartz et al. 1984), white-tailed deer viriginianus) (Rangifer tarandus) (McEwan and Whitehead 1970) all show that these species regulate seasonal intake of dry matter and digestible energy even when offered high quality food ad libitum. Intake of dry matter is influenced by the digestible energy content of the diet. Captive moose eating diets of varying energy content consumed different amounts of dry matter, but similar amounts of digestible energy. These moose consumed enough food to meet a seasonal caloric requirement rather than maximizing dry matter fill (Schwartz et al. 1988a). Food intake in moose peaks in summer with a nadir in late winter (Schwartz et al. 1984, Renecker and Hudson 1985, Schwartz et al. 1987c). Changes in voluntary intake coincide with changes in forage quality and availability (i.e., summer vs. winter). Moose eat approximately 2.6-3.5% of their body weight {BW) per day in dry matter during summerbutonly0.5-1.3%inwinter(Schwartz eta1.1984,ReneckerandHudson 1985). This equatestoapproximately 116-142g/kgBW0\u00b77s/ day in summer and 30-51 g/kg BW0\u00b77s/day in winter. Two recent studies (Renecker 1987. Risenhoover 1987) provide valuable insight into foraging strategies of moose, and im\u00ad prove our understanding of the dynamics of forage intake. Renecker (1987) observed moose in one habitat during different seasons, whereas Risenhoover(1987) observed moose during winter in two different environments; both observed moose during daylight hours. Seasonal intake rate (g dry matter/min) is a function of available forage biomass {g/m2), bite rate (bites/min) and bite size (g dry matter/ bite). Renecker and Hudson (1986a) estab\u00ad lished a significant (P < 0.001) curvilinear relationship between intake rate and forage availability (Fig. 1). There were 3 different response curves corresponding to differences in forage quality among seasons. Maximum foraging rates of dry matter were predicted at 23 g/min in July, 18 g/min in October, and 11 g/min in January. Risenhoover (1987), on the other hand, found no relationships (P > 0.05) between intake rates of moose and both total plant biomass and diet species biomass (Fig 2.). Intake rates of dry matter varied greatly be\u00ad tween foraging periods ranging from 1.2 to 25 g/min. The biomass of moose food varied from 0 to 65 g/m2; this was about 50% of biomass estimates of Renecker (1987) in January. The discrepancy between these two stud\u00ad ies is difficult to explain. The functional response curve ofRenecker (1987) is similar to curves for wapiti (Cervus elaphus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), reindeer, and caribou (see Wickstrom et al. 1984, Fig. 2). A curvilinear response is the appropriate func\u00ad tion when describing such a relationship. It is logical that intake of dry matter beyond some maximum (asymptote) is not influenced by availability. Renecker's curve was based on observations made with 2 animals. Risenhoover, on the other hand, observed at least 32 different moose in his 2 study areas. The lack of a curvilinear fit demonstrates the high variability between individual moose and limits using abundance of forage biomass to predict intake, particularly at lower ranges (Oto HX>g/m2). AlsoasRisenhoover(1987:74) suggested ''the failure to detect a functional response in moose intake rates suggests that diet species biomass provides a poor indictor of moose encounter rates with acceptable forage.\" It is difficult to define what is moose food. A lack of a relationship could also be a function of the diversity of shrub habitats which by their nature require intensive sam\u00ad pling. Intake of food is also related to bite size and rate which vary seasonally, among plant species, and among study areas (Renecker 1987,Risenhoover1987).Risenhooverfound no relationship between mean bite size (g/ bite) or mean harvest rate (bites/min) and diet 144 + ALCES SUPPLEMENT 1 (1992) SCHWARTZ- NUTRITIONAL ADAPTATIONS OF MOOSE ..-.. \u00b7-E ........... ~ Q 0) ..._.. w ~ a: z 0 -..... a.. ~ :::> (/) z 0 (.) 30 JULY ttl3 20 OCTOBER 1983 0 2000 3000 4000 5000 USABLE BIOMASS ( kg/ha) Fig. 1.

However, the amount of handling time required per gram declined as bite size increased, and thus, intake rate could be maximized by maximizing bite size (Fig. 3). Renecker concluded that during summer, moose had little difficulty meeting their daily forage requirements for maintenance and production. During winter, low quality food imposed logistic constraints on foraging behavior, opportunity for selection decreased and time required for rumination increased. Morphological Adaptations The digestive anatomy of the moose is well suited to their diet choices. Kay et al.

The poles of this classification system are represented by concentrate selectors and grass/roughage eaters. The two are vastly different. Details are amply characterized by 146 ALCES SUPPLEMENI' 1 (1992) SCHWARTZ- NUTRITIONAL ADAPTATIONS OF MOOSE Hofmann Nygren 1992. The Bell-Jannan principle (Bell 1969, 1971, Jannan 1974) states that small bodied animals tend to be selective in their diet choices (concentrate selectors) while large bodied ru\u00ad minants are non-selective (roughage eaters). This principle, developed in Africa, was based on the relationship of body size and energy requirements. In general, energy requirements scale to body weight (BW) at approximately BW0\u00b775 (Kleiber 1975). Expressed allometrically, large animals require less en\u00ad ergy per unit of body weight but more abso\u00ad lute energy than small animals. This simply means small bodied ruminants can be more selective in diet choices, but those choices must be of high quality. Hofmann's classifi\u00ad cation contains at least 3 large species of concentrate selectors, the giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), moose, and greater Moose do entirely to Hofmann's classification as a concentrate se\u00ad lector, since foods eaten in winter are not that nutritious (Table 3). Similarly, it may be difficult to make pure anatomical and mor\u00ad phological comparisons between African bovines (Pliocene origin) and can cervids (Pleistocene adaptations of moose. Moose are morphologically adapted to the northern environments where they live. Winter is especially critical since there may be snow on the ground from 4-8 months/year. The ability of moose to travel in snow is governed by the snow's depth, density, and hardness. The long legs and small hooves of moose facilitate mobility in deep soft snow. Their chest height is 64% greater than white-tailed deer(82-105 vs. 50-64cm), although the foot loading of moose advantage over other forest browsers like the white-tailed deer since they can move and freely exploit areas with relatively deep snow. The large body size of moose, which minimizes heat loss helps with survival in a cold climate. Adult moose are capable of tolerating extreme cold (Renecker and Hud\u00ad son 1986b), butareintolerantofheat(Renecker et al. 1978, Renecker and Hudson 1986b, Chennnykh 1987). Forage Digestion and Passage To extract maximum metabolizable en\u00ad ergy from ingested foods, ruminants must optimize the trade off between retention and passage (Foose 1982). Retention of food in the rumen allows formore complete digestion whereas rapid passage allows for more food to be processed. Schwartz et al. (1980) speculated that moose, as concentrate selec\u00ad tors, confronted this problem by propelling digesta rapidly, fennenting mainly soluble components. Rapid passage was possible because highly lignified browse when masti\u00ad cated, shattered into large cuboidal particles (Mertens 1973, Milchunas et al. 1978) suit\u00ad able for passage. Renecker and Hudson substantiated the earlier speculation of Schwartz etal. (1980). Reneckerand Hudson (1990) fed aspen browse, alfalfa hay (Medicagosativa) and grass haytothesethree ruminant species. They concluded that the ability ofbrowsing moose to extract adequate energy from forages of low asymptotic di\u00ad gestibility depended on rapid passage rate. Moose were most sensitive to diet, propelling browse diets more rapidly than cattle, but retaining grass hay and lucerne longer than either wapiti or cattle. Rapid passage of browse was achieved by propelling large par\u00ad ticles through the rumen. Based on critical 147 NUTRITIONAL OF MOOSE- SCHW AR1Z ALCES SUPPLEMENT 1 (1992) particle-size theory, threshold range ofpani\u00ad cleswashighestformoose(4.4-6.9mm)with the probability of passage increasing for high lignin ratios. In a similar study, Renecker et al. (1983) compared the digestive kinetics of grass/al\u00ad falfa, alfalfa, and alfalfa/browse mixtures in cattle, wapiti, and moose using the nylon bag technique. They demonstrated only slight differences in digestion of dry matter, sug\u00ad gesting that the fermentation environment in the three ruminants species was basically the same. Disappearance curves and asymptotes were nearly identical for all three forages among all three ruminants. Digestive effi\u00ad ciency appears to be regulated more by forage selection, rumination, gut morphology, and mechanisms controlling rate of passage than by the digestive kinetics of rumen fermenta\u00ad tion. There is a close association between the flow ofliquid and solid phases from the rumen of moose (Hubbert 1987, Renecker and Hud\u00ad son 1990). Hubbert (1987:49-55) discussed the rumen turnover times (RTI) of liquids and solids in cattle, domestic sheep and moose. His liquid-to-solid RTI ratios were 0.964 for moose, 0.788 for sheep, and 0.395 for cattle. Therefore, the liquid digesta phase in the grazer (cattle) flowed at a faster rate than the solids, whereas in the browser (moose) the differences were small; sheep are considered mixed feeders. Grazers retain solids longer because cellulose and hemicellulose require long digestion times whereas retention of highly lignified fiber contained in browse would be inefficient and costly. Moose have an adaptive digestive strat\u00ad egy to optimize energy intake. Diets are more digestible in spring and summer than in winter (Table3). Summerdietsarecomposedmainly of highly digestible leaves of deciduous browse, forbs, and aquatic plants. Intake rates are high and moose catabolize large quantities of fat. Winter diets are almost exclusively woody browse (Table 1), and low in digest-ibility; moose must metabolize fat to meet an energy deficit. Although summer and winter diets have different rates of digestion (Table 3), both contain undigestible lignin. Woody browse has a highly lignified cortex and most of the digestible components are contained in the outer bade and buds. Moose digest this outer material efficiently and propel the indi\u00ad gestible cortex rapidly. However if forage is limited,asinwinter,slowingtherateofpassage may be beneficial by allowing for some di\u00ad gestion of the woody browse cortex (Hubbert 1987). Seasonal Metabolism Seasonal metabolic rhythms occur in a number of northern wild ruminants including caribou (McEwan and Whitehead 1970), roe deer (Weiner 1977), white-tailed deer (Silver et al. 1969), mule deer (Freddy 1984, Parker and Robbins 1984), and wapiti (Lieb and Marcum 1979, Parlcer and Robbins 1984). Moose, like other northern ruminants, have a cyclical metabolic rate, with a peak in sum\u00ad mer and a nadir in winter (Regelin et al. 1985, Renecker and Hudson 1986b). Changes in seasonal metabolism are related to changes in feed intake and body weight (Schwartz et al. 1984, Renecker and Hudson 1985, Hubbert 1987), which probably reflects changes in mass of metabolically active tissues like the liver and digestive system (Arnold 1985). Body condition, particularly fat reserves, may also affect metabolism independent of plane of nutrition and endogenous rhythms (Reid and Robb 1971, Byers et al. 1989). Estimates of theoretical basal metabo\u00ad kcal/kg al. 1988a) are close to the interspecific mean of 70 kcal/kg BW0\u00b77s provided by Kleiber (1975). Seasonal Activity Like most ruminants, moose spend most 148 ALCES SUPPLEMENT 1 (1992) SCHWARTZ- NUTRITIONAL ADAPTATIONS OF MOOSE of the day eating and ruminating (Risenhoover 1986, Renecker and Hudson 1989, Van Ballenberghe and Miquelle 1990). These activities vary seasonally (Renecker and Hudson 1989) with forage abundance, qual\u00ad ity, digestibility, and passage rate. Feeding bouts are shorter during summer when forage availability and digestibility are high (Risenhoover 1986, Renecker and Hudson 1989, Van BallenBerghe and Miquelle 1990) than during winter. Moose in Denali National park were active 12.8 hours/day in summer (Van Ballenberghe and Miquelle 1990) but only 5.8 hours/day in winter (Risenhoover 1986); this represents a 2.2-fold increase in the daily activity period from winter to sum\u00ad mer. The duration of rumination bouts and total daily rumination time is significantly related to both cell wall constituents in the diet and digestible dry matter intake (Renecker and Hudson 1989). Moose ruminate longer and more intensively in winter when forage fiber is high (Renecker and Husdon 1989), which may limit food intake (Risenhoover 1986). Because lignin is resistant to digestion, intensive rumination is the means by which moose breakdown forage to a size capable of passage. The spatial arrangement of forage has a strong effect on time spent feeding. Intake of dry matter is positively related to forage density and inversely related to search time (Risenhoover 1986, Renecker 1987). On an annual basis search effort appeared to be an important component of foraging (Renecker 1987). Moose tend to increase forage intake by selecting habitats rich in food (Risenhoover 1987). Body Composition Changes in body composition and fat metabolism in moose are a dynamic process. Large gains and depletions are associated with the summer flush of forage and winter declines in food availability and quality, re-spectively. Seasonal weight dynamics of moose have been associated with reduced diet quality and forage availability (Renecker and Hudson 1986b, Schwartz et al. 1981b). Es\u00ad timates of body composition of moose (Schwartz et al. 1988b) suggest that moose enter winter with large amounts of body fat (20-26% ). There are vast differences between males and females (Schwartz et ai1988b). Males lose large amounts of body fat during the rut (Sep.-Oct.) because they quit eating (Schwartz et al. 1984). Females continue to improve body composition until early winter (Schwartz et al. 1984, 1988b, Renecker and Hudson 1986b) and then loose body mass and fat Stored body fat and protein represent the currencies that allow moose to survive a win\u00ad ter energy deficit. Fat and protein are metabo\u00ad lized during winter and used to supplement the energy deficit associated with reduced intakes. Energy balance then influences sur\u00ad vival. Summer ranges govern fattening whereas winter ranges dictate depletions. Excesses in energy during summer influence reproduction; animals on high quality range breed earlier and tend to produce more twins (Peterson 1955,Franzmann 1978,Franzmann and Schwartz 1985). Protein and Energy Requirements Protein and energy are considered by many people to be themajorlimitingnutrients within the environment (Moen 1973, Wallmo et al. 1977). Estimates of energy requirements for maintenance of moose during winter (131 kcallkg BW0\u00b775/day of metabolizable energy) (Schwartz et al. 1988a) are similar to those of white-tailed deer (Ullrey et a/1969, 1970). Similarly, the main\u00ad (0.627 g/kg BW0\u00b775/day) for moose (Schwartz et al. 1987a) was within the range reported by Robbins (1983:159) for several species of wild ruminants. These data suggest that moose nutrient requirements are similar to other ruminants. 149 NUTRITIONAL ADAPTIONS OF MOOSE- SCHW AR1Z ALCES SUPPLEMENT 1 (1992) Strategies for Survival Selective processes operating on the moose have resulted in an organism that is adapted to the northern environment Some of these adaptations are reflected in the nutri\u00ad tional strategies that the animal employs to survive and reproduce. Diet choices are mainly leaves and stems of woody browse. These foods predominate in the boreal forest. Moose are selective feeders spending mostoftheirtime eating and ruminating in habitats rich in available forage. Their digestive system is adapted to process the woody browse diet they consume. By taking large bites and chewing their foods for long periods the material is broken down into particles capable of passing quickly out of the rumen. Diet fiber is high in lignin and is not retained in the rumen. Moose have high metabolic rates and are hyperphagic in summer when food quality and availability are high. The opposite is true in winter. Energy and protein requirements are similar to other ruminants. Fat reserves are cyclic and reflect sea\u00ad sonalrhythms of intake and metabolism. These rhythms appear to be controlled by feedback mechanisms linking body condition and fat reserves (Arnold 1985). Arnold (1985:82) reviewed the mechanics of intake control and stated that \"long term stability of energy balance is thought to be controlled by the size of the fat reserves\", and that \"many species in temperate and arctic areas appear not to have stability in energy balance even in a constant nutritional environment.\" Arnold (1985:97- 98) further stated that \"the regulation of for\u00ad age intake by free-ranging wild herbivores is through both internal controls concerned with digestion, rate of passage of digesta through the digestive system, and set points probably including energy balance and body condi- tion.\" Schwartz et al. (1988a) proposed the fol\u00ad lowing for moose, based on their observations with captive animals. When available, moose consume large quantities of high quality food during summer. Body condition peaks in early fall prior to the rut for bulls. Peak body condition for females occurs latter and is associated with natural declines in forage quality and availability. Peaks in body condi\u00ad tion activate mechanisms (set point) which depress intake. Depressed intake occurs in captivity even when animals are offered high quality food ad libitum. Reductions in intake occur in the wild concomitantly with natural declines in food quality and availability. Decreased intake results in a lower metabolic rate (Hubben 1987) and a shift to a negative energy balance. Body stores are depleted to a low in body condition (set point) in spring. The process then reverses. Set points, which result in metabolic shifts, correspond with environmental changes in food quality and availability (Regelin et al. 1987, Renecker 1987,ReneckerandHudson 1988). Set points vary with individuals and level of intake. Body condition likely influences intake dur\u00ad ingwinter. Ifthelowersetpointisreached prior to change in food availability (i.e., green-up), animals in the wild starved to death. However under confined conditions where food is available, moose that reached the lower set point prior to spring increase intake, while moose in good condition (above the set point) do not (Schwanz et al. 1988a). These mechanisms are not rigidly fixed and exhibit plasticity when animals are stressed. The annual cycle of food intake, fat me\u00ad tabolism, metabolic rate, and body mass dy\u00ad namics is not driven simply by food quality and availability in the environment. It rep\u00ad resents a complex interaction between inter\u00ad nal physiological regulators and the external environment. Physical condition of moose is keyed to environmental quality, but deeply rooted in physiological and morphological adaptations of the species. Nutritional energetics plays an important role in the sur\u00ad vival of individual moose which ultimately influences population dynamics and survival 150 ALCES SUPPLEMENf 1 (1992) SCHWARTZ- NUfRITIONAL ADAPTATIONS OF MOOSE of the species.
