All rights reserved. 19 November 2021Table of ContentsThe Frontiers of Medical Research2On the shoulders of giants Medicine\u2014and the science behind it\u2014are advancing quickly. Genomes can be routinely sequenced, certain cancers cured, pandemics attenuated, and the molecular underpinnings of individual cells understood. From the infrastructure and tools to generate and capitalize on enormous datasets, to the ability to edit genetic material, to a more granular and nuanced understanding of the immune system, we now find in the lab and the clinic what was not that long ago found only in science fiction. If these breakthroughs herald the future of health care, what will that future look like? One thing is for certain: It will include a substantial use of data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). Pathologists are now training AI-driven algorithms with digitalized tissues to allow faster, more objective, and more quantitatively accurate diagnoses. AI can also inform long-term strategic decision making to enable the most effective use of resources in a pandemic such as that caused by COVID-19. T echnological advances are also enabling improved screening of potential drugs, the identification of drug targets, and the screening of patients who will most greatly benefit from a particular course of treatment\u2014getting us a few steps closer to truly personalized therapies. The application of new technologies, together with AI, will allow for earlier, more accurate prediction of adverse side effects, and identification of new and better ways of synthesizing drugs. It may soon allow development of drugs for targets now considered undruggable. Y et it is not only dramatic, front-page advances that drive medicine and medical research forward. New evidence-based ways of viewing and interacting with patients\u2014including novel screening regimens as well as health-promotion interventions aimed at stemming preventable diseases\u2014can impact health outcomes. We are learning more about how the environment, in conjunction with a patient's genetic makeup, helps determine the biology of health and disease. Researchers are working together to collaborate with each other's intellectual silos, and finding ways to integrate emerging technologies and educational insights into changing how the next generation of practitioners is screened, selected, and mentored, to ensure they are equipped to serve and innovate in accordance with tomorrow's needs and values. This includes awareness of systemic issues that lead to health inequity, a shortened lifespan, and degraded quality of life. The excitement and optimism around the remarkable progress in medical research and treatment is what inspired the creation of this supplement. The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in partnership with Science/AAAS, is spotlighting just some of the extraordinary work being done by researchers and clinicians at the frontiers of medical research. Their hard work and innovative spirit will continue to drive advancements in patient-centered health care, now and into the future. Sean Sanders, Ph.D. Custom Publishing Office Science/AAAS The Frontiers of Medical Research3The future is now: The accelerating transformation of medicine This Science supplement presents a panorama of the frontiers of biomedical exploration. Never before has this vista been so expansive and exciting as today, as we stand on the cusp of a transformative era of discovery that has the potential to radically advance medicine. The next decade is rich with opportunities for us to recognize disease earlier and with greater precision, to address it more effectively, and ultimately to prevent its occurrence. A technological revolution has empowered researchers to see deeper into the human body to uncover the etiology and progression of disease. Breakthroughs in DNA sequencing and transcriptomics, for example, are revealing the intricate genetic, epigenetic, and cellular patterns underlying disease, and generating insights that will help solve our most challenging biomedical puzzles and enable the discovery of efficacious new therapies. In the following 17 brief survey articles, scientists and physicians from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai discuss the progress and possibilities within their fields of specialization, including artificial intelligence, cancer, cardiovascular medicine, genomics, immunology, exposomics, and neuroscience. T oday's biomedical frontiers hold great promise. T o fulfill this promise, we must continue advancing our scientific understanding and devise novel ways of attacking disease. This requires engaging more diverse and inclusive teams of researchers and clinicians who bring differing perspectives to scientific inquiry. Along with these priorities is the urgency of better harnessing data analytics and artificial intelligence to improve the functioning of hospitals and health care systems. We envision a world of medicine that is smarter, more equitable and inclusive, and more capable of healing and preventing disease. All this requires more commitment, collaboration, and creativity. The commitment to science must come in the form of robust research funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), the single most important source of financial support for biomedical research. Measured in inflation-adjusted dollars, NIH funding during fiscal year 2021 was >3% below that of 2003. The following articles stand as evidence in the case for substantially boosting NIH research funding. The future of medicine depends upon collaboration: active interdisciplinary cooperation across academic institutions and between academia, government, and industry. COVID-19 created an urgency that broke down barriers and enabled the development of assays, new treatments, and vaccines in record time. This historic response to the pandemic can serve as a model of collaboration. Advancing the frontiers of biomedicine also requires creativity. We need bold thinking from the best and most diverse explorers not only in basic biomedical, translational, and clinical science, but also in biomedical engineering and in physical and computational sciences. We invite you to join us on the frontiers of biomedicine by reading this inspiring collection of essays that portend sweeping improvements in human health and well-being. Dennis S.

Dennis S. Charney Eric J. NestlerThe Frontiers of Medical Research4ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEMS The advent of artificial intelligence in health care and its practical implementation Thomas J. Fuchs3,4,5*, Patricia Kovatch6,7, Emilia Bagiella2,4, Marta Filizola1,4, David Reich4,13 Our civilization is undergoing a fundamental transformation that will directly impact every single human being. One does not have to agree with Google's CEO that artificial intelligence (AI) is \"more profound than electricity or fire\" (1), but without a doubt, the impact of AI could eclipse advances from the Industrial Revolution, personal computing, and the internet combined. Health care and well-being, as fundamental human needs (2), are at the forefront of this transformation. In health care, this transformation is driven by an annual growth rate of medical data that exceeds all other global data sources, including financial services, manufacturing, media, and entertainment (3, 4). A single digitized microscopy slide, for example, with its millions of cells and morphological structures, contains more data than a full feature high-definition movie. Thus, the advent of AI in health care is not only driven but made necessary by this explosion of data. Concurrently, the statistical methods used to analyze and model biological and health care data have evolved rapidly, from classical linear models with a few parameters, to early machine learning models such as support vector machines and random forests that depended on manual feature engineering, to state- of-the-art, high-capacity deep-learning approaches with billions of parameters. Examples of the latter in health care include convolutional neural networks for pathology (5), dermatology (6), radiology (7), and drug discovery (8), and transformer models for medical language (9). A modern, secure, optimized (10, 11 ), high-performance computation and data science ecosystem is critical to training such AI systems and realizing their promise. Mount Sinai, for example, has invested significantly in building a comprehensive infrastructure to accelerate research in all biomedical domains based on over 20 petaflops of GPU and CPU compute power, 50 petabytes of storage, and over 100 terabytes of memory. A data commons called \"Data Ark\" (12 ) contains both public and private datasets, including electronic health record data along with imaging and genomic data. Initiatives like the Data Ark should be guided by the FAIR principles (13): making data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. For example, to help clinicians and researchers make data- driven decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic surge, new datasets were, and still are, made available daily to help track and better understand both individual and collective patient outcomes. An example of a discovery that leveraged this infrastructure was the determination that the origin of the COVID-19 epidemic in New York City arose predominately through untracked transmission between the United States and Europe. The workflows and processes for training such large-scale AI systems as well as their real-world deployment are developed in the new field of MLOps (machine learning operations). Especially useful for clinical deployment in a regulated environment, MLOps is crucial for guaranteeing that AI performs as intended. For modern health care systems, we are envisioning an \"Intelligent Fabric\" that underpins all efforts of biomedicine and health care. This Intelligent Fabric will be woven out of AI services that elevate and streamline the work of our nurses, physicians, scientists, and administrators. At the most basic level, we will continue to leverage our existing productivity and decision support tools for diagnosis, treatment, and workflow optimization; and we will connect and interweave these tools together to improve the overall patient journey and optimize the resources for an entire health system. Research analytics and mechanisms for multimodal data integration are not yet built into the modern health care environment. As a result, even health systems that have invested heavily in data science infrastructure remain largely in the dark regarding workflows and outcomes within their walls. At the hospital level, the Intelligent Fabric will overcome this issue by providing insight into the whole system from intertwined AI threads. The aim is to inform local, tactical decision making with information collected from the whole health system. This will empower local actions to be more in tune with other activities taking place throughout the health system, and will also enable long-term strategic decision making for the care of single patients as well as for the entire health care system. The COVID-19 pandemic provides one example of how the Intelligent Fabric is crucial for improving health care delivery: Such a massive, unexpected influx of critically ill patients could easily overwhelm a health care system, necessitating streamlined diagnosis and efficient patient movements between emergency rooms, intensive care units, and other specialized treatment areas. The Intelligent Fabric would greatly assist with system-wide tracking, strategic planning, and proficient execution for situations with large-scale, real-time requirements such as these. For patients, such an Intelligent Fabric extends beyond improved care within the walls of a health care system: AI companions will also guide them toward disease prevention and healthier living, resulting in enhanced well-being. Intelligent tools will chaperone patients to their appointments and assist with rehabilitation after they return home. The Intelligent Fabric will envelope them with personalized services offering not only the reassuring feeling of being continuously cared for by a health system, but more importantly the confidence that comes with knowing they will get personalized treatment when they are in need of it and will have an active role in the decision-making process.1Department of Pharmacological Sciences and Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences; 2Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy; 3Department of Pathology, Molecular and Cell-Based Medicine; 4Department of AI and Human Health; 5Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai; 6 Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences; 7Scientific Computing and Data; 8Departments of Cardiology, Medicine, Health Science 9Department of Information Technology; 10Department of Dermatology; 11Department of and Engineering and Imaging Institute; 13Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY *Corresponding author: thomas.fuchs.ai@mssm.eduThe Frontiers of Medical Research5ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEMS On the evolution of learning health systems Alexander W. Charney1*, Girish N. Nadkarni1, Robert Freeman1, Patricia Kovatch2, Kristin Myers3, David Reich4 While biomedical research and clinical practice have leaped to new heights, the concept of a learning health system seems stuck in a time warp. Opportunities to fully embed data analytics into daily clinical practice to continuously improve quality of care (1) have been missed time and again. Indeed, more than half a century ago, a chief architect of the concept, Guy Octo Barnett, M.D., wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine: \"The use of computers would, it was held, allow the rapid and accurate collection and retrieval of all clinical information, perform automatic diagnosis, [...] interpret all laboratory tests immediately, and replace the telephone and the medical record by fulfilling their functions\" (2). Five decades later, the contemporary feel of these words is cause for serious contemplation: No true learning health system yet exists. Given this history of underachievement, the guiding principle of Pragmatic Innovation, which we will explore in this essay, can be highly useful in today's health system decision making. First, we touch upon the evolution of learning health systems during this period. The emergence of the electronic medical record (EMR) as the backbone of health care delivery has been the most critical development in the evolution of learning health systems to date. The predecessors to modern EMRs were computer programs written to streamline specific care processes in specific clinical settings (e.g., the ordering of laboratory tests in a hospital). Their developers\u2014physicians and researchers in academic medical centers\u2014found that a single program to manage all processes was impractical, so they instead designed a \"modular system\" with different programs for each process (2). Over time, the modularity of these systems became highly complex, such that the modern EMR is not simply a log of events as its name might suggest, but rather a virtual space where dozens of independent databases are interconnected to appear to the user as a one-stop shop where tests are ordered, results reported, medications prescribed, and clinicians' thoughts recorded. In parallel to the emergence of EMRs have been efforts to develop clinical decision support tools, which aim to automate diagnosis and predict clinical events. An early example was INTERNIST-1, painstakingly programmed over the course of decades to emulate the ability of a physician to diagnose At Mount Sinai, practical implementation is driven by integrated efforts across the BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute (BMEII), the Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai (HPI-MS), the Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine (IPM), and Mount Sinai Centers for Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, and Clinical Intelligence. A new Department of AI and Human Health, the first of its kind located within a medical school in the United States, provides an academic home for AI faculty, enhances Master's and Ph.D. training opportunities (14 ), and facilitates cross-cutting enterprises dedicated to improving patient care through pioneering innovations and technologies. Developing AI for patient care is a highly challenging task that comes with many responsibilities, ranging from compliance to patient consent, privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity. Wide-ranging AI ethics initiatives and training should ensure that the development, evaluation, validation, and use of AI is trustworthy, and that AI algorithms for clinical care are safe, effective, and equitable. The World Health Organization has published broad guidance on approaching these challenges (15). A critical role in assuring this is assigned to regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. While the hype around new technologies is often distracting, in reality, at the time of writing, only a single AI is approved by the FDA for clinical use in pathology. We hope that the vision laid out in this essay will help modern health care systems and the scientific community in developing, building, and deploying AI in clinical practice, to assure that every patient can benefit from these new and promising technologies.

The earliest iterations of such tools never made it into clinical practice, and their modern derivatives have not had the transformative impact that was promised. Weaknesses in the digital infrastructure of modern health systems have been laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic. As frontline providers during this era, we have seen at least four answers to the question Dr. Barnett posed in his time: \"What is the cause of this state of underachievement when the need is so great, and the technology supposedly so powerful?\" (2). First, interconnecting the nodes of modular data in a large health system is both a science and an art, and as a result, these systems are slow to engage. In the years immediately preceding the pandemic, this was a well-known inconvenience, with data once memorably described as \"balkanized along organizational boundaries\" (4). This inconvenience became a missed opportunity of tragic proportions as health systems were strained to the brink of collapse, and as data to guide action could have actually saved lives. Second, even with the nodes connected, research analytics is not built into the modern health care environment. To EMR users, it comes as a surprise to learn that the data they see on a single screen in the EMR resides in dozens of databases on the backend that are not readily accessible for researchers who want to investigate the efficacy of care delivery at the population level. Third, most predictive and other artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms are not properly validated before being deployed, which may lead to more harm than benefit for the patients and result in physicians developing the habit of ignoring such tools as at best a useless annoyance, and at worst a dangerous detriment to care delivery (5). Finally, best practices for dealing with ethical considerations and cybersecurity are often not in place at baseline. Under high-stakes situations where time is of the essence, careful consideration of these complex topics delays decisive action.In trying to meet the above challenges, we have found that the guiding principle of Pragmatic Innovation pays rich dividends. Specifically, we strive to apply this principle when making decisions in the following key areas: Infrastructure. A modern, secure, high-performance computational and data science ecosystem is critical in the evolution of learning health systems. The solution will differ according to the needs of each institution, and local experts should be identified and tasked with building the requisite infrastructure on premise or buying it in the cloud, depending on the appropriate context. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. Centralizing talent. In the modern health care environment, too often lines are drawn between information technology and data science, quality improvement and research analytics, and data engineers and clinical informaticists. In contrast, every team member in the groups that reshaped health care around EMRs had the same title: \"problem solver\" (2). A consequence of the current organizational structure is a systematic deprioritizing of activities that fall under the umbrella of research analytics, which are the activities most necessary for learning health systems to evolve. These dividing lines between subtly distinct data-centered teams within health care organizations must be replaced with centers of \"clinical intelligence\" that bring all of the relevant talent under one umbrella. Stakeholder engagement and education. There are many stakeholders in the evolution of learning health systems. These include health care providers, health system leadership, and patients. As we continue to build data-driven clinical tools using advanced analytic techniques such as artificial intelligence, their input must be sought. Most physicians view EMR workflows as an unwanted addition to their administrative burden (6). For adoption of data-driven tools, therefore, an upfront investment is needed to educate clinicians on the basic underlying science and to demonstrate to them the concrete evidence of their value Integrate Multimodal Data Types to Generate Rapid InsightsLeverage Multimodal Data to Develop Clinical Solutions Prospectively Validate and Operationalize Clinical Solutions to Improve Patient Care EHR Clinical Notes Wave FormMultiomics Imaging Harmonized DataPredictive Models Clinical Tools 1 Validation and Calibration Workflow IntegrationClinical Deployment Prospectively Test FIGURE 1.

The Frontiers of Medical Research7BIOMEDICAL EDUCATION The future of medical, biomedical, and graduate medical education: We will reap what we sow Marta Filizola1*, I. Michael Leitman2*, David Muller2* More than 110 years after the Abraham Flexner report (1), medical, biomedical, and graduate medical education continue to evolve. Yet a transformational change of the methodologies used generations ago has not occurred, despite the disruption created by the flood of new scientific information and the ability to harness massive amounts of data produced by increasingly complex health care systems. As the proper training of scientists and physicians has profound implications for the future of our species and planet, what we teach, how we teach, and who does the teaching must be fundamentally reimagined, not incrementally tweaked. To enable future breakthrough discoveries that can be rapidly translated into clinical practice and boundless medical and social benefits, we must integrate new scientific knowledge and technological advances into education in a manner that is seamless, cognitively efficient, and values the dignity of every human life. Despite their differences, the foundation of Ph.D., Master's, and M.D. degrees, and board certification following residency or fellowship, should be governed by core principles that include a rigorous, forward-thinking science education that is bold and creative, not risk averse; a learning and training environment that is nurturing and encourages growth and independent thought; and an approach to equity and justice that eliminates the racism and disparities in privilege that define much of society. Table 1 describes some of the needs and challenges of science instruction, and some proposed action plans. For instance, the wealth of scientific information produced by advanced genomic, biochemical, and biophysical technologies risks causing cognitive overload if taught using classic faculty- driven, classroom-based teaching modalities. Studies have argued in favor of replacing traditional lecturing with active learning to maximize retention and performance (2). The way information is presented also appears to play an important role in the immediate translation of complex information into working memory, as demonstrated, for example, by the positive impact of medical holography in basic anatomy training (3). High- definition, three-dimensional virtual reality (VR)/augmented reality (AR) environments and devices, as well as simulators assisted by artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning tools and algorithms, are revolutionizing science and clinical practice (4) and can have the same impact on education, as seen in surgical training (5), social cognition training, brain damage assessment and rehabilitation, pain management, and drug discovery (6). Challenges associated with the use of VR and AR for both basic research and education include the paucity of content and the difficulty of translating observations into quantitative information. Simulation, on the other hand, has already demonstrated improved accuracy, efficiency, and speed of technical skills in operative outcomes, and has enhanced teamwork, especially related to high-risk but rare events such 1Department of Pharmacological Sciences and Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 2Department of Medical Education, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, representative patient advisory groups should also have a voice at all steps in this evolution. Prospective validation and randomized testing. Data science approaches that are not validated or have built-in biases have the potential to cause significant harm when deployed in clinical settings (8). Appropriate governance is therefore key, with the inclusion of ethics experts to ensure that patient welfare is always paramount. Any models built should be prospectively validated to ensure no bias, and if bias is detected, it should be corrected. Models and clinical tools should be tested in a randomized, controlled fashion to ensure benefit, using the same rigorous standard currently in place when evaluating an experimental pharmacological intervention. These steps are presented in Figure 1. In this essay, we have presented achievements to date, challenges ahead, and a roadmap for realizing the complete evolution of learning health systems. With the requisite knowledge, resources, and technology at our disposal, and respect for the difficulty of the task at hand, let's get to work. References 1 . L. M. Etheredge, Health Aff.

We must continue to investigate how and why certain methods of instruction augment cognitive performance, thus evaluating their impact and justifying their further development. Understandably, further development of robotic simulators and other emerging technologies in clinical medicine (e.g., deep learning capabilities, 5G-enabled devices, tricorders, and wearables, among others) will require both educators and learners with quantitative undergraduate degrees and solid computational skills, but also an entrepreneurial attitude and a deep understanding of the culture, missions, and infrastructure of academic health centers and complex health systems. As individuals have different talents, the solution cannot be found in providing foundational training in a variety of different disciplines to a single individual, especially in a medical center where teaching is at the graduate rather than undergraduate level. For example, at Mount Sinai, we have a long history of building interdisciplinary teams by establishing alternative pathways to careers in medicine and biomedical sciences that, despite bypassing many of the traditional premedical (8) and biomedical science requirements, continue to produce outstanding graduates from diverse backgrounds. This includes the Humanities and Medicine Program, which was established in 1987; FlexMed (9), which expanded this early assurance pathway beyond humanities majors; and the recent Ph.D. concentration in AI and emerging technologies, which exclusively recruits students with quantitative and technical backgrounds. We believe that progress in biomedicine is contingent upon nurturing collegial environments of experts across numerous disciplines, from computational fields to the humanities, as well as the ability to attract and retain domain experts who are in high demand in other industries. Roots, sustenance, and soil If transformational change in education constitutes the roots of this endeavor, and education research is its sustenance, then the learning environment is the soil that must provide the rich substrate for preparing graduates whose careers will span the 21st century. Whom we teach and train will, over time, drive the most profound changes in medicine and biomedical research, as the coming generations of scientists and physicians replace us and refine our values and core principles. Profound changes in the educational environment have increasingly focused on the experience of learners and their desire to impact society beyond the immediate benefits of scientific discovery, and the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. In recent years, the push for holistic review of candidates that looks beyond GRE, MCAT, and USMLE scores has slowly attracted a more diverse cohort of candidates to medical and graduate schools (8, 10). Following research-driven recommendations (11 ), the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Mount Sinai dropped the GRE score requirement for Ph.D. applications in 2018 and continues to track training outcomes and admissions practices to guide the holistic evaluation of candidates.

TABLE 1. The future of biomedical science instruction. The Frontiers of Medical Research9CANCER The fight against cancer: Looking back, looking ahead\u201450 years of progress Nina Bhardwaj1,2, Carlos Cordon Cardo1,3, Ramon Parsons1,4*, Joseph Sparano1,2 It has been 50 years since the National Cancer Act was signed into law in 1971, which President Richard Nixon described as the U.S. commitment to a \"war on cancer. \" Over the ensuing decades, this infusion of funding has led to an improved understanding of the causes and biology of many cancers in the laboratory, and to better prevention, screening, and treatment in the clinic. Cancer mortality rates have decreased by nearly one- third since 1971, providing a tangible return on that investment (1 ). Although much of that decline has been due to reductions in smoking and more widespread and earlier cancer screening, improvements in treatment have also contributed to the long- term declines in death from lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, which are the four leading cancers in the United States. New drugs, new options Given the growing importance of further improving cancer therapeutics, clinical trials have played a critical role in improving outcomes. Such trials increasingly translate basic science discoveries made in the laboratory into tangible benefits in the clinic. For example, 410 novel cancer drugs were approved by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration over the past decade, including 53 in 2020 alone (2). Entirely new classes of agents have emerged as a direct result of basic science discoveries and emerging technologies, including antibody-drug conjugates, immune checkpoint inhibitors, bispecific T-cell engaging antibodies, and engineered cellular therapy, to name a few. Concurrent with the plethora of new cancer therapeutics has been the rapid evolution of diagnostic molecular tests that identify which individuals benefit 1Tisch Cancer Institute at Mount Sinai, 2Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, 3Department of Pathology, 4Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY *Corresponding author: ramon.parsons@mssm.eduapplications, screenings, and interview processes, we will continue to improve admission practices for all of our programs. Regardless of the approach, we are committed to identifying and eliminating biases based on resources, privilege, and social capital, as well as to recruiting student and trainee cohorts who reflect our national race, gender, and socioeconomic demographics (12 ). As learners enter the field from increasingly diverse and disadvantaged backgrounds, they will bring with them new ways of thinking about health and illness, new approaches to solving problems, and new strategies for sharing, collaborating, and disseminating their work. They will steer science and medicine more intently toward addressing the social determinants, social risk factors, and social needs of patients and populations. As educators, we have an obligation to provide the best educational experience to all of our trainees, which includes attention to their well-being. This may require offering and evaluating training in time management, communication, leadership, resilience, cultural diversity, and overcoming imposter syndrome. Similarly, we must continue to investigate and provide training in the necessary skills today's mentors must possess to address cultural diversity within research-mentoring relationships (13, 14 ). Our contribution to the rich substrate of academic health centers includes accelerating the shift away from a culture of bullying and mistreatment that has long been accepted as the norm in academic medicine (15), a culture that has tolerated interpersonal and academic behaviors that negatively impact creativity, productivity, camaraderie, and the joy of our work. Most ubiquitous are racism and gender bias, and the outcome has been a crisis of burnout, depression, anxiety, and attrition in our ranks. The cycle of negative behaviors that current faculty experienced from their teachers, mentors, and peers during their own professional development can be broken by establishing an environment that encourages reporting, embraces restorative justice, and confronts head-on the atmosphere of fear of retaliation, real and perceived, that permeates our professional lives. This will yield enormous returns in scientific breakthroughs driven by diversity of thought and an approach to mentorship that is mutually beneficial and enlightening. Promoting a learning environment that rewards excellence in teaching and mentorship, positive role modeling, and equity, instead of hierarchy, tradition, \"paying-your-dues, \" and abuse, will enable a new generation of empowered physicians and scientists to make the most of what the current scientific revolution has to offer.

Pipeline for the analysis of the tumor microenvironment (TME) to develop clinical applications for patients. most from specific therapies, facilitating ever-greater therapeutic precision. The progress in cancer therapy and diagnostics is expected to continue and even accelerate with the development of new technologies. Although therapeutic clinical trials leading to regulatory approval are generally driven by the pharmaceutical industry, federally funded efforts sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) have also made major contributions to reducing morbidity and mortality from cancer. NCI supports a robust basic science and clinical research network through its 71 NCI- designated cancer centers and seven NCI-funded research bases that plan and coordinate cancer clinical trials at over 1,000 academic and community sites participating in the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) (3). NCI-sponsored trials often address questions that would never be tackled by the pharmaceutical industry, bringing added value. For example, two NCI-sponsored trials in early stage breast cancer, called TAILORx and RxPonder, determined that the majority of women with the most common type of breast cancer could be spared adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery when guided by a diagnostic assay (4, 5). Mount Sinai has a long tradition of clinical trial research that has led to advances in the care of cancer patients. Recent notable success has been achieved in the area of bladder cancer and multiple myeloma, where Tisch Cancer Institute (TCI) investigators took the lead in development of practice-changing therapy (6, 7). The hunt for new targets Fifty years of cancer research has led to the discovery of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and to the recognition that mutations and epigenetic changes in these genes participate in the initiation and progression of cancer not only at the cancer-cell level but also by influencing the surrounding cells and tissue. These cancer genes encode proteins that are potential targets for therapy; however, they currently are or have been considered \"undruggable. \" Despite this challenge, many groups including TCI are actively engaged in the study of cancer pathways these cancer proteins has led to FDA-approved drugs for some targets such as EGFR, BRAF, and CDK4, and novel drug-like tools and drug combinations for others that show promise in preclinical cancer studies (and sometimes human clinical trials) because of their ability to specifically target and inhibit tumor growth in a predictable way based upon the mutation state of a signaling pathway or the expression of a biomarker. Recent examples from TCI include new small- molecule inhibitors and drug combinations that inhibit BRAF/ MEK, PI3K, and MDM2, providing therapeutic benefit in different cancer settings (8-10). Substantial efforts are underway to explore the epigenetic regulation of gene expression that occurs within chromatin. These include efforts in chromatin remodeling and RNA transcription initiation, elongation, splicing, and discovery of noncoding RNAs that modulate tumor growth (11- 14). Finally, the field is working to understand tumor dormancy and microenvironmental signals that activate and suppress the growth of metastatic cells (15). Targeting tumor-cell driver genes that encode protein kinases has led to therapeutic benefit for some cancers through the use of kinase inhibitors, as has the development of DNA repair inhibitors for the treatment of cancers with BRCA mutations. However, new small molecules that can degrade kinases and other proteins that drive cancer growth and metastases will lead to new therapeutic options for previously undruggable targets. Recent highlights from TCI include the development of novel degraders of EGFR, MEK, AKT, EZH2, and CDK4 proteins ( 16-18). In addition, replacement of tumor suppressors such as RB, p53, and PTEN has not been feasible in the past, but advances in gene editing should lead to new therapies in this arena as well. Improving screening and diagnosis Fifty years of improvements in the analysis and detection of cancer have also led to much better diagnostic tools and improved cancer screening. The fields of pathology and oncology are embracing cutting-edge, multidimensional diagnostic approaches to classify disease, inform treatment decisions, and train the next generation of academic pathologists. Descriptive anatomic and tissue studies categorizing patients into broad disease types are being refined by more objective molecular analyses aimed at defining individual patient and tumor characteristics. Additionally, the use of cell-based diagnosis is growing, with innovative technologies such as single-cell genotype/phenotype assessments generating highly accurate diagnostics and supporting the now- established cell-based therapeutics for immune modulation. \"Digital pathology\" is becoming routine, enabling remote expert consultation and more interactive scholarly activities, including multidisciplinary conferences that can now be led The Frontiers of Medical Research11by the diagnostician. Digitalized tissue slide banks of images are being used to train and validate artificial intelligence (AI)- driven algorithms, which in turn support the increasing need for objective and quantitative morphometric analysis for more accurate grading and staging of neoplastic diseases (19). In parallel, new developments in clinical pathology and laboratory medicine are being implemented in response to the pursuit of a liquid biopsy platform. This includes the use of mass spectrometry for the measurement of innumerable analytes, such as metabolites and drugs, in a variety of sample types (e.g., serum, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid). A more novel approach involves nuclear magnetic resonance to profile body fluids, encompassing the study of lipid panels, among others. The rapidly growing field of molecular pathology capitalizes on advances in both tissue and body fluid assessment, aided in large part by microfluidics and nanotechnology. Somatic genetics is becoming the cornerstone of diagnostic and prognostic classification of cancers, both for solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Profiling of circulating tumor cells and cell-free nucleic acids, along with extracellular vesicles (e.g., exosomes), will bring the next generation of biomarkers. Pathology is being redefined at the core of patient management and individualized medicine. By integrating complex biochemical, immunological, molecular, and genetic tests, including the systematic application of AI, pathology diagnostics now provide some of the most objective measurements in clinical medicine and are being integrated with image-based methods to improve early detection and measurement of tumor progression. This invaluable information is promoting the development of evidence-based treatment protocols and personalized strategies, optimizing clinical outcomes, and providing cost-effective health care. Recognition that tumors proactively disable the immune system has led to the development of immunotherapies that have revolutionized cancer treatment through reversal of immune suppression and restoration of immune balance. The effectiveness of checkpoint inhibitors for cancers is a major milestone for the field, however, durable and complete regression has not yet been realized, indicating the persistence of additional pathways of immune dysregulation. We and others are addressing these challenges and expanding the current armamentarium of immune therapies through creation of state- of-the-art facilities to monitor immune function and generate vaccines for cancer patients; comprehensive characterization of mechanisms underlying immune resistance in the tumor microenvironment (TME); establishment of preclinical models to test and validate correlates of resistance; and application of these discoveries into the clinic (Figure 1). The importance of biological markers A current goal for the field is to develop predictive biomarkers for detecting and monitoring graft-versus-host disease that can occur after a bone marrow transplant. These biomarkers hold promise for the better management of this potentially fatal occurrence and therefore ensure better outcomes for cancer patients who require a bone marrow transplant. Another goal is to create cancer-specific personalized \"atlases\" that examine the crosstalk between tumor, tumor stroma, and immune cells to characterize immune-resistant TMEs. Through application of functional genomics, proteomics, and cellular characterization, maps of cancers (e.g., bladder, glioblastoma multiforme, lung, and melanoma) have divulged the immune-modulating effects of subclasses of innate and adaptive immune cells. At the end of one spectrum, we have identified macrophage subsets that drive early tumor invasiveness, regulatory T-cell accumulation, and metastasis, and promote deleterious inflammation and angiogenesis (20 , 21). These cellular \"biomarkers\" have led to novel approaches to control tumor growth through their elimination/modulation in preclinical models and in the clinic (e.g., IL-4 signaling pathway, IL-1 blockade, IRAK4 inhibition, and MERTK inhibitors). At the opposite end of the spectrum, we have demonstrated the critical need for replenishing tumors with specific classes of dendritic cells (DCs), potent antigen-presenting cells essential for cross- presentation of tumor antigens to T cells. By enhancing their mobilization and infiltration into tumors, DCs promote antitumor immunity in humans, further propagated by checkpoint inhibitors and cancer vaccines. Natural killer (NK) cells, another class of innate immune cells, are essential for the recruitment of DCs into tumor sites and for first-line attack against tumor cells. NK cells can become progressively exhausted in the TME; therefore, to promote NK cell function, NK cell-based monoclonal antibody cancer immunotherapies have been developed that inhibit proteolytic cleavage of molecules that enhance tumor cell recognition (MICA A/B, CD16a) (22 ). Finally, genomic, molecular, and new pathways in the effector cytolytic T-cell arm: (1) new immune checkpoints amenable to treatment with monoclonal antibody blockade (e.g., LAG3, TIGIT) or killing pathways (fas-fasL) that can overcome immune escape. Together, these studies are informing the characterization of genomic, molecular, and cellular biomarkers of response to immune intervention in cancer and related disorders. Making it personal Tumor atlases are providing a new appreciation of how a particular individual tumor evades antitumor immunity, emphasizing the need to consider: (1) treating cancers early and (2) personalizing cancer immunotherapy. For example, TCI's Neoadjuvant Tumor Treatment program provides patients who have earlier-stage, potentially resectable cancers the opportunity to receive immunotherapy (usually in the form of checkpoint inhibitors plus another targeted agent) in a short interval prior to tumor resection. Studies are showing the impact of procuring cancer downstaging and even major pathological responses in melanoma, lung cancer, and liver cancer, respectively, setting the stage to broaden this platform of treatment to many cancer types and to identify biomarkers of response. In situ vaccination, namely modulating and activating a tumor site through injection of potent adjuvants or oncolytic viruses, renders a tumor its own \"vaccine factory. \" Investigators have shown the efficacy of such approaches in lymphoma, for example (23 ). Personalized cancer vaccine development is a major current effort for the field. For instance, the Personalized Genomic Vaccine (PGV) platform at TCI is an outcome of in-house science that uses in-house algorithms to predict patients' expressed The Frontiers of Medical Research12CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE Enhancing cardiovascular health throughout the lifespan: A critical need Valentin Fayad4 The circulatory\u2014or cardiovascular\u2014system, comprising the heart, blood, lymph, and vessels, carries oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients, cells, and their products across all tissues and organs in the body. Serving the body's transportation needs, the heart and vasculature are indispensable to the immune, metabolic, endocrine, hematopoietic, and nervous systems. A healthy life requires a robust and efficient cardiovascular function, yet many environmental and lifestyle factors can jeopardize and weaken it, increasing risk of disease. It is essential therefore to focus on cardiovascular health (CVH) throughout the lifespan, paying particular attention to childhood, middle age, and old age. We are leveraging Mount Sinai's rich history of discovery in cardiology with innovations in science and technology, and are committed to the idea that CVH needs to be understood if it is to be cultivated and enriched. Throughout life, the processes constituting CVH change as we age. Sleep, for example, strongly associates with heart health, but varies dramatically across the lifespan, generally diminishing in need over time. Comorbidities that accrue throughout our lives, whether acquired genetically or environmentally, will affect the cardiovascular system, and their specific influence 1Mount Sinai Heart, Mount Sinai Medical Center, and the Department of Medicine (Cardiology), Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 2Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), Madrid, Spain 3Cardiovascular Research Institute, and the Departments of Medicine (Cardiology) and Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 4BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, and the Departments of Radiology and Medicine (Cardiology), Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY *Corresponding author: valentin.fuster@mssm.edupersonalized genomic neoantigens. Ongoing trials in melanoma, glioblastoma, bladder cancer, multiple solid tumors, and multiple myeloma are showing early evidence of immunogenicity and correlation with clinical outcome in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, tumor treatment fields, or the adjuvant setting. Novel messenger RNA (mRNA) platforms are also being exploited in neoantigen vaccine formulations. The recognition and discovery of novel \"shared\" frameshift-derived neoantigens in high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) that correlate with response to immunotherapy, and myeloproliferative neoplasms (e.g., frameshifts in the calreticulin gene), respectively, are paving the way for development of personalized yet \"shared neoantigen\" vaccines. The next chapter for cancer immunology will augment functional genomics platforms to incorporate microbiome and metabolomic analyses to further define an individual's immune response to their cancer, demarcate how it might affect their prognosis, guide the treatment they receive, and predict their response to therapy. Cancer prevention and early detection are extremely important for reducing cancer mortality, and strides in this area have been made in improving screening for breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer nationally with contributions from TCI in all of these major areas. Notable recent TCI achievements in epidemiology and public health have included linking prostate inflammation to elevated prostate cancer incidence in 9/11/2001 first responders at the World Trade Center, identifying increased levels of insulin resistance among African American women with newly diagnosed breast cancer, and increasing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in teenagers (24 , 25). We are excited by all of the progress made in the past and by the momentum toward a future that can fulfill our mission to overcome cancer. References 1 . R. L. Siegel, K. D. Miller, H. E. Fuchs, A.

Deep phenotyping of cardiovascular disease throughout the lifespan will vary. Some cardiovascular diseases affect younger people disproportionately, while others hardly occur until old age. As aging is a process involving the interplay of environment and genetics as a function of time, it is essential to track the dynamics of CVH separately in children, middle-aged people, and the elderly. Mount Sinai is working closely with other institutions, including the National Centre for Cardiovascular Research in Madrid (CNIC), to track CVH in these three cohorts. The SI! Program for Cardiovascular Health Promotion in Early Childhood has been applied at all preschool levels in 24 schools, including 2,062 children, ages 3 to 5 years, to promote CVH among children using their proximal environment (school, teachers, and families). Lessons have been learned over 10 years of experience implementing the SI! Program for CVH promotion in preschool settings in three locations: Bogot\u00e1 (Colombia), Madrid (Spain), and Harlem (New York City, United States). Based on this experience, by matching rigorous efficacy studies with implementation science, we can now help bridge the divide between science and educational practice for nearly 50,000 children. It will require the integration of several factors: (1) multidisciplinary teams, (2) multidimensional educational programs, (3) multilevel interventions, (4) local program coordination and community engagement, and (5) scientific evaluation through randomized studies. The concept behind the program is that implementing effective health promotion interventions early in life may induce long-lasting, healthy behaviors that could help to curb the CVD epidemic (1-4 ). Atherosclerosis starts early in life and progresses silently for decades before manifesting as debilitating or fatal cardiovascular events, a fact that imposes a significant challenge to understanding the disease. Accordingly, early adulthood and middle age are important targets for investigating CVH. Recognizing that atherosclerosis does not simply affect the vessel wall but is also systemic invites the use of noninvasive methods to identify disease before clinical symptoms appear. In examining the effectiveness of adult intervention through primary and secondary prevention, the age range of 25-50 years appears to offer an opportunity to evaluate subclinical disease, about which we have been learning a significant amount through noninvasive imaging techniques. In two recent bioimaging studies, we assessed approximately 10,000 asymptomatic adults age >40 years using multimodality vascular imaging of the carotid and iliofemoral arteries using two- and three-dimensional ultrasound and of the coronary arteries with computed tomography techniques. Focusing on early adulthood and middle age, the multiple lines of clinical and experimental investigation elucidating the biology of CVH require sophisticated tools (1). This multidisciplinary science harnesses imaging modalities that have a long history in cardiology, such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET), along with the aforementioned computed tomography and ultrasound; in aggregate, these are used to visualize and characterize heart and vessel function as well as their interactions with other tissues and organs such as the brain, body fat, and others (3). We utilize classic flow cytometry and microscopy tools and augment them with genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and other 'omics approaches for highly detailed exploration of the systems' complexities (deep phenotyping; see Figure 1). We are leveraging the continuous monitoring of health and multimodal data collection throughout the lifespan. Specifically, we are The Frontiers of Medical Research14EXPOSOMICS Integrating exposomics into precision medicine and public health Robert O. Wright*, Kecia N. Carroll, Rosalind J. Wright Precision medicine, which now primarily utilizes genomic and electronic health record data, holds the potential to transform medical practice. Recent calls to expand the field's purview to encompass all factors that predict health (1-3 ) underscore the need to include environment (4, 5), as human health and disease are shaped by a range of lifelong exposures and their resultant biological responses. The emerging exposome concept addresses this complexity by studying the effects of all health-relevant environmental factors over the life course (6-8). The 20th-century concept of \"nature versus nurture\" needs to be tossed aside, as genetics and environment do not compete\u2014they work hand in hand through interactions in which our environment (i.e., where people are born, live, develop, learn, work, play, and age) triggers biological responses that are determined in part by our genetics in a lifelong, iterative process. However, there is not yet a systematic plan to integrate exposomics into precision medicine. Advances in computational science, medical informatics, remote sensing, geographical information systems, and analytical chemistry now provide powerful research tools to facilitate the incorporation of exposomics into precision medicine and public health (9-11 ). Understanding our environment is critical to advancing human health and eliminating health inequities. The broad- ranging effects of climate change consequent to rising global average temperatures, increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), associated extreme weather events (i.e., heat waves, droughts, floods, and hurricanes), and altered ecosystem functioning and biodiversity, have alarming potential to magnify toxic environmental exposures and amplify consequent health disparities (Figure 1) (12 ). Climate affects the exposome both directly and indirectly to influence the spatial and temporal distribution of infections, asthma, allergies, mental health, and dozens of other chronic diseases. Also, rates of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and neurodegenerative diseases, among other complex diseases, continue to rise with minority groups such as Blacks, Latinx, Native Americans, and Asian Americans experiencing increased disease morbidity and/or severity. Structural racism, including redlining, has segregated Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health and the Department of Pediatrics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY *Corresponding author: robert.wright@mssm.edu securely utilizing sensors, electronic medical records, laboratory tests, imaging data, self-reported information via mobile apps, genetic and molecular tests, and pathology. With artificial intelligence and machine learning, we are building and updating a \"digital twin\" or \"avatar\" from every subject throughout their lifespan (5, 6). A dominant focus in cardiovascular science and clinical cardiology involves elucidating and targeting processes that both precede and follow acute cardiovascular events, which typically, though not exclusively, occur later in life. The rupture or erosion of atherosclerotic plaques may give rise to myocardial infarction or stroke; those who survive such events have elevated risk for reinfarction and complications such as heart failure. Even though a wide array of therapeutics, devices, and surgical interventions are available and highly effective at mitigating risk, chronic cardiovascular disease, and the acute events that it precipitates, continue to claim lives. We must therefore gain a deeper and fundamental understanding of the circulatory system, and to do so, we must learn how the system responds to environmental perturbations and interacts with other organs and tissues (7). Current research devoted to CVH and disease connects the influence of the environment and modifiable risk factors with molecular, cellular, and tissue processes throughout the body. For instance, we are exploring how diet, sleep, exercise, and stress affect physiology, studying not only the heart and blood vessels, but also the contribution of critical nervous, immune, metabolic, and endocrine networks (8-11 ). Diseases of aging, including neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, are characterized by similar and convergent molecular pathways known to be important in classical vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. A systems biology (12 ) conceptual framework is guiding ongoing research at Mount Sinai and elsewhere, as the field seeks to integrate environmental inputs with interorgan communication that influences health and homeostasis. It is this explorative fusion of harnessing sophisticated tools to examine lifestyle, environment, and biology in the young, middle aged, and elderly, coupled with an increasing emphasis on salutogenesis (which focuses on the origins of health and well- being) (13) rather than disease exacerbation, that is poised to transform health care.

The systematic segregation of persons of color through redlining policies has significant public health implications (13). These environmental disparities go beyond pollution, particularly for indigenous populations, as cultural practices commonly involve local food and water, further exacerbating social inequities. Health inequities arise from variable\u2014and too often predictable\u2014imposed environments that link to social determinants of health. The geospatial diversity of the exposome underlies its key role in explaining health inequities. Broad categories of the human exposome include nutrition, infections, chemicals, physical environment, and sociocultural conditions that act as psychosocial stressors. Because exposomics encompasses the interconnections among our social, nutritional, and chemical environments, it holds great promise for elucidating root causes of recalcitrant health disparities. The technology to measure the exposome is far more advanced than many researchers may realize, given that it has arisen largely in parallel silos. At Mount Sinai, our Institute for Exposomic Research brings together the broad intellectual and technological expertise that moves us toward unifying exposomics into a single, cohesive field. For example, we now utilize untargeted chemical assays that assess hundreds of thousands of endogenous and exogenous small molecules in blood or urine (14 ). We have also developed novel methods using nontraditional biological matrices (teeth, hair) that reconstruct our distant past, even fetal life, giving us the time- varying data on environment and other biological markers needed to understand the developmental origin of health and disease (15-18). At the other end of the spectrum, we measure the external environment using satellites and other remote sensors that record our daily climate, air pollution, noise, green space, and built environment. Electronic health records are increasingly providing not only phenotypic data, but also environmental data, including occupation, address, drugs prescribed, medical procedures, and dates of hospitalizations. Our institute complements these measures with state-of- the-art computational infrastructure to enable the mining of public and administrative databases to estimate chemical exposures, infections (19-23 ), socioeconomic status, urban food deserts, and neighborhood crime levels. Cellphones, wearable devices, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are ubiquitous and can link an individual's place in space and time to concurrent environmental conditions and physiologic reactions. All of these methods, many developed only in the last decade, can now be brought together to define the exposome across our lifespan. Measuring the time-varying nature of exposomics and the societal context that shapes an individual's cumulative exposures may seem daunting, but provides unique opportunities for life-course research. Work is needed to integrate all of these measures into large diverse populations in order to conduct multiomic research on complex diseases, with the exposome being the layer at which many of the interventions will occur. Exposomics is at a developmental inflection point, as the realization of its commercial, public health, and medical value is only beginning to take hold. We are now calling for a reference exposome study analogous to the genomic Hapmap Project that characterized haplotypes in populations around the world. Exposomic \"exposotypes\" will vary by sex, culture, geography, calendar year, and life stage (e.g., children will be different from adults). A reference exposome will enable comparisons across these variables and will be enormously beneficial to researchers while enabling better causal inference analyses. The exposome must also become part of precision medicine initiatives. The global population is getting sicker, and The Frontiers of Medical Research16GENOMIC MEDICINE Genetics and gene therapeutics: Igniting a revolution in health care Eimear E. Kenny1*, Noura S. Abul-Husn1,2, Brian D. Brown3, Judy H. Cho4, Alison M. Goate5 Introduction Starting with the completion of the Human Genome Project two decades ago (1), genetics research has exploded and today plays a central and catalytic role in biological research and health care. Spurred by an over 1-million-fold reduction in the cost of genome sequencing and increasingly sophisticated computational methods, data interrogating the link between genetic variants and human health have been generated and analyzed at a massive scale in both research and clinical settings. This has allowed researchers to determine the genetic basis for thousands of rare and common diseases, and to gain an ever-deepening understanding of our biological complexity. Importantly, this research success has been converted into powerful tools for health care, driving the development of novel diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic strategies. Mount Sinai has long been at the forefront of genetics research and genomic medicine. It houses the first department of genetics in an academic medical school in the United States, and has a track record of successful treatment development for heritable diseases, including creating one of the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved enzyme replacement therapies\u2014Fabrazyme (2). Investments in high-performance computing and large-scale biobanking are enabling a future at the interface of genetics, artificial intelligence, and precision medicine. Discovery genetics at a massive scale A major advance for discovery genetics has been the increasing availability of health system-based biobanks, which offer an unprecedented ability to examine the health impact of disease-associated genes and variants in real-world settings (3). The BioMe Biobank, established in 2006, is a large, exceptionally diverse biobank drawing from the multiethnic patient population in New York City and supporting over $50 million in research funding. The rich scope of genetic, demographic, clinical, and lifestyle data in this biobank accelerates the discovery of variants that impact risk for both rare syndromes and common diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and autism (4-6). The data often connect diseases in surprising ways to reveal shared biology and overlapping mechanisms, such as variants that influence multiple autoimmune conditions (7). Research is revealing the genetic complexity of schizophrenia and how genomic information can be used to predict disease risk (8), as well as the challenges of translating this information into clinical care (9), highlighting the need to refine genetic risk prediction to successfully bring genomics into mental health care delivery. We have learned that host-genome interactions have substantially shaped the architecture of many human diseases, a point that has been vividly underscored by marked interindividual 1Institute for Genomic Health, Department of Medicine, 2 Division of Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, 3Icahn Genomics Institute, Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, 4Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, 5Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY *Corresponding author: eimear.kenny@mssm.eduthose with chronic illness comprise an increasing proportion of our population (24 , 25). Patients experience environments that may not have caused their disease but can nonetheless impact their disease or its treatment\u2014addressing this kind of problem is at the very heart of precision medicine. As an example, we should consider the possibility that chemical obesogens, such as perfluoryl alkyls that are ubiquitous in the U.S. population, are not just a cause of diabetes, but may also modify the response to exogenous insulin and should be studied as a cause of treatment failures or as an initiator of disease complications. Diabetic patients who require escalating doses of insulin will benefit from an environmental assessment to determine modifiable risk factors that are driving exacerbation of hyperglycemia. Exposomics will also lend itself to complementary partnerships with genomic and health inequity researchers, as all diseases have an environmental component, just as all diseases have a genetic component. By committing to exposomics, we will drive 21st-century research toward a greater understanding of the interactions between our genome and our exposome. References 1 . M. M. Davis, T. P.

EHR, electronic health record. differences in COVID-19 outcomes (10). Large-scale genetic discovery efforts also inform the prioritization of therapeutic targets, providing vital clues to potentially druggable pathways and opportunities for drug repurposing (11 ). Despite this success, we will face daunting challenges over the coming decade, including issues of scale and diversity. Current global genomic databases are heavily skewed toward representing European ancestry populations (3). It is imperative to address this bias to avoid limiting genetic discovery and essential for achieving clinical benefits for diverse patients. To meet this challenge, we and others are further growing discovery genetics into a massive-scale enterprise to ultimately include millions of individuals across the globe. This will serve as a powerful conduit for translating genetic discovery into medical knowledge. For example, we have piloted a program to identify disease-associated genetic variants, which can be used as a screening mechanism for disease prevention and management (12 ). We have also shown that embedded genomic data in health systems can be used to infer genetic ancestry, which can provide evidence-based means to assess\u2014 and complement\u2014the use of self-identified race in medicine (13). By leveraging our world-class high-performing compute ecosystem, fostering a culture of broad data sharing among our clinical and scientific researchers, and developing sophisticated machine learning approaches (13), we will integrate genomic information seamlessly into to our health system in a way that will ameliorate\u2014not promulgate\u2014health disparities. Linking genetic discovery to disease mechanisms Progress in genetic discovery has been paralleled by major advances in functional genomic technology, which systematically interrogates the functional effects of genes and variants on molecular, cellular, and physiological processes. Prominent among these approaches are single-cell analyses, which help elucidate the specific cell populations in which genetic variation operates to influence disease. Single-cell- based transcriptomics have helped elucidate that a genetic driver of Crohn's disease called NOD2 (first reported 20 years ago) substantially acts via altered blood monocyte differentiation, resulting in impaired myeloid-stromal interactions. We have identified functional gene signatures for treatment resistance to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy (14 ), and for responsiveness to new therapeutic targets [e.g., gp130 (15)]. CRISPR/Cas9 screens, in which thousands of genes are perturbed in parallel, offer another major advance. The functionality of CRISPR genomics was recently expanded through the development of a novel protein barcode (Pro-Code) technology, which enables high-dimensional phenotyping of CRISPR screens with single-cell and spatial resolution (16 ). This technology was used to identify two genes, SOCS1 and TGFBR2, which control the immune composition of lung tumors, a major determinant of therapeutic response to immunotherapies (17 ). It will be important to develop strategies that extend functional genomics to better understand human physiology. Genome editing in induced pluripotent stem cells and differentiation of organoids provide powerful approaches to understand the impact of genetic variation, particularly in tissues that are not easily accessible, such as the brain. For example, we have demonstrated that a variant in the MAPT gene is associated with frontotemporal dementia and causes early dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling followed by widespread altered splicing and age-dependent neurodegeneration (18). At the tissue level, The Frontiers of Medical Research18it will be critical to statistically model biological pathways and cell-cell interactions, including clonal expansion and neoplasia, and cellular recruitment and differentiation. Developing spatial analytic platforms that rigorously and flexibly integrate evolving technical developments is essential. Emerging DNA and RNA therapeutics In synergy with groundbreaking genetics research, scientists are translating insights from the genome into novel gene therapies\u2014medicines that work at the DNA and RNA level\u2014 to treat a broad range of diseases, including rare inherited disorders, cancers, and infectious diseases. Decades of research have recently led to gene therapy successes that are life-changing for patients with specific conditions and have the potential to be extrapolated widely to other conditions. For example, Balwani et al. showed in phase 1/2 and 3 clinical trials that givosiran, a short-interfering RNA that works by RNA interference (RNAi), can successfully treat the group of debilitating genetic diseases known as acute hepatic porphyrias, leading to the second FDA-approved RNAi drug (19). Genetically engineered T cells have also been established as a highly effective treatment for aggressive blood cancers, and messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines for COVID-19 have altered the course of the pandemic by providing millions of people with protection from the disease (20 ). Work is also needed to greatly expand future clinical applications of gene medicine. This includes the development of new lipid nanoparticle technology, which can enhance delivery of mRNA and oligonucleotide drugs, in situ cancer vaccines that use RNA to stimulate the immune system (21 ), and the establishment of new ways to employ CRISPR gene editing for cell engineering. These preclinical and clinical efforts are enabling researchers to generate better and more effective treatments for a wide range of diseases. Putting genetic testing at the forefront of clinical care Important advances are being made in genomic medicine strategies. The NYCKidSeq program is a large clinical trial using genome sequencing as a frontline modality to diagnose disorders that have a complex phenotype, such as neurodevelopmental conditions, in children from diverse and underserved communities in New York City (22 ). We have innovated new digital platforms to facilitate the communication of complex genomic information to diverse and multilingual patients (23 ), and to allow health care providers to engage with clinical genetic laboratories. In parallel, we are rapidly coordinating efforts to integrate more complex genetic risk information (e.g., polygenic risk scores) into preventive health care. As part of the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, we are offering a Genome-Informed Risk Assessment, including clinical polygenic risk scores for 10 common conditions, to patients in primary care practices with recommendations for how to reduce their risk. Long-term outcomes from these programs will broadly inform the utility and cost-effectiveness of utilizing genomic sequencing as a frontline test for preventive health. Pathogen surveillance is also an important area of genomic medicine, particularly to identify new threats and the emergence of potential deadly variants, such as for flu and SARS-CoV-2 (24 ). Over time we expect that genome sequencing will increasingly be used to identify disease risk in asymptomatic individuals. Research has shown that genomic risk for medically actionable conditions, including certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases (25 ), is more prevalent than previously estimated, and is largely undiagnosed in routine clinical care. Genomic screening has the potential to identify individuals at highest risk for disease, so that risk-reducing interventions can be offered prior to disease onset. We have implemented a genomic screening program to empower individuals to understand their monogenic disease risks and take actions to reduce them (12 ). Results from the program and from eMERGE are integrated into the electronic health record so that individuals can continue to obtain genome-informed care. Conclusions In the next decade, we expect that clinical genome sequencing will outpace research sequencing, and that genetic information will be centered in routine care throughout the life course of a patient. Through continued investment in genetics, AI, and therapeutics, health care systems will become increasingly informed by genomics (Figure 1), enabling rapid integration of genomic knowledge and therapeutics into clinical practice to benefit patients' lives.

Sean Morrison*, Diane E. Meier, Albert L. Siu Over the past century, improved living conditions, advances in public health, and modern medical care have nearly doubled human life expectancy and brought with it the gifts of longer life, space to pursue our passions, and more time for deepening relationships with loved ones. These added years\u2014typically after age 75, however\u2014are often accompanied by one or more serious chronic illnesses with which we live for many years before we die. To date, four National Academy of Medicine reports (1) and three National Institutes of Health State-of-the-Science workshops/conferences (2-4 ) have reported extensive data from multiple settings and disease categories of the high prevalence of physical, psychosocial, and financial suffering associated with serious chronic illness in older adults. In the coming years, our health care system must pivot to deliver responsive care for older adults living with chronic illnesses and, as recent events have illustrated, address the increased vulnerability of older adults to the effects of inequality, emerging infections, and climate change. The need for evidence-based approaches to make these added years worth having is urgent, as is the need to integrate these approaches into routine practice. In the United States, health expenditure is projected to be over 30% of the gross domestic product (GDP) by 2040 if growth continues at its current rate. Older adults with serious illness make up only 5%-10% of our population, but account for over two-thirds of all health care spending. In prior work, we have found that older adults living with chronic conditions account for a larger proportion of Medicare costs than those in the last year of life (5). Our efforts have focused on development and implementation of new models of care that are matched to the needs of older adults\u2014care that addresses physical and emotional distress, supports family and other caregivers, and maximizes independence and quality of life for as long as possible (6-11 ). We have developed, tested, and widely scaled palliative care\u2014a relatively new medical specialty (11 ). As a result of our efforts, palliative care now reaches >90% of large hospitals in the United States and is spreading rapidly to meet the needs of older and seriously ill people in community settings as well. Research by us and others demonstrates that palliative care improves quality of life, reduces symptom burden, improves family outcomes, reduces need for hospitalization, and, in some populations, prolongs life as compared to traditional care (12 , 13). Recognizing that hospitals carry higher risk for older people, the field has also developed, tested, and scaled an important innovation enabling some older adults to receive hospital- level care at home, with support from medical and nursing staff delivered right in the patient's own home (8-10). Research demonstrates that this approach provides not only equal or higher quality of care, but also faster recovery and reduced costs.These new models of care focused on quality of life, maintaining independence, and remaining at home (when possible) are especially important for older adults living with dementia. Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) currently affect one in four people over age 80 years and will triple in prevalence in the United States over the next 30 years as people live longer (14 ). Whereas investment in dementia research by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and industry has catalyzed our understanding of its pathogenesis, brain structural and functional changes, and behavioral and cognitive manifestations, notable knowledge gaps remain (15). Because people with dementia often cannot express their symptoms in words, undertreatment of pain and other symptoms is common. Preventable hospitalizations may occur because of a patient's inability to adhere to treatment and difficulty in recognizing symptoms associated with an impending crisis, magnifying the physical, emotional, and financial demands that dementia places on caregivers. Family caregivers need practical assistance, attention to relief of suffering, and support in order to sustain their caregiving role. Our work assessing service use, costs of care, and patient and caregiver outcomes for the increasing population of persons living with dementia and serious illness will inform new models of care delivery truly matched to the needs of this growing population (16-20 ). Commonly used statistical methods, such as regression analysis, take a variable-centered approach to data analysis. With these types of statistical approaches, the focus is on learning about relationships between variables. For example, studies have traditionally focused on predictors and outcomes of specific diseases (dementia, heart failure, cancer) or conditions (disability, frailty). The challenge, however, is that these diseases and conditions have qualitatively and quantitatively different patterns of change and probabilities of adverse outcomes over time, as outcomes and their determinants interact with non-health-status factors (21 ). Accurate classification of heterogeneous cases into groups with similar members has tremendous potential for providing information with practical and theoretical use (22 ). Analytic techniques such as cluster analysis and latent class growth analysis provide the opportunity to better understand clinically meaningful patterns of service use across the whole system of care and with the goal of better matching health-services delivery to actual patient need. Finally, average time from journal publication of new scientific evidence to incorporation into routine clinical practice is 17 years (23 ). Implementation science (IS) is \"the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practices (EBP) into routine practice, and, hence, to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services\" (24 ). Our experience with national implementation of new models of care for older persons and those with serious illness demonstrates both feasibility and impact. Our focus on the often-underrepresented older persons who need and receive many of these interventions (25 ) points to the necessity of adapting evidence-based interventions to the patients who will receive them. Further, establishing effectiveness is not sufficient. Interventions (e.g., delirium prevention, access to palliative care during serious illness) must be integrated into clinical practice and routinized in order to benefit patients.

Richardson1,2,3*, Gary C. Butts4,5,6, Carol R. Horowitz1,3,7 The underlying, intersectional causes of health disparities are as varied and complex as health itself, and decades of research uncovering reasons for persistent disparities have not closed the equity gap. The direct impacts of structural racism and bias on Black, Latinx, Native American, and Asian populations have become research and funding priorities, and there is new attention being given to enhancing the diversity of the research workforce. No longer the sole province of a small group of committed researchers, health equity science requires the contributions of scientists from every discipline, working collaboratively with community, clinical, policy, and industry stakeholders (1). The challenges and the opportunities are vast. Studying intersectional etiologies and multifocal interventions to eliminate disparities. Traditional discipline- siloed disparities researchers must dive deeper and search more widely to elucidate and address inequities. Building user- friendly, reliable datasets that link biological, clinical, and social determinants data can improve predictive analytics and enhance understanding of the drivers of health outcomes. Race\u2014a social construct, and ancestry\u2014with its biological components, are both contributors (2, 3). For example, Black/African ancestry adults face a higher burden of kidney failure, driven not only by social determinant and health care factors, but also by a 16-fold increased prevalence of renal-risk APOL1 genotypes versus White/European ancestry adults (4). Social (air pollution) and genetic (APOL1) influences significantly interact for overall risk of chronic kidney disease (5). Now, a transdisciplinary team is using these findings to influence patient and provider behaviors, develop therapies, and help patients avoid dialysis. Such holistic approaches can realize the promise of big data to investigate how biological, social, financial, neighborhood, and health care factors combine to cause poor health outcomes for racial, ethnic, and gender minorities and socioeconomically and physically disadvantaged groups across a range of diseases and conditions (6). Dismantling structural racism in health care is a prerequisite to achieving equitable health outcomes. This requires rigorous analysis to detect the institutional racism embedded in rules, laws, practices, policies, and organizational approaches. Mount Sinai Health System's new Roadmap for Action uses Collective Impact (7) to implement strategies to elevate equity as a core health system value and key quality measure, collect accurate patient demographics, and use informatics to systematically identify and address inequities. For example, inappropriately using race in clinical algorithms based on flawed evidence has caused harm to certain racial groups, leading to well-meaning but misguided calls for a color-blind approach to clinical decision making. However, competently caring for diverse populations requires knowledge of group-specific data on 1Institute for Health Equity Research, 2Department of Emergency Medicine, 3Department of Population Health Science and Policy, 4Department of Medical Education, 5Department of Pediatrics, 6Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health, 7Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY *Corresponding author: lynne.richardson@mssm.eduBarriers to dissemination and implementation due to behavioral, organizational, payment, or other constraints must be codified and resolved. There is a pressing demographic imperative to attend to dissemination and implementation of models that are matched to the needs of a very different population, now living much longer with serious chronic illnesses, than the one characterizing our country when Medicare and the NIH were first established more than a half-century ago.

Brown1,3* Immunity: In sickness and in health The immune system maintains human health and plays a central role in virtually all diseases. Protective immune defenses against cancers and infections are critical for survival. However, immune system overactivity can drive detrimental inflammation that causes allergy as well as autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (1). Inflammation is also a major contributor to other conditions, such as atherosclerosis, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and aging. Drugs that target the immune system are revolutionizing medicine. Immunotherapy using inhibitors of receptors that stop T cells from killing cancer cells, called checkpoint blockade, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells engineered to recognize tumor-associated antigens, have transformed oncology by putting patients with aggressive tumors in long-term remission (2). Antibodies that block inflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF) effectively treat RA and IBD (1), and drugs that deplete B cells reduce inflammatory brain lesions and clinical relapses in MS patients (3). However, a major challenge of \"drugging\" the immune system is carefully balancing immune activation versus suppression. This conundrum is evident in COVID-19 treatment, as steroids that dampen hyperinflammation are lifesaving, but may prevent virus clearance if used too early in infection (4). Thus, we urgently need to identify the mechanisms that drive, brake, and balance immune responses, and understand how to exploit these mechanisms to precisely control immunity and inflammation in diseases. Technological breakthroughs and new paradigms of multiscale science are addressing this problem. Medical centers have established cross-disciplinary institutes, such as Mount Sinai's Precision Immunology Institute (PrIISM), to study patient tissues, create disease models, identify therapeutic targets, develop novel drugs, and conduct innovative clinical trials. Through this multiscale approach, we are progressing toward treating diseases through more precise and individualized therapeutic control of the immune system. Generating immune maps of human diseases In order to design new immunotherapies, we need accurate and comprehensive information about all the immune risks and outcomes and clinical decision tools (8). Thus, our system is eliminating use of biased clinical practice and artificial intelligence algorithms through governance structures to use the best available data while articulating and adhering to ethical and equity principles. Partnering with communities to improve diversity and inclusion in research. Achieving equity will not be possible unless those disproportionately and unjustly impacted by health disparities are partners in conceptualizing, executing, and evaluating research questions, and using findings to inform policy, systems, and environmental changes. Rather than siloing community members in passive advisory groups, they can join other private and public stakeholders as trusted research partners (9). Such partnerships can build strategies that overcome the earned skepticism that diverse individuals have of research; inform recruitment and retention strategies so participant demographics in clinical trials reflect the prevalence of conditions being studied; present information in simple, engaging ways; and create positive, respectful research experiences that build a culture of participation (10). A common trope is that low-income and nonwhite individuals do not trust researchers (11 ). We challenge researchers to consider another possibility, namely, that they themselves are not sufficiently confident that community members have innovative ideas and strategies to help transform human health. Health equity science must continue to focus on the pervasive and longstanding disparities in health status and outcomes of diverse populations and investigate how race, ethnicity, language, gender identity, neighborhoods, experiences, and biology lead to illness or wellness (12 ). Achieving health equity will require that scientists across all disciplines learn to bring an equity lens to their work. References 1 . L. D. Richardson, J. Public Health Manag.

The Frontiers of Medical Research22components of healthy and diseased tissue, how they interact, and the consequences of perturbing these systems via candidate targets. New technological platforms can now measure virtually all molecules, cells, or metabolites within a tissue (2). This approach has generated tissue \"atlases\" with unprecedented detail and revealed specific molecular alterations between healthy and diseased tissue. Immune dysregulation has been mapped at the molecular and cellular level in human lung tumors (5), atherosclerosis lesions (6), IBD (7), COVID-19 (8), and allergy (9). Among the many findings, these studies have revealed unique molecular programs within macrophages and dendritic cells that dampen tumor immunity and resistance to checkpoint immunotherapy (10), identified the potential role of IL-1b in atherosclerotic plaques (6), and uncovered a cellular module enriched in IBD patients that resists TNF blockade (7). Importantly, these studies revealed actionable targets (6, 10) that enable precise targeting of molecular defects. More work is still needed to enhance these atlases, particularly through incorporation of spatial resolution and longitudinal measurements connecting to health outcomes. Immunology meets data science Data generated by patient analysis can power artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to solve questions about immune responses. For example, a recently developed machine learning model predicts how cancer patients will respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors (11 ). Improved AI models will expedite antigen discovery and vaccine development for seasonal flu, novel coronavirus strains, and other emerging pathogens. Efficient identification of immunogenic antigens among individual tumor mutations is also critical, as personalized cancer vaccines must be administered before the tumor becomes too aggressive. Using computational approaches to sift through the mutational landscape of endometrial, colorectal, and stomach cancers, shared immunogenic frameshift mutations were recently identified between patients (12 ). These findings, and the computational approaches developed in studies like these, will help to establish \"off-the-shelf\" vaccines for cancer patients. Identifying novel immune targets of disease Through the extensive analysis of patient immune systems, we can identify key variations between healthy and disease states that inform patient treatment. For example, molecular analysis revealed JAK1 (13), USP18 (14 ), or TBK-1 (15) deficiencies that caused undiagnosed monogenic immune disorders, which led to the repurposing of existing JAK and TNF blockers to precisely treat each patient's condition. Without such a precision approach, these patients would have had no remedy for their debilitating diseases. Functional genomics using CRISPR screens is being employed to great effect to identify novel immunotherapy targets (16 ). Recently, it became possible to resolve CRISPR screens in situ using Pro-Code/ CRISPR genomics (17 ). This advancement greatly expands target discovery by enabling the disease-causing role of genes operating extrinsically\u2014such as cytokines\u2014to be determined, and represents a new frontier for identifying immunotherapy targets through functional genomics. Developing novel immunotherapies Immunomodulatory drugs have profoundly improved treatment for many diseases and comprise nine out of the 10 Data-driven target discovery (AI, machine learning, etc.) Target validation and mechanistic interrogation (functional genomics, animal models, etc.) WT CCR2 KO0102030# Tumors / lobe** Molecular profiling of blood and tissues during clinical trials Develop and test novel or repurposed therapies in preclinical models based on rational target selection PlaceboDrug Clinical trials of novel therapies and repurposed drugsDegraders mRNA/nanoparticles gene therapiesSmall molecules Generate gene, cell, and molecular disease maps (scRNA -seq, Multiplex imaging, WGS, etc.) FIGURE 1.

However, additional therapies are needed, including for treatment of checkpoint-resistant cancers, atherosclerosis, neuroinflammation, sepsis, and \"inflamm-aging. \" Many new compounds have already been generated to target the molecules identified from disease profiling and functional genomics studies. A promising example is the macrophage receptor TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2), which was found by molecular analysis in a broad range of diseases, including Alzheimer's (18), IBD (7), and lung cancer (5); TREM2 blocking antibodies have ameliorated illness in preclinical models of these diseases (18) and are currently in clinical trials in cancer patients. Vaccines were among the first immunotherapies and have had enormous impact on global health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccines educate the immune system to recognize pathogen-associated antigens so it can rapidly block infection by the pathogen. One of the most revolutionary recent developments in this area are messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, which are effective not only for viruses but also cancer (19). mRNA therapeutics also have applications beyond vaccines. For example, they have been used to reprogram tumor macrophages from protumorigenic to antitumorigenic states (20), and to reprogram T cells to kill cancer cells. Scientists are now working to tailor cell type-specific expression of mRNAs (21) to enhance targeting of mRNA-based drugs (22 ). Commensal bacteria have a profound impact on the immune system and human health, including influencing the development of asthma and food allergy (23 , 24). Scientists are now determining which microbes control immune function and how, and are using these insights to generate microbiome cocktails to treat IBD and other inflammatory diseases (24 ). Adaptive clinical trial design: Molecules and profiling The same immunomodulatory drug can treat different conditions because the same immune cells reside in all organs and affect different diseases in similar ways. For example, PD1 antibodies are the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration- approved pan-cancer drug, and TNF-alpha inhibitors are used to treat both RA and IBD (1). However, physicians have been slow to repurpose drugs indicated for one disease to another. A reason for this is that medical specialties are siloed and study diseases based on the organ of presentation rather than their molecular underpinnings. This extends to how drug trials have traditionally been run and is particularly irrational for diseases driven by the immune system, given commonalities in immune activity between tissues. We and other groups are working to break this old model by developing clinical trials targeting pathogenic molecular programs shared between diseases and by working closely with multidisciplinary teams of immunologists and different medical specialists. An example of this approach is IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) blockade, which was originally developed to treat asthma. Elevated IL-4 was identified in atopic skin lesions, and clinical trials proved IL-4R blockade was very effective in treating eczema patients (25). Through deep profiling, we recently found a dominant IL-4 signature in the infiltrating immune cells of patient lung tumors and showed that IL-4R blockade could rescue therapeutic immunity in experimental lung cancer that resists checkpoint blockade (10). This has prompted a clinical trial to test combined PD-1 and IL-4R blockade in advanced lung cancer (# NCT05013450). These advances outline an adaptive clinical trial design where new knowledge from tissue profiling and therapeutic immunomodulation provide the rationale for the next set of mechanistic studies (Figure 1).

Satlin2,3, Rachel Vreeman2,4, Bruce D. Gelb2,3* A commitment to ensuring the optimal health and future of every child, adolescent, and pregnant woman worldwide is a priority for scientists in the fields of pediatrics, obstetrics, child development, developmental biology, reproductive health, and global and population health. Breakthroughs in technology, including genome sequencing and artificial intelligence, allow for new scientific discoveries that can be translated into advances in clinical care. The continuing evolution of genomic medicine will be transformative. Single-gene (Mendelian) disorders, while individually rare, affect ~5% of live births and contribute to roughly 30% of pediatric hospitalizations (1). Since the completion of the Human Genome Project and the development of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS), our ability to sequence individuals' exomes and genomes has been rendered practicable. This, in turn, has accelerated discovery and implementation research in genomic medicine. With thousands of Mendelian disorders remaining without identified cause, discovery efforts will continue for years (Figure 1). These discoveries will facilitate elaboration of disease pathogenesis, sometimes uncovering unexpected overlap across entities (e.g., histone modifier variants underlying autism and congenital heart disease) (2). Gene discoveries will also enable delineation of the relationships of genotypes with phenotypes and clinical outcomes. Sequencing capacity and cost are no longer limiting factors; the focus for the coming years needs to be on leaving no sick child behind. Every family with a child having a potential genetic abnormality must be studied\u2014a model that has worked well in pediatric oncology. Implementation research is needed in order to fully realize the potential of pediatric genomic medicine. As clinical genetic test menus expand, important questions about clinical utility remain, which, in turn, are limiting the willingness of health care payers to cover these tests. For example, is genetic testing of critically ill infants cost effective and, if so, which test (targeted gene panels versus genomes) has the highest utility? Subsequent research will be needed to determine how best to standardize deployment of NGS across health systems and to support a workforce that can implement genomic medicine to maximize the benefits to affected children. Attention is also needed to assure that pediatric genomic medicine is deployed equitably. Statistics for large genetic studies and aggregated NGS data such as in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) reveal an unacceptable bias toward whites of European descent. Through carefully crafted recruitment strategies and collaborative engagement with community partners, enrollment from groups underrepresented in medical research is achievable. Critical to the future heath of children are efforts to develop, test, and evaluate existing drugs and novel therapies for safe and effective treatment of genetic disorders. For example, U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved immunomodulatory drugs have been repurposed to treat children with rare Mendelian disorders (3, 4). For most traits, for which pathogenesis is unknown or rational repurposing is not obvious, studies following the traditional bench-to-bedside path, starting with modeling in animals and cells (now including pluripotent stem cell-derived human cells and organoids) and moving to testing of known drugs and novel compounds, will be required. Of note, neurodevelopmental disorders, no longer viewed as largely inevitable defects of early brain development, represent one area of child health that is ripe for therapy development. Finally, indications for genomic therapies\u2014gene therapies and gene editing\u2014will continue to expand impressively (5), although many hurdles remain for rendering them practical for the thousands of Mendelian traits. Precision obstetrical medicine has the potential to transform care during pregnancy. For instance, obstetricians and geneticists at Mount Sinai, in conjunction with data scientists at the health intelligence company Sema4, are developing a point-of-care decision tool to optimize the timing of cell-free DNA aneuploidy screening. Since a minimum threshold of fetal DNA must be present, we are developing predictive models using factors affecting the fetal fraction, such as gestational age, maternal body mass index, and medications that determine each patient's earliest window for screening. These models will allow personalized screening to assure the greatest likelihood of accurate results. Another example of personalized obstetrical care is being developed using digital phenotyping to predict risk and guide care. Scientists are building models using electronic medical record data that will guide intrapartum monitoring based on postpartum hemorrhage risk (6), with future efforts aimed at predicting preeclampsia risk. Child and maternal health priorities demand that we broaden our scope globally. To reach the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for 2030, we must recognize exactly what the \"Every Woman Every Child Global Strategy\" for 2030 states: that women, children, and adolescents are \"potentially the most powerful agents for improving their own health and achieving prosperous and sustainable societies\" (7). As highlighted in the COVID-19 pandemic, we must prioritize global strategies and innovations to adequately support maternal and child health needs for all (8). Our research strategy in prioritizing these goals is to engage with communities around socially acceptable, culturally adapted, and validated approaches for detecting growth or developmental challenges and implementing referral strategies to address issues early (9, 10). We must also continue research to detect and address children's long-term health needs, supporting children and their families through lifelong treatment regimens (11 , 12), for example, living with HIV, and addressing the broad range of behavioral and social health needs demonstrated by adolescents coping with health challenges globally, such as the cohort of adolescents Mount Sinai has followed for more than 10 years in Kenya (13-16). While the COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging clinically, it has also provided research opportunities in child and maternal 1Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Science, 2Department of Pediatrics, 3Mindich Child Health and Development Institute, 4Arnhold Institute for Global Health, Department of Global Health and Health Systems Design, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY *Corresponding author: bruce.gelb@mssm.eduThe Frontiers of Medical Research25health. Using lessons learned in low-resource settings abroad, we studied universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection among pregnant women in Queens, New York (17 ) and assessed childbirth satisfaction and postpartum health during the pandemic (18). We also launched a pregnancy cohort to study the short- and long-term impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy (19). The Generation C (Generation COVID) cohort captures questionnaire data and biospecimens throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period. Maternal immune responses are being assessed via cytokine levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid and correlated with pregnancy outcomes, maternal mental health, and child development. New assays are being developed to distinguish the immunity provided by previous infection versus immunization, and newborn blood spots are being correlated to assess immune status at birth. Additional analyses are examining how structural racism and pandemic stress are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, birth outcomes, and vaccine deliberation among pregnant women. In the future, we will study the long-term impact of the pandemic on the mental health of mothers and children. In summary, we expect the frontiers of maternal and child health research to range from improving precision/genomic medicine, to driving disease discovery and generating novel therapeutics, to analyzing population-level data globally. The resulting advances promise to improve health outcomes for women, children, and their families. With proper attention, we can and must assure that these benefits are enjoyed equitably in the United States and throughout the world. References 1 . C. R. Ferreira, Am. J. Med. Genet.

Schematic summarizing the future of research in child and maternal health. The Frontiers of Medical 2010 2015 20202009 H1N1 pandemic3 FIGURE 1. Major outbreaks of emerging viruses in the last 20 years. 1Nipah virus caused its first detected outbreak in 1998/1999, but since then has caused several additional outbreaks. 2 The highly pathogenic H5N1 virus first caused an outbreak in 1997 , then reemerged in 2003 and has caused sporadic zoonotic infections since then. 3Pandemic H1N1 emerged in 2009 and has since become a seasonal influenza virus. 4MERS CoV was first detected in 2012 and has caused sporadic outbreaks since then. 5H7N9 virus first caused an outbreak in 2013, and since then has caused sporadic outbreaks. 6Ebolavirus caused a large outbreak in West Africa from 2013 to 2016, but caused many sporadic outbreaks before and after that epidemic. Avian and swine influenza viruses of different subtypes constantly cause zoonotic infections that could lead to larger outbreaks and pandemics.MICROBIOLOGY Preparing for the next pandemic Florian Krammer1,2,*, Viviana Simon1,2,3, Adolfo Garc\u00eda-Sastre1,2,3,4,5, Peter Palese1,4 Early in January 2020, the sequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was published online by Chinese scientists from Fudan University in Shanghai. Scientists in the Department of Microbiology and in the Global Health and Emerging Pathogens Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai were alarmed and started to prepare even before it was clear that the cluster of patients with respiratory disease first reported in Wuhan in 2019 would be the start of a pandemic triggering an unprecedented global health crisis. Within a few weeks, molecular testing for the virus was established; an antibody test was developed suitable for studying the immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifying possible COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) survivors who might be eligible for plasma donations (1-4 ); and animal models (5, 6) and antiviral and vaccine research for COVID-19 were initiated (7, 8). In the following months of 2020, our groups led numerous studies aimed at understanding the biology and pathogenicity of the new virus, and established observational longitudinal cohorts to better understand immunity induced after infection (9, 10). We shared reagents generated in our laboratories at Mount Sinai with hundreds of laboratories and hospitals worldwide, and we spearheaded the development of affordable COVID-19 vaccines (11 ). The reason we could rapidly spring into action and generate these data so quickly was because we were prepared: We had the expertise and necessary infrastructures in place as well as unwavering support from our institution. Traditionally, our Department of Microbiology focuses on studying RNA viruses and the development of vaccines and therapeutics. We lead one of the Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response (CEIRR), which focuses on pandemic preparedness. The center contributed significantly to responding to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and several outbreaks of zoonotic influenza viruses, including H7N9 (Figure 1). We also lead a Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Center (CIVIC) that is focused on developing universal influenza virus vaccines, discussed further below. This past experience with influenza virus and other RNA viruses, along with close collaborations with other research and clinical groups on campus, allowed us to respond rapidly to SARS-CoV-2. For example, our Personalized Virology Initiative and Pathogen Surveillance Program are both longstanding multidisciplinary programs that allowed immediate access to critical patient samples and virus isolates collected in real time with approval of the Institutional Review Board. We are now 20 months into the COVID-19 pandemic. While new infections have decreased and vaccines have become widely available in high-income countries, much remains to be learned and accomplished in order to crush COVID-19 and prevent future pandemics. Current high-profile projects aim to provide a better understanding of vaccine- and infection- induced immunity (12 , 13), to define correlates of protection for SARS-CoV-2, and to explain why some viral variants (e.g., the B.1.617.2 Delta variant) are more transmissible and can cause infections in fully immunized individuals (14 ). To answer these questions, our group leads the Protection Associated with Rapid Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 (PARIS) program, which follows infected and vaccinated individuals over time to study reinfection rates and the longevity of immune responses. This has been complemented with the rapid establishment of in vitro and in vivo models of SARS-CoV-2 infection under BSL3 containment. Multi-institutional collaborations were also established, allowing the rapid discovery of potential antivirals and treatments, several of which, including plitidepsin and topotecan, have been advanced into clinical trials (15, 16 ). Finally, 1Department of Microbiology, 2Department of Pathology, Molecular and Cell-Based Medicine, 3Global Health and Emerging Pathogens Institute, 4Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, 5Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY *Corresponding author: florian.krammer@mssm.eduThe Frontiers of Medical Research27we are spearheading the development of a Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that can be produced using existing influenza vaccine production plants at very low cost ( 17). This vaccine is currently in clinical development in Thailand, Vietnam, Brazil, and Mexico (18). We hope that this work will make SARS-CoV-2 vaccines available in low- and middle-income countries, especially since it can be produced at low cost locally\u2014providing countries independence from international vaccine supplies. The efforts mentioned above focus on the current pandemic, but it is also clear that we need to plan ahead. While we do not know which virus will cause the next pandemic or when it will occur, it is certain that new viral pathogens will continue to spill over into human populations, giving rise to future pandemics, unless safeguards are put in place now. Increase in farming, habitat destruction, extreme weather conditions, and global warming will likely result in an increased frequency of pandemics. Four of the last five pandemics with respiratory viruses have been caused by influenza virus, and the high diversity of this virus in the animal reservoir makes it a very likely candidate for the next pandemic. To tackle this problem\u2014and to solve the issue of antigenic drift of seasonal influenza viruses\u2014 we are developing several broadly protective and universal influenza virus vaccine candidates, of which several are in clinical development (19). We have also developed the NDV vaccine platform stated above, which can be used to generate a wide variety of vaccines, including those against respiratory syncytial virus, filoviruses, influenza virus, and any emerging viral pathogen. Furthermore, we recently established the Center for Vaccine Research and Pandemic Preparedness (C-VARPP). C-VARPP focuses on collecting biospecimens from patients seeking care at the Mount Sinai Health System, the development of monoclonal antibody therapeutics from convalescent individuals, and the analysis of infection- and vaccine-induced immunity. New York City (NYC) is a major travel hub, and individuals from many different regions of the globe live here or come to visit. Moreover, people in NYC, like those in other large metropolitan areas, live in close proximity and rely on public transportation to commute. This constant influx of people infected with emerging, reemerging, and circulating pathogens such as Zika virus, dengue virus, SARS-CoV-2, and others, not only compels our health system to provide innovative, high- quality diagnostics and clinical care, but also allows us to seamlessly integrate cutting-edge research aimed at studying and fighting these pathogens (20-25 ). Innovative programs such as these require robust funding from governmental and private sources. Many challenges remain with endemic viruses such as seasonal influenza virus, and most importantly, the global community recently had to discover that we are not prepared for emerging pandemic viruses. We must focus on studying viruses and developing suitable countermeasures such as vaccines and therapeutics. The scientific enterprise was prepared to take on COVID-19, which enabled a rapid understanding of the virus and development of treatments and remarkably effective vaccines. While the pandemic is not over yet and still needs our full attention, work should continue on solving remaining problems with endemic and pandemic viruses in order to be better prepared for the next outbreak\u2014which will certainly come.

A single brain is composed of ~100 billion neurons and roughly an equal number of glia, with perhaps ~100 trillion synapses comprising the brain's neural circuitry. While computers are faster and more accurate, a human brain still outperforms the most advanced computer in abstract thinking, planning, social intuition, and emotion. As progress is made in treating and preventing diseases of other organs, and people live longer, the impact of brain disorders continues to increase, today representing five of the top 10 causes of disability worldwide (depression, psychosis, dementia, stroke, and addiction). Unlike all other branches of medicine, where much of today's challenges will be met by executing existing approaches, the brain still requires The Frontiers of Medical Research28fundamentally new paradigms to understand its functioning in health and disease. We are entering a phase of unprecedented optimism and anticipation based on a range of exciting new tools that have been developed over the past decade. This is reflected in major investments in brain science across the globe, such as the U.S. BRAIN (Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Initiative and related efforts in Europe and Asia. The brain's extraordinary complexity resides in its cellular diversity and highly intricate circuits. Each brain cell has the same complexity of molecular constituents as all cells in peripheral tissues. However, in contrast to those tissues, whose cellular function in vitro reflects the organ's function in vivo (e.g., pumping blood, filtering air or blood, attacking pathogens, or secreting insulin), the brain exhibits so-called \"emergent properties\" that cannot be understood based on molecular- cellular function alone. While much attention is focused on consciousness and \"the mind\"\u2014which can be viewed as the ultimate emergent properties\u2014even the most basic functions of the brain, such as interpreting a visual image, throwing a baseball, solving a mathematical equation, remembering past experiences, or emoting in response to good or bad news, cannot be explained today by simply measuring cell and circuit activity. Technology-driven roadmap for understanding the brain These challenges define an overall experimental strategy that is now being used to decipher brain function under normal conditions and resolve what goes wrong in specific disease states (Figure 1). Starting with molecular biology\u2014analogous to other fields and relying on their tools\u2014it is now possible to understand how a cell's molecular constituents are determined initially by an individual's genetic constitution and modified across the lifespan via epigenetic processes during development and in response to lived experiences and other environmental factors throughout life. Such molecular characterization must be achieved with anatomical precision, by use of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) and related methods, followed by \"spatial transcriptomics, \" which permits delineation of the molecular constituents of a cell within the context of its location in the brain and its circuitry (1). New technologies are required to better link scRNAseq with spatial information such that the transcriptomes of individual neurons can be related directly to their unique patterns of connectivity in the brain. Other new methods such as iDISCO (immunolabeling-enabled three- dimensional imaging of solvent-cleared organs) or Lipid-exchanged Acrylamide-hybridized Rigid Imaging/ Immunostaining/in situ-hybridization-compatible Tissue hYdrogel) enable mapping proteins in a brain-wide fashion with cellular resolution (2). These tools are being applied not only to rodent models but also to human brain tissue obtained at autopsy or during surgery (3). scRNAseq is revealing an unexpected level of cellular diversity in the brain by identifying numerous putative subtypes of a previously defined single cell type, with work now underway to understand which such subtypes reflect distinct functional states of a single cell type versus truly distinct types of cells. This work is also generating newfound appreciation of the importance of glia and endothelial cells in neuropsychiatric phenomena. A related challenge is to understand the specification of such a large number (many thousands) of distinct neuronal and nonneuronal cell types through development. These molecular constituents determine the functioning of individual cells, which in turn control the functioning of simple and more complex composite circuits in the brain and spinal cord that produce behavioral outputs, whether interpreting sensory information; executing a motor program; or learning, remembering, planning, and emoting. The last decade has seen revolutionary advances in our ability to connect the functioning of a single circuit\u2014with a precision and specificity unimagined even two decades ago\u2014to a specific behavior. For example, in vivo Ca2+ imaging provides continuous activity measures of thousands of individual neurons in behaving animals (4), while optogenetics and chemogenetics make it possible to link the activity of clusters of precisely defined neurons and their projections to a behavior (5, 6). Circuit control over behavior is more complicated than anticipated, in part because each \"microcircuit\" (one cell type projecting to a second cell type) is modified by both cell types' other projections, which shape the ultimate behavioral output (7). Advances in neural network analysis are beginning to reveal how collections of neurons can generate a simple behavior (8), although this area requires further innovations through artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches. Importantly, every time a circuit functions, the type and intensity of activity alters the molecular constituents of individual cells in the circuit, which in turn alters the functioning of those circuits. Through this constant iterative plasticity across cells, synapses, circuits, and behavioral responses and back, the brain is ever changing and adapting. Establishing causal connections bidirectionally across this continuum is for the first time technically possible and represents one of the major goals of contemporary neuroscience. Progress in delineating the pathophysiology of brain diseases As we learn more about the brain, it is now possible to better elucidate the causes and pathophysiology of brain and nervous system disorders, although progress is clearly lagging behind that for other medical disciplines due to the enormous complexity involved. Most brain disorders are highly heritable, although with genetic underpinnings far more complex than ever imagined: Many hundreds of genome variations, each contributing a miniscule fraction, determine an individual's disease risk. This situation is similar to the genetic basis of other, common complex disorders. A major challenge is how to use this genetic information to improve diagnosis, for example, through polygenic risk scores. Genetic knowledge is also providing new biological insight into disease pathogenesis, for example in psychiatry, by demonstrating a ~50% overlap of genes implicated in schizophrenia also being seen in either bipolar disorder or autism, as compared to eating disorders (e.g., anorexia nervosa), where genes related to peripheral metabolism are especially implicated (9). The genetic complexity of brain disorders emphasizes the potential utility of studying Departments of Neuroscience1, Psychiatry2, and Neurology3 Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY *Corresponding author: eric.nestler@mssm.eduThe Frontiers of Medical Research29Article 6 #15 neuron- or glia-like cells induced from human patients, which provide the full complement of genetic risk in a cell model. Genomic and transcriptomic data are likewise demonstrating the validity of animal models: Rather than postulating how a rodent behavior may be similar to a human behavior, it is now possible to determine the extent to which an animal model recapitulates the molecular pathology of a human disorder in a cell-type- specific manner. The importance of epigenetic mechanisms in disease is underscored by the large number of genes encoding chromatin regulatory proteins that have been linked to psychiatric and neurological disorders (e.g., 10-12). Medications targeting epigenetic mechanisms\u2014an intense area of interest in cancer\u2014are as a result now being explored for a range of brain disorders as well. Furthermore, while the clinical application of gene editing and epigenome editing approaches to brain disorders (13) will come long after their application to non- nervous system diseases, due to challenges of accessing the brain and limiting side effects, important strides are being made, with nucleic acid-based therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders showing great promise in the clinic (14 ). Circuit-based therapeutics represent another enormous opportunity. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is now widely used to treat Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders, and is being applied to several psychiatric syndromes, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome, and experimentally to depression, addiction, pain, Alzheimer's disease, and eating disorders (15, 16 ). DBS involves neurosurgery and therefore is only applicable today for individuals with severe disease, but the surgery is extremely well tolerated, and one can imagine broader applicability as the specificity of treatment is improved. For example, will it be possible to stimulate only an individual cell type in a targeted brain region by employing an optogenetic or chemogenetic approach? Beyond therapeutics, the human neurosurgical suite is an essential arena for researching how circuit function generates behavior, including highly complex outputs such as language, emotion, and memory (16 , 17). This work highlights the importance of research on nonhuman primates. While increasingly complex behavioral paradigms are being developed for rodents, there is a limit to how much can be learned about the human brain from rodents, given the extraordinary evolution of frontal cortical circuits in primates (18). In fact, the interplay between humans and nonhuman primates offers a critical opportunity (Figure 2). Continuous recordings from DBS electrodes, and from indwelling electrodes in the temporal lobe of epilepsy patients, are integrated with recordings from homologous monkey circuits, with hypotheses about causality between a circuit and a behavioral output tested in the latter. Molecular genetic control of circuit function in primates represents a tremendous challenge, but is perhaps feasible through the study of smaller primates with rapid breeding cycles, such as marmosets. Advanced brain imaging, which offers far broader applicability, is also being used to study brain circuitry in humans and nonhuman primates: While imaging methods still lack the molecular and cellular resolution possible with more invasive tools, improvements in spatial and molecular resolution are continuously being achieved. Brain-body interactions As more is learned about the brain, it is increasingly possible to delineate bidirectional interactions between the brain and peripheral organs, and this synergy is captured perfectly by the multidisciplinary Friedman Brain Institute at Mount Sinai. There is tremendous excitement in neuroimmunology. For example, the last decade has seen major advances in treating autoimmune illnesses that target the brain, exemplified by multiple sclerosis. These advances reflect the impressive progress in human immunology and the range of new treatments generated as a result. However, a remarkable discovery over the past decade is the range of nervous system disorders that are not autoimmune but nevertheless involve neuroimmune mechanisms. A subset of depressed patients display a hyperinflammatory state, FIGURE 1. A roadmap for understanding brain function in health and disease. Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms (right panel) determine the functioning of individual neuronal (blue) and nonneuronal (purple) cells and synapses (inset) (lower panel), which control the functioning of those neurons in larger brain circuits across species (left panel). Complex neural networks (upper panel) ultimately underlie behavioral responses as well as feedback and alter the molecular and cellular properties of individual cells. Image from Ni-ka Ford (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai). The Frontiers of Medical Research30and the causal role of such neuroinflammation in controlling stress responses has been demonstrated in rodent models (19). These advances are guiding current clinical studies of anticytokine antibodies in treating this subset of depressed individuals. The importance of neuroimmune mechanisms is further underscored by the finding that some of the strongest known genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease are genes enriched in microglia\u2014resident immune cells in the brain (20 ). Still another example, which may not relate to disturbed immune function per se, is the postulated involvement of complement pathways and microglia in disordered synaptic pruning that has been implicated in schizophrenia (21 ). The gut microbiome may contribute to a range of brain abnormalities in part by influencing peripheral immune mechanisms. Similarly, the interplay between cardiovascular health and brain function\u2014 which may be partly mediated by immune-based mechanisms controlling atherosclerosis and by brain circuits that ultimately influence atherosclerosis through the autonomic nervous system\u2014are thought to explain the dramatic comorbidity between cardiovascular disease and brain disorders as diverse as stress-related disorders (depression, posttraumatic stress disorder); stroke; and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (22). Furthermore, the autonomic nervous system influences all other peripheral organs and their diseases, an area of intense research today. The control of intermediary metabolism is integrally related with brain function. A major achievement over the past two decades has been the elaboration of peripheral hormones (e.g., leptin, ghrelin, and insulin) that influence the brain, which in turn controls feeding behavior through circuitry that arises in the hypothalamus (23 ). How hypothalamic function then determines feeding behavior and energy expenditure beyond the autonomic nervous system remains a major challenge\u2014reflecting the circuit-behavior divide discussed above. Interplays between the brain and peripheral metabolism are thought to explain the robust comorbidity seen for obesity and depression and implicated as well in addiction and many other brain syndromes (e.g., 24 ). The ultimate frontier of modern medicine The brain and nervous system will be the last frontier of medicine's precision revolution. This is expected given the unique complexity of the brain and its functions. Despite the challenges, however, the field is now at an inflection point where it is possible for the first time to delineate the myriad molecular constituents of individual cells, understand how those constituents determine cell function, and how the functioning of individual cells determine the activity of a single circuit and of larger and more complex composite circuits, ultimately producing behavior, then feeding back on cell and molecular function and so on. The new tools that study this bidirectional relationship across molecules, cells, and circuits are driving optimism that advances in understanding and treating brain disorders, which have long defied biomedical research, will be coming in the next decade. In fact, after decades of disappointment in therapeutics, the last few years alone have seen numerous examples of novel therapeutic mechanisms for psychiatric and neurological disorders, which are harbingers of far greater successes in the decade to come (e.g., 25 ). It is impossible to overstate the positive impact on humanity that will be gained by one day conquering brain and nervous system disorders. References 1 . S. K. Longo, M. G. Guo , A. L. Ji , P. A.

Kenny1,2*, Nina Bhardwaj3, Marta Filizola4, Andrew Stewart5 Each person carries several million relatively common genetic variants that are widely distributed throughout the population, between 10,000 and 100,000 much less common variants shared with related family members, and around 100 de novo variants found exclusively in that individual (1). The unique complement of genetic variants we each carry, and how they interact with the different environments we inhabit, help to explain why some of us are more susceptible (or resilient) to certain diseases than others, and why the same drug treatment can be beneficial in one person yet be ineffective or even detrimental in another. The past decade has seen groundbreaking advances in our understanding of the basic mechanisms of disease, driven in part by breakthroughs in large-scale DNA sequencing (2). As genomes and transcriptomes are sequenced more frequently and with ever-greater cellular, spatial, and temporal resolution, so too will our understanding of the genetic architectures of disease continue to improve (Figure 1). Such progress will move medicine toward a future of personalized treatments designed by physicians to maximize an individual's therapeutic response while minimizing their risk of an adverse outcome. The full potential of personalized medicine will only be realized as the arsenal of safe, effective treatment options available to physicians increases dramatically above current levels. A major hurdle impeding such progress is the exorbitant cost of developing new drugs, currently estimated at $2.6 billion per new-drug approval (3). The high failure rate of traditional small-molecule drug discovery is largely responsible for these costs. The reasons for such failures are manifold and include incomplete understanding of the drivers of disease; faulty assumptions about the involvement of a drug target in a disease; failure of a new drug candidate to engage its intended target; and detecting toxicity only after a new treatment is given to large patient populations. Finding creative solutions to these vexing problems will facilitate the future of therapeutic discovery. The last two decades have seen dramatic improvements in computational approaches to drug discovery. Increased computational power and improved software platforms have made it possible to discover new compounds that modulate drug targets using in silico approaches. Computer-aided, structure-based drug discovery has enabled \"virtual\" screening of ultralarge libraries of chemically diverse compounds against drug targets at scales impossible to achieve using traditional \"hands-on\" approaches (4). Classical examples of successful computer-aided drug discovery include the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor amprenavir (5) and the antibiotic norfloxacin (6). This success was made possible by advances in X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and other biophysical techniques, which are yielding remarkably high-resolution, three-dimensional structures of drug targets and mechanistic information to support more accurate virtual screens. The availability of expansive datasets of chemically, structurally, and biologically relevant data, in addition to faster computers and improved algorithms, has intensified the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques for drug discovery (Figure 1) (7). Not only is AI helping to identify new uses for old drugs, but several companies have announced drug candidates designed de novo with the help of AI that have advanced to clinical trials (8). Even structural biology is benefiting from AI. The AlphaFold program developed by Google's DeepMind can generate molecular models of drug targets of crystallographic quality (9). Improving the ability of AI to identify new drugs will depend on a continuous supply of high-quality data to train reproducible machine learning models to accurately predict drug-target interactions and identify chemotypes with the most favorable drug-like properties. AI will also help address some of the other challenges that have plagued drug discovery efforts. These include more accurately predicting adverse drug side effects at the earliest stages of the discovery process, identifying the most tractable synthetic pathways to generate industrial quantities of drugs, and formulating novel synthetic pathways for compounds that otherwise cannot be generated in a commercially viable manner. Additionally, AI and machine learning may facilitate the discovery of drugs for protein or nonprotein targets that are considered undruggable. For example, there is much promise in modulating discrete disease-associated sequences or conformational states of DNA, and protein-coding or noncoding RNAs (3), yet our understanding of how genetic materials can be manipulated in a therapeutic manner is in its infancy. Improvements in computer-aided drug design alone will not fix high failure rates in drug discovery. Better in vitro modeling of diseases will be required to define biological processes that drive disease, validate bona fide disease-modifying targets, and better predict drug candidates that are efficacious in patients. Innovations in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), iPSC-derived organoids, and so-called \"organs-on-a-chip\" are yielding improved models of disease and cellular systems that are more capable of predicting adverse drug effects (10, 11 ) (Figure 1). Continued advances in cell and tissue engineering, combined with improvements in materials science and microfabrication techniques, will further optimize the conditions under which patient-derived cells can better recapitulate healthy or pathological conditions in the human body ( 12). Learning more about how environmental factors interact iteratively with an individual's genome to determine disease risk (Figure 1) (13) will catalyze the development of entirely new classes of prophylactic drugs, many of which are likely to operate through biological mechanisms fundamentally different from those targeted after a disease is established. The tremendous promise of genome-editing technologies may be realized such that disease-associated genetic variants are corrected before diseases occur (2). By editing RNA, it may be possible to manipulate transcriptional responses to disease-1Nash Family Department of Neuroscience and 2Drug Discovery Institute, 3Department of Medicine and the Tisch Cancer Institute, 4Department of Pharmacological Sciences, 5Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY *Corresponding author: paul.kenny@mssm.eduThe Frontiers of Medical Research32causing environmental insults so as to reduce disease risk or facilitate recovery. Progress in genetic and chemical engineering will be required to develop viruses, nanoparticles, lipid vesicles, modified retrotransposons, or other novel systems to deliver genetically encoded information, such as therapeutic transgenes or the proteins and RNAs required for genome editing, to only those cells in which expression is desired, and to do so in a safe, efficient, and temporally controlled manner (14 , 15). While stunning progress has been achieved in sequencing and manipulating genetic materials, equivalent progress for proteins has been slower. This reflects the daunting technical hurdles associated with sequencing proteins and their posttranslational modifications in a high-throughput, accurate, and inexpensive manner. Progress in proteomics will better link disease-related genetic variants to the protein networks through which they operate and identify more robust biomarkers of disease vulnerability and therapeutic response to drug treatments. In parallel, novel therapeutic proteins with high selectivity for their targets and low risk of adverse events will complement or even supersede traditional small-molecule therapeutics for many diseases. Harnessing the power of the immune system will also play an increasingly important role in therapeutic discovery. Recombinant monoclonal, bispecific, monomeric, and drug-conjugated antibodies, as well as other immune proteins, are emerging as important interventions for many cancers (Figure 1). Genetic reengineering of immune cells, exemplified by chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell- directed therapies, is likely to become more prevalent. Similarly, RNA vaccines, oncolytic viruses, checkpoint inhibitors, and other novel strategies to modulate the activity of the immune system and target immune cells to diseased tissue will continue to advance. The brain and other relatively immune-privileged organs represent new vistas for immunotherapeutics (16 ) A final note on where drug development is likely to occur in the future: Recent years have seen major pharmaceutical companies reduce early-stage drug discovery efforts to FIGURE 1. The future of therapeutic discovery. Improvements in genomic and transcriptomic sequencing and proteomics technologies, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based mining of electronic medical records and digital data, will support the identification of new targets for therapeutic discovery. Advances in AI and other cutting-edge computational approaches will drive more efficient discovery of new drugs that are safe and effective. Cell and tissue engineering will deliver better in vitro models of disease. New therapeutic modalities will emerge and new classes of currently undruggable targets will become tractable. These advances will bring us closer to a future of truly personalized medicine iPSCs, induced pluripotent stem cells..The Frontiers of Medical Research33mitigate the high risk associated with these endeavors. Instead, companies are increasingly partnering with academic institutions and smaller biotech companies to fill their pipelines, often only after a novel therapeutic has been relatively derisked by successful advancement to an important preclinical or clinical development milestone. Governmental funding agencies have invested heavily in academic drug discovery initiatives over the past decade. In parallel, academic institutes have increasingly embraced the idea of translating their most promising new findings into drug discovery programs, a trend that is likely to continue as new drug successes are realized. This rapidly changing landscape in early-stage drug discovery presents unique challenges and opportunities for all involved. Finding new ground and fostering new types of relationships between academic institutes, pharmaceutical companies, and government agencies is critically important for the future success of therapeutic discovery.References 1 .

STEM CELL BIOLOGY AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE Fulfilling the promise of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine Joel W. Blanchard1,2,3, Timothy A. Blenkinsop1,4,5 , Robert . Zwaka1,4, Mlodzik1,4,5,6,7*, Sarah E. Millar1,4,6,8* Stem cell biology and regenerative medicine have long held promise for the development of new therapeutic strategies. A congruence of recent discoveries and innovations has propelled the field to the cusp of realizing this promise (Figure 1). These include the ability to generate autologous (patient- specific) human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) engineered to serve as a universal source for allogeneic cell therapy; the advent of gene- editing technologies to repair or introduce disease-associated mutations for personalized cell-based therapies or mechanistic studies; stem cell differentiation strategies based on information from developmental and single-cell analyses; and the use of bioengineering technologies to generate three-dimensional \"mini-organs. \" Applications of stem cell biology include transplantation of stem cell-derived therapeutic cells or tissues; generation of in vitro platforms for mechanistic investigations and drug screening; and studies of endogenous stem cells and their niche environment that reveal new therapeutic targets. Stem cell-based therapies are most immediately applicable in scenarios where cell transplantation procedures are already established in clinical practice. The classic example of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) relies on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that give rise to all blood cells. BMT is a curative treatment for blood cancers and immune cell deficiencies; however, it relies on matched donors for allogeneic transplantation (1), and HSCs are short-lived ex vivo. These challenges are being addressed by developing new techniques to expand HSCs while maintaining potency (2), including altering the degradation capacity of lysosomes in HSCs (3). A fascinating but yet-to-be-demonstrated approach is to generate HSCs via directed differentiation of hiPSCs (4). This could potentially be scaled for banking of common haplotypes for transplant, or employed in a patient-specific setting with gene editing of autologous iPSCs to correct gene defects in inherited diseases such as sickle cell anemia. Another exciting application of hPSC differentiation technologies is the generation of immune cells for adoptive immunotherapies, for instance chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells that are engineered to target tumors and can be produced at scale. T cells and natural killer cells can be stably engineered to have \"off-the-shelf\" anticancer potential and do not require the derivation of an HSC precursor for their generation from hPSCs. This in turn raises entirely new paradigms for hematopoeisis in regenerative medicine, as hPSCs robustly give rise to HSC-independent embryonic hematopoietic progenitors that may have unique therapeutic potential. For example, a recently identified embryonic myeloid progenitor gives rise to natural killer cells with enhanced cytotoxicity as compared with their HSC-derived counterparts (5). These cells are being tested as potential cancer therapeutics. In parallel, gene-edited iPSC-derived myeloid cells are being used as a model to uncover mechanisms of malignant and nonmalignant blood diseases and to guide new therapies (6 ). Other stem cell transplantation paradigms include the skin epidermis and cornea, which can respectively be regenerated by grafting of epidermal and corneal limbal stem cells (7). In one encouraging study, a therapeutic gene was virally 1Black Family Stem Cell Institute; 2Ronald Alzheimer's Disease; and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY These authors contributed equally. *Corresponding authors: pathophysiological and therapeutic discovery. iPSCs, induced pluripotent stem cells.introduced into epidermal stem cells that were expanded and grafted to cure an otherwise lethal genetic skin condition (7). More recently, several groups have used gene editing to correct the gene mutated in recessive epidermolysis bullosa in patient-derived iPSCs, followed by for skin grafting (8). Retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) is likewise amenable to stem cell transplantation to potentially treat vision loss. For example, RPE engineered from adult stem cells can safely replace host RPE function in nonhuman primates (9). hiPSC-derived RPE has been transplanted into a human patient, but this was not associated with a significant improvement in visual acuity, and a second patient was not treated due to genomic instability of the hiPSC-derived cells (10). Other concerns surrounding hiPSC- based therapies include the preservation of epigenetic memory in hiPSC-derived cells that may impact their differentiation potential in vivo. Thus, these approaches still face significant hurdles to their adoption in clinical practice. Researchers have harnessed the self-assembling properties of differentiating stem cells to partially recapitulate the development of more complex human organs, such as lung, small intestine, kidney, and brain to an extent (11 , 12), ex vivo. hiPSC-based brain organoids are being developed to recreate the choroid plexus, myelination, and the blood-brain barrier (13, 14). Some models have even produced evidence of interaction of hiPSC-derived human brain tissue with other organs such as the gut-brain axis and neuromuscular circuits (15, 16 ). Organoids are facilitating discoveries into fundamental disease mechanisms in many areas, including neurodevelopmental disorders (17 ), neurodegenerative diseases (18), and viral infection (19), and provide an important counterpart to animal models that can fail to recapitulate human disease accurately or may respond differently to therapeutic agents. However, their utility for disease modeling and drug screening relies on the extent to which they accurately reflect human physiology. For instance, comparative analysis of primary human fetal tissue and brain organoids at the single-cell level revealed important differences in the presence, maturation, and spatial distribution of distinct cell subtypes. Improving these models will require a deeper understanding of human fetal development, an area that has been hampered by restrictions on the use of discarded human fetal tissue in research (20 ). Despite differences in detailed mechanisms and cell types between human and mouse model systems, the latter continue to play a key role in regenerative medicine. For instance, while grafting epidermal stem cells effectively replaces the outer layer of skin, such grafts lack hair follicles, oil glands, and touch cells. Current research using mouse genetic models is uncovering signaling pathways that direct development of these associated structures ( 21, 22). In parallel, understanding the regulatory The Frontiers of Medical Research35interactions between endogenous tissue stem cells and their niche environment suggests approaches to therapeutically stimulate or dampen stem cell activity. As an example, muscle wasting diseases have devastating effects and are currently incurable. Experiments in mice have shown that skeletal-muscle regeneration relies on muscle stem cells (MuSCs), which are normally maintained in a quiescent state by signals from the niche environment but are activated upon injury (23 -25). While widespread therapeutic transplantation of MuSCs would clearly be challenging, alternatives may include use of biologicals or small molecules that target niche signals to enhance the function of native MuSCs. This is a highly exciting era for regenerative medicine. While the next decade will undoubtedly reveal additional challenges related to safety and efficacy, we can expect to see the actualization of novel therapies based on multiple aspects of stem cell biology, particularly in areas where cell and tissue transplantation techniques are well established.

SURGERY Dramatic innovations in surgery Joshua Bederson1*, H. Adams2, Evan Flatow3, Leesa Galatz3, Eric M. Genden4, Michael L. Marin5 Although surgical training is long and rigorous, even the most creative surgeons are limited by human biology and available tools. To cite one example, blood is red, tissues are opaque, and we cannot see through the body. Technological solutions to these and myriad other limitations have driven a revolution in surgical innovation over the past 50 years. Advances in microscopy, miniaturization, implantable materials, imaging techniques, and our understanding of biology and brain function, together with powerful computing, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI), have led to dramatic changes in the way surgery is performed and to the development of entirely new treatments. Orthopedics and spine surgery An explosion of basic science tools and the demands of an increasingly aging and yet active population have amplified the need for less invasive and regenerative approaches. Percutaneous fracture repair and new ingrowth materials for joint replacement (1) have been developed. Computer-aided navigation, robotics, patient-specific instrumentation, and augmented/virtual reality during spine and joint replacement surgery have increased safety (2) and have enabled surgeons to save joints that were previously considered inoperable due to bone loss in degenerative arthropathies. Research into the biology of cartilage and tendon (3) and how they repair after injury is driving development of tissue engineering and cell therapies to enhance healing (4). Vascular and cerebrovascular surgery Treatment of the most common and devastating diseases, including vascular insufficiency, stroke, and aneurysms, has been completely revolutionized within the last decade. Flow- diverting and fenestrated endovascular prostheses allow reconstruction of diseased arteries, resulting in the cure of previously untreatable aneurysms of the brain (5) and aorta (6). Intracranial thrombectomy is the most effective medical treatment to date (7). Endovascular access has opened a pathway to treat disorders outside vasculature, such as in cardiac arrhythmias and now in brain disorders (Figure 1). Tumor surgery Maximal resection while preserving function is the goal for tumor surgery. However, many tumors are not visible to the naked eye or even through an operating microscope. Frameless stereotactic navigation has become a modern standard in brain tumor surgery (8), and combined with other techniques, greatly enhances the ability to differentiate tumor from normal tissue. New technologies include intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and electrophysiological brain mapping. New molecular agents aid in selectively visualizing tumor cells (9), and some of the same fluorophores that delineate tumor cells may be used to eradicate them by light activation. Use of magnetic nanoparticles (10), patient-specific 1Department of Neurosurgery, 2Department of Orthopedics, 4Department of Otolaryngology, 5Department of Surgery, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY *Corresponding author: joshua.bederson@mountsinai.orgThe Frontiers of Medical Research36 FIGURE 1.

(C) \"Stentrode\" with sixteen 500 \u00b5m-diameter recording electrodes embedded in an intracranial stent and connected to a subclavicular transmitting device (see Figure 4).induced pluripotent stem cells (11 ), and low-intensity focused ultrasound are all being developed to enhance tumor resection. Cardiac surgery Deep collaborations between cardiac surgeons, electrophysiologists, and cardiac imaging scientists have led to new concepts in the management of heart diseases such as mitral valve prolapse (MVP), which affects up to 3% of the Western population. MVP usually follows a protracted course, but some patients suffer devastating ventricular arrhythmias or fatal sudden cardiac arrest early in the disease. By combining electrophysiology, positron emission tomography, and MRI, a previously unrecognized link was found between structural abnormalities in the mitral valve and the deadly arrhythmias (Figure 2). Direct-access cryoablation of a pathological focus at the time of mitral repair surgery led to a dramatic reduction in abnormal activity. This work has inspired an emerging national focus on the treatment of patients with associated ventricular arrhythmias (12 , 13). Augmented and virtual reality Advances in neuroimaging and computer graphics have permitted the ability to merge different modalities such as computerized tomography (CT), MRI, angiography, and ultrasound to create interactive three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality \"scenarios. \" These can be coregistered to a patient's anatomy and linked to navigation devices that are essentially GPS maps of organs\u2014such as the human brain\u2014that guide surgery. Projected into an operating microscope in a heads-up display during surgery, these systems are at least a partial solution to a vexing problem, allowing surgeons to see \"through\" tissues to the critical structures beyond (14 ) (Figure 3). Restorative surgery Even the most advanced instruments may not be capable of restoring function in patients with trauma, cancer, stroke, or neurodegenerative disorders. A deeper understanding of neural stem cell physiology and 3D brain organoids, together with novel transplant strategies, has led to enhanced engraftment of transplanted brain tissues (15). Improved understanding of axonal regeneration and wound healing has pushed the development of novel regenerative approaches that encourage neural repair and axonal reconnectivity after traumatic injury (16 ). Advanced immunosuppressive methods combined with creative surgical techniques have led to the first-in-human transplantation of a trachea and adjacent structures ( 17). These advances have ushered in a new era of transplantation that promises to restore complex functions such as movement after paralysis, control of tremors, and the return of smell, taste, speech, and swallowing. Brain-computer interfaces From the first reports of implantable brain-computer interfaces (BCI) to the modern era, BCI can be seen as developing along at least two pathways. In one, electrodes, stimulators, and programmable brain pacemakers modulate, suppress, or block pathological processes such as epilepsy, movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (18), and The Frontiers of Medical Research37neuropsychiatric conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, and depression (19). Full closed- loop self-programming systems detect abnormal signaling patterns and adjust the output to suppress pathological activity in the brain (20 ). As our understanding of brain circuitry improves, dementia, traumatic brain injury, addiction, obesity, and even cognitive enhancement (21 ) are potential indications for modulation. In another major pathway, BCI technologies aim to address failed transmission from the cerebral cortex due to conditions such as spinal cord injury, stroke, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Surgically implanted neuroprostheses create a direct link from the brain to computers. For example, data from cortical surface electrodes have been used to produce natural speech (22), and using AI algorithms, to decode handwriting translated to texting. One such invention is the Stentrode, an endovascular stent and brain-machine interface already implanted in four humans and helping to translate their thoughts into digital output (Figure 4) (23 ). It is essential to develop tactile or haptic feedback perception using BCI; until this occurs, even a high- performing motor solution will be perceived as separate or unwieldy by its user. FIGURE 3.

Adapted from (12).The Frontiers of Medical Research38Commercialization of BCI technology is an important driver in the field, harnessing the massive resources available to industry. Likewise, continuous reevaluations of moral principles by physicians and scientists will be critical in guiding future research and care in this rapidly advancing field (24 ). Access to care Finally, technological innovations coupled with improved at- home care are expanding the platform for ambulatory surgery, which can be applied to the 5 billion people in the world who currently do not have access to surgical interventions (25 ).

Shaw1,2,3,4*, Veerle Bergink1,5, Gelijns2, Roxana Mehran3 Sex and gender differences in disease manifestation, clinical outcomes, and treatment effectiveness are understudied but full of enormous possibilities for discovery and advancement in women's health. It is only recently that research has focused on uncovering unique attributes that define sex-based phenotypes, including the many trait characteristics of women of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. This coincides with the U.S. National Institutes of Health's (NIH) 2016 mandate to include sex as a biological variable in all funded research, which at long last provides foundational knowledge of sex differences in cell and organ function in health and disease. Even though most research focuses on episodic care for a specific health condition, each life stage of a woman, from childhood to elder years, is inextricably linked with detectable precursors of future health care needs and chronic diseases in later life. Altering the pathways that lead to common chronic conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and depression, requires pioneering research bringing together scientists and disease specialists to reveal a comprehensive understanding of health and disease in women (Figure 1). Pregnancy-related complications are increasingly common, and\u2014as our research underscores\u2014highlight the alarming and increasing inequities of care for Black as compared to White women (1). Certain pathogenic conditions during pregnancy are precursors for a woman's later health, such as pre-eclampsia and future risk of hypertension. An array of pregnancy-related complications predicts future cardiovascular disease (such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, gestational diabetes, and placental abruption). A model of early intervention has the potential to improve perinatal outcomes while also resulting in the immeasurable benefit of improving the health of middle-older aged women. However, research has lagged, and randomized trials evaluating the clinical benefit of intensified preventive care strategies aimed to reduce adverse perinatal outcomes are long overdue. Redefining high-quality care would importantly benefit women at highest risk, including those of diverse race and ethnicity. Mental health benefits would also be realized for diverse women, as health discrimination increases stress, anxiety, and depression during pregnancy (2). The mental health stability of mothers is also vital for the health of their children, as high stress levels or exposure to environmental toxins during pregnancy increase risk of mental health and cognitive problems in their offspring. Postpartum pathology is prevalent, notably among Black women, where infectious mechanisms drive not only cardiomyopathy but also co-occur with high rates of anxiety and depression. Targeted research aimed at improving preventive health practices would not only reduce near-term events related to pregnancy but dramatically reduce future risk of chronic diseases that greatly impact and debilitate a woman's later years, such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer, mood disorders, and cardiovascular disease. As a woman ages, the loss of estrogen that occurs during menopause is associated with wide ranging disease expression and the emergence of several chronic diseases (3-5). Cardiovascular disease is a prominent condition, which increases in prevalence and severity in the postmenopausal woman. Despite marked advances in cardiovascular care, significant disparities in care persist, which adversely impact morbid and fatal outcomes for millions of women. Cardiovascular disease in women remains understudied, underrecognized, underdiagnosed, and undertreated. myocardial infarction with normal/nonobstructive coronary arteries, and spontaneous coronary artery dissection all commonly occur in women without a definable diagnostic and therapeutic strategy of care. Recently, The Lancet Commission on Women and Cardiovascular Disease addressed these worrisome trends by identifying knowledge gaps in research, prevention, treatment, and access to care for women (6). A wide range of psychological, social, economic, cultural, and sex-specific risk factors need further investigation and consideration to improve our understanding of cardiovascular disease in women. Cross-disciplinary explorations focusing on women undergoing premature menopause is a means for early detection of cardiovascular disease. Early menopause before 40 years of age occurs more often among women who are obese, smokers, human immunodeficiency virus-infected, and those with certain autoimmune diseases. Iatrogenic premature loss of ovarian function is increasingly common for women at elevated genetic risk of ovarian cancer, such as those harboring pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants who undergo risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (7). Knowledge can also be gleaned through clinical and translational research in transgender/ gender nonbinary people in whom feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapy may promote or attenuate atherosclerotic plaque progression. The unique role of inflammation in women warrants further investigation, with autoimmune diseases occurring at a rate twofold higher than that of men (8, 9). Population evidence reveals that women live within a greater inflammatory milieu, with higher levels of the generalized inflammatory marker C-reactive protein across all age groups (10-12). The high rate of obesity in women may contribute to this chronic, low-grade inflammation, and the associated increased inflammatory cytokine production may in turn contribute to obesity-related pathologies, such as diabetes, cancer, depression, and cardiovascular disease (13). Moreover, the post-COVID-19 syndrome occurs more often in women versus men (ratio=4:1), necessitating research unearthing the mechanism for the stronger autoimmune response among women (especially those younger women with potential underlying autoimmune disorders). Disentangling the interplay between sex-specific traits and cultural and societal disadvantages impacting women's health is daunting. Until now, typical sex-based comparisons were 1Blavatnik Family Women's Health Research Institute, 2Department of Population Health Science and Policy, 3Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, 4Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Science, 5Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY *Corresponding author: leslee.shaw@mountsinai.orgThe Frontiers of Medical Research40 FIGURE 1. A multidisciplinary approach to women's health across their lifespan. yToday's health care environment is siloed and creates dramatic inefficiencies and discontinuity of care. yBy focusing on a woman's lifespan, unique cross-disciplinary teams of experts are brought together to research disease states and interconnecting factors impacting women throughout their lives. yConnections forged across medical specialties enhance our understanding of how each stage of life contributes to women's future health and life expectancy. ySocietal, economic, and other disadvantages uniquely contribute to worsening disease states, diminished quality of life, and shortened life expectancy for women, especially for women of diverse race and ethnicity. yBoth sex (i.e., biologic) and gender (i.e., societal/cultural) factors uniquely contribute to varied female phenotypes and affect unique disease mechanisms and presentations, requiring female-centered care management strategies. (Purple, white, and gold are the colors of the U.S. suffrage movement.) often based on the principle of \"sameness\" (14 ), where men and women have similar odds of prompt diagnosis and receipt of guideline-directed treatment. In reality, there is a prominent selection bias in referral of women, delayed presentation across varied diseases, suboptimal enrollment of women in clinical research, and underuse of a wide range of effective medical therapies and surgical procedures (14 ). Recent developments in artificial intelligence methods (15) are well suited to unearth the complexities of sex and gender science. Yet to be discovered is the way in which sex and gender features form complex patterns leading to varied disease manifestations that may be extracted by sequential predictive modeling using learning algorithms. Targeting equitable care of women requires integrating gendered structural determinants of health with targeted sex- specific needs of women in order to define care coordination (14). Our most vulnerable racially and ethnically diverse women, lacking financial means and burdened with multigenerational care responsibilities coupled with societal discrimination, face a daunting task of seeking care in our health care system. People from sexual and gender minority populations also experience significant access and treatment barriers. Our health care system lacks impetus to change without transformative health policies, including public reporting of care for women of diverse race and ethnicity. For women's health scientists, innovation requires questioning everything and thinking creatively about diverse sex-based mechanisms, which include exploring novel strategies of care focused on early detection and averting the long-term adverse consequences leading to chronic diseases and premature mortality. The possibilities are abundant for scientists to realize major strides in improving the lives of women. It is vital that funding agencies fulfill their obligations of equitable enrollment and definable strategies of care to reduce the incidence of preventable illness and reduced life expectancy observed for too many women.
