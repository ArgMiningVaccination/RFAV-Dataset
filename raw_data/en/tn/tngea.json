But unlike a yoga class, where the teacher guides a group of students through a practice, a yoga therapy session is focused on just one person\u2014you. In addition, yoga therapists have extensive training in adapting the practices of yoga\u2014such as postures, breathing and meditation\u2014to suit the individual needs of their clients. No yoga experience is required. And despite the common misconception that you need to be flexible to practice yoga, yoga therapy can help people who have limited mobility, as well as people who are active. All you need to be able to do to practice yoga is breathe. A growing body of evidence suggests that yoga offers numerous health benefits such as: While all yoga is potentially therapeutic and healing, yoga therapy is the specific application of yogic tools to address your individual needs. During a yoga therapy session, the yoga therapist will work with you to create a personalized practice designed to help you reach your health goals. Working one-on-one with a yoga therapist can be particularly useful for people who are new to a yoga practice and those who have health challenges. 1. Deep listening. The initial session is 90 minutes and begins with an in-depth conversation designed to help the yoga therapist understand your health challenges, history, concerns, interests, and goals. 2. Breathing and movement instruction. You will be guided through some simple movement and breathing practices to assess your strength, flexibility, and balance as well as your habits of body and mind. 3. Creation of a personalized practice. The yoga therapist will create a personalized yoga practice designed to suit your abilities, health goals, medical challenges, interests and time. This may include postures, breathing techniques, and meditation, as well as the application of yogic principles such as gratitude and non-harming. 4. Practice instruction. After guiding you through your practice, the yoga therapist will provide materials (handouts and sometimes audio and/or video recordings) to help you practice regularly at home. 5. Return sessions. Follow-up sessions are 60 minutes and will help refine your practice and, as you become more skilled\u2014and/or your needs change\u2014offer modifications and/or new material. It's important to recognize that, while yoga has great power to heal, it only works if you practice! Because regular practice is essential to gain the benefits of yoga, it's helpful to plan on three to six yoga therapy sessions to get you started and offer support as you establish your home yoga practice. After this initial period, some individuals enjoy having regular sessions, monthly or weekly. Others return for occasional \"touch-up\" visits. In these stressful times, having a regular yoga practice can be an invaluable way to cultivate wellbeing. And it doesn't have to take a lot of time. Even just 15 to 20 minutes a day of yoga will help you stretch and strengthen your body, relax your mind, and lift your spirits.
