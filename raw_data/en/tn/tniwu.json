I had previously done kombo once before and it was okay, I didn't think it was something I would do again. However after crazy year and much needed healing I figured I'd give it another shot, and I am so thankful I did. Goddess Serena truly is a real life goddess amongst us, pure magic in human form. Upon meeting her she was so welcoming, and kind- I felt like I was meeting someone I've known for lifetimes (and probably have) She is authentic and real, having actually lived and learned the experiences she so gracefully shares with others. I really admired and appreciated how insanely knowledgeable she is and how she took the time to really explain the process, intentions, and background behind each ritual of the ceremony. I felt included and involved despite not really knowing much, having but only one previous experience. Ceremony with Goddess Serena just made sense, it felt right and I actually felt a real shift in my energy and in my ability to be able to create more positivity for myself and with others. I also felt amazing afterwards and continued to do so for quite some time after. Most importantly, I felt genuinely supported and cared about during my time there, in my process, my healing, and in my confidence; that myself and all of us, possess the ability do great things, and in and every time after. Thank you Goddess Serena for showing me how many magical and beautiful possibilities there in the world, for believing in me, helping me, and for making the world overall a better more beautiful place to be.
