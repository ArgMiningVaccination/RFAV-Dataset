physical, engineering, environmental and life sciences of potential importance to the defense mission. The program is carried out primarily through grants to univers ities and non-profit organizations. RATING What This Rating Means zThe program has clear purposes. It helps develop technologies that provide options for new weapons, help s prevent technological suprise by adversaries and develops new scientists who will contribute to the DoD mission in the future. zThe program is reviewed regularly by technically capable outside expets, who recommend improvemen ts they believe should be implemented. The experts indicate that the work is of overall high quality. zResearch earmarks have increased dramatically in the past 15-20 years. Such projects contribute less than typical projects to meeting the Department's mission, as they don't have to be screened for relevance or quality, and cost more to administer. Earmarks also reduce incentives for other projects to perform to peak potential, as non-earmarked projects encounter less competit ion for funding. PERFORMING Effective IMPROVEMENT PLAN About Improvement PlansWe are taking the following actions to improve the performance of the program: zEmphasizing the use of independent review panels in assessing the performance of the program. zWorking with the research community and Congress to explain the need to limit claims on research grant funds to proposals that independently can meet the standards of a strict merit-review process.

PROGRAM ASSESSMENT vPROGRAM View Similar Programs Defense Applied Research Program This program supports scientific study of physical, biomedical, behavioral or other phenomena to determine the means by whic h a particular military need may be met. This work is a little more advanced and applied than the basic research from which it may arise. RATING What This Rating Means zProgram purpose and design are clear. The purpose is to support quality science with potential application to the defense mission. The Department has established methodical processes for setting program goals and for reviewing progress. zReviews of the program by exte rnal review panels are not independent of program officials. Some reviewers are government employees with financial associations to the program areas under review. zA large part of the program is exec uted either without the benefit of military or scientific expertise in choosing the funded work or without allowing the applications process to be open to all capable researchers. Earmarking of projects in the program has increased in the recent past and has led to these problems. PERFORMING Moderately Effective IMPROVEMENT PLAN About Improvement PlansWe are taking the following actions to improve the performance of the program: zEnsuring that adequate funding exists to carry promising basic research results through the applied research phase. zChanging the expert evaluation proc ess to use fully independent review panels in assessing the performance of the program. zWorking with the research community and Congress to explain the need to limit claims on research grant funds to proposals that independently can meet the standards of a strict merit-review process.

Models of complex gene-protein interactions will enable simulation, dynamic analysis, prediction a nd control of cellular processes. Based on these models, the program has developed B io-SPICE (Simulation Program for Intra-Cell Evaluation), an open software framework providing innovative models and analysis tools. The extensible design of Bio-SPICE allows for adding, refining and customizing of the Bio-SPICE models and tools for specific cell processes. (U) Technical challenges to developing Bio-SPICE are being met thr ough the development of four-dimen sional (4-D) computational mode ls and simulation techniques, and by leveragi ng cognitive information processing tools. To transition the tech nology, the program is collaborating with several DoD client agencies including Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), U.S. Army Medical Research and Material Comm and (USAMRMC), Soldier Biological and Chemical Command (SBCCOM), Wa lter-Reed Army Institute for Research (WRAIR), Naval Medical Research Command (NMRC), the U. S. Air Force Toxicology prog ram, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). (U) Program Plans: Developed a progressively sophisticated suite of dynamic cellular models and architect ure for Bio-SPICE which will enable model ing, prediction, and control of cellular processes. Con tinually validate results through experimentation.

Built baseline models of intra-cell processes of interest to DoD, such as spore formati on in bacteria like anthrax, bacterial c ell division and growth, and cell death induced by toxins from bio-warfare agents (apoptosis). Identify candidate molecular targets for intervention strategies in sporulation (such as for therapeutics and safe decontamination), cell cycle control, and other proce sses in defense against bio-agents. Demonstrated computer analysis methods for commanders to use in the threat assessment of natural and emerging bio-agents. Thes e methods, which predict pathogenicity and virulence of agents from their genomic information, were demonstrated for several bact erial pathogen cases (staphylococcal enterotoxin B [SEB], E coli), and r esulted in far more information than today's costly wet- experiments. Identified new methods for early detection of exposure of soldie rs to pathogens and toxins using molecular (gene expression) signatures, which is vital for early intervention and avoidance of death. These methods demonstrated a 95% accuracy rate in identifying exposure to host cells among a set of ten pathogens. 6UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA1 Basic Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Defense Research Sciences PE 0601101E, Project BLS-01 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 2 Page 7 of 30 Develop a framework for describing and representing biological know ledge that spans data from the molecular (genomic, proteomic ) to clinical level, and across organisms, to support deep and rapid knowledge extraction.

(U) The Computer Exploitation and Human Collaboration program is also exploring the fundamental science of interconnected systems t o provide powerful mathematical tools for understanding the intrinsi c properties and complexities of large-scale networks and oth er distributed systems. This foundational research is imperative for the future design of robust systems that break away from the established tradition of piece- meal patching of current infrastructures. The resulting mathem atical tools will allow development and defense of critical infr astructures and create more efficient, reliable data networks for the warfighter. The security of the nation depends on interconnected systems, such as the power grid, telecommunications systems, social and organizational networks , economic and financial systems and command and control structur es. These networks can suffer dramatic failures. Such failures can poten tially be prevented or controlled through a fundamental, quantit ative understanding of the intrinsic properties of networks. Deeper scientific f oundations for what might be calle d \"network understanding\" will e ventually generate dramatic new capabilities for the DoD while at the same time gene rating benefits for civilian applications. Overall, the resea rch will provide vastly expanded power and improved interaction for a wide range of military tasks and environments. (U) Research on machine intelligence over the l ast two decades has revealed that many r easoning problems are inherently computation ally complex, and in many cases, intractable. Solutions to these probl ems typically require either enormous computer resources, or simplification of the problem resulting in major sacrifices to accuracy. The Real-W orld Reasoning thrust (REAL) is developing foundational techn ologies, heuristic approaches, and tools necessary to enable effective, practical machine reasoning about increasingly complex, large-sc ale problems on time scales and with accuracies that will aid commanders and wa rfighters in assessing the consequences of specific actions and strategies, and predict future results. This research will push the envelope of deep-reasoning decision making by systematically considering i nteractions among multiple teams of warfighters, robots and weapon systems in strate gic settings where each team may have different or varying go als. The key technologies under investigation are effective, practical inferentia l reasoning in real-world situations with complexity and un certainty; novel paradigms for learning from experience, events, and actions that a ffect the final outcome of a situation or scenario; integrati on of multiple reasoning paradigms; representation and reas oning with information that changes consta ntly over time; reasoning about the goals of other agents; pragmatic reasoning that uses appropriate default assumptions to respond intelligently; and appropr iate metrics for measuring c ognitive behavior and performance. 14UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA1 Basic Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Defense Research Sciences PE 0601101E, Project CCS-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 2 Page 15 of 30 (U) Program Plans: Developed new forms of human-computer inter action that enable humans and computers to work as synergistic teams.

Sophisticated computing capabilities like those available in current desktop workstation and server systems are moving to mobile wireless embedded systems th at communicate over low bandwidth self-organizing tactical netw orks often with low-powered devices. Concurrent w ith the advanced computing capability will be security and other trustworthiness challen ges in the systems that the future U.S. military will be heavily dependent upon during battle. With the increased U.S. military dependenc e on information technology, the ability to maintain battlefield superiority requi res control of our information systems against increasingly so phisticated adversaries employing computer network attack. With foreign production of inform ation technology increasing, and adversaries seeking to us e the asymmetric leverage of cyber warfare as the Achilles' heel of current and future U.S. military systems; the U.S. military must have the ability to withstand, operate through, and counter in creasingly lethal cyber attacks, while reduc ing the manpower required. The DARPA Fut ure Information Assurance Initiatives will identify promising technologies to contin ue to push the state of the art and pursue transition oppor tunities to promote adoption by the military services. Other distinct programs within this project will be created to pursue promising technologie s as they are identified for further focused development.

This pr ogram expands these same goals, by addressing not just the physic al layer but also the entire network stack. Similar to frequency-hopping spread spectrum, the approach of this program is to develop and demonstrate algorithms that provide hopping between IP addresses and then expanding to hopping between different perm utations of layer 1-3 protocols.

In order to develop this new capability, the initial foc us is on tactical mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). MANETs are composed of interdepende nt nodes based on interdependent system layers. Each node exposes tens to hundreds of configurable parameters that must be continuously adapted due to variable tactical factors such as mission profile, phase, force structure, enemy activity, and environmental conditions.

Today's commercial trends are not aimed at supporti ng the DoD's extreme deployments or unique applications. This p rogram will take on the ambitious goal of researching a novel protocol stack th at supports integrated optimiza tion and control of all netwo rk layers simultaneously. Key technical challenges include scalable desi gn, stability, and convergence. These challenges are particular ly difficult in a distributed setting with partial and uncertain information, hi gh communications overhead, and high probability of link failure. To address this problem, the CBMANET program will exploit recent optimization-theo retic breakthroughs, recent info rmation-theoretic breakthroug hs, and comprehensive cross-layer design to develop a network stack fro m first principles with specific attention to support for DOD ap plications such as multicast voice and situation awareness. (U) Program Plans: Design and develop a novel protocol architecture from first pr inciples in information theory and optimization theory. Design and demonstrate protocols based on network coding that vastly improve performance in extreme conditions. Design and demonstrate cross-layer protocols and adaptive cont rol capabilities to drive resource allocation more efficiently. Design novel control interfaces to support DOD-relevant app lications such as multicast and situation awareness. Design appropriate interfaces between the nove l network stack and the physical radio platforms to support cross-layer optimizat ion. Perform quantitative analysis and trade st udies to understand the degree of performan ce offered by the novel network stack.

They are vulnerable to skilled attackers w ho develop creative and unpredictable strategies, and are increasingly dependent on software produced in and/or \"outsourced\" to potentiall y hostile nations. Misconfiguration accounts for most security failures in internet services and poses a serious risk to military systems. This p rogram will develop security aware systems that will avoid brittleness and vulnerabilit y, due to their ability to reason about their own security a ttributes, capabilities and functions with respect to specific mission needs. These syst ems will also dynamically adapt to provide desired levels of s ervice while minimizing risk and providing coherent explanations of the re lative safety of service level alternatives. These systems will b olster the reliability and security of critical open source software systems by reduc ing vulnerabilities and logic erro rs, and providing state-of-the- art software analysis 48UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Information and Communications Technology PE 0602303E, Project IT-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 11 Page 19 of 28 techniques augmented with cognitive decision-making techniques with the ultimate goal of applyi ng these systems on to the Globa l Information Grid. (U) This Security-Aware Systems thrust was previously budgeted in the DARPA PE 0602304E, Project COG-01. It has been enhanced with technologies and approaches developed under the Trustworthy Systems, Asymmetric Flow Monitoring and the DARPA Future Informatio n Assurance Initiatives, programs within this project. The Security -Aware Systems thrust will also explore practical advanced so ftware engineering technology for building flexible systems th at will allow new features to be added vi a \"interposition\" between existing features , with guaranteed levels of reliability and security. Cogni tive and automated software analysis t echniques will screen outsourced software both for quality lapses and unauthorized functiona lity to assure the outsourced code performs as exp ected. Strategies for intelligently adapting compl ex system configurations in response to operator ac tion will be developed. Cognitive reconfi guration technology will infer the user's le gitimate goals and adapt configurations to rapidly meet thos e goals with a minimal impact on security a nd longer-term objectives. The Security-Aw are Systems thrust encompasses the Application Comm unities (AC) program together with several supporting research initiatives. (U) The Application Communities (AC) program will leverage the res earch conducted under DARPA's in formation assurance programs to create a new generation of self-defending software that automatica lly responds to threats, and provide a comprehensive picture of security properties and current status displayed at multiple levels of abstraction and formality. This capability will bring intelligen t security adaptation to DoD systems and make security properties and status more appa rent to decision makers, thus increasing the speed and confidence with which military systems can be securely and dynamically reconfigured, particularly under stressful conditions. AC technology will ena ble collections of similar systems to collaboratively generate a shared awarene ss of security vulnerabilities, vulnerability mitigation strategies , and early warnings of attack. AC will revolutionize the security of military informati on systems and reduce the threat from stealth attacks (where a ttackers take control of systems undetected). (U) Research initiatives related to vulnerabiliti es, missions and threats in computer abstract-model reasoning will enable systems to create a prioritized list of threats and analyze the hypotheses about threat s in the context of system development and deployment. The resulting technology will enable current systems to generate vulnerability reports ranked by probable impa ct of a failure/attack on the mission. In addition, technology that results in a multi-level network operating system capable of controlling the flow of classified information will prevent u nauthorized leakage through computer systems, and provide planners and intelligen ce analysts safe, simultaneous, and convenient access to classifie d and unclassified information. 49UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Information and Communications Technology PE 0602303E, Project IT-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 11 Page 20 of 28 (U) Program Plans: Develop techniques to collaboratively dia gnose and respond to problems (e.g., attacks or failures that threaten a mission) in g roups of military systems.

The technol ogy will allow computational systems to have reasoning and lear ning capabilities and levels of autonomy far beyond those of today's systems. With the ability to reason, learn and adapt, and with facilities f or self-awareness, these will literally be systems that know what they are doing, en abling new levels of capability and powerful new applications. (U) Cognitive Systems are different from conventional computing systems in that they manipulate rich structured representations of their knowledge, learn from experience and add to their store of knowle dge, mix symbolic logical knowle dge with uncertain and probabi listic information, allow reflective self-aware inference, and support th e transition of perceptual (e.g., visual, auditory) data to s ymbolic information. These capabilities are not well matched to the architectures that support more conventional computing. The Cognitive Systems C omputing Foundation project is developing the tools and architecture necessary to support the cognitive computing revolution.

These capabilities will make the difference be tween mission success and mission degradation or failure, e ven in the event of cyber-attack or component attrition resulting from kinetic warfare or accidental faults and errors. Systems that learn and rea son will reduce the requirement for skilled system administrators and dramatically reduce the overall cost of system maintenance.

These technologies will lead to systems with increased self- reliance, intelligent negotiation capability, cooperative behavior, the capacity to rec onfigure themselves, and survivability w ith reduced programmer intervention. In cognitive architectures, there ar e three primary types of processes: reactive, deliberative and re flective. Reactive processes respond quickly and directly to known stimuli; deliberative processes embody wh at is usually known as \"thinking;\" and reflective (higher-order) processes allow a system to \"st ep back\" and evaluate the environment and its own capabilities to decide the next appropriate course of action. Each of these processes will be improved through lear ning. Individual technical capabilities developed in this pro ject include novel representations for knowledge, skill learning, algorithms for au tomated reasoning (deductive, a bductive, planning, strategic in ference, and hybrid approaches), pattern detection capabilities, and language learning.

The application of this te chnology will result in military systems that are more robust, self-sufficient, and re quire minimal or no platform-specific customization. Current projects will develop hybrid learning techniques to create cognitive systems capable of learning military strategy, leveraging large amounts of prior knowledge, incorporating external guidance and applying prior knowledge in r eal-time to the naturally changing environment, all without pr ogrammer intervention. The Foundational Learning Technology thrust include s three programs: Real-World Learning, Integrated Learning, and Bio- Inspired Cognition. The Real-World Learning program will explore the integration and application of advanced machine learning techniques to enable cognitive computing systems that learn from e xperience and adapt to changing situations. The program will emphasize Transfer L earning providing the ability to transfer knowledge and skills learned for sp ecific situations to novel, una nticipated situations and p erform appropriately and effectively the first tim e a novel situation is encountered. This is essential because currently, most milit ary operations occur in ever changing environment and U.S. forces and systems mu st be able to act appropriately and effectively the first time each novel situation is encountered. The program will drive the design and implementation of new hybrid learning technologies, such as la rge-scale transfer learning, multi-purpose extensible knowledge learning, l earning with minimal direction, learning adaptable and efficie nt network structures, bootstrapped strategy learning, learning from text, l earning intent of information, and learning generalized task m odels. The program will stress technologies that combine statistical learning techniques with knowledge-based techniques that take into ac count background knowledge and a priori experience. The resulting technologies will a) learn and represent vast amounts of knowledge in forms that can be applied to unknown situ ations and domains; b) generalize learned knowledge and apply it to dynamic and unpred ictable situations; and c) reason about a situation or environment. 70UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 13 of 28 The Integrated Learning program will create a new computer lear ning paradigm in which systems learn complex workflows from warfighters while the warfighters perform their regular duties. Current machine learning technologies cannot learn these compl ex workflows. The program is focused on military planning tasks su ch as AOC (air operations center) planning and military medical logistics. With this learning technology, it will be possible to create many different types of military decision support systems that lea rn by watching experts rather than relying on hand-encode d knowledge (which is expensive and error prone to produce). The new learning paradi gm differs from conventional machine learning in that it does not re ly on large amounts of carefully crafted training data. Rather , in the new paradigm the learner works to \"figure things out\" by combining many different types of learning, reasoning, and knowledge. For instance to learn AOC tasks, the computer learner combines: what it observed the warfighters doing with the knowledge it has about aircr aft, and the reasoning about airspace deconfliction to create a generalized m odel that can then be used to perform the entire AOC task o r provide intelligent instruction to other warfighters performing the same task. The Bio-Inspired Cognition program will draw on continuing adva nces in neurophysiology and cogn itive psychology to guide and augment traditional artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to l earning, reasoning, memory, know ledge acquisition and organizat ion, and executive functions. The work will focus on novel designs inspir ed by the function, representation and structure of the brain. This approach will expand traditional AI technologies from complex sy mbolic processing to new capabilities in memory, categorization , pattern recognition and fusion of perceptua l/sensory information. Computational in telligence is in its infancy, whereas the hu man brain is the product of millions of years of evolutionary development. Thus, designing software inspired by the brain's processing sche mes can offer leap-ahead advances in cognitive syst ems. These systems will seek to emulate human performance in exploiting past experi ence in novel situations, learning in multiple ways, fusing multiple percep tual inputs in real-time, extracting concepts from specific experiences, forming hierarchies of associated memories and concepts, and dir ecting attention through a complex executive process. This thr ust will take a fresh look at the design and implementation of bio-inspir ed cognitive architectures modeled after human cognition that c ombine principles from neuroscience and cognitive psychology with tr aditional artificial intelligence-based symbol processing and know ledge representation. Success will, in part, be meas ured by the ability of the systems devel oped to deal effectively with novel situ ations and respond appropriately in reasonable timefram es. This thrust has the potential to revolutionize a broad range of military appli cations through breakthrough performan ce of intelligent machines. 71UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 14 of 28 (U) Program Plans: Real-World Learning. -- Selected several critical problems and scenarios to challenge machine learning technology in ways that will determine the essential value of individual techniques. -- Establish a testbed of complex multi-agent environments for the generation of specific and novel situations that will be used t o evaluate learning techniques and components. -- Design and develop hybrid learning systems that allow cognitive sy stems to generalize based on information gathered and learned to operate successfully in similar, but not identical situations; adapt to a wide va riety of naturally-occurring situations; an d perform better over time. -- Demonstrate the ability of a cognitive agen t to learn large amounts of knowledge fo r performance in a specified domain on an unknown task within the same domain. -- Demonstrate the ability of a cognitive agen t to combine and restructure knowledge from multiple domains to solve novel problems.

Tasks requiring higher- level computation, such as perception-based navigation, will also benefit. (U) Program Plans: Learning Locomotion and Navigation. -- Explore the integration of various learning technologies to enable rapid adaptation by robots to new physical environments and improve autonomous vehicle speed over rough terrain. -- Develop learning methods that allow their learned navigation algorithms to surpass the perfo rmance of a baseline system. -- Transfer the best performing navigation methods learned on a smal l-scale vehicle to the large robotic vehicle, Spinner, to incr ease speeds in complex environments. -- Explore \"learning from example\" and \"reinforcement learning\" a pplications to develop technology for autonomous vehicle systems to learn from example and from ga thered experience without relying on a pr ogrammer to anticipate all eventualities. -- Create learning locomotion toolkits that will control a di verse set of high degree-of-freedom vehicles on rough terrain. Narrative Title FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 Knowledge-Based Technology 2.478 4.540 6.413 (U) The Knowledge-Based Technology thrust will develop enabling tec hnologies, methodologies, ontologi es and detailed knowledge base s to achieve the next generation of intelligent, knowledge-intensive systems. This work will focus on developing technology that sp ans the spectrum from large, strategic knowledge banks to sm all, individual knowledge-based systems. The Knowledge-Based Technology thrust comp rises Knowledge-Based Systems and Bootstrapping Cognitiv e Systems with Implicit Semantic Knowledge. The Knowledge-Based Systems program will de velop technologies to acquire, codify, link, integrate, and use complex and cross- disciplinary knowledge at varying scales. At a strategic level, this capability will pr ovide DoD decision makers with rapid, a s-needed access to relevant background knowledge from a broad spectrum of sources. The knowledge will be expressed in formal knowledge representation languages that allow computers to reason with the knowledge, consider its implica tions, imagine possible future scenarios and query the warfighter for clarification. The significant ch allenges are centered on the fact that critical knowledge involv es temporal 74UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 17 of 28 information, complex belief structures and uncertainty. Current representation technology is inadequate to capture such inform ation. This program will develop technology needed to enable the creation of individual knowledge-based systems that would incorporate into the reasoning process (in a computer-understandabl e form) knowledge of the warfighter's r esponsibilities, approach, tasks and activ ities. Another goal of this program is to support the warfighter's ability to understa nd the \"big picture\" for mission planning, monit oring and re- planning. By formalizing situation-mode l representations, automated support will be pr ovided to commanders and analysts for pr ediction of unforeseen events and determination of relevance of isolated or partial events to the evolvi ng situation. To achieve these objectives, this program will develop analogical and case-based reasoning, la nguages and situation markup lan guages technologies, and forma lized situation representations. An additional goa l is the development of technologies for rich, high-fidelity simulation models of human learning, reasoning and behavior. The program will also explor e new ways for knowledge to be transferred efficiently to a know ledge base by reading tutorial text intended to convey new concepts to a cognitive system. The Bootstrapping Cognitive Systems with Implicit Semantic Know ledge program will explore a new technique for creating cognitiv e systems that learn to perform actions in an intelligent fashion without detailed r easoning or reliance on detailed models of ac tion. Instead, the technique uses large amounts of coarse grained information and usage statistics gathered by watching many warfighters at wo rk. This body of knowledge enables the algorithms to \"do the right thing\" without detailed computation - replacing detailed knowledge-ba sed inference or planning with statistical usage information. This new technique will lower the cost of creating cognitive systems that perform assistive tasks for our warfighters. (U) Program Plans: Knowledge-Based Systems -- Developed initial techniques for represe nting and using common sense knowledge. -- Explored novel methods for acquiring new knowledge that is l ess onerous than traditional methods requiring hand-coding by experts including direct input thr ough processing natural language text. -- Develop and evaluate methods, protocols, and tools for using interoperable knowledge modules resident on distributed knowledge servers. -- Develop integrated knowledge representation and learning technolo gy that enables effective representation of essential forms of knowledge. 75UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 18 of 28 -- Document a substantial library of formal declarative interoperable multi-use ontologies initially across single, then multiple domains. -- Demonstrate and evaluate prototypes of stra tegic and individual knowledge-based systems. -- Develop representations of events and me thods for separating and tracking their association to merge multiple scenarios, assimilate one event within the context of the othe r, and identify where events deviate from the norm.

(U) A unique aspect of natural perceptual systems is their ability to filter and integrate vast amounts of raw sensor data, such as visual flow and rich auditory input; rapidly segment the resultant data into meaningful elements; and integrate them into a coherent pictur e. The human perceptual system is able to create perceptual units that par cel the world into objects and di screte entities that are then rec ognized, remembered and used in problem solving. Looking closely at these innate pe rception abilities will yield insights into how to build totally no vel computational systems that identify important, low-frequency events in a noisy e nvironment. This kind of approach should lead to dramatic im provements in the ability of a computer to process and analyze huge amounts of data to form a high-level understandi ng within its environment. R obust interaction among cognitive systems, legacy systems and warfighters will require incorporation of advanced m odels and control of the networ k infrastructure to ensure adequate provisioning of quality-of-service under d ynamic loads. Together, these technologies will allow the warfigh ter to focus on high-level mission objectives rather than low-level maintenance of supporting systems. At the same time the technology will en sure that the warfighter maintains essential understanding of how (and how well) the system is implementing and responding to high-level dire ction. (U) This project will focus on methods for users to interact with a nd direct cognitive systems (including the physical sensors and effectors); technologies to reduce the personnel and labor required for set up a nd maintenance of tactical and strategic networks; and tech niques for retrieving and interpreting relevant collected information. High-level languages will be developed for rapid and precise specification of complex behavior in response to mission demands. Since it is equally important for th e warfighter or commander to understand the system as it is f or the system to understand the user's goals and n eeds, this project will develop technologies that give systems the ability to explain, perceiv e and reason about their behavior and actions. While development of stand-alone cognitive systems re presents a huge leap forward, real, complex m ilitary missions require teams of these systems to work collaboratively. The pr oject will also develop those technologies necessary to enable s uch systems to collaborate effectively and take advantage of the power of collective cognitive agents.

Th e main thrust of this program is the Improving Warfighter Information Intake under Stress program. The Improvi ng Warfighter Information Intake under Stress program will enha nce operational effectiveness through a set of cognitive techniques that specifically improve 1) the amount of information that war fighters can handle, thereby reducing manpower requirements (e.g., one person doing the j ob of three); 2) attention management during stressful oper ations; and 3) information retention (memory). The program will develop th e means, devices and infrastruct ure necessary to assess the warfigh ter's or commander's cognitive status in real time, and use adaptive strategies specific to his/ her status to improve information proces sing and decision- making. The program will develop the technologies to integrate new digital devices that support memory, attention, and context recovery; and will culminate in the development of closed-loop systems that enab le computer systems to adapt to the warfighter's or decision- maker's cognitive status. The research is also pursuing perceptual processing-b ased displays that are sensitive to information processing mechan isms inherent in the human perceptual system to invent, modify and redesign devices that more effectively deliver content to the operator. Such wor k will include designing and building adaptive multimodal interfaces that impr ove the battlefield and command cen ter communications, and explo iting all of the digital information currently available in a static command enviro nment.

Such situations typically require multiple coord inated tasks that involve information sharing and cooperative efforts. The Colla borative Cognition thrust will foster the design and implementat ion of collaborative software agents that operate in dynamic environments and include both software agents and people. Applications include collabo rative surveillance and reconnaissance systems, logistics re-planning an d decision support for unanticip ated operational changes, situ ational analysis, prediction tools, and other aids to warfighter/commander decision making. The technology will also allow software agents to co pe with limited and/or noisy sensor information, limited communication capabilities, changing and unforeseen environments, other agents, and li mited a priori knowledge of each other's capabilities. The Collaborative Cognition technology thrust consists of two programs: Coordination D ecision-Support Assistants (COORDINATORs), and Advanced Soldier Se nsor Information System and Technology (ASSIST). The Coordination Decision-Support Assistants (COORDINATORs) program will develop cognitive software coordination managers that provide support to fielded tactical teams. The coordination ma nagers will help fielded units adapt their mission plans in resp onse to inevitable, unanticipated changes in the mission by tracking pers onnel, resources, situational ch anges, and proposing and evalu ating options (adjustments to task timings, changes to task assignme nts and selection from pre-planned contingencies). This will ena ble fielded units to respond faster and more accurately to the dynamica lly changing battlefield situation, requiring far fewer personnel in the re- planning process. COORDINATORs is a distributed technology. A single COORDINATOR will be partnered with each tactical unit or team, and will be able to collaborate a nd coordinate with other tactical units to optimize needed mission changes. 80UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 23 of 28 A key lesson learned from Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) is the importance of accurate observationa l reporting by ground soldier s. The Advanced Soldier Sensor Information System and Technology (ASSIST) program will develop an integrated information system that exploits soldier-worn sensors to augment the soldier's ability to capture, report, and share information in the field. Communi cation of timely and accurate information is vital for enhanced situa tional understanding and overall ope rational effectiveness in urban combat and post-conflict stability operations. While a range of standardized reporting mechanisms are in use today, the confusion of the battlefield/urban operations combined with ph ysical and psychological stresses on the warfighters can make the task of reportin g very difficult. Furthermore, existing verbal and text-format reports limit the soldier's ability to capture and convey the full pic ture, particularly annotated visual information. The ASSIST program will develop an integrated system using advanced technologies for processing, digitizing and analyzing information captured and collected by so ldier-worn sensors. It will draw heavily on the experiences a nd lessons learned from previous OIF missions and other surveillance and reconnaissance missions. A baseline system will demonstrate the capture of video/still images together with voice a nnotations and location-stamping. The adva nced system will demonstrate automatic identification and extraction of key objects, events, activities and scenes from soldier-collected data. The system will creat e knowledge- based representations that will serve as an input to an array of warfighter products including augmented maps, situational anal ysis tools, and query and answer capabilities. (U) Program Plans: Coordination Decision-Support Assistants -- Develop distributed coordination technology that reasons about making changes to task timings, assignments, and selection from preplanned contingencies. -- Develop a coordination autonomy technology that learns wh ich response options are most highly valued so that the COORDINATORs generate an appropriate option when th e warfighters are occupied or cannot be interrupted. -- Develop a meta-cognition technology that reasons about resource allocation (i.e., where a given COORDINATOR should spend its processing time), so the entire system can engage in difficult processing tasks but still respond in real time. -- Create algorithms that reason about military decision-maki ng policies and procedures so COORDINATORs follow correct information exchange protocols and ensure that decisions a nd recommendations stay within the scope of authorization. 81UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Cognitive Computing Systems PE 0602304E, Project COG-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 12 Page 24 of 28 Advanced Soldier Sensor Informa tion System and Technology (ASSIST) -- Demonstrate the baseline capture and retrieval system prototype an d evaluate the effectiveness of the integrated system in MOUT (Military Operations on Urban Terrain) field exercises. -- Develop algorithms to identify objects, events, and activities in captured data and assign correct labels. -- Exploit multimodal sensor streams and contextual information. -- Create a taxonomy of objects and events, collect test data, and develop procedures and metrics for advanced technology evaluation. -- Develop a laptop-based user search and visualization interface fo r accessing logged information captured by multiple soldiers. -- Demonstrate temporal event representation and outdoor spatial representation. -- Develop key technological components that enable in-fiel d data sharing and retrieval on a handheld platform. -- Demonstrate the system's ability to improve its event and obj ect classification performance through learning; demonstrate an accelerated capability for recognizing new classes of events, objects and activities. -- Integrate advanced multimodal sensor event and object extraction techniques into advanced systems and evaluate the enhanced capabilities.

These technologies will allow the military to focus its critical manpower resources on the mission rather than on the maintenance of its information systems and network infrastructure. Resear ch in this area will create a radical new design for distributed computers, device networks, and the software to manage these systems. It will also attempt to create a \"cognitive enhanced radio\" capability, which uses cogn itive information processing to optimize communications based on current conditions, past experience and high-level user guidance. This research thrust will also explore adaptive command, control, co mmunications and computers (C4) network planning and desi gn capability that dramatically reduces life- threatening communication failures in comp lex communication networks. The Cognitive Networking thrust comprises three programs: Situation-Aware Protocols in Edge Network Te chnologies, Adaptive Cognition-Enhanced Radio Teams and Brood of Spectrum Supremacy. The Situation-Aware Protocols in Edge Network Technologies (SAPIENT) program will develop a new gene ration of cognitive protocol architectures to replace conventional protocols that fare poorly in extreme network conditions a nd do not provide adequate serv ice for key applications. Technology developed in th e SAPIENT program will have military utility wherever tactical communications are depl oyed.

Thus, ACERT platforms will focus on resource management to facilitate basic radio capabilities and accommodate the allocation of resources necessary for the indivi dual radios to be combined into a team. In additi on, since membership in a radio team str ongly affects the capabilities of the aggregate, ACERT radios will provide robust access control for the radio team's res ources. Therefore, resource management of ACERT platforms wi ll be carried out at machine speeds to overcome intermittent connectivit y, dynamic team membership, and the requirements of the indiv idual team member radios. This capability will provide more reliabl e communications for small unit ope rations in urban environments. The Brood of Spectrum Supremacy (BOSS) program will provide acti onable situational awareness to the warfighter in complex RF (R adio Frequency) environments. BOSS adds collaborative processing capabiliti es to tactical software-defin ed radios to achieve specifi c military goals, such as understanding the adversary's organization. BOSS e xploits cooperative use of computational, communication and s ensory capabilities in a software radio, in aggregate, to generate breakthrough capabilities in the warfighter knowledge of their surr oundings, with a particular focus on RF-rich urban operations. The BOSS pr ogram will initially focus on modeling and simulation, resulting in hardware- independent executable specifications of wa veforms in an interoperable format. Once the modeling and simulation is verified, t he BOSS program will develop a prototype demonstration capability for a pe rformer-selected RF platform, using and refining the hardware - independent executable specifications of th e waveforms.

Work in this area has also uncovered new approa ches to therapeutics that, rather than attacking specific pathogens, enha nce human innate immune mechanisms against broad classes of pa thogens. Not only will these approaches be more effective against known pathogens , they also promise to offer substantial protection against unknown pathogens including engineered pathogens and emerging pathogens from third-world environments. An emphasis is on the discovery and development of technologies that will allow a rapid response (within weeks) to unanticipated thr eats, whether they are naturall y encountered emerging diseases or agents from intentional attack. In this re gard, this thrust addresses the development of in vitro systems that directly mimic the human immune response and can be used for rapid development and screening of human vaccines. An additional focus is the de velopment of entirely new technologies that will allow the rapid, cost-effectiv e manufacture of complex therapeutic proteins such as monoclo nal antibodies and vaccine antigens.

Today, this standard is achieved for DNA and RNA threats using polymerase chain reaction, which is slow because of the associated temperature cycling. For proteins, the standard is met usin g Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), which requires skilled laboratory t echnicians to complete.

Design and build a prototype HISSS device. Characterize HISSS prototype in labor atory and operational environments. (U) Triangulation Identification for Genetic Evaluation of Biological Ri sk (TIGER). Most nucleic acid-based sensors search for an exact sequence match to some unique part of each pathogen. This requires a unique set of primers and probes for every target pathoge n; it also means that the sensor can only determine whether th at specific (portion of the) target pathogen is present. DARPA is developing a ne w kind of DNA- based sensor that searches out th e universal parts of the genetic code and looks for species-specific variation between these r egions. This TIGER sensor will enable a universal sensor for all pathogens and also holds the promise of detecting the presence of never-before-se en (bio-engineered) agents.

Active probing of bi oaerosols with electromagnetic (EM) energy holds the promise of extremely fast, and potentially long-range, detection and identif ication of bio agents. Only a small portion of the EM spectru m is exploited in today's trigger sensors (e.g., optically based particle sizers, sometimes enhanced with fluorescence measurements). However, a necdotal evidence suggests that other portions of the spectrum may offer substan tial improvement in trigger sensors, as well as potentially agent -specific discrimination capability. Various types of spectra in the visi ble, infrared, and additional UV wavelengths are being measured in laboratory or early prototype systems. Additional spect ral information such as UV fluorescence lifet ime and single particle mass spectroscop y is also being evaluated. DARPA is investing in this approach, beginning with cross-spectrum data collection and performance models, followed by prototype sensor development. An aerosol testbed has been developed to provide calibrated exposures of threat agent simulants. (U) Program Plans: Completed bioaerosol testbed and standardi zed data-collection protocols to allow the new sensor technologies to be challenged w ith both threat agent simulants and typical interferent s such as diesel smoke, pollen and natural fibers. Investigated spectral response of chemicals unique to BW agents (e.g., picolinic acid in anthrax spores).

The goal of th is program is to develop and employ rapid proteomic approaches for the detection and identification of bioengineered microorganisms. These organisms potentially can be designed to have the lethal e ffects of dangerous pathogens by incorporating the genetic seque nces that encode toxins into otherwise be nign, naturally occurring organisms. The general concept for this type of bioengineering is well known and used extens ively industrially to produce such products as human insulin. Cle arly such biotechnology could be subverted to produce ma terials dangerous or deadly to humans while evading conventional detection. A no vel approach to detecting such organisms would target the active, functional co mponents required to engineer the organisms. For instance speci fic types of antibiotic resistance are nearly universal pr operties of engineered organisms.

The RRaDIUS program will develop coatings containing crystals that scintillate ultravio let (UV) photons upon interaction with ioni zing radiation. RRaDIUS will also deve lop deployment and detection systems that will allow for surreptitious coating appli cation and detection of UV photons at a distance. A notional approach includes the firing of a \"paintball\" that will coat a vertical surface. Resulting UV photons emitted from the coating will be intercepted r emotely to determine the radiation level at the coated surface. RRaDIUS will leve rage coating technologies develope d in the Wide Area Radionuclide Detection (WARD) portion of the Radiation Decontamin ation (RD) Program. RRaDIUS will also de velop new technologies for the collection an d amplification of signal from small area (square centimeter range) coatings at a distance. (U) Program Plans: Evaluate RD Program/WARD-developed technologies to identify a UV scintillant that is activated via ionizing radiation and emits UV photons near the solar blind region. Incorporate the scintillant into a ballistic-delivered coating or paint; match with existing balli stic paint delivery systems. Develop a remote detection, UV camera capable of identifying and quantifying the UV scintillation photons at a distance of at l east 100 meters, and sustaining an indirect detection capabilit y of a minimum of 1 microGray (100 microrads) per hour. 93UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Biological Warfare Defense PE 0602383E UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 13 Page 8 of 16 Narrative Title FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 Immune Buildings 21.000 12.500 0.000 (U) DARPA is developing technologies for integrat ed defensive systems to be employed in military buildings to protect and respond t o the emerging threat of aerosolized Chemical, Biological and Radiological (CBR) releases. The approach is to modify and augment the infrastructure of buildings to allow them to sense and defeat an attack by bio or chem agents in real-time and to find and remove hazardous ra diation left behind by a \"dirty bomb.\" The program has three goals: to protect th e human inhabitants from the effects of the agents; to restore t he building to function quickly after the attack; and to preserve forensic eviden ce for treatment of victims, if necessary, and for attributio n. For CB releases, the DARPA focus is on the challenging problem of protection from intern al releases of agent, where active and timely control of air flow is required to prevent a building's HVAC system from spread ing the agent throughout the building. To enable such building-protection systems, DARPA is developing component technologies such as optimized filtration sy stems, advanced neutralization techniques, active building coa tings, and remediation techniques appropriate to biological, chemical, and radi ological decontamination. In addition, DARPA is investigat ing the systems- level issues of integrating and optimizing such active systems, including the integration and adaptation of sensors, as well as the simulation of threat events and emergency responses. Seve ral new chemical and biological sensors ha ve been identified for development to add ress problems that are unique to the building application. Self-assembling nano-structures for building sealants will be investigated to qui ckly and inexpensively coat building exteriors and completely seal the building, thereb y making effective the defensive strategy of sheltering in plac e.

Currently, vessels are at the mercy of ocea n waves, and when waves become sufficiently large, damage and capsizing can occur. SWASH will enable safe operations in an expanded sea state en velope. SWASH combines detailed sensing and wave prediction of the lo cal sea surface with improved understanding of vessel dynamics in a control system that provides optimum course and speed to the vessel's r udder and engines. SWASH offers the potential to reduce injurie s to crew and passengers as well as damage to vessels caused by high waves. In addition, SW ASH is an enabling technology for unmanned surfac e vessels (USVs), which will be a component of the modules for the Navy's new Littoral Combat Ships (LCS). increase the survi vability and operability of USVs in rough seas, and can provide inputs to the LC S steering system to make USV launch and recovery faster and safer. Medium manned vessels, such as LCS, DD(X), and current classes, will benef it from the more detailed knowledge of wave fields that will be developed in the SWASH program.

HEDLight remote sour ce lighting uses centralized light generation and optically trans ports the light to the point-of-use. This allows the lighting system electrical circu itry and wiring to be concentrated, protected, and removed to th e interior of the warship, thereby removing a source of vul nerability from the outer-envelope. Critical metrics that are necessary for the succe ssful implementation of HEDLight are system efficiency, weight, and control of the illumination pattern. The technical areas key to the success of the HEDLight program include the development of compact, high-efficiency, fu ll-spectrum sources; high-efficiency and integrated illuminator e ngines that effectively combine the light source, the optical coupler, and fiber- luminaire. 110UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Tactical Technology PE 0602702E, Project TT-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 15 Page 9 of 72 (U) Program Plans: Develop high efficiency full-spectrum light sources.

By imprin ting target locations on SLMs, multiple targ ets can be simultaneously designated in pa rallel with orthogonal codes consisting of spatial (amp litude) and temporal (phase) modulations. This allows for a single laser designator system to direct precision or semi-active laser guided muniti ons to a large number of incoming closely spaced threats. In addition, the program will seek to decrease degradation of accuracy or cross talk between guidance signals by assigning unique orthog onal codes to the interceptor s to prevent spoofing. (U) The high data-rate optical communications project will exploit th e characteristics of CCIT SLMs to dynamically generate orbital angular momentum (OAM) of photons. Using SLMS to change the OAM of ph otons in real-time as opposed to simply modulating the amplitude of light waves allows for significant improvement in data carrying capaci ty. Concepts will be developed for secure laser communications by parametrically down converting OAM states that provide higher or der entangled states compared to polarization entangled states.

The Helicopter Quietin g Program is developing revolutionary new rotor blade design tools that will enable the creation of novel roto r blades that can dramatically reduce the acoustic signature of a helicopter without sacrifici ng flight performance. Current rotor bl ade development is conducted on a trial and error basis, relying on an iterative cycle of analysis and model wind tunnel tests (time consuming and costly) or going straight from analysis to full- scale wind tunnel/flight test (high risk and costly). Because of the si gnificant issues of time, cost, and risk, helicopter rotor designe rs cannot explore the revolutionary potential of emerging new rotor noise-reducing techno logies in the design process. This program will leverage re cent advances in computational fluid dynamics to develop physics-based predictive design tools that will allow desi gners to develop revolutionar y rotor blade designs with vastly improved acoustic characteristics. The pred ictive tools will be tested using existing data sets and data c ollected from fully instrumented full-scale and model-scale experiments. The tools wi ll then be used to design ne w blades that yield a significant reduction in low- frequency in-plane signatures without impacti ng performance compared to a baseline design. (U) Program Plans: Develop predictive blade design tools. Conduct a study to guide the development goals fo r new blade designs based on operational models. Validate models using experimental data. Use the tools to support the design of new blades that yiel d a significant reduction in low -frequency, in-plane signature. 154UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Tactical Technology PE 0602702E, Project TT-07 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 15 Page 53 of 72 Narrative Title FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 Nano-Flapping Air Vehicles 0.000 2.300 6.956 (U) The goal of this program is to develop flapping air vehicle tec hnology that results in a bio-inspired flapping air vehicle with less than two inch wingspan and gross takeoff weight of a pproximately ten grams or less.

NEST is the key software building block needed to enab le ad-hoc or structured wireless sensor networks to function to gether. Applications of these systems include: localization of snipers by collaborative sensor fusion in real time (i.e., within two s econds), sensor network-based tripwires and chokepoints for detection and discrimination of personnel and vehicles, and wide-area, 24/7 surveil lance of long linear structures, (i.e., pipelines and borders). These applications require from tens to tens of thousands of nodes. NEST pr oduces reusable software libraries and design tools that simplify the development of wireless sensor network app lications. NEST is planned for transition to the U.S. Special Operations Command, U.S. Southern Command, and the U.S. Army. (U) In particular, this technology is being combined with an active exciter to develop a radar-like sensor system to measure human activity inside buildings. The approach exploits existing wiring networks (power) to provide persistent surveillance of buildings and b elow grade areas. The concept is to insert radar pulses into a building's main power feed and read pul se returns from a wireless network of senso rs placed around the building. The building's own wiring network serves as a tran smission line to conduct these pulses throughout a structure, and every outlet or switch serves as an antenna to couple these radar waves to and from free-space.

Narrative Title FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 Combat Zones That See (CZTS) 8.213 7.436 5.000 (U) The Combat Zones That See (CZTS) project will improve the situa tional awareness, effectiveness and force protection of U.S. mil itary forces in foreign urban environments (e.g., Baghdad). CZTS w ill provide close-in sensing and extended reconnaissance capabilit ies using a network of video sensors. The system will track vehicles over wi de urban areas using sparse arrays of video cameras and automa tically detect vehicles that may be involved in hostile activities based on th e observed tracks. This network will produce an extreme amount of data for human analysis, so advanced video understanding algorithms embedded in commercial-off-the-she lf hardware systems will monitor video f eeds automatically. Reconnaissance, intelligence, and targeting inform ation needed to provide close-in, 24/7 support for military o perations in urban terrain (MOUT) will then be generated. CZTS will enable vehicle identification with a 10,000-fold reduction in the bandwidth r equired to transmit key data across the camera networ k and will provide the capability to track vehicles non-continuously across extended distances. The CZTS goal is to demonstrate technology packag ed into a flexible ground-deployed system.

Narrative Title FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 Automated Battle Management 12.800 13.723 20.400 (U) The pace of battle will continue to increase as capable platforms and effective communication networ ks become operational. Whi le experienced commanders are required to formulate strategy and select tactics, the increased operational tempo will demand more automation of low-level decision processes, such as route-finding, weapon/target pa iring, and sensor scheduling. Some elements of these proc esses, such as collision avoidance and navigation, will be embedded in each platform. However, gr oups of platforms will be able to execute co operative tactics to achieve coordinated effects. This cross-platform coordi nation and synchronization requires new technologies that can carry out aggregate maneuvers and tasks, while leveraging the functions embedded in each platform. This program is developing novel technologies f or multi- platform, automated battle management at the tactical level, in the air, on the ground, and within mobile sensor networks. The Collaborative Networked Autonomous Vehicles (CNAV) (formerly Mission Driven Control of Autonomous Robotic Systems) program will develop autonomous control met hods to cause distributed platforms (Unmanned Undersea Vehicles - UUVs) to self-orga nize and distribute tasks through judicious transactions conveyed over a shared communications network. The CNAV Program will illus trate these capabilities through development of a capability for submerge d target Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR ) in restrictive littoral waters. CNAV will provide this capability by creating a field of dozens or hundreds of UUVs, networked th rough Low Probability of Interception/Low Pr obability of Detection (LPI/LPD) acoustic wire less communications and working collaboratively and autonomously to detect, classify, localize and track target subm arines transiting the field. The field will be self-organizing and self- healing and will have the capability to close on submerged targets.

CNAV will al so result in a significant reduction in the cost per square mil e for submerged target ISR in the littoral domain. The Organic Sensor Exploitation Network (O SEN) program will develop rapid, highly aut onomous techniques for sensor exploitation by leveraging technology from the NEST program to support autonomous sensor networks in ground warfare. The goal of OSEN is to provide network-enabling technology for pro cesses currently performed at centralized ground stations and analysis centers. The objective is to move processing closer to the sensor to reduce the need for expensive communicati ons back to a central site and provide r obustness to unexpected loss of platforms, communications disruptions, and unpredictable target behavior. OSEN is developing technology to: (1) permit on-board exploitation of sensor data from remotely deployed sensor nodes; (2) support correlation of information develop ed across different platforms; (3) detect, track, and identify targets in the field-of-view of a platform; (4) cue other sensors to acqui re a target; and (5) transition targets to other platforms as different targets m ove through sensor fields-of-view. OSEN system studies will ev aluate the relative value of different sensor mixes against low-flying airc raft, ground vehicles, dismounted infantry, and irregular force s. Sensor candidates include: electro-optical, infrared, radar, passive RF, acoustic, seismic, and magnetics which may be fixed or mount ed on mobile platforms.

The TSC E executes all tasks and mission applicatio ns optimized at the platform level, rather than the subsystem level. Autonom ous TSCE systems require middlewar e and frameworks that adapt robu stly to changes in environmental conditions. ARMS middleware coordinates the exchange of in formation predictably, scalably, dependably , and securely among shipboard entities by employing advanced Quality of Serv ice (QoS) capabilities of the underlying network and end systems.

When integrated, these technologies and models allo w combatant commanders and senior decision makers to understan d and anticipate the societal/regional indicators that precipitate instability and conflict within an area of responsibility in time intervals ranging from six months to five years, then mitigate the impact of that in stability by recommending shaping actions (military, Non Government Or ganizations (NGO), State, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), private companies) that address the causal factors of the inst ability. PCAS will help Combatant Command (COCOM) staffs identify unintended consequen ces of actions taken to influence or remediate situatio ns and assist in the assessment of secondary/tertiary effects of actions, possibly delayed weeks, months, or years in time, that could have p ositive or negative effects on U.S. goals and objectives within countries and regions. The PCAS system will be tested and validated against curren t state-of-the-art practices, such as intelligence analysis reports that provide coun sel about an area of operations using idiosyncratic mental mo dels and research from open source and classified materials. (U) Program Plans: Augment the suite of social science models with emerging comput ational social science model and theories that can be applied to assess and predict social change. Select a representative set of countries and regions in Pacific Command (PACOM) which are expected to range from stable to high ly unstable social dynamics. Obtain and organize a large corpus of data describing the sel ected countries and regions that is useful to the models. 169UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA2 Applied Research R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Tactical Technology PE 0602702E, Project TT-13 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 15 Page 68 of 72 Build tools to automatically translate the data corpus into a form usable by the suite of quantitative and computational social science models.

Today such aircraf t rely on stealth technology to avoid detec tion and engagement by long range surface to air mi ssile threats. In the future, the unique advantage enjoyed by the United States may be eroded by technological advances, and stealth y aircraft often give up thei r advantage in detectibility whe n they utilize active radar and laser sensors in the conduct of their mission. An active aircraft self-defense system could relax the design constra ints imposed by signature control, allowing a greater range of platform cap abilities. Because lasers provide \"speed-of-light\" response and a de ep magazine, we will examine their suitability relative to the more conventional miss ile based solutions. The ASP program will evaluate both pod-mou nted and fully integrated system concepts and will devel op and demonstrate missile detection, threat tracking, engagement, and defeat at a saf e range. (U) Program Plans: Perform ASP system tradeoff analysis, resulting in sy stem size, weight, power and effectiveness criteria.

The enabling technologies were survivabilit y, autonomous operations, command and control, and targeting/w eapons delivery. A highly survivable UCAR system would be able to prosecute enemy high value targets with relative impunity without p lacing a pilot in harm's way. UCAR's autonomous capabilities c ould have enabled effective teaming with manned systems and could have eliminated the requirement for a dedicated ground control station. The UCAR capabilities could have provided the Future Force with the mobili ty, responsiveness, lethality, survivability, and sustainability requi red to ensure mission success. Specific objectives of the UC AR program included: development and demonstration of an effec tive, low total ownership cost design for the system; an air and ground-based command and control architecture for UCAR operations that did not require a dedicat ed ground control station; auto nomous multi-ship cooperation and collaboration; autonomous low altitude flight; and system survivability.

(U) A space force structure that is robust against attack represen ts a stabilizing deterrent against adversary attacks on space ass ets. In addition to the ability to detect and characterize potential attacks, robus tness against attack is provided by proliferation of assets, ready access to space, the ability to neutralize man-made space envir onments, and a flexible infrastructure fo r maintaining the capabilities of on-orbit a ssets. Ready access to space allows the delivery of defensive systems and replenishm ent supplies to orbit. An infrastructure to service the missio n spacecraft allows defensive actions to be taken without limiting mission lifetime. In addition, developing sp ace access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new oppor tunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of spa ce. Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems, space-derived information and services with terres trial users. Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enab le satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situati onal awareness; enabling concepts include solar thermal propulsion, novel ion-thrust er applications, payload isolation and pointing systems.

Among these were: (1) the generation of extremely low frequency/very low frequency radio waves for submarine and other subsurface communication, and the reduction of charged particle populations in the radiation be lts to ensure safe spacecraft systems opera tions; (2) the control of electron density gradients and the refractive properties in sel ected regions of the ionosphere to create radio wave propagat ion channels; and (3) 255UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Space Programs and Technology PE 0603287E UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 30 Page 12 of 24 the generation of optical and infrared emissions in space to calib rate space sensors. To date, the facility has been developed to include a suite of optical and radio diagnostics and an advan ced, modern, high frequency transmitting array that has a radiated power of 960 kW, a bout one-third of the 3.6MW called for in the original con cept and plan. The current high frequency transmitting array has proven to be extremel y reliable and flexible, and has shown the feasibility of the overall concept. Ho wever, results to date have in dicated that the advanced appl ications-related research activities and new military system concept demonstrations envisioned under the program require that the high frequency transmitting capability at the site be increased from the present 960 kW level to the originally planned 3.6 MW level. A study completed by an Air Force/Navy Panel also pointed to additional high-val ue functions that can potentially be accomp lished with the a 3.6 MW capability, in par ticular, the exploration and refinement of scientific principles that could lead to the development and deployment of a system to provide pr otection for space- based assets from emergent asymmetric threats. DARPA established an MOA with the Air Force and Navy for this program in Novemb er 2002. The HAARP technology is transitioning to the Air Force and Navy in FY 2006.

Narrative Title FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 RAD Hard by Design 10.250 10.000 6.000 (U) This program, formerly titled Radiation Resistant Mixed Signal Elect ronics, will develop, characterize, and demonstrate microel ectronic design technologies to enable fabrication of radiation hardened electronic components using leading-edge, commercial fabricatio n facilities. The current mainstream approach for fabricating radiation-harden ed electronics depends on specialized process technologies and dedi cated foundries that serve this military market niche. While commercial semic onductor fabrication is not expl icitly radiation hardened, recent trends in deeply scaled fabrication such as very thin oxides, trench isolation, and multiple levels of metal are resulting in semiconductor devi ces that are inherently more tolerant of radiation than older ge nerations. This program will pursue development design-based technologies that couple into pure commercial fabrication technologies to atta in radiation hardened electronics equivalent to those from the dedicated foundries. The design technology developed under the Radiation Hardening by Design Progr am is planned for transition to the Air Force and to the Defe nse Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) at the end of Phase 2 which is anticipated to be completed by FY 2007. Specific design libraries for h ardened circuits will transition through the defense electronics design industry, whic h are being supported largely by DTRA and the Air Force.

The JAGUAR system is d riven by: 1) targeting information, both for sensor targets and strikes, e xpressed as point and area targets (i.e., search, combat air patro l); 2) rules of engagement and procedural constraints, such as airspace restric tions; and 3) availability of platforms, weapons, sensors, and c ommunications equipment. From this information JAGUAR produces ingress rout es, flight schedules and patrol zones, while assuring airspace an d electronic deconfliction. The technology provides pilo ts and commanders the option to choose conve ntional tactics or conceive unconventio nal operations. In the latter case, the system captures the innovation and retains the strategic maneuver for future mission plans. JAGUAR mon itors actual plan execution against expected results and alerts commanders to si gnificant differences.

Plan elements are communi cated through an integrated set of protocols from the unit commander down to dismount commanders equipped with advanced heads-up displays and helmet-worn sensors. Finally, the program continuously assesses progress against the operational pl an and alerts users to significant deviations. The Multi-spectral Adaptive Networked Tactical Imaging System (M ANTIS) program develops, integrates, and demonstrates a soldier - worn visualization system. Both helmet-mounted and handheld ve rsions will be built during Phase 3 of the program. The system consists of five elements: 1) multi-spectral sensor suite; 2) high reso lution measurement unit (IMU); 4) hi gh-speed processor; and 5) power supply. MANTIS provides the warfighter with digitally-fused imagery in real time from the multi-spectr al sensor suite, exploiting three distinct spectral bands: 1) the Visible/Ne ar Infrared (VNIR, .4 - .9 mi crons); 2) the Short Wave Infra red (SWIR, 1 - 2 microns); and 3) the Long Wave Infrared (LWIR, 8 - 12 microns). The fused imagery is shown on two displays; one has a wide field-of view and the other a narrow field-of-view. When viewed together the system furnishes a larger field-of-view image with simulta neous high resolution and stereo capability. The system also allows the warfighters to record and \"p lay back\" the video while on the battlefield. The record/playback feature includes: electronic zoom, scroll, pan and panoramic image stitching. MANTIS provides a vision-ai ded inertial navigation system (INS) and will interface with the futu re soldier's global positioning system (GPS). When combined w ith precise pose estimation from the helmet-mounted IMU, MANTIS allows battlefield information to be overlaid on the display to pro vide increased situational awareness. MANTIS in terfaces with the future soldier's advanced communications and networking systems, allowing the warfighter to send/receive video images and position in formation with fellow soldiers and commanders in real time. The coupling of the imaging system with INS/GPS will provide the individual warfighter a \"point-click-kill\" capability for real-tim e target hand-off capability to networked smart weapons fired from remote locations, thereby significantly increasing the lethality of t he individual warfighter. The MANTIS technology is planned for transition to the Army at the conclusion of Phase III anticipated to be compl eted early in FY 2008. An urban warfare environment presents the warfighter with lim ited sightlines and mobility with insufficient knowledge of the di sposition of enemy combatants, civilians, and occupied structures. As a result, the warfighter requires situational awareness informatio n, presented in a manner that accounts for current operational context and pe rsonal strengths, limitations, and preferences. The Urban Comm ander program develops planning and control tool s tailored to dismounted operations in comp lex urban environments . \"On-the-ground\" warfighters do not have time to constantly check an information rich visual display.

(U) The goal of the Polarized Rotation Modulation (PZRM) Communicati ons program is to develop new extremely high data rate, point-t o- point, and wireless communications using the PZRM communications c oncept which can be implemented at any wavelength - RF to vis ible - to exploit the presently unused polarization and rotation dimensions of radiation. The PZRM communications program will investiga te the use of polarization modulation and the ability for conventional radios to carry all inform ation over the transmitted signal amplitude, phase and frequency. Polarization modulation introduces an additional dimension. A ra dio with four polarization possibilities would transmit four t imes the information with all other aspects of the waveform held constant. Use of the antenna as part of the information processing architecture of a radio has not been previously performed. This technology will greatly increase the capability of existing channels without increase in spectrum o r modem complexity. The program will be demonstrated as an enhancement to an otherwise state of the art networking system. The Polari zation Modulation technology is planne d for transition to Service applications in FY 2008. (U) Program Plans: Secure Adaptive Waveforms -- Initiated system design effort.

The Connectionless Networking (CN) program will develop technology to allo w networks (such as UGS) to se nd and receive messages without initial link acquisition or previous sharin g of routing information. This will improve energy per bit of delivered information by as much as 100 to 1,000 times compared to conventi onal and near-term deployable communications systems such as c urrently contemplated by both commercial and military users. Conventio nal radio link and network designs expend most of the energy on l ink establishment and maintenance, as well as packet and network overh ead. This energy requirement not only limits the lifetime of energy-limited systems, it unnecessarily fills the radio spectrum; limiting ava ilable bandwidth; creates unnecessary risks of detection; and i ncreases thermal loads. These impacts are especially severe for comm unications with proliferated sensors, or remotely operated weapons. Eliminating th e requirement to maintain a continuous network link would en able these platforms to provide continuous connectivity without consumption of power , or compromising emanations. The CN program will exploit existi ng and available signal processing components, intelligent (process ing and memory intensive) routing, and availability of situational informati on to demonstrate a total energy savings of at least 100 times typ ical connection oriented network applications. The Connectionless Networking technology is planned for transition to the Army, Navy, and Air Force for unattended ground sensors and low duty cycle applications in FY 2007. (U) Program Plans: Investigated specific technology requirements fo r each of the traditional wireless networks. Determined layer specific solutions. Investigated layer integrating approaches. Modeled acquisition and media access; network and tran sport design; and aggregate energy cost savings. Predicted achievable performance improvement. Translate the technology design and simulations into actual hardware and software.

Narrative Title FY 2005 FY 2007 Next Generation (XG) 15.571 10.916 2.869 (U) The Next Generation (XG) program goals are to develop both the enabling technologies and system concepts to provide dramatic improvements in assured military communications in support of a full range of worldwide deployments through dynamic spectrum ac cess. U.S. Forces face unique spectrum access issues in each country in which they operate due to competing civilian or government users o f national spectrum. These constraints must be reflected in all force pl anning and may preclude operation of critical systems. Coalition and allied operations are even more complex to manage, and may severely limit the U.S. ability to fully exploit its superiority and investment in inf ormation technology. The XG program approach is to develop the theore tical underpinnings for dynamic access to the spectrum, the techno logies and subsystems that enable dynamic access, and the system prototyp es to demonstrate applicability to legacy and future DoD radio fr equency emitters. The approach plans to investigate methods to leverage the technology base in microelect ronics with new waveform and medium acce ss and control protocol technologies to construct an integrated system. The proposed program goals are to develop, integrate, and eva luate the technology to enable equipment to automatically select spectrum and operating modes to both minimize disruption of existing use rs, and to ensure operation of U.S. systems. The result of the XG program will be to develop and demonstrate a set of standard dynamic spectrum adaptation technologies for legacy and future emitter systems for joint service utility. The XG Communications technology is planned for transition to the Army in the Joint Tactical Radio Systems clusters in FY 2007. (U) Program Plans: Conducted CONUS and OCONUS spectrum usage analysis.

Narrative Title FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 Advanced Speech Encoding (ASE) 4.782 6.699 5.383 (U) The Advanced Speech Encoding (ASE) program will achieve an or der of magnitude reduction of voice communication bit rates in noi sy military environments over current state-o f-the-art voice encoders (VOCODER). Such a reduction will significantly decrease the probability of detection of transmitted signals and will also decrease the requi red transmit energy, thereby increasing battery lifetime. The program will pursue two novel approaches toward achieving its goal. One approach builds upon multiple noise-im mune sensors that have been combined with traditional coding algorithms to achieve significant improvements in intelligibility and quality in harsh noisy environments at 2400 bits per second (bps). This approach will be extended to nontraditional ultra-low-bit-rate coding algorithms in order to achieve 300 bps codin g capability in harsh military environments. Alternative approaches will also be expl ored, such as the communication without acoustic information a chieved by extracting laryngeal and sublingual muscle signals that are produced when a person generates sub vo cal speech. This approach w ill yield a revolutionary capability in situations where stealth is of the ut most importance, or in situations where acoustic signals canno t be used, such as under water. The Advanced Speech En coding technology is planned for tr ansition to the Army by FY 2008. (U) Program Plans: Demonstrated significant improvement of in telligibility and quality voice communications in harsh noisy environments at 2400 bp s.

This effort seeks to create a system cont rol methodology that will allow intuitive control over complex co mmunications systems while still preserving the flexibility of the emerging ad-hoc networks. In addition to creating a method for an operat or to understand the state of the network, PBNM will allow the network to implemen t the commander's intent for the operation by dynamically changing function and allocation throughout the duration of a mission.

Narrative Title FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 Network Centric Operations/Battle Command 7.452 9.054 11.584 (U) The DoD is transforming to a more network centric focus for military operations. Netw ork centricity, among other benefits, fac ilitates the sharing of situation information and access to resources. Shar ed situation awareness enables collaboration and self synchroniz ation at all operational levels thereby greatly increasi ng mission effectiveness. Military campaigns in the future will not necessarily be focused solely on major military operations. These campaigns will involve attempts at conflict avoidance, and if this fails, possibly major comb at operations with periods of various security, stability, reconstruction, transforma tion and transition operations. Future campaigns will be cha racterized by an increased demand for the commander to employ the most appropria te actions (diplomatic, information operations, military, econom ic, etc.) against the adversary's various political, military (air, land and sea; re gular or irregular), economic, social, information distributi on, infrastructure, etc. systems. Commanders in the future will use network centricity to access a larger base of knowledge sources and a greater range of resources and actions. Concurrently, the commander will be challenged to ex ploit these capabilities to achieve a mixture of appropriate effe cts. 333UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Command, Control and Communications Systems PE 0603760E, Project CCC-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 44 Page 24 of 34 (U) Until recently, the primary technological emphasis for network centric operations has been on improving command, control, communications and computing, intellig ence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems to enable better sensor-decider-shooter linkages. While appropriate, there must also be more emphasis on tec hnologies to assist commanders in: 1) understanding the complex opera tional environment, developing and managing effects-based campaigns that employ all options available to the commander, and synchroniz ing combat operations, security, stability, reconstructi on, transformation and transition operations over the entire time of the campaign; 2) enabling tactical units to self synchronize to exploit targets of opportunity by appl ying effects using any weapon or effect generator, any senso r system, from any of the services, from the U.S. or its allies, on land, air, maritime or space platforms to immediately create effects against targ ets on land, in the air or on the sea; and 3) communicating seamlessly across mobile ad hoc networks, data links, fixed and transportable networks as well as commercial systems.

Current network routing methodologies use IP address numbers that are distributed i n no defined pattern or methodology. As a result, current routing system s spend large amounts of time and computing power updating and main taining tables that 'point' to where different IP addresses are located geogra phically. The Self-forming Networks will reduce the load on rou ters as well as greatly simplify router configuration. These networks will be a paradigm shift in that numbered IP addresses will no longer ex ist, and changes to the Domain Naming Server (DNS) system will allow for services to m obile users to be incorporated. This program is planned for transition to the Services in FY 2009. (U) Program Plans: Develop machine naming schema for data packets that are geographi cally based and that allow for fine grained control of precede nce and improved quality of service capabilities. Develop tactical router replacements that work with existing co mputers/routers and require no new configuration and enable self - forming networks that will result in at least an order-of-magn itude reduction in training, conf iguration, and installation time .

Narrative Title FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 DARPA Interference Multiple Access (DIMA) Communications (formerly R3I Network) 0.000 5.080 7.458 (U) The DARPA Interference Multiple Access (DIMA) Communications progr am will develop a networked radio system that supports voice and data. The goal of this program is a network that is dynamically controllable us ing techniques such as reconfiguration, opt imum resource allocations based on mission priorities, and dynamic policies, as opposed to relatively passive reac tions to changes by the com mercial infrastructure. This program will initially develop direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) communications technologies as a bu ilding block to enable robust, mobile, tactical wireless networks, which are th e foundation for network centric warfare concepts. The fundamen tal technical challenges are scalability, covertness, robustness and platform size, weight and power requirements. The DIMA Communications p rogram will develop and demonstrate a DSSS system based on multi-user detecti on concepts that can operate in an infrastructureless (ad-hoc networked) environment. The technologies developed under this program are planned for trans ition to the Army and SOCOM in FY 2008. (U) Program Plans: Demonstrate feasibility of concept in a wireless test bed.

This technology routes each transmitted packet via a wavelength based on the destin ation node in a ring architecture. A major technical challe nge is obtaining the ability to quickly and precisely tune the laser source. This pr ogram will develop Terabit Optical Ethernet Network Interface C ards that will demonstrate the throughput, scaling and weight reduction potential of this technology. Strong in terest has been expressed by t he user community for the dissemination in real time of the large volume, high valu e metadata that the next generation of sensors will produce, w hile at the same time providing on demand access to stored information. This will enable breakthroughs in the rapid exploitation and analysis of cri tical high-bandwidth sensor data needed to support DoD operations.

Narrative Title FY 2005 FY Satcom program will develop a proof of concept system that will enable multiple users access to 100 kilobits per secon d (kbps) satcom channels using the existing C- band satellite architecture. This new capability becomes possible, in part, by mov ing away from the existing paradigm regarding usage of these satellites. This new MIMO Satcom paradigm envisions satellites as merely a node or relay for a single user. In communications terminology, the satellite is part of a single-input / single-output (SISO) channel. Instead, this pr ogram will consider the multiple satellites simultaneously. Using this approach, a mu ltitude of co-channel users send signals that illuminate a multit ude of satellites. Powerful processing algorithms then isolate the individual commun ication links. Using the cons tellation in this manner provide s signal gain and interference rejection. 341UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Command, Control and Communications Systems PE 0603760E, Project CCC-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 44 Page 32 of 34 (U) The most important advantage for military missions is the abilit y to use the existing C-band uplink infrastructure with antenna aperture areas several orders of magnitude smaller than are currently n eeded. The large size of current C-band ground station antennas is driven by the need to limit adjacent satellite interference ra ther than the need for additional link margin. Operation with drastically redu ced apertures is possible if the requirement to avoid illuminating an adjacent satellite is removed. By relaxing beam si ze requirements the ground termi nal footprint can be reduced. Other satellite constellations with reduced coverage offer greater power and, hence, more capacity. (U) The increased complexity of the MIMO Satcom communication link demands dynamic and adaptive network protocols to ensure optimal performance is achieved.

(U) Program Accomplishments/Planned Programs: Narrative 0.000 0.000 (U) The goal of the Boomerang program was to rapidly develop an d demonstrate affordable and re liable acoustic gun shot detection and localization techniques. The program focused on enhancing the sa fety of vehicle convoys and increasing situational awareness. Based on previous acoustic shot detection work, Boom erang developed system hardware design and packaging, vehicle integration concepts, user interfaces and signal processing algorithms and software for prototype systems, as well as continued refinement of algorithms, hardware an d software to improve system performance and accuracy. Acoustic sensors, mounted in an array at the top of a mast, are used to detect both s upersonic shock and sound waves from muzzle blast and then identify the location of the shooter. Users receive simultaneous visual and auditor y information about the point of fire from an LED display and speaker. Boom erang systems were tested by warfighters serving in Operation Ira qi Freedom (OIF). The systems were designed for ease of use, installation and field upgradeability. Shot data collected from a series of CONUS firing tests and from systems deployed to OIF demonstrated that Boomerang pr ovides troops the ability to detect and locate supersonic shots for both moving platforms and stationary applications, th us providing increased force protection capabilities.

Th e program will focus on delivering precision targeting accuracy to 1) enable light -weight munitions and thus deeper magazine and/or longer eng agement ranges, 2) tailor categories of kill through subsyste m targeting, and 3) provide lethal effects against targets otherwise beyond the re ach of man-portable weapons. The objective M3 capability will integrate a variety of existing weapons-systems functions and provide the dismounted soldier with a compact system to engage vehicles, rotorcraft, and close air support aircraft. The effort will also explore additional mission concepts to include anti-personnel and breaching appli cations, beyond-line-of-sight functionality, ai r-to-ground capability, and ground vehicle mou nting options. Critical characteristics of this weapon system concept include light weight, simple operation, and affordability.

Technol ogies to be explored include: aggregation of information from mu ltiple MAVs and OAVs with that from other sources into an easy-to-use interface, improved techniques for detecting dismounted targets and disti nguishing friend from foe, and improved methods for displaying information to di smounts and allowing them to dir ect operations without impeding their mission. These systems will be developed within the fra mework of both legacy forces and expected future forces.

Narrative Title FY 2005 FY 0.000 0.000 6.000 (U) The HYFORM program, an outgrowth of the Tactical Urban Operations (TURBO) program also budgeted in this project, will develop a lightweight and unobtrusive audio and visual interface with r obust high-bandwidth communications allowing the soldier not only instant access to real-time ubiquitous sensor data (imaging, night vision, satellite /UAV data, etc.), but also act as the interface to an entire tactical intelligence center consisting of both automated and hum an-in-the-loop analysis. Techniques such as dynamic information encoding, multi lay er waveforms and predictive routing that adapt across multiple layers will be developed. Thus a single soldier can have virtually unlimited real-time reach-back support while not incurring the enormous force protection and l ogistics cost. Key enabling technologies may include miniature heads-up-displays (HUDs), compact multimode communication receivers (e.g., RF, EO/I R, etc., to maintain link in urban canyon), retinal scanners, multidimensional surround sound, and voice activated computer interfaces for the em bedded soldier, as well as knowle dge aided and adaptive compu ting at the support center. HYFORM should have access to non-line-of-sight ra dar to see behind buildings and ma intain track of mobile targ ets. This non- line-of-sight capability will develop new radar and electro-optic /infrared (EO/IR) integration to track vehicles over wide urba n areas. Thus the output of the HYFORM program will be an extremely compact, light weight acousto-optic interface with a robust communication link back to the computer/command center. 351UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Land Warfare Technology PE 0603764E, Project LNW-01 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 45 Page 8 of 24 (U) Program Plans: Architecture and sensor conceptual design for multi-sensor/multi-point operation.Communication and sensor sizing to determine operational requirements.

This pr ogram will explore various phenomenologies that may permit explo sive detections. The first approach will examin e chemical approaches such as spectrometry using IR photothermal signature of the ex plosive compounds, or standoff detection using molecular tags that change physical, electronic, or optical properties upon exposure to emitted vapors. These tags provide specific molecular information on the signature chemicals, thus enhancing specificity in the cluttered envir onment. They could be deployed as dust or chaff that can be dispersed in the air or sprayed on suspect vehicles, or into larger sensor structures that could be used to integrate the concentration of vapor over tim e. Yet another approach is the developm ent of integrating, reactive collectors th at can be broadly distributed and sensed remotely. Imaging b ased approaches will be developed that coul d allow stand-off detection of weapons or explosives on individuals. Integrated silicon-based ante nna array receiver devices could produce w hole radar arrays on a single die.

This system would potentially provide a new operati onal capability for conducting buildin g raids, clearing facilities, and perhaps even masking convoy movement in the urban theatre. (U) Key technical challenges are associated with developing a system intrinsically immune from countermeasures. Initial studies ha ve shown optical analogs of secure digital communication hold great promis e for providing a \"coded\" obscurant system. The optical prope rties of obscurant can be tailored such that they develop tr ansparency at narrow, tunable wavelengths. This narrow band op tical bleaching phenome na could be realized through optical threshold sensitive switching materials ak in to some developed for laser protection goggles. The U.S. Army PM- Obscuration and Decontamination Systems will be the likely transition partner.

Narrative Title FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 Urban 3.000 (U) The Urban Counter-Mortars (UCM) program will provide persistent surveillance and tracki ng of mortar launches. With precision s ensor positional knowledge, the UCM will backtrack th e mortar to within 0.5 meters of the insurgent location within seconds of the in itial launch - enabling an automated counter-fire solution that will impact the insurgent location before they disappear while limiting collat eral damage. (U) To achieve these performance parameters, the UCM program will de velop the precision multisensor network metrology necessary for extremely small angular resolution. The distributed sensor sy stem requires precision knowledge of each sensor location within the urban coordinate system, sub-nanosecond shared system timing, extremel y-fast Mid Wave Infrared (MWIR) and Long Range Infrared (LWIR) detectors, and the tracking algorithms to enable 0.5 meters Circular Erro r Probability (CEP) geolocation within ten seconds of the mortar launch.

Spinners are being used as platforms to port and test methods for perception techniques to optimize autonomous performance. This integration of the best-of-class sensors and algorithms on a vehicle of Spinner's class represents a leap fo rward in UGV capability. Autonomous mobility is being further enhanced by the u se of terrain data for path pl anning. The program's technol ogies will transfer to the FCS UGV Integrated Product Team activities to include Syst em Development and Demonstrati on (SDD) efforts and potential e arly spirals into FCS anticipated to occur in FY 2008. (U) The Future Combat Systems MultiCell and Dismounted Command a nd Control program enables experimentation with advanced command and control information technology. MultiCell emulates the functionality of an entire tactical combined arms force. T he program incorporates both unmanned air and ground robotic platforms, hea dquarters working at the operational level, and human dismounts . MultiCell also provides commanders with recommended interface functions a nd workload allocations. MultiCell validates the understanding of the dynamics of complex warfighting organizations thus defining comm ander interface layouts, functions and displays for maximum fle xibility and effectiveness. This program recommends capability enhancements supporting technol ogy for the nomination of information sources and supports visualization of current and future operational states. Mu ltiCell enables commanders to successf ully prosecute future command and control operations with significantly reduced staff. DARPA established an MOA with the Army for this program in August 2003. The Mult iCell Command and Control technology is planned for transition to the Ar my at the conclusion of Phase II, anticipated to be completed in FY 2006. (U) The Maneuver C3 program will develop robust, assured and potentially high data rate connectivity for the Future Combat Systems (FCS) elements along with a command and control architecture to re duce the number of forward deployed Command and Control (C2) operators. The communications component will develop an integrated architectur e that provides for a seamless tr ansition from line-of-sight to non-line-of-sight communications. To enable this functionalit y, development of new secure waveforms, di rectional antennas and mobile ad hoc netw orks will be initiated. The C2 component will directly leverage the Army's investment in th e automation of the Battlefield F unctional Areas within the Army Battle Command System (ABCS). Because of the multitude of single aspect systems that feed information in ABCS, large amounts o f data are made available to the commander, thus requiring a much larger sta ff of operators and workstation analysts to complete the fusio n function of battlefield data into information for the commander to make d ecisions. Future operations involving FCS technologies and operat ional capabilities cannot be restricted by a less responsive C2 architecture and large support staffs. 358UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Land Warfare Technology PE 0603764E, Project LNW-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 45 Page 15 of 24 (U) Under the Maneuver C3 program, the Mobile Networked Multiple-Input/Multip le-Output (MIMO) (MNM) project will pursue MIMO communication systems, which have the potential to increase data rates by 10-20 times above current systems. MIMO will use mul tipath to create parallel channels in the same frequency band thereby increasing spect ral efficiency. This effort will demonstrate the MNM capa bility under where conven tional techniques are degraded. This effort will unde rtake advanced MIMO technology development and perform field demonstrations of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). This effort will culminate in the development of a wideband form-factor (Joint Tactical Radio Syst em (JTRS) cluster 1 size PC card) system. The MNM technology i s planned for transition to the Army in FY 2008. (U) Two autonomous air vehicle programs will provide reconnaissance a nd surveillance, and targeting information for small unit FCS direct and indirect fire weapons. The approach is to develop autonomous vehicles for operati on at two levels; a company level vertica l take off and landing unmanned air vehicle (VTOL UAV) progr am will develop a vehicle for carrying out airborne surveillance and targeting aga inst ground targets; and a platoon level VTOL UAV for providing small units with an organic reconnaissance and surveillance capability. Th e company level UAV will be developed under the OAV-II program and the platoon le vel UAV will be developed under the Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) pr ogram. (U) The Organic Air Vehicle - II program will develop lift augmented ducted fan vertical flight vehicles together with their associ ated flight controls, collision avoidance systems, non-line-of-sight communicati ons systems and heavy fuel engines. Once the basic flight vehicle is proven, a reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition (RSTA) payloa d, which is being developed by the Army Night Vision & Elect ronic Sensors Directorate, will be integrated to demonstrate mission capabilit y. The OAV-II program will leverage several programs in DARPA and the services including advanced communications, sensor developments, th e MAV ACTD, and UAV command and control programs. The dry s ystem weight (no fuel) of the OAV II will be no greater than 112 lbs. Th e program will transition to the Army at the end of Phase II I, which is anticipated to be in FY 2009. (U) The primary goal of the Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program is to further develop and integrate MAV technologies into militarily useful and affordab le backpackable systems suitabl e for dismounted soldier, Mari ne, and Special Forces missions. The ACTD will focus on the development of lif t augmented ducted fan MAVs to accomplish unique military missio ns, particularly the hover and stare capability in restricted environm ents. The objective of the MAV ACTD is to demonstrate a back packable, affordable, easy-to-operate, and responsive reconnaissance and surveillance system. The system will provide the small unit wit h militarily useful real-time combat information of difficult to observe and/or dist ant areas or objects. The system will also be employable in a variety of war 359UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Land Warfare Technology PE 0603764E, Project LNW-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 45 Page 16 of 24 fighting environments (for example: in complex topologies such as mountainous terrain, urban areas, and confined spaces). The initial MAV technology development program focused on the technologies and com ponents required to enable flight at small scales, including flight control, power and propulsion, navigation a nd communications. The MAV ACTD program is inte nded to get DARPA-developed small, Vertical T ake - Off and Landing (VTOL) UAVs rapidly into the hands of the users for evaluation and evolution of the technologies; to develop ta ctics, techniques and procedures; and to provide a residual operational capability to active duty forces. The FCS MAV technology is planned for transition to the Army during FY 2007. (U) The FCS LADAR Support (JIGSAW Phase III) program is developing advanced laser radar (LADAR) sensor systems and technologies for foliage penetration. Jigsaw will enable warfighters to acco mplish day/night target identification and verification in the most stressing environments at short range (<1km). Environments of interest include targets hidden by foliage and camouflage, and targets in urban settings, such as alleyways. Jigsaw technologies are designed to provid e warfighters with reliable combat identification based on a LADA R sensor that will deliver a visual picture of the target scene. The JIGSAW technology is planned for transi tion to the Army, which is antic ipated to be completed by FY 2007. (U) The Foliage Penetration (FOPEN) Reconnai ssance, Surveillance, Tracking and Engageme nt Radar (FORESTER) initiative supports the Future Combat Systems (FCS) and the U.S. Army Objective Force. The program is de veloping FOPEN Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) radar. This radar promises persis tent, long-term detection and tracking of dismounted troops and vehicles moving under foliage and in the open. The technology allows Objective For ce commanders to operate with confidence in forested areas. The FORESTER radar will also be able to detect low-flying aircraft such as helicopters and ultra-light s at ranges out to 75km. FORE STER is a UHF-band FOPEN GMTI ra dar designed to operate on rotary wing platforms such as the A-160 unmanned he licopter. For GMTI operation, the helicopter flies into the w ind to maintain near-zero ground speed. The goal is to detect dismounted troops under foliage at 30 km range under calm to low surface wind sp eeds. The program employs adaptive processing and innovative radar waveform s to overcome radio frequency in terference and electronic coun termeasures in hostile electromagnetic environments. The FORESTER technology is planned for transition to the Army at the conclusion of Ph ase III anticipated to be completed by FY 2008. (U) The goal of the AACER (Affordable Adaptive Conformal ESA Ra dar) Program is to develop a high performance radar and communication system for Class IV unmanned helicopters such as the A-160.

It will provide this information directly to the Unit of Action commander via an interleaved data link through the same antenna. The program will develop Electroni cally Scanned Array (ESA) technol ogy in a small Ka-band anten na. The combination of platform and radar characteristics will provide fo r persistent surveillance including that in urban areas, with a minimum discernable velocity of 1 mph. The technologies being develope d include: (1) affordable radar devices such as phase shifting e lements and power amplifiers/combiners which opera te at Ka band; (2) miniature receiver/exciter modules generating very broadband waveforms; (3) signal processing algorithms to support multiple functions simultaneously a nd detect and track dismounts. Use of existing signal and data processing hardware and software will allow an early flight demonstration of the entire system on an A-160 or surrogate aircraft. If succ essful, this program will provide a vastly improved intelligence and targeting capabilit y for local commanders by providing a dedicated, rapidly tas kable asset with surveillance of most of their battlespace, including areas inaccessible or obscured to larger airborne assets. DARPA negotiate d an MOA with the Army for this program in August 2005, and the AACER technology is planned for trans ition to the Program Executive Office - Inte lligence Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO-IEW&S) at the conclusion of Phase III in FY 2008. (U) The electro-magnetic (EM) Mortar program w ill design and demonstrate EM guns (coilgun and railgun) cap able of firing modified 1 20 mm mortar rounds with a velocity of 420 m/s. The second goal is to evaluate significant system \"trade space issues\" for implem entation including: 1) ammunition integration and compatibility; 2) vehicl e integration concerns; 3) system reliability metrics (barrel life, EM interference); 4) lethality change due to modification; and 5) system supportability metrics. Transition of developed capabilities will be ac complished through the Army FCS program, and is anticipated to occur in FY 2007. (U) The goal of the DP-5X program was to provide a flight-ready, tac tically transportable, vertical take-off and landing unmanned a ir vehicle (VTOL UAV) helicopter that integrated a JIGSAW sensor package a nd an EO/IR payload. The UAV was to be employable by a two pers on team and deployable in a single HMMWV. The DP-5X program was funded through FY 2005. (U) The Future Combat Systems Studies, Analysis and Experimentation Project enables the continued Joint analysis and integration of enabling future land warfare concepts and technologies into the U.S. Army Future Combat System program. It enables the rapid a nalysis of opportunistic concepts and technologies, a nd provides support for Joint Force effectiveness modeling of DARPA enabling technolo gies by the TRADOC \"Future's Center.\" The project has three initial focus ar eas: Air Assault Expeditionary Forces (AAEF), USMA Systems Eng ineering, and Directed Studies. 361UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Land Warfare Technology PE 0603764E, Project LNW-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 45 Page 18 of 24 (U) The objective of the FCS International Cooperation program is to establish and execute Science and Technology Project Agreement s with the Republic of Singapore (SN) and the United Kingdom (UK) to identify new S&T initiatives. The program is in collaboration wi th the U.S. Army. The Singapore Project Agreement will initially support projec ts to investigate tactical command and control interoperabi lity, explore the use of computer-based technology to mitig ate differences between coalition partner pl anning processes and tools; investigate an d assess the utility of various sensor packages on UAV/UGV platform s in dense jungle environments, urbanized terrain and littora l/maritime environme nts; and determine the applicability of quantum dot technology for devel oping multi-spectral optic systems. DARPA established an MOA wi th the Army for this program in April 2004. The agreement with the Un ited Kingdom will initially support projects to: survey and assess in ternational technologies applicable to the FCS program; compare and assess th e coalition effects-based operations planning technologies ava ilable from the U.S. and U.K.; and, conduct an analysis of U.S./U.K. coalition interoperability. The FCS Inte rnational Cooperation technology program is planned for transition to the Army by FY 2007. (U) The Sensor Dart program will produce and de monstrate unattended ground sensors in an aer odynamic glider capable of covert deliv ery from a stand-off of at least 45 kilometers with a 50 meters or less circular error probability (CEP). Sensor Dart will leverag e and integrate capabilities derived from prior small unmanned air vehicle demonstr ator and unattended ground sensors projects. The basis for the Sensor Dart is a platform/sensor system that transitions from winged flight to earth-penetrating dart. The integration of glider and precisio n delivered sensor will provide a well-coupled seismic and acoustic sensing capability in support of the FCS Brigade Combat Team (BCT). The planned tr ansition customer will be Unit of Action (UA) Produc t Manager Robotic and Unmanned Sensors (PM RU S) out of Fort Monmouth. Transition is scheduled to occur following program conclusion after FY 2007. (U) The WolfPack program will further develop the initial capability for close approach electronic warfare. The overall effectiven ess and efficiency of FCS will be improved by this effort through the development of an advanced, collaborative electronic warfare sens ing and attack system. This will lead to improved situational awareness of the battlespace for other FCS platforms and will improve their sur vivability in a wide range of potential conflicts. The improved WolfPack system will be able to suppress enemy air defenses, RF communication syste ms, and networks either through sensing and passing b ack targeting information to other FCS wea pon platforms for kinetic fire or by col laboratively jamming those systems and networks on its own. The WolfPack technology is planned for transition to the Army in FY 2007. 362UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Land Warfare Technology PE 0603764E, Project LNW-03 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 45 Page 19 of 24 (U) The C-130 Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) de monstration modified an existing C-130 ai rcraft in order to demonstrate improveme nts in take-off and landing distances and maximum payload capability.

Joint Warfare Systems levera ge current and emerging network, robotic, and information techno logy and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, le thality, and rapid responsiveness. Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use o f firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants. These problems are magnifi ed in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilia ns are often colocated, and in peacekeeping operations wher e combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable. Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning. Understanding opponent networks is essential so that cr eative options can be developed to counte r their strategies. Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only wh ere needed and with specific effects is required. This proj ect supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic/ope rational level by generating targ eting options against opponents ' centers of gravity that have complex networked relations hips; (2) the tactical/operational level by managing highly automated forces with tight couplin g between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developi ng platforms, which acquire targets of opportunity, cuing netw ork-based analysis of likely enemy operations and developing warfighter tools, thus maximizing the pr esence of ground forces in Stability and Supp ort Operational (SASO) environments.

CPOF transitioned to the Army Program Executive Office Command, C ontrol, and Communications Tactical (PEO C3T) in January 2006. This program created a system with radical new capabilities fo r improving decision making by operational commanders, providing dynamic tailored visualization and deep collaboration tools for improved situation awareness and course-of-action development a nd dissemination. The program has introduced a radical new concept for future command environments, namely, the elimination of th e fixed command post that will be replaced by battle command on the move. Introduction of the tools deve loped under this program will allow future command structures to be mobile and distributed, thus enabling reduction of staff sizes and allowing commanders to opera te effectively while on the move. The Multiuser, Adaptive Command Environment (MACE) program is based on advancements made under the Command Post of the Future (CPOF) program and will make collaborative tactical comm and more adaptive, cross-functional, and scalable. The program provides monitors in the collaboration environment to observe data traffic, identify patterns, a nd proactively move information through the system to more rapidly meet user's needs. MACE will monito r and adapt to user-system inter actions, user-user collaborations, a nd changes in the operational environment. MACE allows users to be distinguished by their military function - intelligence, maneu ver, fires, security, logistics - and tailors displays and communication modes to those functions. The system will also utilize profiles o f the users that contain information about career, previous deployments and in formation display preferences to make the system more adaptab le. Finally, the technology scales the environment from dozens to hundr eds of workstations operating over a diverse set of tactical communication networks. The Network-Centric Situation Assessment pr ogram develops and deploys technologies to assess military situations at levels of i nterest above individual targets. The program uses all-source data to reconstruct unit organizations , mission relationships, logistics connections, and communications connectivity and analyzes data over time to infer movement, communicat ion, and supply patterns. Within this context, capability analyses are provided and future courses of action are hypothesized. The objective is to understand potent ial capabilities and intentions of opposing forces. This effort provides greater understanding of opponents' force structures, cap abilities, and operational practices, then enables commanders to sustain effects-based targeting rather than simple attrition strategies. The program 372UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Network-Centric Warfare Technology PE 0603766E, Project NET-01 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 47 Page 5 of 26 provides a context for discovering vulnerabilities in opposing fo rces and provides cues for intellig ence, surveillance, and rec onnaissance planning, as it suggests areas of future enemy activity that mer it intense scrutiny. Technologies are planned to transition to the U.S. Army Distributed Common Ground Station. The Joint Mission Rehearsal program integrates high-fidelity; ma inframe-based combat simulations with situation assessment and planning tools. The objective is to allow rehearsal of joint mi ssions, while participants are en route to operations or remain at their home stations. The program uses current situa tion data to: (1) provide initial conditions for the simulations, and (2) plan data t o steer the dynamics of the simulations along the selected courses of action. The technology streams data from the simulations for display , then visualization systems are available to the prospective participan ts. The visualization permits the warfighter to interact with the simulation in a manner consistent with their anticip ated role in the mission being rehearsed. The program delivers the capability to prac tice and fine- tune mission plans for joint military operations and enables co mmanders and staff to participate from their current location in stead of a training facility, thereby reducing deployment needs while im proving mission planning and effectiveness. Technologies are plann ed to transition to the U.S. Army Simulation, Training & Instrumentation Command.

Narrative Title FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 Precision Urban Combat Systems (PUCS) 4.000 8.423 11.165 (U) The Precision Urban Combat Systems (PUCS) is developing and va lidating advanced sensor, explo itation, networking, and battle management capabilities for joint dismounted fo rces in urban combat. The program in cludes detection and tracking of potential enemy targets, discrimination and identification of friendl y versus enemy units, sorting of enemy from neutral and non-combatant personnel, co ordination of sensing, maneuver, and fires, and contin uous assessment of results. PUCS will utilize technologies including: smart networks o f distributed imaging and non-imaging sensors; sensors with the capability to de tect hidden human targets; improved 3D visualization systems, and multi- spectral discrimination systems that survey the battlefield for weapon activity and detect primary signatures. These capabilit ies will be developed within the framework of both legacy forces and expected future forces. The program will provide a set of prototype demonstrati ons of the capabilities in surrogate urban combat environments. Technologies ar e planned to transition to the U.S. Special Operations Comm and. The Robust, Persistent 3D Urban RSTA (rec onnaissance, surveillance and target acquisiti on) program is providing situational awa reness capabilities that will assist the warfighter in identifying and def eating enemy threats. This includes the ability to robustly detect and persistently track all-source targets in the highly cluttered, 3-dimensional urban la ndscape (outdoors and in doors). This prog ram will demonstrate an innovative active radio frequency (RF) sensor ne twork technology that uses broadband, short-pulse active RF tech nologies for low power precision radar and communications, exploits multi-st atic operation for robust 3-D ta rget detection, localization and tracking, and provides distributed sensor fusion for target characterization. 374UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Network-Centric Warfare Technology PE 0603766E, Project NET-01 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 47 Page 7 of 26 The Smart Dust Sensor Networks Applied to Urban Area Operations Program will provide persistent staring reconnaissance, surveil lance, and target acquisition (RSTA) of the three- dimensional urban battlespace using a dense ne twork of ground sensors. The system c oncept consists of ubiquitous and inconspicuous low-power, small and easily conceal ed ground sensors distributed throughout the urban landscape. The program includes the development of ultra small sensor nodes for easy deployment and concealment in a crowded u rban environment and data fusion algorithms to e xploit the abundance of new information prov ided by a dense urban spatial network. The Networked Acoustic-Visual Imaging System (NAVIS) (formerly Head Mounted Alerting for Urban Operations) program will develop a networked weapon fire detection system using infrared sensor imagery fused with acoustic senso r information for precise local ization of the source of weapon fire. The NAVIS system is a soldier-borne sensor array that moves with the dismounted unit, continually a dapting to the dynamic threat situation in urban operations. The syst em exploits all available infrare d and acoustic event data and co rrelates all observables from a multi-sensor, multi-node, networ ked array to minimize false alarms and maximize accuracy. The challenge of this initiative is to provide a moving networked sensor array, borne by dismounted warfighter s, with near real-time visualization of the fused firing event data for immediate response and accurate pointing. The Exploiting Vibrations to Monitor Activities in Buildings pr ogram will develop procedures and sensors to characterize activi ty inside structures based on acoustic/seismic information. The types of information sought include numbe r and location of personnel, fo ot traffic, operation of building mechanicals (ventilation, cooling, and hea ting; plumbing; etc.) as an indicator of human activity, operat ion of other machinery, door openings and closings, and speech. Algorithms th at infer internal layout of the building from the pattern and location of these activities will be investigated along w ith the fusing of the information from othe r surveillance information gained by ot her sensing modalities. The Solar Blind UV Tagging, Tracking & Location (TTL) program will develop technologies and methodologies required to locate a vehicle in an urban environment. A compact and covert solar-b lind Ultra Violet (UV) \"tag\" can be visually followed through non -Line- of-Sight (LOS) tracking by a UV camera. This program is critic al to tracking vehicles containing persons of interest through a difficult visual tracking urban environment. Phase one of the project i nvolves concept of operations deve lopment, modeling, and validati on. Ground-based field tests will be performed with DayCor II UV came ras to assure strength of detection and non-LOS isolation of t he tag. Following successful ground tests, the second phase involves procuremen t and integration of an airborne platform to validate co ncept of operations for aerial tracking of the source tags. The primary technical obstacles that must be overcome to develop the tracki ng 375UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Network-Centric Warfare Technology PE 0603766E, Project NET-01 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 47 Page 8 of 26 mechanism are the development of a powerful enough UV source to facilitate detection through non-LOS scattering at a safe hover ing altitude. The tag must be both small enough to be unnoticeable and big enough to support a battery supply for reasonable power life. In addition, this UV source must be detectable and distinguishable fro m other sources by the camera. The UV camera must be able t o queue the observer and allow for reliable geo-tracking of a tag through joystick controls and visual detection. This capability will be transitioned to Air Force and Army Combatant commands for use in ground-b ased and low-altitude airborne reconnaissance platforms starting in FY 2008.

Narrative Title FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 Effects Based Network Targeting 3.600 4.062 4.500 (U) The Effects Based Network Targeting program develops technolo gy to identify, determine vulnerabilities, target, and anticipate workarounds in enemy networks. These techniques use all-source info rmation to continuously update models of urban networks (e. g., transportation, energy). An aim is to elicit operational objec tives for urban interventions, expressed in terms of desired and undesired effects. The technology will use these objectives to find vu lnerabilities in the networks, then nomi nating targets for prosecution so as to maximize desired effects while minimizing undesired effects. Further, the program develops techniques for predicting those observables that wil l rapidly identify an opponent's response when several courses of action are available. The program enables warfighters to develop effects-based tar get sets at forward command nodes and provides commanders a means to anticipate and c ounter an opponent's workarounds. Finally, Effects Based Netw ork Targeting minimizes undesired effects by anticipating downstream consequences and selecting targets with low risk of collateral damage, permitting targeting operations to proceed, even within restric tive rules of engagement. Technologies are planned to transition to the U.S. Strategic Command. 377UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Network-Centric Warfare Technology PE 0603766E, Project NET-01 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 47 Page 10 of 26 (U) Program Plans: Develop tools to: (1) extract relevant information from source da ta (especially signals, text, and imagery); (2) correlate that information to existing models; (3) update the models while r esolving conflicts among sources; and (4) analyze the overall effe ct of newly discovered changes.

This effort identified techn ologies in the areas of agent-based autonomous control; vehicle navigation; high data ra te/low-power underwater communica tions; network management and optimization; sustainable energy concepts; and low power sensi ng/signal processing enabling covert persistent underwater survei llance in denied areas. (U) The Persistent Ocean Surveillance program will combine geoloca tion techniques such as the global positioning system with statio n keeping and intra-sensor communication technologies to provide l ong-term station keeping ocean environment sensing buoys. Thes e technologies, when applied with state-of-the-art undersea warfare sensors, will result in a floating field of smart sensors cap able of observing the undersea environment in an area, including the presence of submar ines and other undersea vehicles. A range of technologies wil l be considered including those that rely on the local environment (such as wind, ocean waves, solar energy, temperature differentials, etc.) f or their power, miniature geolocation technologies, and technologies for sensor data storage, transmission, and intra-field communications. Pe rsistent Ocean Surveillance-Station Keeping technology is pla nned for transition to the Navy in FY 2008. (U) The Warfighting in the Littoral effort is the vehicle for i nvestigating and developing technologies recommended by the joint DARPA/Navy Littoral Naval Force Architecture Study that explored future concepts and potential technologies for rapid access an d successful operation in contested areas defended by forces ashore, mines, s ubmarines, small craft, and anti-ship missiles. The technologi es developed will directly affect the ability of Naval Forces to accomplish missi ons in the world's littorals\u2014some may involve significant techni cal obstacles that, if overcome, would lead to dramatic improvement in capability. Potential transition targets include a broad spectrum of existing and future naval programs. DARPA established an MOA with the Marine Corps for this program in October 2004. (U) The Aluminum Combustor program seeks to develop an energy-den se air-independent underwater power source as a potential propulsi on system for underwater vehicles. This program will optimize the design for a small combustor and develop the auxiliary power sy stem components needed to control and sustain operations. In addition to the combustor, the aluminum fuel feed subsystem, aluminum-steam separ ator subsystem; and closed loop control subsystem will be d esigned, built, and tested and integrated with a turbine in order to successfully de monstrate a power system in a laboratory environment. The Aluminum Combustor t echnology is anticipated to transition to the Navy in FY 2008. 388UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Network-Centric Warfare Technology PE 0603766E, Project NET-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 47 Page 21 of 26 (U) Early entry maritime forces need maps of morphology, water dept hs, and currents in complex riveri ne/estuarine environments for mission planning and execution. This information is critical for rout e planning, sensor placement, rendezvous determination, vulnerabi lity assessments, and for determining objective assault engagement/disengagement stra tegies. For uncharted and/or denied areas, present methods are inadequate for obtaining the necessary information. Reliable remote sensing methods do not exist that produ ce bathymetry and water curren t data in waters that are sediment laden (bottom is not visible) and/or shelte red (swell and significant wind waves are not likely). The River Eye effort will provide a new capability to predict or assess, in real time, river and estuary conditions to enable special operations mission planning and execution. New techniques will be developed to indirectly determine current sp eed and direction by remotely sensing advection of scene feature s. Using advanced modeling techniques, indirectly sensed current data will be used to extract bathymetry data. Forward circulation models will u se the bathymetry data to predict future currents and water heights in a mission planning decision support tool. The River Eye effort is anticip ated to transition to the Navy and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in FY 2010. (U) The ability of U.S. Navy submarines to maintain situation awaren ess and tactical advantage in sh allow water is challenged by di fficulty to safely deploy the highest-capability acoustic sensor, the long towe d array. The Compact Aperture Ranging Passive Sonar (CARPS) effort explored the feasibility of a towed array capability in a compact hull or dome-mounted sonar aperture. CARPS sought to exploit non-acoustic shear waves induced in the material of a small aperture by exte rnal acoustic energy. The program evaluated practical beamformi ng techniques, the effect of acoustic and non-acoustic noise on performance, and the ability to resolve multiple acoustic sources. (U) Program Plans: Mobile Undersea Distributed Systems Continue investigation into novel co mmunications and networking concepts.

The implicit goal of this program is to reduce platform infrastructure and, ultimately, the cost of future design and production of submarines. The program is a collaborative effort to overcome selected technological barriers that are judged to have a significant impact on submarine platform infrastructure cost. DARPA and the Navy, under Memorandum of Agreement jointly formulated technic al objectives for critical technology demonstrations in: (1) shaftl ess propulsion, (2) external weapons stowage and launch, (3) co nformal alternatives to the existing spherical sonar array, (4) radical ship infrast ructure reduction technologies that eliminate or substantially s implify hull, mechanical and electrical systems, and, (5) automate d attack center technologies to reduce crew manning.

With the advent of net work centric warfare, the submarine's evolving tactical missions re quire both timely transmission and receipt of tactical intelligen ce and operational directives. When mission effectiveness requires the submarine to operate below periscope depth, the challenge to communicate g reatly affects the submarine's contributions to the operational commander. This program will develop an expendable communications device/system t hat would enable high bandwidth communications at tactically significant sp eeds and depths while minimizing probability of detection. It combines a propelled tow body with a hybrid, inflatable kite to hold an antenna aloft for exte nded periods. The tow body would be connect ed to the submarine by a cable tether, which supplies electrical power fo r tow body propulsion and communications signal amplification. The propelled tow body will be designed to deploy from the signal ejector of any U.S. submarine.

These models enable the evaluation of multiple sensor/targeting concepts, and drive requirements for highly sens itive, advanced sensors, which ope rate at very low frequencies in order to reach deeply buried structures. One concept under development, the CUGF Unattended Ground Sensor System (CUGSS), will demonstrate th e use of multiple, networked ground nodes of multi-phe nomenological sensors (EM, acoustic, seismic) for UGF monitoring and target charac terization. Another element, Effluents for Vent Hunting, has evaluated the feasibility of finding vents from stand-off locations by exploit ing the spatial, spectral, and temporal characteristics of the exhaust plumes. Th e Low-Altitude Airborne Sensor System (LAASS), will demonstrat e the use of airborne EM, acoustic, and gravity sensors to rapidly find UGFs a nd map out their backbone structure. Techniques are also bein g developed for finding and mapping traces and portals of sm all tunnels used for movement among large facilities or buildings, and for surrepti tiously crossing borders and security boundaries. The CBT (Cross-Border Tunnel) program is using seismic and el ectromagnetic tomographly to det ect and localize small tunnels. The RITA (Remote Interconnected Tunnel Assessment) program is using stand-off hyperspectral sensing to determine portals and vents that are connected by tunnels underground. Other potential technologies to be included are precision thermal imaging and active surface seismic and electromagnetic approaches. These are particular ly useful for small, relatively shallow, unimproved tunnel s.

By ignoring optical phase, the system can be made much less complex with lower siz e, weight, power, and cost, and with reduced sensitivity to adverse turbulence-i nduced atmospheric distortion. Technical achievements under othe r programs in this PE/Project provide the basis for radically new approaches to measuring target characteristics under conditions that limit the p erformance of conventional sensors. Target characteristics potentially obtainable include target image, shape, size, detailed structural fea tures, surface texture, reflectivity, polarization, macro and micro dynamics, and other a dvanced threat properties.

The initiative encompasses high-resolution multispectral, multipolarization, radi o frequency, and electro-optical and active optical sensors. The program significantly improves mapping, terrain characterization, ta rget detection, and situationa l awareness. The technology explores applications for both medium-and high-altitude deployment and permits fusion, automate d exploitation, and vi sualization of prod ucts from diverse classes of sensors. These sensors and processing techniqu es enable commanders to enjoy wide-area detection, characteri zation, and geolocation information along with app lication to facilities, vehicle, and dismounted targets in both tactical situation aw areness and strategic indication and warning. These tools support rapid mappi ng and terrain characterization support in near-real time for support of robotic and manned maneuver forces. Technol ogies are planned for transition to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. The National/Tactical Exploitation (NTEX) initiative develops t echnologies to locate and identify enemy air defense and missile units. NTEX uses multi-source imagery and data from both National reconnaissance systems and tactical sensor assets. Under a DARPA Memorandum of Agreement with the Nationa l Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), the project places researchers in facilities wi th access to real data and analysts. These researchers submit their sensor exploitation developments for rapid assessment by opera tional analysts using real world data. NTEX builds upon technologies developed under the DARPA Semi-Automated Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) Processor Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration. Th e program demonstrates increased capability to model, detect, a nd locate air defense targets and surface threats, including those that have been denied, m odified, or have yet to be modeled. Th e NTEX technology is planned for transition to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency at the conclusion of Phase III anticipated to be completed by FY 2006. The Video Verification and Identification (V IVID) initiative develops technology to auto mate moving target strike operations fo r remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs). Program products support both precisi on strike operations and military surveillance. VIVID enables the handoff of targets between wide area coverage Intelligence, Surveillan ce, and Reconnaissance systems and local video surveillance platf orms. The technology provides techniques for precision target identification in video including fingerprinting techniques and related tec hnology to permit reacquiring previously observed vehicles. The program al so features techniques enabling video sensors to autonomously a nd simultaneously track multiple vehicular target s through dense traffic, temporary occlusion or exit from sensor field of view, i n military surveillance and strike operations, and suppor ts target detection of moving vehicles a nd/or dismounts in very low resolutions. VIVID technologies significantly advance the capabilities of video surve illance and moving target strike for numerous military missio ns, including military operations in foreign urban areas.

The VIVID t echnology is planned for transition at the conclusion of Phase II which is anticipated to be completed by the end FY 2007. The Tactical Sensor Network Technologies (TSNT) initiative develops detection, tracking, identification, and pattern analysis c apabilities that operate in all nodes (fixed or mobile) within a networked, distributed multi-sens or system. The processing to be performe d at each network node depends on the sensors reporting to that node, the subscribing commanders, and resource management decisions. TSN T exploits locality of sensing, but will leve rage the advantages of a self-forming adaptive network for signal processing. Algor ithms are designed to be aware of the sensor network and adapt their pr ocessing algorithms based on self-discovered network topology. Th e algorithms also take into account power ma nagement constraints, communications bandwid th limitations, and constraints found in the local environment. TSNT is resilient to the failure of any node while maintaining sufficient consistency to support commanders ' collaborative tactical planning. Technologies are pla nned to be transitioned to US Army (PEO IEWD). The Exploitation of 3-D Data (E3D) initiative develops techniques fo r rapidly exploiting 3-D sensor data. Such data is prolife rating from growing numbers of advanced sensors, such as Laser Detection and Ranging (LADAR) and Laser Identification Detection and Ranging (LIDAR). Three dimensional data represents a rich resource for use in precision target identification. E3D demonstrates that the target identification performance of 3-D informati on greatly surpasses that of 2-D image-based methods. The program effort consists o f three distinct processes: (1) Target Acquisition (TA) develops methods based on search of a local 3-D volume for detecting possible t argets in scene; (2) Target Recognition (TR) investigates mathematical appr oaches to the identification of specific targets and target ty pes detected by TA; and (3) Modeling explores methods of modeling the structur e and variability into a representation exploitable by TR to i dentify targets. The resulting software tools are designed to be integr ated into operational ground stations processing 3-D sensor data . The E3D technology is planned for transition to th e SOCOM at the conclusion of Phase IV an ticipated to be completed in FY 2006. The Dynamic Tactical Targeting (DTT) initiative develops sensor c ontrol and data fusion technologies to enable warfighters to m anage a process to find, identify, track, target, and destroy mobile, tim e sensitive targets (TSTs). Current targeting technology is t oo slow to maintain target track and support prosecution of these fleeting targ ets. DTT is designing and demonstrating a system that: 1) leverages existing National/Theater Intelligence, Surveillance, and Rec onnaissance (ISR) processes for timely extraction of critical data ; 2) fuses organic sensor data with ISR data from all sources to enable mu lti-scale estimation of target location, identity, and activity; 3) dynamically tasks standoff, organic, and embedded sensors to fill ISR covera ge gaps and provide relevant sensor observation in areas of tac tical 411UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 48 Page 18 of 38 interest; and 4) processes and manages the voluminous data produced by various sensors in time to provide the warfighter inform ation required to prosecute TSTs. The DTT technology is pl anned for transition to the Air Force by FY 2007. The All-Source Target Characterization initiative develops a co llection and measurement capabilit y to characterize new targets as they emerge on the battlefield. This effort develops tools to perm it rapid user interaction with imagery, sensor data, and processi ng results and provides real-time feedback to operators indicating target key features and other discriminates. The technology provides tools to process and disseminate target signatures to the field in usable form ats for direct insertion into operational systems and enhances ope rator interfaces with extant analysis workstations to allow on-the-fl y collection of signature data with little/no intervention for t he operator. Technologies are planned for transition to the Air Force Distributed Common Ground Station. The Automatic Target Recognition Technology (ATR) initiative matur es automation of target detection and analysis for multi-view multi- sensor data. This will enable the efficient identification of ta rgets of interest, to the level of fingerprinting of those tar gets according to their unique characteristics. Th is capability will enable analysts to track vehi cular targets, even though the views are taken at relatively infrequent intervals. It will also enable analysts to make full use of both novel national and increasingly abundant tactical data sources, including EO/IR, SAR, and multispectral data. Using robust ta rget cueing and identification methods gleaned from advanced acad emic pattern recognition and object recognition theory, the project will develop recognition capabilities over large target classes within a computational form factor appropriate for insertion into a distri buted architecture of sensor platforms. This effort will devel op tools to permit rapid user interaction with imagery and processing results and provide real time feedback to operators indicating target decision confidence. The project will operate in conjunction with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and includes transi tion of capabilities to the production environment at NGA.

The combination of active, coherent, distri buted-network sensing offers unique capabilities not possible from stand- alone, single-point systems. CLENS enables reduced force protec tion and supports monitoring of borders and critical CONUS site s, and long-duration covert monitoring of target sites such as terrorist camps. CLENS has broad application in support of comprehensi ve intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissan ce for situational awareness and enables pe rsistent sensing of dismounted combatant s in forested areas and other tough environments. The CLENS technology is planned for transition to the SOCOM at the conclusion of Phase III anticipated to be completed by FY 2007. The Tactical Targeting Network Technologies (TTNT) initiative deve lops rapidly reconfigurable, a ffordable, robust, interoperabl e, and evolvable communications technologies. R esulting technologies support airborne network-centric targeting. Goals for the TTNT tactical network are: (1) reconfigurability in fractions of a second; (2 ) wideband capacity (10+Mbit/s) on demand; (3) near zero (2 mill iseconds) latency for high priority messages; (4) comple te interoperability with Link 16; and (5) cost effectiveness. This program addre sses technical issues including physical waveforms and frequency alloca tions, fast security subsystems, and distributed network mana gement. It is developing novel digital processing techniques to eliminate the need for centralized network synchronization. TTNT is pu rsuing an omni-antenna-based approach with a self-ad aptive, channel sensing, multiple user access protocol. It employs spread spectrum w aveforms optimized for rapid carrier acquisition, featuring powerful turbo code error detection and correction. This physical layer pro vides well- integrated security architecture. The network architecture is designed to exploit commercial-o ff-the-shelf technology wherever possible.

The program designs, develops, evaluates and demonstrates robust, affordable data link technologies suitable fo r use by weapons, tactical UAV's, and air control units. This includes shrinking the package size of data link capabilities from the current 1000 in3 to 10 in3, the size of a cell phone. These data links enable precision strike and efficient machine-to-machine targeting agai nst time critical and mobile targets, support combat identifica tion of targets, disseminate tactical UAV and ground sensor data, and provi de bomb impact assessment (BIA). The data links allow secur e weapon handoff from the launch platform to any of several contro l platforms in the combat area, both air and surface. The QNT units provide two modes: a low rate bi-directional mode and a high data rate mode capable of either c ontinuous or a burst imagery/vid eo transmission. Dynamic net resource management technology will scal e to support hundreds of vehicles in flight. Advanced infor mation security techniques provide secure weapon data links and contro ller handovers. QNT technology transitions via insertion into D oD's existing and emerging weapons, tactical UAV's, and tactical handhe ld units after the program is completed in FY 2008. The Federated Object-level Exploitation (FOX) initiative assembles the results of image analyzers, target recognizers, and sign al processors into a collection (federation) of situation estimate s and describes objects of interest ranging from terrain, roads, and surface type to militarily significant vehicles, buildings, and people. The estimates enable prediction of future observables, enablin g differences between the predictions and the observations to trigger change detection and analysis that updates the estimates. The estimate s are maintained, in a consistent manner at multiple sites, distinguish ed by different areas of interest, target sets, and data sourc es.

The program focus is on the Iraqi theatre, using a spiral approach designed to insert enhanced counter-i nsurgency capabilities into operational use as soon as possible, followed by im provements and enhancements as they become integrated thro ugh a domestic testbed. The efficacy and timeliness of surveillance a fforded by the program's systems-level approach will significan tly exceed that afforded by individual ISR components, and will result in substantially enhanced force pr otection for fixed sites, convoys , and military operations. The framework includes da ta exploitation at both forward-deployed and national sites to support both quic k-reaction cuing to engage insurgents, and deeper fo rensic analysis to identify their support structures. The POSSE program is jointly fu nded with the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Task Force. POSSE technologies are planned for transition to the U.S. Army Intell igence and Security Command. The Target Geolocation from a UAV (GeoLoc) program uses novel photogrammetric techniques to provide accurate geolocation of ground targets (<10 meters CEP) from small and mid-size UAVs. Th is represents an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy compared to instrumentation used on high-end UAVs. Further it requires no new hardware on-board the aircraft and does not rely upon prepared reference imagery. This photog rammetric technology will permit UAVs to not only observe targets for the first time, b ut also to direct fire from coordinate-seeking weapons. Furthermore, the technology will be extended to provide real-time geolocation on moving vehicles as well, enabling engagement of moving targets without us e of laser designators, and without any human operators in ha rms way. The thrusts and future capabilities of the GeoLock Program are: detection, precision identification, tracking, and destruction of elusive surface targets from networked manned and unmanned systems. Tec hnologies are planned for transition to the U.S. Air Force. The Wide Area Video Exploitation project w ill develop technology to enable wide fiel d-of-view visible and infrared imagery (EO/ IR) framing cameras in airborne platforms to detect and track, in real time, multiple moving objects under a wide range of conditio ns and topography. Current systems are able to collect data and provid e an ability to backtrack individual targets post-facto. The S onoma-Plus project aims to provide a real-time ability to track in forw ard time multiple potential targets from high-altitude video imager y. On-board processing will be crucial since imagery data volumes will amount to gigabytes per second. Multi-hypothesis tracking of dozens and eventually hundreds of entities will also be developed, and imagery stabilization b ased on prior digital elevation models will also facilitate tracking and track analysis.

Initiatives in th is program include the following: 420UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 48 Page 27 of 38 Standoff Precision ID in 3-D (SPI 3-D) is developing an afford able sensor package capable of high-resolution 3-D images for confirmatory target ID at long ranges (>10km). The SPI-3D sen sor overcomes obscuration and pene trates foliage, camouflage, and cloud layers via range gating. The system provides intensity, range a nd polarization for each pixel in the field of view with each l aser pulse - SPI-3D is the first laser radar with this capability. The progr am includes a series of ground and air vehicle demonstrations o f SPI-3D precision ID capabilities and track fusion techniques. The objec tives are to provide: (1) rapid acquisition; (2) polarization exploitation; (3) intensity mapping; and (4) high range resolution. Results w ill provide commanders with significantly improved identification o f enemy ground targets, both stationary and moving. The SPI-3D sensor sy stem employs existing commercial-off-the-shelf optics, focal p lane arrays and gimbals, combined with a novel Pockels cell range me asurement technique. The SPI-3D technology is planned for trans ition to the Air Force at the conclusion of Phase III, which is anticipated to be completed by FY 2008. The Synthetic Aperture Ladar for Tactical Imaging (SALTI) initia tive will develop and demonstrate an airborne synthetic advance d laser radar (ladar) imager capable of producing high-resolution three-dimensional imagery at long ranges. The SALTI approach combine s the long-range day/night access afforded by conventional synthetic ap erture radar (SAR) with the interpretability of high-resolutio n optical imagery and the exploitability of three-dime nsional (3-D) imagery, for fit and deployment within a tactical-sized package. The technical objective of the SALTI program is to provide a proof-of-concept for operation at tactically relevant high altitudes and at long ground ranges. Development and demonstration of long range performance is scheduled to be conducted through FY 2008. The SALTI technology is planned for transition to the Air Force by 2009. The Video Exploitation for Precision Identifi cation initiative explores new ways to overc ome or circumvent the limitations of a utomatic recognition of targets (ATR) and monitoring fixed sites and fac ilities by exploiting the unique opportunities provided by persi stent sensing, such as high temporal and spatial sampling rates, long-te rm observation, and perspective diversity. The project devel ops techniques specifically designed for exploita tion of persistent and ubiqui tous sensing over larger and larger areas of interest . The project includes basic research that addresses a broader and more robust view of target recognition, classification, and generalization . The thrusts and future capabilities of the PEPS Program are: detection, precisi on identification, tracking, and destruction of elusive surf ace targets. The capabilities will serve as a force multiplier for urban area ope rations. Technologies are planned for transition to the Air Force. 421UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 48 Page 28 of 38 The Firesight Aerial Sensor Mapper (FSAM) program will devel op an autonomous UAV-based sensor exploitation and decision support capability that provides dynamic situational awareness for large-scale firefights in ur ban environments. The FSAM concept will combine novel thermal and acoustic gunfire detection capabilities with a 4D (space-time) fusion approach within the framework of a prob abilistic inferencing network to reliably locate and ma p the array of urban firing events with lo w spatial uncertainty and with low rate false alarms. This includes the distribution of shooters and weapon types as we ll as the firepower movements and trends associated with the dynamically changing battlefield situation. FSAM will enhance lethality and survivability of the friendly ground forces by dra matically increasing the speed, accuracy and completeness of detecting, iden tifying, tracking and destroying the elusive enemy in complex urban terrain, including the irregular combatants. Integrated with a nd within the emerging battle command systems, intel systems and unmanned/manned networks, FSAM w ill be a force multiplier in urban area operations. FSAM will be the first system to address battalion-level urban firefight detection a nd tracking, providing field commanders with a holistic, up-to-the-minute dynamic pi cture of the movements, evolution, and emerging firepower tactics of the enem y unit in the complicated urban battlespace. Further, the real -time picture provided by FSAM will not be a collection of pixels, but interpreted, computer-understanda ble formal descriptions of th e evolving events and entities on the battlefield. As such, FSAM's output will be a critical au tomated input to battle command and intell igence systems. Technologies are planned for transition to the U.S. Army (PM RUS). The High Precision Long Range Laser Designator/Locator (HPLD) program seeks to develop an affordable laser target designator/lo cator package that allows the user to observe, track, and designate a target at operationally significant ranges. The focus of this effort is to develop new target-in-the-loop active opti cs approaches and novel high accuracy pointing methods to enable a single operator to precisely determine the GPS coordinates of a target that is multiple k ilometers away. Once precisely determined, the operator will be ab le to observe, track, and laser designate the target as required, using a single device. This device will be used by ground combat e lements and small unmanned aerial vehicles that conduct terminal attack cont rol and call for fire and will be designed to support their ful l range of deployment methods. It will also survive in a harsh environment for long periods of time with minimal maintenance. The High P recision Long Range Designator/Locator technology is planned fo r transition to the Army and SOCOM by FY 2009. The Omni-Directional Flash & Launch Detecti on, Positioning, Classification and Observation System (MEGA) program will develop a low-cost, omni-directional staring, infrared sensor, which will provide circumpheral imagery of its surroundings. The MEGA sen sor and algorithms will be used to detect weapon discharges in its field of regard, locate and classify them and, using appropriate com munication means, convey the information to other units or systems connected to it. 422UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 48 Page 29 of 38 The Advanced Optical Sensing (AOS) program will develop the next generation of airborne optical surveillance systems while also developing and demonstrating the ability to obtain very high dynamic range, high resolution hype r-spectral and polarimetric inf ormation from airborne imagers. The program will focus on bringing r ecent advances in photonic and other technologies to military airbo rne optical sensing systems. This effort will develop advanced digital signal processing to support onboard image reconstruction, atmospheric correction and system calibration. Techniques will be explored to realize a 1 meter class aperture wide-field-of-view imaging system within less than half a meter of thickness. Adaptive optics techniques, such as tho se used for atmospheric correction, will be explored to help combine sub-apertures while relieving alignment requirements. While electronic beam steering and zoom optics have been demonstrated with deformable mirrors a nd liquid crystal spatial light modulators, this program will seek to extend these techno logies and make them practical for airborne surveillance systems. The Large Area Coverage Search-wh ile-Track and Engage (LACOSTE) program enables pe rsistent tactical-grade Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) in dense urban areas. Wide-area continuous tr acking of moving vehicles requires very small coverage gaps, sm all resolution cells, and target separation and identification features. The ideal sensor has the area coverage rates of GMTI rada r and the resolution/identification capabilities of an electroptical infrare d system. The LACOSTE program will provide wide area surveil lance, simultaneous tracking, and target engagement with optical and infrared sensors fo r tactical GMTI operations. The program is de veloping a sensor with a very wide field of regard (90 \u00b0 cone angle), and a wide instantaneous fiel d-of-view (FOV) that is rapidly scanned in a search-while-track mode - tracking up to 10,000 targets in an urban area. Additionally, the LACOSTE sensor will provide precis ion tracking to enable engagement on a large number (~100) targets with in that same field of regard with a minimal penalty on the s earch- mode area coverage rate. The program is also developing a ra pid \"zoom\" capability for target identification enables feature-ai ded tracking through dense target environments plus sufficient target iden tification for separating like-targets when back-tracking a partic ular target via the historical track data. The LACOSTE technology is planned fo r transition to the Air Force at the conclusion the program ant icipated in FY 2009. The SandBlaster program will develop a passive pilot enhancement system that fuses visible, IR and millimeter wave radiation to enable multiple helicopters to land safely in conditions of severe brow n- and white-out. SandBlaster will exploit the low attenuation property of dust (fog and snow) on millimeter wave radiati on. A passive millimeter wave system w ill be developed to preclude detection and prevent interference as would be expected from multiple active systems ope rated in close proximity. Four fundamental piloting situatio nal awareness enablers will be addressed: (1) p ilot's ability to \"see\" in limited visibility conditions, (2) pilot's awareness of h elicopter drift, 423UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 48 Page 30 of 38 (3) pilot's awareness of slope of terrain, and (4) display tec hnology matched to mission and huma n factors considerations. The technology developed under this program w ill transition to USSOCOM and th e Marine Corps in FY 2008. The Super-Resolution Vision System (SRVS) initiative will develop a nd build a field prototype soldier-portable optical system t hat will demonstrate improved recognition and identif ication range over existing systems. Th e key technical innovation is exploitation of an atmospheric turbulence-generated micro-lens ing phenomena to generate better than di ffraction-limited images. SRVS will facilit ate new operational and tactical opportunities for land forces. Throu gh enhanced resolution imaging SRVS will (1) extend target reco gnition and identification to decisively longer distances; (2) overcome atmo spheric turbulence, which now limits the ability of high-resolu tion optics; and (3) increase target identification confid ence to reduce fratricide and/or collateral damage. It will develop advanced tech nologies to enable atmospheric, turbulence-induced, supe r resolution, and will culminate in a field demonstration of a prototype. Technolo gy developed under this pr ogram will transition to the Services in 2010.

Narrative Title FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 Advanced Radar Sensor Technology 32.081 21.055 19.000 (U) The Advanced Radar Sensor Technology program promises signifi cant improvements in military sensor performance in situation awareness, surveillance, reconnaissance and targeting applications . Its emphasis is on surface targets and threats. Program e fforts are focused on exploiting emergent and no vel radar sensing technology and phenom enology. Key elements are adva ncements in ultra-wide UHF/VHF, polarimetric change detection, tomographic imaging, space-time adaptive processing and other advanced signal processin g, advanced Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) techniques, and foliage, bu ilding-penetrating, and ground-pe netrating radar phenomenolog y. Program developments are integrated with current and emerging military platforms. Emphasis is on the most stressing military radar sen sor challenges. Examples are operations featuring complex cl uttered ground environments; those against small and slow moving surface targets; u rban operations, and situations where camouflage, decoys a nd countermeasures must be overcome. Initia tives in this program the followin g: 427UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 48 Page 34 of 38 The Wide Area All Terrain Change Indication and Tomography (W ATCH-IT) initiative developed real-time VHF/UHF synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic change detection and target discrimination technologies. WATCH -IT provides the commander with rapid, rob ust detection of threat systems in the open, under camouflage, and in foliage. The program featur es discrimination algorithms that examine change detections to determine if they have threat vehicle ch aracteristics. Indications of change cue on- or off-board high-re solution sensors to perform target identification. WATCH-IT is designe d to operate from platforms, such as high altitude unmanned air v ehicles (UAVs). The technology will demonstrate hi gh area-coverage rates with few false alar ms. WATCH-IT provides commanders with a critical capability that currently does not exist. The program also developed techniques to extract 3-D vehicle images from mu ltiple-pass polarimetric SAR imagery. This capability enables rejection of confusers (i.e., decoys, relocated vehicles that are not of mil itary significance), thus greatly improves target classification/identifi cation. DARPA established an MOA with the National Geospati al - Intelligence Agency for this program in September 2004. The WATC H-IT technology transitioned to the NGA at the conclusion of P hase II in 2005. The Knowledge Aided Sensor Signal Processi ng and Expert Reasoning (KASSPER) initiative radically altered the fundamental \"front - end\" signal processing architectures of advanced military sensors. It accomplished this through the real-time integration of a dynamic environmental knowledge database. Real-tim e \"environmental awareness,\" absent in conventional systems, dramatically improves c lutter and interference rejection and significantly enhances sensor produc ts. Current radio frequency sensors with adaptive signal pr ocessing estimate the background interference using sample statistical estim ation. Key technologies included advanced algorithms and hi gh- performance computing architectures capable of memory-intensive adaptive signal processing. The KASSPER technology transitione d to the Air Force during FY 2005. The Augmented Aerial Sentry (AAS) program will develop a rapidl y-deployable airborne system to provide assured protection of permanent or temporary U.S. base camps in hostile territory. AAS will include ground-based, wide area sensors in conjunction w ith air platforms to maintain continuous surveillance of the area around the camp, detecting potential intr uders or weapon launches. T he suite of airborne sensor platforms can be tasked lo cally to investigate potential threats; lock on to personnel or weapons involved in a n attack; allow commanders to confirm threats; or au thorize precision weapons to engage them. 428UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFIC ATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2006 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide BA3 Advanced Technology Development R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Sensor Technology PE 0603767E, Project SEN-02 UNCLASSIFIED R-1 Line Item No. 48 Page 35 of 38 The goal of the Bipedal Detection project is to develop technology for the detecti on of humans walking (or running) using Groun d Moving Target Indication (GMTI) radar hosted aboard a moving platform. Design criteria for the optimal radar system and operations co ncepts will be developed as part of the signal pr ocessing algorithm development. Multiple pl atforms will be required for system perfo rmance to show general bipedal motion detec tion over wide areas. Challenges include det ection of motion below the minimum discernable ve locity of the radar system, and discernment of multiple moving objects within a single beam width. Technologies are planned for transi tion to the US Army. The Generation After Next Airborne Surveillance Radar (GAN) initia tive evaluated new concepts for wide area coverage airborne g round surveillance radar technology by exploiting wide-beam staring system s rather than narrow-beam scanning systems. The approach s tudied challenges associated with low revisit rates, limited concurrenc y of modes, low power efficiency, low resolution, and sensor ma nagement. The Tethered Ultra-Long baseline Sparse Aperture (TULSA) initiativ e studied developing new means of exploiting single-ship airb orne long-baseline sparse apertures. The initiativ deploying, calibrating, powering, feeding and proce ssing received signals from active end bodies deployed on long, towed teth ers, and signal processing to support use of single-aircraf t, towed long-baseline sparse arrays for: (1) emitter geolocation and (2 ) applications, such as GMTI m ulti- lateration. The Networked Detection and Ranging (NetDAR) initiative is addressing an impending bandwi dth crisis in radar. Commercial press ures on bandwidth usage will make it difficult for military radar systems to operate in peace time without interfering with or being interfered by other transmission sources. This initiative will explore technologies to turn this bandwidth crisis into an asset. By using s ignals of opportunity across the spectrum, systems will be developed that can passively exploit a multi-static and only transmit to augme nt the RF propagation environment. Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) radar c oncepts will be developed that coherently integrate multiple s ignals to efficiently use the entire RF spectrum. This now makes all RF sources assets instead of interference sources. This will in clude adaptive waveform diversity and extending MIMO radar into airborne sources as a revolutionary approach to conventi onal multi-static rada r. This program has evolved into the Visibuilding program in PE 0603767E, Project SEN-01.

(U) The Guidance Technology project will increase the ability of Global Positioning System (GPS) users to operate effectively in th e presence of enemy jamming; to increase the versatility of navigation systems applications by de veloping microelectromechanical sensor in ertial navigation system technologies; and to apply the geolocation technologies /techniques to precision threat geolocation of short-dwell emitte rs or passive air defense systems. Fire-and-forget standoff weapons need precise targeting information if critical fixed and mobile targets are to be eliminated effectively with minimal collateral damage and minimum cost-pe r-kill. This requires that: (1) military surveillance and targe ting systems geolocate targets accurately in the same coordinate system in wh ich the weapon system navigates; (2) the surveillance, targetin g and weapon systems have precision navigation and guidance systems on-board; and (3) navigation and target location systems robustly operat e day/night and in adverse weather. In addition, future systems designed to accomplish precision strike missions must be significantly more af fordable. The achievement of these characteristics in an inte grated system is the goal of this project.

AONS will employ electro-optic system strengths in image registr ation and precision range to track and map a soldier' s position continuously. Using image-flow methods, a compact, power-efficient camer a and laser radar system will track the imagery from frame-to-frame and back out camera pose and position information to provide the soldier a ve ry precise estimate of current position as well as a continuously upgraded ma p of the building or underground facility (UGF) being travers ed. This same system will make real-time estimates of range and relative pos ition of objects in the scene, and will provide real-time positio n estimates outside under GPS-denied conditions in urban, mount ainous and even foliated areas given access to a high-resolution terrain map of the area. This system would match small-scale features, such as shrubs, trees and sma ll buildings, to features in the map and provide real-time estim ates of the soldiers location within that map.
