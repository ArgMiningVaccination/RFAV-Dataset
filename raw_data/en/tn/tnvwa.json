This provision is Section 427 of GEPA, enacted as part of the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (Public Law (P.L.) 103-382). To Whom Does This Provision Apply? Section 427 of GEPA affects applicants for new grant awards under this program. ALL APPLICANTS FOR NEW AWARDS MUST INCLUDE INFORMATION IN THEIR APPLICATIONS TO ADDRESS THIS NEW PROVISION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE FUNDING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. (If this program is a State-formula grant program, a State needs to provide this description only for projects or activities that it carries out with funds reserved for State-level uses. In addition, local school districts or other eligible applicants that apply to the State for funding need to provide this description in their applications to the State for funding. The State would be responsible for ensuring that the school district or other local entity has submitted a sufficient section 427 statement as described below.) What Does This Provision Require? Section 427 requires each applicant for funds (other than an individual person) to include in its application a description of the steps the applicant proposes to take to ensure equitable access to, and participation in, its Federally-assisted program for students, teachers, and other program beneficiaries with special needs. This provision allows applicants discretion in developing the required description. The statute highlights six types of barriers that can impede equitable access or participation: gender, race, national origin, color, disability, or age. Based on local circumstances, you should determine whether these or other barriers may prevent your students, teachers, etc. from such access or participation in, the Federally-funded project or activity. The description in your application of steps to be taken to overcome these barriers need not be lengthy; you may provide a clear and succinct description of how you plan to address those barriers that are applicable to your circumstances. In addition, the information may be provided in a single narrative, or, if appropriate, maybe discussed in connection with related topics in the application. Section 427 is not intended to duplicate the requirements of civil rights statutes, but rather to ensure that, in designing their projects, applicants for Federal funds address equity concerns that may affect the ability of certain potential beneficiaries to fully participate in the project and to achieve to high standards. Consistent with program requirements and its approved application, an applicant may use the Federal funds awarded to it to eliminate barriers it identifies. What are Examples of How an Applicant Might Satisfy the Requirement of This Provision? The following examples may help illustrate how an applicant may comply with Section 427. (1) An applicant that proposes to carry out an adult literacy project serving, among others, adults with limited English proficiency, might describe in its application how it intends to distribute a brochure about the proposed project to such potential participants in their native language. (2) An applicant that proposes to develop instructional materials for classroom use might describe how it will make the materials available on audio tape or in braille for students who are blind. (3) An applicant that proposes to carry out a model science program for secondary students and is concerned that girls may be less likely than boys to enroll in the course, might indicate how it intends to conduct \"outreach\" efforts to girls, to encourage their enrollment. We recognize that many applicants may already be implementing effective steps to ensure equity of access and participation in their grant programs, and we appreciate your cooperation in responding to the requirements of this provision.

This region of California is extremely rural with high levels of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) including povert y, homelessness, substance abuse, and neglect. The arts are integrated with core content and social -emotional learning in a whole -school reform approach. Our organization has been developing arts integration and creative education work over the past seven years with funding from three previous USDoE grants. This project builds upon our knowledge base of creative education and arts integration strategies with the addition of social - emotional learning and whole -school reform. Applicable priorities This proposal addresses the 2021 concerns of the Center for Disease Control regarding student/family wellbeing as we move out of COVID -19 restrictions. By training every adult in the child's life, including the clerical, administrative, certificated workers at t he school, and parents, the children have a consistent experience throughout many formative years. The adults are trained to understand that social -emotional learning is a lifelong pursuit and that everyone contributes to the emotional health of the learn ing community. The ARTSEL approach uses high -quality creative education and arts integration strategies to boost student engagement, creativity, higher -order thinking, and social -emotional learning . Participating t eachers are trained in concepts of best teaching pract ices, higher -order thinking and research from Harvard Graduate School of Education to increase student academic PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e11 achievement and engagement. Proposed project outcomes Teachers are effectively prepared to implement arts content and arts integration strategi es Teachers improve teaching and learning in their classrooms, supported through in -class coaching Teachers increase students' higher -order thinking and deeper understanding of concepts Social-emotional practices develop healthy identities, develop emotio nal regulation, aid in increasing agency and motivation to achieve personal and collective goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain supportive relationships, and develop a cognitive skillset to make responsible and caring decisions. Sustained increased student engagement and attendance. Sustained improved student behavior & attitudes about school. Students demonstrate higher levels of engagement, resilience, attendance.

As schools navigate uncharted territory in acclimating students to re- engage with in -person classroom teaching as pandemic restrictions are lifted, teachers are tasked with developing and implementing innovative methods to address social -emotional learning and creative problem solving while promoting academic achievement. In a 2021 study reported by the Centers for Disease Control, risks to mental health and well-being for students and parents have been reported as possible effects of stressors caused by COVID -19-associated schooling changes 1. This proposal addresses the immediate concerns of the CDC regarding student/family wellbeing while building upon the arts integration and creative education work our organization has been developing over the past seven years with funding from three previous USDoE grants. ARTSEL Project Goals Program Goal 1a: All participants (teachers, administrators, staff) will complete 75% or more of the professional development hours offered (186 hours for teachers, 52 hours for staff, 52 hours for administrators over a period of 4.5 years) in order to enable sustainable delivery, with integrity, of ARTSEL curriculum. 1b: At least 80% of participants will report increased equippedness, confidence, and interest in facilitating higher -order thinking and social- emotional learning strategies immediately after each training. Measurable Objective: The measurable objective will measure the frequency and quality of engagement in training sessions and coaching cycles for teachers, which we have found to be predictive of implementation. Measure 1a: Attendance at ARTSEL trainings as measured by attendance records Measure 1b: Record of coaching cycles for teachers Measure 1c: Likert-scale ratings of equippedness before and after each training.

Measure 6a: Annual number of presentations delivered Measure 6b : Annual number of unique visitors to the site (A2) The extent to which the design of the proposed project is appropriate to, and will successfully address, the needs of the target population or other identified needs. Humboldt County student demographics indicate a unique student population requiring targeted support. In a 4,000 square mile area, 31 school districts serve 18,000 students in grades PK - 12. Of these 31 districts, 17 districts qualify as Rural with a special designation as Frontier which indicates a population density of fewer than 11 persons per square mile. The three demographic categories demonstrating the greatest need reveal multiple schools with up to 37% of students living with disabilities, up to 20% of homeless students, and up to 11% of students in the foster care system. The rural nature of a large percentage of the county renders school campuses as community hubs, where the community gathers for town hall meetings, theater practice, martial arts training, and town social gatherings. The challenges faced by these student populations have been intensified over the course of the pandemic, requiring a nimble, sustained, and innovative approach to addressing social- emotional needs, cognitive flexibility, creativity, and student engagement. To address these unique student needs, teachers require professional development to better understand these under-resourced student groups in a largely rural environment, while implementing tailored evidence -based arts strategies in their classrooms. This critical need is underscored by re search showing that marginalized and underrepresented populations have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.2 Schools have traditionally been places of passive absorption of information for students, offering neither agency nor ownership in lea rning. Critical thinking, collaboration, creativity, communication, and character have often given way to compliance and rote learning3. Teachers 2Kantamneni, N. (2020).

Specifically, in a series of studies documenting the i mpact of arts integration on marginalized and under-resourced student populations, Chand O'Neal, Tadik, Shilling, & Beale6 found that in high trauma middle and high school environments, arts education significantly increased student engagement by four percent in as little as 22 hours of arts instruction. In a second study examining the impact of arts education on student engagement and creativity in high trauma elementary schools with high percentages of unduplicated students, Chand O'Neal, Tadik, Escobedo, & Shelton 7 found that four years of sustained arts integration served as a tipping point that significantly increased student engagement and creative problem- solving skills for unduplicated students at the elementary school level. In addition, the study design included a teacher assessment of student engagement which correlated strongly with student self -reports. Each study provided evidence that both arts education and arts integration significantly increase student engagement in elementary, middle, and high schools; while also highlighting the variability of time required to see long -term effects due to varying levels of trauma. During the spring of 2018, Create Humboldt, through a PDAE grant, conducted classroom observations during arts and non- arts lessons.

This finding inspired a teaching strategy that is being integrated into the proposed work: incorporating specific teaching strategies used in arts classes, including Artful Thinking and Visual Thinking Strategies, into non- arts teaching pedagogy to reach the goal of increasing student engagement. The arts provide students with multiple ways to learn, offering opportunities to demonstrate their learning through multiple domains, inclu ding those that are non- linguistic. This is of particular importance to English learners, special education students, and students suffering from trauma resulting from living in homeless conditions and in foster care environments. As Robert Marzano writes, \"When used well, [non- linguistic representations] can have a positive effect on student achievement and provide diversity in the way that students process new information.\" 8 He goes on to state that these strategies \"require students to generate a representation of new information that does not rely on language.\" 9 The arts may incentivize student attendance.10 11 12 Project schools have high student chronic absenteeism rates (missing 10% or more school days). The national evaluation of the Youth ARTS Development Project found arts education \"has a measurable impact on youth at risk in deterring delinquency and truancy problems while also increasing overall academic performance.\" 13 The National Education Association recommends using arts to entice inter est in school.14 Moreover, the arts provide social-emotional benefits; for example, they provide a nonverbal pathway for communication when stress, trauma, ability, language, or culture interfere with speech. 15 In unduplicated student populations, arts education and arts integration have been 8http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational -leadership/may10/vol67/num08/Representing -Knowledge - Nonlinguistically.aspx 9Marzano, Robert, The Art and Science of Teaching / Representing Knowledge Non Linguistically , Education Leadership, Volume 67,| Number 8, May 2010 10Barry, N.

For the many at-risk students in Humboldt County, these heightened states are amplified. As schools begin to move to in-person learning formats, students will need to reconnect with their friends, their teachers, and their school culture. In addition, te achers have been detrimentally impacted by the pandemic and have experienced high levels of burnout juggling home and school responsibilities, while being nimble in addressing the needs of their students during the pandemic. Targeted arts professional development has been instrumental in providing social-emotional and curricular support to enhance teaching practice and rebuild school culture 18. Research demonstrates the arts not only reduce negative emotions but are uniquely capable of enhancing positive emotions, which is important in the development of resilience, a skill set of critical importance to students in the target schools. 19 20 Perhaps most importantly, the arts offer a powerful means of building connection, which is essential in countering the disconnection faced by students as a result of trauma, loneliness, intolerance, and - now - social isolation 21. Engagement in the arts is associated with positive social-emotional behavior and school 16 Chand O'Neal, I., Tadik, H., Escobedo, F. & Shelton, L. (in press).

The means of delivery will be through sustained and intensive professional development for all teachers, staff, and principals, in addition to cycles of in- class coaching for teacher participants on the integration of standards-based arts instruction and social- emotional learning across the curriculum. This integration ultimately aims to improve student creativity, social- emotional learning, well -being, and improved student outcomes. 22 Chand O'Neal, I. & Tadik, H. (2019).

Humboldt County schools average 58.3% of students qualifying for free and reduced-price meals; 3 0 out of 31 school districts have more than 30% of students on free and reduced-price meals, with some schools at 100%. Prior to the pandemic, Humboldt County had California's highest ACEs (Adverse Childhood Experiences -violence, abuse, neglect, substance use, and household dysfunction) rate, with 30.8% of adults in the county reporting four or more ACEs versus 16.3% statewide 28 and 12.5% nationally29. A person with four or more ACEs is 5.13 times as likely to suffer from depression, 2.93 times as likely to smoke, 12.2 times more likely to attempt suicide, 10.3 times as likely to use injection drugs, and 7.4 times as likely to be an alcoholic 30. A 2013 study by the Area Health Education Center of Washington State University found that students with three or m ore ACEs are three times as likely to experience academic failure, six times as likely to exhibit behavior problems, and five times as likely to show poor attendance. 31 The pandemic has amplified a climate of student disengagement in learning. Integrating the arts across the curriculum provides us with an opportunity to improve higher-order thinking, cognitive flexibility, social- emotional learning, tolerance, and empathy \u2014 improving overall student success at a critical moment in student cognitive developmen t.

The proposed work is designed to scale up and be replicated in additional schools as resources allow. Three schools are currently included due to the staffing and financial resources required to implement extensive whole-school reform in these frontier and rural schools. The Implementation Team is poised for dissemination and networking with extensive contacts at the California Department of Education (CDE), California Arts Council (CAC), California Alliance for Arts Education (CAAE), CREATE CA, and CCSESA to replicate this model as additional resources become available. All project resources align with the National Core Arts Standards and are relevant to teachers nationwide. Dissemination statewide and nationally: ARTSEL will accomplish statewide and natio nal dissemination in four ways: (1) presentations at national and regional conferences and workshops like the California Art Education Conference and National Art Educators Association, American Education Research Association, (2) making project materials available online, (3) through the California County Superintendents Educational Services Association (CCSESA) and via the CREATE CA coalition lead by the California Superintendent of Instruction, and (4) through the Eat+Sleep+Create Blog Series by MUSE Research sharing real -world applications of creativity research to help navigate the pandemic, as well as study findings that underscore the application of creativity research in school environments. In California, dissemination of K- 12 best practices is con ducted by the county offices (COEs), and the California County Superintendents Educational Services Association (CCSESA) who all work closely with the California Department of Education (CDE) Curriculum and Instruction Sub Committee (CISC) in Visual and Pe rforming Arts. Create/CA is California's advocacy network for arts integration and arts education and is merging with the CA Alliance for Arts Education. These merged organizations advocate for high- quality arts education for all students by providing policy expertise and by mobilizing a statewide network of advocates and allied partners. The partners have long -established relationships and leadership roles in these PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e23 ARTSEL - 10 organizations. These relationships make the program particularly well suited to disseminate program findings and materials statewide. Additionally, HCOE is a co -lead in the CCSESA Rural Arts Network (CRAN) which presents monthly to a collaborative of rural arts leaders in California. Letters of support from our partners can be found in the attachments. Conferences : Coaches and coordinators will participate in state & national conferences. All participants will be encouraged to apply to present at conferences. Websites: ARTSEL will share all project resources and materials through the website artsintegration.net which has over 25,000 unique visitors and 75,000 page-views annually. The site includes art education resources, grade K -8 lesson plans, creative education concepts, videos, posters, and present ations. We hear from teachers across the country and around the world using the resources we've created. Teachers comment on how useful the site is; they can implement the concepts and lessons in their classrooms right away. We also have approximately 75 teacher gallery pages where teachers who have been tr ained with us are showcasing their students' work. An evaluation that supports dissemination: As will be described in the final section, the program evaluation aligns with established practices and strategies the evaluation team has used successfully in n umerous US Dept. of Education grants. The evaluation includes a formative and summative evaluation designed to evaluate each phase of work to assess the effectiveness of implementation, ensure benchmarks are met in accordance with the project timeline, and assess the impact at weekly, monthly, and annual intervals. Assessing both process and outcomes provides the opportunity to systematically create a model that is tested and adjusted through consistent feedback from multiple stakeholders. The resulting implementation and assessment model can then be replicated in other schools while adjusting for unique student populations. This adherence to best practices and successful experience make it suitable for replication or testing in other settings. (A4) The extent to which the proposed project represents an exceptional approach for meeting statutory purposes and requirements. The exceptional approach put forth by the Humboldt County Office of Education is built on PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e24 ARTSEL - 11 its successful track record of three USDoE-funded projects that built system- wide programming to support teachers and students in the area of arts education, arts integration, and creative education. This new project builds on this previous work, incorporating lessons learned to strengthen th e integration of these concepts with the addition of both social- emotional learning (SEL) and higher-order thinking using a whole-school approach to address the critical need created by the coronavirus pandemic. Arts integration with core content has been a steadily developing concept over the past decades, but integrating arts into social-emotional learning and higher-order thinking strategies through whole-school reform has not been reported in the literature. The combination of arts integration and SEL; however, is a nascent area of research that has demonstrated promising findings in certain under-resourced populations including immigrant student populations and high trauma, unduplicated student populations 32. Thus, incorporating evidence from these early studies with whole-school reform, the proposal is unique in addressing a gap in the field by examining the impact of ARTSEL strategies on students, teachers, and parents from demographic categories with high percentages of students who are homeless, in foster care, and/or living with special needs. Based on our work over the past seven years in arts integration and creative education professional development, we are uniquely poised to build upon this institutional knowledge with the addition of a whole- school SEL approach. The trainings we have provided through the last three Arts in Education grants have been highly rated, averaging 9.3 out of 10 by participants. However, the long-term impact on school climate and priorities has sometimes been minimal due to the reduced numbers of teachers who receive training and participate from each school. If, however, the majority of teachers at the school are trained and regularly implement the arts integration/SEL strategies, then the school culture shifts dramatically. In our experie nce, we have seen teachers change the way staff meetings are run and how decisions are made at a school because of the training they have received from us when a critical mass of the staff has received training. Imagine the impact a 32 Chand O'Neal, I., et al., (2015). The Art of Character: How the Arts Improve Grit, Social Emotional Learning, and Creativity.

Im agine the impact this can have on children when all the adults in their lives have a consistent vision and message about social -emotional learning and arts integration as part of a creative educational experience. We see the potential to revitalize the sch ool and its community for years to come. (A5) Extent project demonstrates a rationale (as defined in 34 CFR 77.1(c)). Note: The applicant should include, as an attachment, the logic model used to address selection criterion (a)(5). The following critical review serves as rationale to support the arts approach used in the proposed work, and provides an overview of the evidence used to build the argument for the arts from the two perspectives: studies that identify transfer of knowledge and skills as the pr imary cognitive benefit of the arts, and studies that instead emphasize the role of the arts in helping students develop valuable dispositions, habits, or skills. The analysis begins with examples of evidence that musical activity can be used to predict tr ansfer of knowledge and skills from one domain to another, also known as cognitive transfer. Next, key groups of studies are examined based on the benefits claimed, the form of participation, and the type of analysis used, followed by a summary of the stre ngths and weaknesses of the evidence. The critical analysis provides the foundation and motivation for the direction of the evaluation approach for the proposed project. In the framework of cognitive transfer, studies have focused on the effects of musical activity and its potential non-musical benefits. Moreno and Bidelman 33 argued that musical training serves as an exemplary context to understand the capacity of auditory and non-auditory brain plasticity for the following reasons: First, in addition to auditory demands, music production contains both visual and motor components. Second, and more specifically, the impact of music training on the brain can be extremely quick, with positive effects resulting from only a few minutes of training. 34 Third, becaus e of its complexity, music recruits a rich array of brain 33 Moreno, S. & Bidelman, G. M. (2014), Examining neural plasticity and cognitive benefit through the unique lens of musical training.

On practice: how the brain connects piano keys and piano PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e26 ARTSEL - 13 networks including, among other things, auditory, visual, motor, and memory- related processes.35 These results are likely to occur from the natural engagement of multiple modalities of cognitive functioning and the interplay between perception and production during musical practice and rehearsal that build resilience and added social -emotional benefit. In a more recent investigation examining the relation between music training and higher- level readin g abilities such as reading comprehension, Corrigall and Trainor36 examined 6 - to 9-year-olds (n = 46; 35 girls, 11 boys) (all with some music lessons). Their results revealed that length of music training correlated significantly with age ( r = .52, p < .01 ), tonal perception ( r = .45, p < .01), reading comprehension ( r = .34, p < .05), and the age at which musical training began ( r = -.65, p < .01). In addition, a regression analysis revealed an association between length of music training and reading compr ehension that approached significance, suggesting that after controlling for age, the longer a child took music lessons, the more they could understand what they were reading. Empirical evidence on the effect of the arts on the development of attitudes and behaviors that promote school performance and address social- emotional learning include s studies documenting motivation to do well in school, engagement, self- discipline, self -efficacy, and even specific behaviors such as diminished school dropout rates or school attendance. In a study examining non-school youth organizations in low-income neighborhoods, Heath, Soep and Roach 37 found students involved in the arts for at least nine hours a week were four times more likely to reach high academic achievement and three times more likely to have high attendance compared to students who were not involved in the arts. Similarly, McClaughlin 38 conducted a longitudinal study on youth in low income neighborhoods and found that those who participated in the arts were more likely to be high academic achievers, or be elected to class office. sounds.

PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e27 ARTSEL - 14 In the context of the theater arts, a study was designed to examine the effects of high versus low theater involvement on reading level, self -concept, and empathy. Findings indicated by 12th grade, students with high involvement in theater achieved a 20 % higher reading level, had a higher self -concept which approached significance ( p < .058), and exhibited significantly higher levels of tolerance ( p < .05) than their matched counterparts with low theater involvement39. These results highlight a clustering of specific findings that point to significant changes in student achievement and SEL outcomes that can perhaps be attributed in part to arts participation, which included taking part in such activities as dance, drama, and music events. It is important to note that to date, many researchers categorize participation in the arts as a broad \"youth participation\" construct, rather than by participation in individual art forms. These studies provide a theoretical foundation and clear rationale in support of established cognitive and dispositional mechanisms that are effective in linking arts participation and arts learning to stu dent outcomes in non-arts domains, and social-emotional learning. Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) is a California framework that provides rationale for the proposed work from an application framework perspective designed to help educators provide academic and behavioral strategies for students with various needs. Instead of the \"waiting for failure\" assessment model, MTSS takes a proactive approach consistent with human flourishing literature which replicates growth points; rather than working from a deficit model to identify students with academic or behavioral needs. Early assessment and intervention for these students can help them catch up with their peers sooner. The key components of MTSS include: Universal screening of all students early in the school year Tiers of interventions that can be amplified in response to levels of need Ongoing data collection and continual assessment Schoolwide approach to expectations and supports Parent involvement The integrated instruction model of MTSS uses collected data to assess student needs and provide them with interventions in appropriate tiers. Tier 1 is universal strategies for all students. Tier 2 is small group intervention and Tier 3 is individual student interventions. 39 Catterall, J. , Chapleau, R., & Iwanaga, J. (1999).

This meets the invitation priority to include a licensed arts therapist to improve cognitive and sensory-motor functions, foster self- esteem and self -awareness, cu lti- vate emotional resilience, promote insight, enhance social skills, or reduce conflicts and distress. According to Social Cognitive Theory, integration of mental health practices with the arts would bolster individual self-efficacy and positive outcome expectations through enactive attainment, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and reduction of physiological arousal. 40 Furthermore, collective efficacy may grow through a shared sense of purpose.22 In support of this notion, Paulo Freire's Empowerment Education Theory of Dialogue and Praxis asserts that the development of empathy through common experience enables more meaningful reflection and dialogue, which in turn sets the stage for action, or empowerment 41 Finally, the Elaboration Likelihood Model posits that experiential learning through such mediums as images, stories, and songs will lead to greater recall due to their greater salience because they evoke emotions. 42 43 The combination of the theoretical and applied rationale offers a solid foundation on which the professional development services will be built and assessed.

Numbers of hours, quality and intensity based on research results Based on research findings from our previous USDoE- funded initiatives, we will deliver at least 290 hours of professional development and coaching: 186 hours for teachers, 52 hours for staff, 52 hours for administrators over a period of 4.5 years. The quality, intensity, and duration are proposed based on lessons learned and data-driven evidence from the North Coast Arts Integration Project (NCAIP) (a 2014 Arts in Education Model Development and Dissemination grant), Create Humboldt (a 2017 Professional Development for Arts Educators Project), and Arts & Creativity Initiative (a 2018 Assistance for Arts Education Development and Dissemination grant) which have collectively served over 230 teachers directly and thousands of teachers indirectly. The proposed proje ct, Art+SEL Creativity Initiative (ARTSEL) will work intensely over five years with a cohort of 100 teachers, administrators, and support personnel at three high- needs elementary schools in Humboldt county. The distinct difference between the ARTSEL Creativity Initiative and previous Humboldt projects is the commitment from each of three schools to engage in a whole-school approach where all adults who work at the school will be included in arts integration and SEL training sessions. This deliberate effort is expected to have a profound impact on school culture, with a marked departure from efforts to impact school culture where only a few teachers are supported to engage in arts integration and SEL training sessions. The approach is based on the understandi ng that the effectiveness of social -emotional learning relies on a consistent environment. The child's social-emotional development suffers if they alternate between one adult who understands the SEL needs of the child, and then another adult who doesn't. We aim to make the school experience secure, consistent, and supportive for staff and students alike throughout each day, providing cumulative effects across multiple years. Yearly Activities and Hours of Professional Development Training for Teachers Teacher training is of sufficient quality, intensity, and duration to lead to improvements in practice among the recipients of those services. The project will offer 42 hours of PD and activities per year for teachers. This aligns with Principle 1 of the Center for Public Education's Five Principles of Effective Professional Development \u2014that the duration of PD must be PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e30 ARTSEL - 17 significant and ongoing.44 Each year the program will offer: 6 hours spring PD 12 hours summer PD 6 hours after school meetings 6 hours independent coursework 7 hours - written reflections 5 hours collaborative teaching/consultation with ARTSEL staff The project will offer 12 hours of PD and activities per year for principals and other school staff. 4 hours summer PD 2 hours after school meetings 3 hours independent coursework/written reflections 3 hours consultation with ARTSEL staff Evidence -Based Teaching best practices Another way in which we are addressing the needs of the target population is to use results from our previous Department of Education-funded projects which revealed arts integration is rich with opportunities for developing best teaching practices. Being cognizant and intentional about these teaching practices is critical for effective implementation of arts integration. Without addressing teaching pedagogy, the full potential for arts integration is at risk. Fortunately, an analysis of the efficacy of vari ous teaching practices has been done. In order to find an answer to the question \"What works best in education?\" researcher John Hattie ranked 138 educational practices that are related to learning outcomes from very positive effects to very negative effects in his meta -study Visible Learning. 45 Hattie found that the average effect size of all interventions he studied was 0.40. Strategies with an effect size higher than this 0.40 \"hinge point\" are considered in the \"zone of desired effects.\" 46 Research-based best practices to be explicitly addressed in the ARTSEL trainings include the following that have been reported in the literature as having effect sizes between 0.62 - 0.90: developing positive student/teacher relationships (0.72 effect size),47 checking for understanding (0.90 effect size) , 48 44 Gulamhussein, Allison.

The study used trained observers to watch 7,491 videos of instruction by 1,333 teachers from six socio- economically and geographically diverse districts.54 All of these observations pointed to one glaring weakness - the vast majority of teachers were not teaching for critical thinking.\"55 Without specific and intentional instruction and support for teaching higher-order thinking, teachers are unlikely to take arts integration experiences to their f ull potential. The research -based best practices will be folded into the coaching cycles where the coordinators will model arts lessons demonstrating best practices. The best practices in turn support student learning at the highest levels. 2. Proposal alig ned with the National Core Arts Standards and Common Core Standards The quality component of the proposed work is addressed by the intentional alignment between the arts professional development training with The California Department of Education's 2019 Visual and Performing Arts standards which are aligned with the National Core Arts Standards. These new standards set a high bar for arts education that emphasizes higher-order thinking. Students regularly convey meaning through their artwork, interpret artwork for meaning, and relate artistic work with societal, cultural, and historical context. Both teachers and students need support meeting these new high standards for arts instruction. 49 ibid 50 ibid 51 Ritchhart, Ron, Mark Church, and Karin Morri son. 2011.

At the heart of the CCSS, NGSS, and NCAS is an increased emphasis on critical thinking. When students are surveyed on what they perceive they do in school, \"thinking\" is not in the top 10 things listed, yet shouldn't this be the ultimate goal of school? \"Bored\" is the most common descriptor students used to describe how they feel in school 56. Thinking is considered the precursor to learning57, yet how many classroom s actively use targeted creative and critical thinking strategies and higher-order thinking routines? These are essential for several reasons. An emphasis on thinking often makes for a student- centered classroom where students are empowered to observe, question, evaluate, plan, reason, connect, and form conclusions instead of these actions being the domain of the teacher. Students who engage in these thinking pathways have increased engagement, ownership, and agency with their learning. An emphasis on thinking moves student work beyond mere task- completion or memorization activities into areas of real learning. Thinking strategies are tools the teacher can use to provide structure to facilitate student thought processes with the goal of making those processes routine behaviors. 58 The academic literature documents studies in this area as creativity, comprised of such indices as cognitive fluency, flexibility, and originality, all pointing to the ability of individuals to generate ideas, find problems, generate and test solutions, and know when to repeat the process. Students in high trauma, under resourced environments constantly need to adapt, think quickly and critically to survive. These skills have been documented to increase through arts integration. 59 60 Arts can teach these skills, especially when teachers learn how to focus on teaching creativity 56 https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/ed/17/01/bored- out-their-minds 57 https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/18/02/think- better 58 Making Thinking Visible, R.

The challenge and opportunity are to disseminate these established best practices with general education teachers in a way that promotes the integration of arts instruction across the curriculum. Not only because participation in the arts promotes student success, but when presented effectively, teachers will learn how integrating the arts into other subjects will help them teach their students in a way that develops the student thinking skills called for by these new standards. Besides aligning with the National Core Arts Standards and Common Core State Standards, curricula developed in the project will address key creativity skills (s ee attachment) as evaluated in the self -assessment creativity skills rubric (see attachment). The lesson plan template (see attachment) illustrates the focus on the creativity skills, National/California Arts Standards for Public Schools as well as California's Social & Emotional Learning Principles Guidelines. In addition, as shown in the ARTSEL 5- Year Overview (see attachment), we will be using an incremental approach for arts education development for teachers, administrators, and staff. The ARTSEL team will begin with philosophical foundations of how the arts are used in classrooms, what their purpose is, and best practices in integrating arts with higher-order thinking and social-emotional learning. Visual and theater arts projects follow after the conc eptual understanding for why and how they should be used is established. Each grade level will have evolving and age- appropriate objectives. The National Core Arts Standards and the California Arts Standards for Public Schools are used to support sequenced lessons. Let's consider two examples from 3rd and 5th grade. Evolving visual art objectives in 3 rd Grade might have students studying the art of Sonia Delaunay and creating a visual abstraction of a positive memory from earli er in their childhood. Students share verbally and in writing how they remember the event, the feelings they recall from it, and how they chose to represent it symbolically. The reflective writing both strengthens their arts experience and addresses the Co mmon Core standard to write informative/ explanatory texts to examine a topic and convey ideas and information clearly. Some of the higher- order thinking in this project includes ideation, metaphorical thinking, connection-making, PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e34 ARTSEL - 21 perspective -taking, and synthesizing. This lesson also emphasizes the SEL competencies of identifying and communicating personal identity and assets through the recall of emotional memories of a positive event.61 Teachers will be taught ways to facilitate discussion safely and will also be given tools for responding to strong feelings or sensitive content that may be shared. Fifth-grade students will use watercolor and oil pastels to symbolically represent a character from literature. For example, a goose might represent a protective character or a gift might symbolize a generous character. Here, students use creativity, higher-order thinking, and text citation as evidence for their choices. In one pilot classroom, the whole class all chose the main character from the book, yet no two symbolic choices were the same. Metaphorical thinking is the higher-order thinking ability to make connections between two unlike things, by recognizing an inherent similarity or a common trait. This project also offers students the SEL opportunity to understand other students' perspectives on how they envision the character's traits and to practice using socially and emotionally supportive language with one another 62. In these creative education examples, some characteristics stand out. First, student wo rk evolves over time; the iteration process is evident and they see how creative ideas change and evolve. Next, input from others helps them shape and develop their art and supports collabora-tion skills and perspective-taking. Sharing their memories and emotions with others develops social-emotional awareness, cultural awareness, class cohesion, and empathy. Engagement in the classrooms is at an all -time high as students are invested in their representation of the concept; they have ownership in both the metaphor and the art. By asking students to use visual art to demonstrate the concepts about which they are writing, students are more attuned to sensory details, higher-order thinking, and metacognitive skills. Finally, observers of the artworks are struck by the uniqueness of each one. Since each student is working to represent their vision of each challenge, no two artworks were the same. This supports feelings of a creative identity, independence, self-worth, and respect for the perspectives of others. 61 https://www.artsintegration.net/abstracted -memory.htm l 62 https://www.artsintegration.net/symbolic -portraits.html PR/Award # S351A210056 Page ARTSEL - 22 3. Thinking strategies from Project Zero/ Harvard Graduate School of Education Project Zero was founded in 1967 by philosopher Nelson Goodman at the Harvard Graduate School of Education to study and improve education in the arts. Project Zero has maintained a strong research agenda in the arts while gradually expanding to include investigations into the nature of intelligence, understanding, creativity, and cross- disciplinary thinking.63 The Project believes, \"Learning is a consequence of thinking, and developing a culture of thinking is critical if we want to produce the feelings, energy, and even joy that can propel learning forward and motivate learners to do what at times can be hard and challenging mental work.\"64 The thinking strategies published under Ma king Thinking Visible (Ron Ritchart, et. al.) and Artful Thinking help teachers strengthen student thinking and learning in the arts and beyond. ARTSEL aims to help teachers create connections between works of art and the curriculum and to help teachers use art routinely as a force for developing students' thinking and cognitive development.65 Using thinking strategies, teachers will move from focusing on tasks to a focus on ways of thinking. We can make the various ways of thinking a priority in school by b eing intentional and explicit in identifying them and designing a curriculum to address them. In prior PD and as documented by teacher questionnaires, these thinking routines have been used and found universally valuable for regularly increasing student engagement and evolving to a student-centered, inquiry-based classroom. 4. Alignment with California Social & Emotional Learning Guiding Principles and CASEL The ARTSEL project will facilitate social and emotional learning, as defined by the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) to include the process for developing healthy identities, managing emotions, achieving goals, feeling and expressing empathy for others, creating and maintaining positive relationships, and making responsi ble decisions. The ARTSEL approach will be rooted in evidence- based best practices: SEL will be woven into curricula throughout the day; SEL interventions will be designed to meet the specific, 63 http://www.pz.harvard.edu/who -we-are/about 64 e36 - 23 assessed needs of both students and teachers; SEL will be contextual, relationship driven, and explicit; it will be culturally responsive; it will offer affirmative messaging66 67 68 69 70 Moreover, implementation will be monitored to ensure integrity of delivery.71 ARTSEL intends to empower teachers with sustainable tools for addressing social -emotional needs they encounter at the front lines as well as for their own self -care. This will enable students to have equitable access to lifelong skills for personal well- being and educational success.72 73 After this pandemic, at a time of such high disengagement from school and other students, it is crucial that we address the social -emotional crisis that COVID -19 has wrought. Children are five times more likely to need support for mental health issues, including post- traumatic stress (PTS), when isolated during a pandemic.74 Students with existing mental health challenges, as well as those with special needs, are particularly vulnerable to the negative mental health impacts of the pandemic.75 Moreover, mental health problems for children and adolescents are not only likely to develop but also to endure as a result of loneliness brought on by the pandemic. 76 66 California's Guilding Social and Emotional Learning Principles https://www.cde.ca.gov/eo/in/documents/selguidingprincipleswb.pdf 67 Durlak JA, Weissberg RP, Dymnicki AB, Ta ylor RD & Schellinger K.

PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e37 ARTSEL - 24 Correspondingly, emergency room visits for children's mental health issues steadily rose during the first seven months of the CO VD-19 pandemic in 2020 compared to the same seven-month period in the previous year, particularly for adolescents.77 In addition, data from six large CORE school districts in California have shown that extended absences from school negatively impact all students in four measured constructs of SEL: growth mindset (GM), social awareness (SA), self-efficacy (SE), and self -management (SM). Low -income students and SWD are particularly impacted by the SEL effects of absenteeism. 78 79 As the arts offer an organic and evidence-based medium for being seen and heard, SEL through the arts will enhance engagement and salience, which should hasten and deepen a sense of belonging and, thus, more rapidly improve the culture and climate of classrooms. ARTSEL partner UCLArts & Healing has found, in collaboration with Turnaround Arts: CA, that school- wide implementation of its evidence -based SEL program was associated with reductions in behavior incidents across the board as well as a six percent increase in sense of belonging, after progressive declines in this construct over the previous four years at an underserved middle school. UCLArts & Healing has demonstrated that a positive youth development approach aimed at building core assets can be effective for reducing behavior pr oblems across a spectrum in low- income elementary school students.80 It has also gathered as -yet-unpublished data documenting the benefits of this approach with special education students, whose behavior improves even more as a result of greater behavior challenges at the outset. Multiple special education teachers have reported that dysregulated students will calm down immediately when given the 77 Leeb RT, Bitsko RH, Radhakrishnan L, Martinez P, Njai R, Holland KM.

UCLArts & Healing's approach to the integration of mental health practices with the arts will empower teachers with nonjudgmental language tools to facilitate reflection and dialogue, in contrast to typical responses such as \"Good job\" or \"I like it,\" which can lead to missed opportunities for dialogue, performance anxiety, and external seeking of validation. Furthermore, teachers will learn tools for enhancing emotional safety in the classroom, for example, by setting ground rules for sharing and by engaging the whole classroom in an arts-based technique for stress management when an individual student is showing signs of traumatic stress, so as not to single them out. General education, music education, and special education teachers have all reported increases in student participation as a result of UCLArts & Heal ing's SEL program, which encourages positive risk- taking by actively embracing mistakes while learning in a supportive environment. This also encourages lifelong participation in and advocacy for the arts. ARTSEL training partner UCLArts & Healing has over 16 years of experience developing and delivering training programs in its \"social-emotional arts\" methodology, and it has shown that implementation can be predicted by constructs such as confidence in the ability to implement the program, beliefs about pr eparedness, interest in the art medium, satisfaction with the training, and perceived barriers.81 Year by Year Activities at a Glance ARTSEL 5 -Year Overview - see attachment (B2) The extent to which the design of the proposed project is appropriate to, and will successfully address, the needs of the target population or other identified needs. As mentioned in section A2, Humboldt County has a unique student population requiring targeted support due to our rural/frontier designation, high percentages of homeless students, students in the foster care system, students living with disabilities, and a high indigenous student population. As mentioned in section B1 Subsection 4, the proposed ARTSEL response to these unique circumstances is a whole- school initia tive providing evidence- based best practices in 81 Ho, P., Chinen, K., Streja, L., Kreitzer, M.

A Research -Based Professional Development Model The ARTSEL PD model is informed by lessons learned from the previous three projects funded by the Department of Education. The model follows the Center for Public Education's Five Principles of Effective Professional Development. 82 Principle 1: The duration of professional development must be significant and ongoing to allow time for teachers to learn a new strategy and grapple with the implementation problem. Principle 2: There must be support for a teacher during the implementation state that addresses the specific challenges of changing classroom practice. Principle 3: Teachers' initial exposure to a concept should be active and varied so they participate in experiencing the new practice first hand. Principle 4: Modeling has been found to be highly effective in helping teachers understand a new practice. Principle 5: The content presented to teachers should not be generic but specific to their grade level or content needs. Using these five principles, the project's PD and support will be as follows: Each teacher will engage in 42 hours of training, coaching, and in- class collaboration each year\u2014after Year One which has 18 hours of training. This number is based on research that suggests at least 50 hours of instruction, practice, and coaching is needed for a new teaching strategy to be effectively learned and implemented.83 Since the strategies will include social-emotional learning, higher- order thinking, and arts education, we're allocating 186 hours of total professional development. Each teacher will attend a day in the spring as well as a two -day summer institute to accomplish Stage One: Introduction to New Teaching Ideas .84 Instruction will focus on 82 ibid 83 ibid 84 ibid PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e40 ARTSEL - 27 conceptual understanding in visual art and theater art, technology, artful thinking strategies, higher-order thinking, social- emotional learning, and research -based best teaching practices. Learning will be active and first-hand so the teacher will know what their students will be experiencing. (Principle 3) This training will focus on the concepts teachers actually teach at their grade levels, not generic lessons. (Princ iple 5)85 Stage Two: Support During Implementation in the Classroom will begin in the first implementation year. (Principle 2) To ensure that all teachers can implement the arts strategies that were taught in professional development, a coaching cycle model will be implemented. Diane Sweeney's Student -Centered Coaching is one such model. A coordinator/coach will visit the teacher's classroom and meet with the teacher to establish goals for student learning in the arts and best practices in teaching. The coach will model a lesson or series of lessons with the teacher's students (Principle 4) which is effective in changing teacher beliefs when they see their students succeeding with a new teaching practice.86 After each lesson, the coach and teacher will debrief to give both opportunities to discuss how the lesson went and how to improve it in the future. In the next lesson, the two may co- teach. Again, after these sessions, a debrief/ goal setting session will follow. In the final sessions of the cycle, the tea cher will teach independently while the coach observes and provides feedback based on previously established goals. By fostering a coaching relationship with teachers, the coordinators can formatively assess each teacher's skills and work with each one personally to maximize their classroom effective - ness. The targets will include the arts skills and the related pedagogy. This authentic training model reflects learning from our previous Department of Education funded grants and a review of PD research. \"Over 90% of teachers report having participated in professional development in the past year, but the majority also report that it wasn't useful. This is because most development happens in a workshop- style mod el which research shows has little to no impact on student learning or teacher practice.\" 87 Research on traditional workshops in which teachers are 85 ibid 86 ibid 87 Darling-Hammond, L., Chung Wei, R., Andree, A., & Richardson, N. (2009). Professional learning in the learning PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e41 ARTSEL - 28 described or shown new skills finds only 10% of teachers could transfer the skill to practice.88 \"The one- time workshop assumes the only challenge facing teachers is a lack of knowledge of effective teaching practices and when that knowledge gap is corrected, teachers will then be able to change. Research finds otherwise. It turns out teachers' greatest challenge comes when they attempt to implement newly learned methods into the classroom.\"89 \"Workshops [alone] have an abysmal track record for changing teacher practice and student achievement.\"90 \"The area of greatest struggle is not in learning a new skill but in implementing it, something referred to as the 'implementation dip.'\"91 \"If school districts want teachers to change instruction, the implementation stage must be included and supported more explicitly in professional development offerings, as this is the c ritical state where teachers begin to commit to an instructional approach.\"92 Mastering a new teaching skill takes 20 or more separate instances of practice.93 Furthermore, teachers' beliefs about teaching change only after they see success with students.94 If teachers do not feel successful or see success in their students, they revert to previous teaching methods and what was learned in professional development goes unused.95 For this reason, every ARTSEL teacher will engage in twice- yearly extended coaching cycles and the teacher/coach partnership ensures a collaborative effort toward improvement. ARTSEL is an innovative interdisciplinary approach that promotes the arts to ensure all students are able to reach their full potential in both academic and social -emotional contexts through whole-school reform. profession: A status report on teacher development in the United States and abroad.

The likely impact of the ARTSEL initiative is expected to be seen at multiple levels (e.g., students, teachers, school culture) and is addressed in detail in the Evaluation Plan (E2). In addition the initiative is built on an extensive review of the literature which serves as the foundation for the proposed work. The framework is built around whole-school reform and includes parents, teachers, and student self- assessments to capture multiple perspectives on student learning. Impacts will be assessed at multiple levels recognizing that professional development opportunities will be provided to the teachers where the impact will be assessed, followed by teachers implementing their training with their students where the impact will once again be assessed by the student, their teacher, as well as their parent to provide a 360 -degree assessment of the impact of the work on student outcomes. Additional relationships between training and outcomes are identified and described in the Logic Model (see attachment). The importance of this alignment cannot be overstated. In work leading up to the proposal, a focus group of principals was convened. In this meeting, the principals were unanimous in the need to align arts education with district initiatives. It is also critical they experience how the arts improve attendance rates and lower dropout ra tes, 96 increase parent and community involvement,97 reduce disciplinary problems, encourage positive attitudes about school,98 and have an essential role in achieving the best aspects of the Common Core.99 (B4) The extent to which the services to be provided b y the proposed project involves the collaboration of appropriate partners for maximizing the effectiveness of project services. Northern California has one of the highest per- capita rates of artists in the US. Locally, there are numerous established community arts partners eager to work with teachers to integrate arts in classrooms and have formalized their interest in the form of partnerships with the ARTSEL initiative. These nonprofit partners are important because their mission ensures they continue to 96 Arts Education Partnership (2013).

ARTSEL staff have developed a partnership with Humboldt State University Learning Service Programs and regularly give 3 - 4 presentations per semester to their students. James Woglom, Ph.D., Associate Professor/Arts Education Area Lead and Elementary Credential Program Lead, will oversee the Service Learning Students who will be paired in teachers' classrooms. Not only will this enhance the learning for K-8 students, but also for future educators and their mentors. The structures developed over the past seven years have proven successful at disseminating information and strategies we've developed. We present to teacher groups, county office of education cohorts, and educational communities at local, state, and national levels. We average 1-2 presentations monthly, reaching thousands of individuals yearly. These presentations have included regular sessions with local educators who are not grant participant s such as English teachers, Humboldt State University teacher candidates, and teachers attending conferences. We also present to the Northern California SEL Community of Practice, a group of county Office of Education personnel from about a dozen counties in California, on a monthly basis. At the state and national level, we are often asked to present at conferences such as the National Art Educators Association, STEM education conferences, and museums such as the Getty Museum. Teaching Artists in the Schools Local professional master artists, often already trained by the Region 1 Arts & Creativity Initiative and Create Humboldt will go to the schools to co -teach and collaborate with teachers to provide extended- term intensive visual or theater arts ed ucation programs to students and teachers as part of one to five session arts lessons with a teaching artist. This arts -focused coaching will employ professional artists and arts educators to work with students and model lessons and techniques for teachers . PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e44 ARTSEL - 31 These lessons will allow students to participate in high -quality, professionally- led arts lessons and provide them access to the skills and knowledge of a master artist. Teachers will meet with the master artists to troubleshoot and discuss the lesson in terms of educational efficacy. The artists will also collaborate with ARTSEL staff to discuss how the lesson's methods can be integrated into other core curriculum.

To address this need and to address our commitment to diversity and inclusion, we will actively recruit qualified members of underrepresented groups to apply for open positions. We have partnered with a number of organizations to assist in meeting this goal, including: Black Humboldt, BBlack, HC Black Music & Arts Association, Black Male Empowerment Network, Queer Humboldt, Latino net, Two Feathers Native American Family Service, and True North Organizing Network. While hiring rules make it illegal to specifically require a staff member to be a member of an underrepresented group, in addition to recruiting from representative organizations, the hiring qualifications will stress a strong understanding of and experience working with the communities that comprise local underrepresented groups.

(D1) Adequacy of the management plan to achieve the objectives of the project on time and within budget, including clearly defined responsibilities, timelines, and milestones Two overriding principles are integrated into the management plan: (1) data-driven decision making to ensure implementation with fidelity, resulting in (2) incre asing levels of appropriate support, coaching, and other services for teachers. Each team member has clearly defined responsibilities and have successfully worked together. ARTSEL requires leadership, fiscal oversight, clear responsibilities, regular input from sites, and a system to support and monitor staff and student success. HCOE and the ARTSEL team PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e47 ARTSEL - 34 have extensive experience supporting students and managing successful US Education grants which make us confident to achieve the goals and objectives on time and on budget. Ms. Young successfully manages county and region-wide activities through her role at HCOE. Mr. Funk-houser and Ms. Young have successfully completed all reporting and fiduciary responsibilities for their current AAEDD gran t which remains within budget and on track to achieve established goals even with a 10,000 square mile geographic region and the complications of COVID-19. The plan includes strong coordination between the participants, clearly delineated activities, and comprehensive procedures for evaluation and feedback from stakeholders. The coordinators and evaluators will implement a systematic data collection system. The evaluators will develop a process-focused Fidelity Matrix to measure progress towards meeting benchmarks and with the site teams provide site -level and project-wide data reports which will be reviewed in the monthly Implementation Team (IT) meetings. An Advisory Committee (AC) comprised of representatives from each school will review program implementation, help the IT make mid - course corrections, and focus on sustainability. Implementation Team: Stacy Young, Project Director Bill Funkhouser, Project Coordinator Heather Gaiera, Project Coordinator Ping Ho, SEL Consultant Dr. Ivonne Chand O'Neal, External Evaluator Melanie Rick, Arts Integration Consultant Dr. Peter Stoll, MTSS and Behavior Therapist Consultant The Implementation Team will meet monthly (more often at first) to review process monitoring data and other feedback and facilitate achievement of ARTSEL project goals, objectives, and implementation timelines. The IT will work closely with principals or other key school personnel to plan and implement (or support) PD for the teachers and staff. The IT meetings guide program implementation and continuous improvement. The director, coordinator, and staff will implement a systematic data collection system to guide and monitor project implementation at each school. The external evaluators will support this data collection PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e48 ARTSEL - 35 system and provide monthly site- level and project -wide data reports to the IT and sites. Evaluators will develop a process-focused fidelity matrix to measure progre ss towards goals. Advisory Committee Nonprofit partners Dr. Jim Woglom, Humboldt State University Art Professor Administrators, teachers, and/or staff from participating schools Implementation Team The Advisory Committee will meet quarterly to review formative evaluation data and project progress towards meeting its goals, in order to determine how well the needs of students are being addressed and how partners and schools might collaborate more effectively. Principals and other key school personnel will participate to ensure that schools' needs are addressed. The County Offices will participate to coordinate the provision of additional resources. Project Timeline: The Management Timeline will be exp anded as ARTSEL is implemented, but the table below shows the estimated timeline based on previous projects.

(D3) The adequacy of mechanisms for ensuring high -quality products and services from the proposed project. Prior to the delivery of professional development, formative research will be conducted through focus groups with teachers. These focus group sessions will be run as if the professional development was being delivered, in order to assess the effectiveness of the training and the relevance of the content to the target population. Formative research constitutes an initial test of the program's theory of action and objectives in order to increase the likelihood that the intervention will have its intended impact, once formal assessments begin. Formative evaluation, will continue throughout the duration of the project to expose residual w eaknesses in the intervention, primarily through weekly implementation surveys submitted by teachers and PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e51 ARTSEL - 38 monthly self- reported measures of resilience in their role.

(D4) How the applicant will ensure that a diversity of perspectives are brought to bear in the operation of the proposed project. To address the need for a diversity of perspectives, the qualitative component of the PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e52 ARTSEL - 39 ARTSEL initiative will incorporate a series of focus groups. Through this process, we will learn from a parent focus group, teacher focus group, as well as interviews with principals the pandemic challenges th ey believe impacted students the most, ways to remedy these issues both as short term interventions, as well as long -term, sustainable methods. Since students will engage with each of these groups in different ways, it is critical to access their viewpoint s and capture their perspectives in order to understand the community, school culture, home and family culture, and traditions that influence the students in this part of the country. As mentioned, a high percent of students in Humboldt County are homeless and from foster care environments which present an additional perspective that needs to be captured. We will work with social agencies to identify parties who can accurately speak to the out-of-school environment of these students. The mixed methods eval uation design incorporates the collection of quantitative data to provide additional opportunit ies for parents, teachers, and students to offer their perspectives on the project : student self -reports on creativity ( i.e., real world problem solving, and ide a generation), engagement in school, and social emotional learning; parent reports on their child's creativity, engagement in school, and social emotional learning, and teacher reports on their student's creativity, engagement in school, and social emotional learning. Information from both qualitative and quantitative data collection will be analyzed and used to inform professional development, coaching sessions, and school- wide family engagement efforts to support the whole-school reform approach put forth by the ARTSE L initiative. (E1) The extent to which the methods of evaluation are thorough, feasible, and appropriate to the goals, objectives, and outcomes of the proposed project. The mixed methods evaluation approach incorporating both qualitative and quantitative data is designed to thoroughly, feasibly, and appropriately assess the goals, objectives and outcomes at multiple levels of program implementation. In addition, a process evaluation will focus on how the program components are being implemented and if they are being implemented with fidelity. Additional components of the process evaluation include frequency of exposure (number of sessions), dosage of training (hours of training), and quality of training to understand PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e53 ARTSEL - 40 how teachers are processing and implementing the training they are receiving. Coaching cycles will also be included in the process evaluation to understand how teaching practice is being impacted by frequency, dosage, and quality of coaching. Teacher self reports of implementation will also serve as a component of the process evaluation. The qualitative component which will include parent and teacher focus groups, and principal interviews will help us understand how the pandemic interrupted important themes including, student learning, increased isolation, learning loss and lack of engagement were experienced and how it manifested at different grade levels. We expect to learn from caregivers and parents about how students handled the lack of social interaction with their friends and classmates, what challenges were caused by distance learning and lack of interventions during this time that are necessary for students living with special needs. These topics can be fully explored through facilitated focus groups and will be conducted in Spanish for Spanish-speaking parents. The summative evaluation and impact evaluation will be conducted annually and will provide a yearly snapshot of how implementation of arts strategies influenced student outcomes, specifically in the areas of student creativity, engagement in school, and social -emotional learning. By incorporating a triangulated approach where students provide self-reports, parents report on their children, and teachers report on their students using validated assessments, we will have multiple data points for each student on the same construct from multiple perspectives offering a holistic view of a student's capacity in these areas. To insure the feasibility of the evaluation at a county leve l, the External Evaluator will be engaged as well as the following ARTSEL team members. Having a 0.25 FTE project director, and 2.0 FTE full-time project coordinators, will be sufficient to serve the 100 teachers, administrators, and staff involved in the three schools. They will also support the visiting artists and conduct coaching cycles with each of the teachers along with all other duties such as creating and facilitating professional development, purchasing and managing materials, federal reporting, and curriculum creation. Ms. Young's 0.25 FTE assignment will provide her with the time she needs to oversee data collection, project reports, project evaluation processes, PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e54 ARTSEL - 41 addressing feedback about the project, and meeting with the project staff. Coordinators : Mr. Funkhouser's 0.5 FTE and Ms. Gaiera's 0.5 FTE assignment in year 1 and 1.0 FTE each year 2- 5 within the project will allow them to effectively support the program\u2014as they have done in three prior federal arts grants. Clerical assistance with a 0. 2 FTE administrative assistant and 0.5 FTE professional development technician will help prepare professional development materials, instructional materials, payroll, stipends, contractual support, filing reports, and other required documentation. The external evaluators and consultants have evaluated numerous US Education and other grants and will coordinate schedules to meet the requirements of all grant activities. (E2) Extent to which evaluation methods include objective performance measures clearly related to intended project outcomes and will produce quantitative and qualitative data .... The quantitative evaluation will use multiple objective performance measures including the California Healthy Kids Survey, a comprehensive data system designed to assess the needs of the whole child and a system that guides efforts by schools, communities and families to ensure all youth thrive. This goal is accomplished through the use of multiple perspectives with subscales that access information from multiple groups. The California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS), is a modular, anonymous assessment recommended for students a ge 10 (grade 5) and above. It is focused on the five most important areas for guiding school and student improvement: student connectedness, learning engagement/motivation, and attendance; school climate, culture, and conditions; school safety, including violence perpetration and victimization/bullying; physical and mental well-being and social- emotional learning; and student supporters including resilience-promoting developmental factors (caring relationships, high expectations, and meaningful participation). The California School Staff Survey (CSSS) provides a means to confidentially obtain staff perceptions about learning and teaching conditions. The online staff survey assesses the perceptions and experiences of K -12 teachers, administrators, and other school personnel (intended for all grades). The results are intended to help: address the problem of low teacher PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e55 ARTSEL - 42 recruitment, morale, and retention; guide professional development and school improvement efforts, and determine what degree to which staff per ceptions align with the attitudes and experiences of students and parents as identified by other subscales. An important influence on the development of the CSSS is research showing that school climate is a powerful predictor of outcomes among staff as it is for students. This includes teacher job satisfaction and retention. A positive climate for staff is a prerequisite for a positive climate for students. The CSSS provides comparison data to the questions and constructs asked students in the student version of CHKS, addresses the working environment and conditions, including staff relationships (collegiality), organizational expectations and norms, and meaningful participation in decisions; encapsulates the scope and nature of existing student supports, programs, and services (e.g., discipline, counseling, health and prevention); and assesses parent supports and involvement. The California School Parent Survey (CSPS) is designed to provide teachers, administrators, and other school staff with information directly from parents, including: parent perceptions about the school's learning environment, school climate, student supporters, and parent outreach involvement efforts (e.g., how welcoming, communicative). It also provides data on the scope and nature of parent involvement at the school (relationships, activities) and in the child's education in general. CSPS identifies which needs and concerns of the parents schools should address in promoting greater involvement. Asking parents to provide their perceptions of the school is an empowering parent- involved activity. An additional objective measure will be the exploratory use of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP). Student, Parent and Teacher Assessments to assess Creativity a nd Student Engagement : Creativity and student engagement in school will be assessed from three perspectives: student self-report, parent, and teacher perspectives. The creativity and student engagement research instruments, their reliability values, and a brief description of what they measure, follow. Student Assessments : The Student Attitudes about Flexibility: Self Report (AAFS) ( = .60) examines actions, PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e56 ARTSEL - 43 attitudes, and thinking style in the context of elementary school aged themes. It contains 10 Likert scale items (e.g., I consider all kinds of solutions (not just one) when solving problems). Runco Ideational Behavior Scale: Student Report (RIBS-S) ( = .86) asks students to report how often they have certain ideas, thoughts, or behaviors. This scale contains 25 Likert scal e items and is designed to measure creative potential (e.g., I have ideas about a new invention). Idea Judgment Scale (IJSS) ( = .68) asks participants to choose between two sets of ideas contained in six items, according to their preference. The idea sets convey either a higher or lower degree of creativity (e.g., Students A and B were asked to make a list of things that are flat. This is what they said: Student A said: pancake, a tire, a lake, a table, the floor. Student B said: a table, a piece of paper , an ice rink, TV screen, lines. Now it's your turn...whose ideas do you like better?). This instrument is designed to measure originality and creativity. Attitudes about Art: Student Report (AAAS) ( = .89) asks students to rate how they feel about different types/forms of the arts and arts -related activities, as well as the relationship between the arts and other subjects. This assessment contains 16 Likert scale items (e.g., One way to understand history is to look at art through the ages.). Chand O'Neal & Schulz Begle Student Engagement Survey: Student-Report (ENG -S) ( = .78) examines student attitudes toward school and school- related activities. The 31 Likert scale items were designed to assess subscales of emotional engagement, interest, effort, positive challenge, and flow (e.g., I spend more time than needed on projects that interest me.). Both subscale and global scores are obtained from students, teachers, and parents. In some cases, based on theoretical criteria, items are included in more than one subscale, so the global overall score is slightly different than an average of all scores. Parent Assessments : Parental Evaluation of Students' Creativity (PESC; Runco, 1984) ( = .89) contains 25 Likert scale items . It asks parents to indicate whether or not their child participated in certain creative and artistic activities (e.g., To what degree, or how often, is this child curious?). Parents are not informed the focus is on creativity and art. It scores for creative potential and flexibility. PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e57 ARTSEL - 44 Runco Ideational Behavior Scale - Parent Report (RIBS -P) ( =.90) asks parents to rate the frequency with which their children displayed specific behaviors (e.g., \"how often does your child...Suggest arrangements for rearranging the furniture in his or her bedroom?\"). Each of the 32 Likert scale items is indicative of the production of ideas, or \"ideational behavior.\" The items are designed to measure creative potential. Chand O'Neal & Schulz Begle Student Engagement Survey: Parent-Report (ENG -P) ( = .82) examines parent perspectives of their child's attitudes toward school and school- related activities. The 33 Likert scale items are designed to assess subscales of emotional engagement, effort, and positive challenge. Teacher Assessments : Teachers' Evaluation of Students' Creativity (TESC) ( = .90) is based on social validation technology, which means that the wording is based on actual teacher input. The focus is creativity and the traits that support or inhibit it. The 25 Likert scale items examine flexibility, motivation for creativity, and social creativity. This is a criterion measure and indicative of actual artistic and creative activity. Runco Ideational Behavior Scale (RIBS -T) ( = .95) is for teachers and is virtually identical to the RIBS -P. This assessment asks teachers to rate the frequency with which their students display specific behaviors (e.g., \"How often does this student...Think of better endings for books, stories, or shows?\"). Each behavior is rated on a 1-5 Likert scale. Each is indicat ive of the production of ideas, or \"ideational behavior.\" The 32 Likert scale items are designed to measure creative potential. Chand O'Neal & Schulz Begle Student Engagement Survey: Teacher -Report (ENG-T) ( = .89) examined teacher perspectives of their student's attitudes toward school and school- related activities. The 33 Likert scale items are designed to assess subscales of emotional engagement, effort, and positive challenge. Social Emotional Learning Measures will be developed and validated for the purpose of the ARTSEL evaluation, and will incorporate specifics to address the needs of the specialized student population at student, parent, and teacher levels. PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e58 ARTSEL - 45 The qualitative measures will incorporate the use of three parent focus groups, three teacher focus groups, and three principal interviews, and will help us understand how the pandemic interrupted important student themes including, belonging, grit, increased isolation, learning loss, and lack of engagement across multiple grades. We expect to learn from caregivers and parents about how loneliness and isolation impacted motivation and resilience, what challenges were caused by distance learning and lack of interventions during this time that are necessary for students living with special needs. These topics can be fully explored through facilitated focus groups and will be conducted in Spanish for Spanish-speaking parents. Project demonstrates a rationale informed by research and included in the Logic Model Section A5 provides theoretical rationale to support the proposed work. The program logic model (see attachment) serves as a graphic depiction of the relationships between the inputs (both resources and activities), outputs (both resources and activities) and short, medium and long-term outcomes. The logic model will help guide the program. (E3) The extent to which the methods of evaluation will provide valid and reliable performance data on relevant outcomes. The project evaluation has the potential to produce promising evidence (evidence of the effectiveness of a key project component in improving a relevant outcome). Due to (a) the rural nature of the program (which limits possible treatment and control schoo ls), and (b) the lack of a random assignment of participating teachers, the evaluation study will be a Quasi- Experimental Design (described below) which can meet What Works Clearinghouse standards with reservations, but cannot meet WWC standards without reservations. Impact Evaluation on the effect of implementation of the model The study will incorporate a Quasi -Experimental Design. Qualitative data will be collected through focus groups conducted with parents from each school and teachers from each school, as well as in -depth interviews with each participating school principal, to understand the challenges faced by these groups in addressing student needs during the period of the coronavirus pandemic. Quantitative data will be collected at the student, p arent, teacher, and school levels. To collect PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e59 ARTSEL - 46 quantitative data, a power analysis will be conducted to determine sample size. Based on this number, a representative number of classrooms will be randomly selected from the three participating schools. Explor atory use of achievement measures will be the objective performance measures. Based on the unique demographics in this part of California, a study will be conducted to determine whether obtaining matched control groups is feasible. If not, propensity score matching will be used to generate a comparable control group. Once the samples are constructed for treatment and comparison, Dr. Chand O'Neal will confirm the equivalence of the samples at baseline by using the same structure of the hierarchical linear regression model that is described below, but with the data from pre- treatment assessments (2021) as the dependent variable. Effects of the proposed professional development model will be estimated by a three level (student, classroom, school) hierarchical linear regression model with dependent variables the baseline levels of student creativity, engagement, and social emotional learning which are observed in 2021 (exploratory), and 2022 (confirmatory). The model is designed to control for and to measure the impacts of the following co -variates: student creativity, engagement, and social emotional learning, student achievement (exploratory) in 2021 and 2022 (baseline), student socioeconomic status, student race, classroom grade- level, class - room teacher experience, percent of non -white students in the school, percent of low socio- economic students in the school. We will explore the effect of the treatment on student creativity, engagement, social emotional learning, and achievement (exploratory) after one year of the program (based on change from baseline), look to confirm a small positive effect in student creativity, engagement and social emotional learning after two years, and look to confirm a moderate positive effect after three years. Additional explorator y analysis will be conducted on six student subgroups: Foster, Homeless, Native American, Hispanic, Low Socio -economic Status, and Special Ed. The Three -Level Hierarchical Linear Model Level 1 (Student level): PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e60 ARTSEL - 47 = proficiency outcome (1 = proficient; 0 = not proficient) for the i th student in the jth classroom in the k th school on the state test. = the covariate-adjusted mean of student outcome in classroom j in school k. Level-2 (Classroom Model): 00 = covariate-adjusted mean outcome for school k. 00 is the covariate-adjusted mean outcome for school k Level-3 (School Model): 000= covariate -adjusted mean outcome occurring across control schools 001= impact of the proposed professional development model on the outcome. =error term for school k. A Wald-chi-square-test will be conducted to test the null hypothesis of no treatment impact, using a .05-level criterion, when a single confirmatory contrast is tested within a domain. When testing multiple confirmatory contrasts in the same domain, we will apply a Benjamini- Hochberg adjustment. A positive and statistically significant estimate of 001 will indicate that there is evidence that the proposed professional development model has a positi ve effect on the targeted outcome. The evaluation aligns with established practices and strategies the evaluation team has used successfully in numerous US Department of Education programs and school district level evaluation studies. This adherence to best practices and successful experience make it suitable for replication or testing in other settings. PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e61 ARTSEL - 48 Conclusion The ARTSEL proposal is a bold and innovative opportunity to integrate the arts, social- emotional learning, and creative education. The proposal uses extensive research to implement what the CDC recommends as we move into post- pandemic education as well as w hat works in meeting educational and social -emotional needs. The whole-school approach recognizes the community of supportive providers who contribute to a child's wellbeing. Children across the country long for creative experiences in emotionally supportive schools. Rural schools serve as the center, the heart of the community.

As the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, one of my main priorities is to increase equitable \u00b7access to well-rounded educational programs and services for all students, particularly those facing barriers to accessing a range of courses and those in need of academic and social and emotional learning (SEL) supports. The California Department of Education (COE) supports the whole school/whole child approach of ArtSEL; the inclusion of families; and professional learning for teachers, administrators, and classified staff with a focus on arts and SEL. Specifically, the skills or strategies mastered through bi-annual collaborative teaching cycles encourage collaboration, planning, in-class modeling, and debrief sessions to support arts and SEL instruction. The \"Tier 1\" connection to a Multi-tiered System of Support approach supports high-quality creative education strategies that boost student engagement, creative thinking, higher order thinking, and SEL integrated with the arts. The project goals are consistent with these priorities, particularly for the rural communities that Humboldt County Office of Education serves. The success of the prior grant awarded in 2018 is a testament to the impact and sustainability of this project . The COE looks forward to supporting the ArtSEL project to positively impact our state's rural youth in a time of great need. If you have any questions regarding this subject, please contact Aileen Allison-Zarea, Education Administrator, Educator Excellence and Equity Divi~ion, by email at Sincerely, Tony Thurmond TT:sp PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e117 Recommendation Letter for Humboldt County Office of Education United States Department of Education Assistance for Arts Education (AAE ) Grant Program February 9, 2021 To whom it may concern, It is my pleasure to write a letter of recommendation for Humboldt County Office of Education (HCOE) who is applying for the U.S. Department of Education Ar ts Assistance for Arts Education (AAE) Grant Program competition. Humboldt has a long history in leadership in arts education and has been an active participant in the California County Superintendents Educational Services Association (CCSESA) Statewide Arts Initiative, CREATE CA, and ongoing work with the California Department of Education. Stacy Young, Visual and Performing Arts Program Manager and Region 1 Arts Lead for CCSESA Statewide Initiative, is a proven leader with remarkable talents and managerial strengths. She is extremely organized and very competent in overseeing grants and initiatives. As a state an regional arts leader, she continues to be active in arts education policy and implementation and serves on the state Curriculum and Instruction Steering Committee as a member of the Arts Subcommittee for California. Through her lead ership, HCOE has been effective in providing professional development and other technical assistance to schools in rural communities and sharing pedagogies and resources to support teachers and administrators of disadvantaged students. Stacy's quality wor k has been featured in many statewide programs and institutes in the last several years, attesting to her competence, achievement, and leadership. She brings a deep knowledge of the arts disciplines and a commitment to ongoing professional learning and dev elopment that has been heralded by arts and education leaders in our state.

Stacy represents HCOE in a statewide leadership advisory for CCSESA Rural Arts Network (CRAN) and continues to work toward increasing educators' expertise to increase access to standards -based arts education and in interdisciplinary models that integrate the arts. Through her many efforts, she continues to work toward building teacher and student expertise in the arts and has worked with many diverse communities including those that are located within the boundaries of the Hupa Indian Reservation, in the mountains along the scenic Trinity River, in northwestern California. With this grant submission, Stacy will be working to create an all -school approach that reinforces the connections to Social and Emotional Learning and the arts through ongoing profe ssional development for teachers, administrators , and classified staff. The prospective program will PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e118 impact school -wide communities and provide a multipronged effort to work in school districts over a four -year period . Through proven curricular modules and other methodologies developed by Stacy Young, and other state and regional leaders, the work of CCSESA's Creativity at the Core and other substantive arts education resources will also be accessed and used representing collaborative work of county offices of education and arts organizations' contributions from across the state. When I think of the powerful collaboration of these individuals, I believe this work will yield incredible change in areas that need it the most. Through focused offerings and technical assistance, the grant will provide leverage and support to educators through well -orchestrated, standards -based programs and offerings.

Humboldt County Office of Education (HCOE) has been a leader in CA by integrating arts education with social- emotional learning. Stacy Young, Visual and Performing Arts Program Manager and Region 1 Arts Lead for CCSESA Statewide Initiative, and Bill Funkhouser, MFA, Arts Learning Specialist, Coordinator, Region 1 Arts and Creativity Initiative (ACI), Humboldt County Arts Lead, CCSESA have been active members of our ten-county Northern CA Social -Emotional Learning (SEL) Community of Practice. Monthly, Bill and/or Stacy have been leading us in an arts -social- emotional learning integrated activity , building the collective capacity of over 30 county office leaders to understand how to leverage high quality creative education strategies to engage and develop social and emotional competencies and capacities in adults . Leaders in the Northern CA SEL Community of Practice receive slide decks and facilitator guides for each strategy, thus, building our ability to integrate art and SEL within the context of meetings and professional learning experiences for educators within this large northern CA region. Stacy Young and Bill Funkhouser are proven leaders in Art and SEL , with exemplary professional development and facilitation skills. Their skills in writing and overseeing grants and initiatives has made Humboldt County a l eader in arts education and underscores their ability to lead a multi -year, multi -school grant that includes creating strong foundational knowledge in educators for Art/SEL, then supporting teachers in infusing Art/SEL lessons within their classrooms, and finally, expanding to theatre arts and lesson creation. With a continued coaching component, the capacity built in teachers and school leaders during the grant period is sure to be sustainable over time, positively impacting hundreds if not thousands of yo uth and educators. This grant is sure to provide leverage and support to educators through well -orchestrated, standards -based , creative and innovative programs and offerings. An additional benefit will be to the ten county offices participating in the Nort hern CA SEL Community of Practice. The proven curricular modules and methodologies already developed and shared by Stacy Young PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e121 and Bill Funkhouser has had a profound impact on all county office leaders, and the new artful thinking strategies, adult and student SEL components will have an even larger impact as they are shared with other leaders across the region. I strongly support this grant application and recommend that Humboldt County Office of Education be considered for this amazing opportunity. Pleas e feel free to contact me with any questions or for additional information.

As a long-time and passionate advocate of the arts, I strongly support the ARTSEL proposal. A whole school approach, where students learn and internalize foundationalskills in arts, intergrated with other curricular areas, increases learning and retention. Offering creative education, discrete and integrated arts education, SEL, and MTSS as a tier 1 strategy for all students for four years will prepare them for higher education and productive lives. I am the Executive Director and co-founder of the Ink People Center for the Arts. As well as being a professional artist, I have over 40 years of nonprofit administrative experience. I received my BA, MA and Teaching Credential in art from Humboldt State University, Arcata. I am a consultant in nonprofit management and program development. Our DreamMaker program, has fostered over 300 community-initiated projects in the past 32 years and currently manages over 100 self-directing projects. Previously, I participated in creating the Humboldt County Office of Education's startegic arts plan. Our teaching artists are grateful for the ability to work in local schools under the coordination of Stacy Young, Visual & Performing Arts Program Manager, Project Director, Region 1 Arts & Creativity Initiative (ACI), and Region 1 Arts Lead, CCSESA. ARTSEL, in using a whole school approach, will include 45 hours of professional development for teachers, 12 hours for administrators, and 6 hours for all classified staff annually. We are excited to see such a progressive approach taken in Humboldt. The Ink People offers to assist in any way possible, from referring vetted teaching artists to meeting attendance and evaluation assistance. We have developed deep and trusting relationships with diverse cultural groups in the county over many years and may be able to serve as a bridge in reaching out.

As a rural community with one of the state's highest populations of children with multiple ACEs, we believe SEL to be a crucial part of a healthy community. The pandemic has only increased this need in our schools. As a high school art teacher, I have seen the need for Social Emotional Learning sky-rocket over the last few years. The percent of students who struggle with anxiety and depression, especially, and who need assistance in managing these issues have increased so much that our school is also planning to incorporate SEL into our curriculum. The proposed grant will include one or more of our feeder schools which would allow us to build upon the foundation that the grant will create. I have worked with Stacy Young on numerous projects throughout the years and attended many events she has overseen. One of the largest projects that I have worked on with Stacy is the Humboldt County Strategic Arts Plan. During the development of that plan, Stacy showed herself to be knowledgeable, a good listener, and an inclusive leader. Arcata Arts Institute students were welcomed and included in the planning meetings and their input was valued in the creation of this important document. Her yearly Arts Symposiums are well organized, meticulously planned, and always worth the attendee's time. As part of my duties as the director of the Arcata Arts Institute, I host a yearly demonstration day to showcase our program, which has been deemed to be a Model Arts, Media and Entertainment Demonstration Site by the California Department of Education. Stacy has been supportive of this program in the past, serving on our community partner panels, and we have collaborated to bring a more robust and varied program to attendees. I consider myself lucky to be able to collaborate with her when our mutual goals allow. I am certain that Stacy will lead this newly proposed Social Emotional Learning program with the professionalism, competency, and energy that she brings to her other responsibilities. The Arcata Arts Institute will continue to support and work with Stacy and the Humboldt County Office of Education during this new grant in any way we can. Sincerely, Johanna Mauro - Director, Arcata Arts Institute & Art teacher at Arcata High School PR/Award # S351A210056 Page e132 March 1 , 2021 Dr. Christopher Hartley, Superintendent Humboldt County Schools Humboldt Office of Education 901 Myrtle Avenue Eureka, CA 95501 Dear Dr. Hartley, As you are well aware, the Eureka Symphony has successfully partnered for years with HCOE via our Schools to Symphony and Musicians to Schools programs , each year providing Humboldt County elementary school child ren the unique and inspiring cultural experience of listening to a live symphony or small Eureka Symphony musician ensembles in their school assembly halls or classrooms. I have said it before and it remains a truth, g etting up to 1,500 school kids to the Arkley Center for Performing Arts for a special symphony concert is no easy task, but between the Eureka Symphony, the Arkley staff, Stacy Young and the participating teachers , it happens yearly (except, sadly, during a pandemic). After the Schools to Symphony concert, students excitedly talk about the instruments that struck their fancy during the \"Meet the Orchestra\" intro or how much they liked a particular musician or how plush the Arkley seats were. Reading the notes and seeing the drawings that many of the students send afterwards, help me to remain sure that this is a positive, engaging and eye -opening experience for them. As always, more can be done. It's my understanding that an application is being made for an AAE grant that focuses on Arts and SEL that includes professional development for teachers, admin and classified staff to be used in a whole school approach over a 4 -year time frame. This development would be exciting and invigorating for everyone and surely enliven the classroom for students in such a way to broaden their perspectives even more so. I wholeheartedly support such development and hope that in some way the Eureka Symphony can help in some way to have music be an even larger part of our local schoolchildren's education as a result.
