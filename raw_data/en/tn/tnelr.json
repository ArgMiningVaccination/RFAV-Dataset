The printable manual is 600 pages long and filled with loads of easy-to-follow recipes, herbal medicinal uses, and gorgeous close-up photos for plant identification. In fact, most of our plant profiles contain more detail than you'll find in any book on wild foods and herbs. Throughout the course, you'll befriend the most common edible and medicinal wayside plants, including dandelion, stinging nettles, violet, yarrow, burdock, rose, goldenrod, and many more. Plus, you'll receive the foundational ground rules of foraging safety and ethics, and then dive deep into botany and plant identification. Before you know it, you'll have the skills and confidence to safely identify and harvest wild plants. If you're curious about foraging, we recommend one of the first things you do is cultivate an ethos centered on sustainability and reciprocity. See our article on [Foraging for Wild Edibles and Herbs](https://chestnutherbs.com/foraging-for-wild-edibles-and-herbs-sustainable-and-safe-gathering-practices/) for more on this. Next, set yourself up with a stack of great foraging guides (see the resources listed below). These resources are highly applicable in most temperate climates and are generalist resources. Some of these only cover wild foods and don't explore medicinal plants, whereas others explore both. These books are best accompanied by a regional field guide or two to help you round out your identification. Apprenticing yourself to a seasoned forager is another fantastic option. We offer our mentorship to you in our 375-hour [Online Foraging Course: Edible and Medicinal Wild Herbs](https://chestnutherbs.com/online-herbal-classes/online-foraging-course-edible-and-medicinal-wild-herbs). You can also check out our [Online Herbal Immersion](https://chestnutherbs.com/online-herbal-classes/herbal-immersion-program/), which features an entire module on foraging, and the wild foods section of our [blog](https://chestnutherbs.com/category/foods/). Note that we don't receive any compensation for promoting the books on this list\u2014they are simply our personal favorites. Plenty of fantastic field guides and wild foods books didn't make it into this post\u2014there are so many to choose from! You can also check out our features on [regional wild food books](https://chestnutherbs.com/the-best-regional-books-for-plant-identification-and-foraging-wild-foods-and-herbs/) and our top picks for [free online foraging resources](https://chestnutherbs.com/the-top-herbal-and-foraging-blogs-podcasts-and-youtube-channels/). - - ACCESSING BOOKS: We recommend purchasing from small and/or BIPOC-owned bookstores whenever possible. Here is one list of [Black-owned bookstores](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/83495-black-owned-bookstores-to-support-now.html), many of which offer an online store. Some books on this list may be more difficult to find and/or be more expensive, since they are offered by smaller publishing houses with smaller print runs. For tips on affordably accessing books, visit our [Herbal Books Hub](https://chestnutherbs.com/our-favorite-herbalism-books/). *Titles by BIPOC authors or co-authors (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) are written in purple. - - 1. Every Book on Foraging by Samuel Thayer Thayer's books are hands-down the best resources on wild foods, being enjoyable to read and very informational. If you can only purchase a book or two to get started, we suggest beginning with his guides. Thayer's books apply widely in the United States and Canada and include many plants found elsewhere in the temperate world. (Note: Thayer does not discuss medicinal uses). The Forager's Harvest: A Guide to Identifying, Harvesting, and Preparing Edible Wild Plants by Samuel Thayer Thayer shares detailed material on plant identification (accompanied by color photos) and food preparation, along with entertaining anecdotal stories. He specifically emphasizes wild foods and doesn't discuss medicinal properties; however, his books are valuable field guides for identifying many herbs that straddle the food-medicine divide (elderberry, for example). Highly recommended. Nature's Garden: A Guide to Identifying, Harvesting, and Preparing Edible Wild Plants by Samuel Thayer This is the companion guide to Thayer's The Forager's Harvest, featuring a fresh collection of plants. Equally essential and recommended. Incredible Wild Edibles: 36 Plants That Can Change Your Life by Samuel Thayer Incredible Wild Edibles is styled in a similar fashion to Thayer's other books but covers a completely new selection of herbs, roots, nuts, and berries. (Note: Thayer does not discuss medicinal uses.) Sam Thayer's Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants of Eastern and Central North America by Samuel Thayer An amazing foraging field guide that covers an impressive 679 edible species (although each species is discussed in less detail than in his previous books). The book is organized by plant groups based on botanical features and also includes range maps, gorgeous color photos, an excellent poisonous plants section, and Sam's trademark humor. Truly an indispensable foraging reference! You can purchase Thayer's books directly and check out his website [here](https://www.foragersharvest.com/#/). - 2. Foraging & Feasting: A Field Guide and Wild Food Cookbook by Dina Falconi, illustrated by Wendy Hollender We treasure this book for its beautiful illustrations and delicious recipes. It's easily our most reached-for wild foods cookbook. The book is divided into two main parts: botanical drawings paired with key identification tips, followed by a bounty of herbal, wild foods recipes. Many of the recipes are flexible for a variety of diets\u2014gluten free, dairy free, sugar free, raw\u2014and Dina includes an array of master recipes that can be adapted to different plants throughout the seasons. There's also a brief medicinal discussion of each herb as well as some nutritional tidbits. Many of the featured plants are common in the herb garden (elderberry, rose, bee balm, etc.), so this is an excellent resource for the gardener and forager alike. If you love Dina's recipes, you can catch more of them in our Online Foraging Course\u2014she's a contributor! You can purchase her book and access her blog via [Botanical Arts Press](http://www.botanicalartspress.com/). - 3. Edible Wild Plants: Wild Foods from Dirt to Plate by John Kallas This is one of the finest books on wild edible greens, with thorough species descriptions, beautiful photographs, nutritional profiles, and lots of recipes. Wild greens are an abundant food source in nearly all temperate places\u2014including cities\u2014so this book is a valuable resource for foragers everywhere. Kallas himself is a botanist, teacher, nutritionist, and wild foods expert who has foraged throughout the United States, Canada, and the European countryside. We appreciate that the book covers fewer plants in greater depth, which is more helpful than superficially covering hundreds of plants. This book focuses on identifying and harvesting wild foods; it doesn't explore medicinal uses. More about John's work can be found on his [Wild Food Adventures](https://wildfoodadventures.com) website. - 4. Identifying and Harvesting Edible and Medicinal Plants by \"Wildman\" Steve Brill and Evelyn Dean You can gather an immense amount of wild food knowledge from this book. Over 500 edible and medicinal plants are organized by harvesting season, with identifying characteristics, detailed preparation information, and beautiful line drawings to accompany each one. This was one of the first books on foraging Juliet owned, she's learned more about wild foods from this book than any other. In the back of the book, you'll find a collection of Steve's recipes. You can purchase the book and visit Steve's blog [here](https://www.wildmanstevebrill.com/). - 5. Native Harvests: American Indian Wild Foods and Recipes by E. Barrie Kavasch A well-rounded book featuring recipes with wild plants commonly found in temperate climates. Also includes information about Native American medicinal and ceremonial plant uses, as well as guidance on plant identification and poisonous plants. Beautifully illustrated by the author. - 6. Ugly Little Greens: Gourmet Dishes Crafted from Foraged Ingredients by Mia Wasilevich There's nothing ugly about this book, which spoofs on the common misconceptions about weeds. It's packed with fancy wild food recipes and sumptuous color photos. Many of the recipes are easy to prepare, but in general, this book is ideal for the epicurean forager, with dishes like nettles benedict and cattail pollen madeleines. Not just limited to greens, it features a diverse collection of plants that grow in most temperate to subtropical climates. The book blends plant identification with preparation but dials in on the recipe side of things. Therefore, it's best accompanied by a field guide that features a lot of identification. We're excited that Mia is a recipe contributor in the Foraging Course! - 7. Wild Food: A Complete Guide For Foragers by Roger Phillips This wonderful classic was written by a British family who spent time in North America, camping and preparing wild foods and drinks. A wide range of wild edibles are covered, including mushrooms, herbs, seaweeds, flowers, roots, greens, nuts, and berries. The book features loads of simple recipes accompanied by sublimely staged photos of wild foods dishes in their native habitat. (Think glamping, with a wild foods twist.) Be sure to purchase the 1986 edition of this book, which is affordable to purchase used, and offers more recipes and species profiles than the newer edition. - 8. Wild Remedies: How to Forage Healing Foods and Craft Your Own Herbal Medicine by Rosalee de la For\u00eat and Emily Han This book explores the benefits of two dozen common wild plants\u2014many of which can be grown in the garden for those who aren't called to foraging. Includes seventy-five tasty recipes and instructions for preparing remedies, plus detailed illustrations and beautiful photography to help with plant identification. - 9. The Wild Wisdom of Weeds: 13 Essential Plants for Human Survival by Katrina Blair We love the spirit of this book. It covers fewer plants than your average field guide but takes you on a deep journey of discovery with each one. It includes edible and medicinal uses for many of the most common weeds found worldwide in the temperate climate, along with ethnobotanical information. Some tips on identification are included, but we recommend using a field guide along with her descriptions to make sure you have the right plant. This is a great resource for both urban and rural dwellers. You can order the book [here](http://turtlelakerefuge.bigcartel.com/product/wild-wisdom-of-weeds-13-essential-plants-for-human-survival). - 10. The New Wildcrafted Cuisine: Exploring the Exotic Gastronomy of Local Terroir by Pascal Baudar Baudar's book is truly groundbreaking, with delectable imagery and recipes that push the edge of even wild cuisine (edible insects, for example). In this light, we recommend his book for the curious cook, or for anyone wanting to take their wild food dishes to the next level. Arranged by season, the book balances progressive recipes with traditional preparations; lots of pictorial how-to's feature fermentation and food preservation. Most plants in the book can be found throughout the temperate world, but others are found only in Mediterranean climates. This is a gorgeous book that is sure to spice up wild food conversation. You can read more about Pascal [here](http://www.urbanoutdoorskills.com/books.html). - 11. *100 Edible Mushrooms by Michael Kuo Engaging to read, Kuo's book features a hundred of the most common edible mushrooms and includes color photos, edibility ratings, descriptions, poisonous relatives and look-alikes, and a recipe section in the back of the book. Not exactly a pocket guide, but small enough to accompany you into the field. Juliet's favorite foraging book on wild mushrooms for beginners. - 12. Discovering Wild Plants: Alaska, Western Canada, the Northwest by Janice Schofield Eaton Don't let the title of this book put you off\u2014it's relevant to temperate climates around the world and is a superb foraging field guide. The book covers 147 wild plants, detailing their identification, range, traditional and contemporary uses, and medicinal properties. Each plant is accompanied by photographs and line drawings. The book is currently out of print, making used copies a bit more expensive than other field guides, but it's so good that it still made our list! - 13. Do yourself a favor and also read: Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer This book will grow your heart and soul, and we recommend it to absolutely everyone. Though not technically about foraging, Kimmerer's writing on our relationship to land, food, medicine, and legacy will change how you live and forage. Prepare yourself for incredible storytelling, immense beauty, and possibly a lot of heartfelt tears. Do you have a favorite wild foods book that didn't make it onto our list? We'd love to hear about it (including any regional guides that you enjoy)! There are so many wonderful books on this subject that we couldn't include them all here. However, we give a shout-out to even more wild food and medicine resources on the blog.
