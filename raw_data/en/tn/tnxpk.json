However, some herbs infuse better in one form over the other. - Some of the most common Herbal Oils include Calendula, St, John's Wort, and Comfrey Herbal Oils. HISTORICAL USES OF HERBAL OILS Herbal Oils were concocted and used for thousands of years due to their medicinal, anti-aging, and cosmetic purposes. Historical uses of Herbal Oils can be found in several ancient cultures, including the use of St. John's Wort Oil in Roman civilization in 400 BC. Having harvested around the summer solstice, the St. John's Wort flowers were soaked in Virgin Olive Oil to extract any healing properties. Once the oil was filtered, it was used to soothe burn pains. In medieval Persia, Herbal Oils were also valued for their medical and pharmaceutical uses. In Bondahesh, a Sassanid Pahlavi manuscript that is considered one of the most important documents categorized all plant species into 11 groups, including oily herbs that were identified by their oily seeds. The application of Herbal Oils and Extracts for medicinal purposes is believed to have originated in Traditional Chinese, Indian, and Egyptian medicine. Although modern health care disregards the healing benefits of Herbal Oils, these cultures continue to pass on these rituals down to new generations. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HERBAL OILS AND ESSENTIAL OILS? Herbal Oils and Essential Oils are often mistaken for one another. Due to their emollient, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiseptic constituents, both Herbal Oils and Essential Oils have a place in natural skin care, hair care, and cosmetics. However, the different extraction methods between the two types of oils contribute to their unique characteristics and performance abilities. As the more common oil type, Essential Oils are the essence of the plant condensed into an oil. It is distilled by extracting the oil component of a plant that contains the highest concentration of specific properties. For this reason, Essential Oils are typically recommended to be used in small doses. Herbal Oils are produced by marinating the chosen dried or fresh herb in a carrier oil, such as Olive Oil, and applying gentle heat over a period and is separated by filtration or decantation. Many of the medicinal qualities of the leaves, stems, and roots are released into the oils. Herbal Oils are typically used externally and are incorporated in natural skin and hair care products. Essential Oils refer to the \"essence\" of the plant, closely mimicking the smell, taste, and color. The high concentration rate of Essential Oils tends to trigger sensitivities in many people. Since Herbal Oils are [herb-infused Oils](/products/herbal-oils/), they are far less concentrated, making them safe to use for those who have adverse reactions to Essential Oils.
