Founded 1896. Just like any other profession in the 19th and early 20th centuries, women in medicine struggled for the right to formal education and recognition as professionals.Even in the field of homeopathy, which was considered 'eclectic,' early women physicians had to put forth a great deal of effort if they wanted to be acknowledged as their male counterparts were.In Philadelphia, the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania (later Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania) was the first school to grant women medical degrees; it was founded in 1850.Several other medical colleges which awarded degrees to women soon followed, in Boston, New York, and Chicago. However, formal homeopathic training was even harder to come by - there were only two schools by 1870, one in New York and one in Cleveland, which allowed women to study homeopathy and earn degrees or certificates.At the Homeopathic Medical College of Pennsylvania (which merged with Hahnemann Medical College of Philadelphia in 1871), women were repeatedly turned down for admission, although they were granted the right to attend lectures in 1865 - provided they sat behind screens. It was common practice for women in the early days of homeopathy to receive medical degrees from schools such as the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia) or New England Female Medical College (Boston), and then move to Chicago, Cleveland, Baltimore, or Boston, where they could receive formal training in homeopathic medicine. We have been working on compiling a list of resources from our collections - and some from elsewhere - about the brave early women homeopaths.You can find our subject guide at [ Early Women in Homeopathy Resources](<a href=).
