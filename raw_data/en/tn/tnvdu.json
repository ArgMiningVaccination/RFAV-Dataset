Add to this mothers who are homeschooling during the pandemic, taking care of families and households, and working as doctors of chiropractic or business leaders, and the stress can be overwhelming. It is overwhelming. Finding support \"In our Women Chiropractors Facebook group we connected continually as we never before have,\" writes Cynthia Shaft-Toll, DC, FPAC, founder of the Women Chiropractors (Wdc) group, in this issue. \"Most of the 8,200 Wdcs were in there asking ques - tions of each other about how to respond to this world event multiple times a day.\" Support during this time is crucial. Both for patients and doctors of chiropractic. Whether it's same-gender or same-race, statistics show that patients are more comfortable and seek out doctors they think understand or \"get them.\" That makes it difficult for the roughly 60% of chiropractic patients who are women who might prefer a woman chiropractor, especially when dealing with pregnancy or specific issues, when only 20-25% of chiropractors in the U.S. are women. Women and DCs of color Along racial lines it's even more difficult for women and all DCs of color. According to the report \"Advancing Diversity as We Advance the Chiropractic Profession\" from the American Black Chiropractic Association (ABCA) in 2019, \"The chiropractic profession continues to lack diversity. Racially, the profession continues to be overwhelmingly white (92%), with just 2.3% black.\" Which means black women chiropractors make up the minority of that 2.3%. The ABCA notes that \"The profession is also underrepresented by Hispanic, Asian, and Native Americans.\" These minorities combined make up more than 25% of the general U.S. population, but less than 1/3 of that percentage serve as DCs, according to the report. How can U.S. chiropractors serve a diverse patient population without a diverse population of DCs? The report \"Advancing Diversity as We Advance the Chiropractic Profession\" goes on to note, \"Close [chiropractic] contact requires development of a level of trust that racial tensions may impede.\" That level of trust From governments down to police forces to health care workers and chiropractors, there must be that level of trust. When there isn't, tensions can build and explode \u2014 or in the case of health care or chiropractic, patients simply stay away. Women numbering 60% of chiropractic patients is a prime opportunity to put more resources into place to make doctors of chiropractic reflect their patient population in practice. It starts in the schools, which are addressing these issues. NWHSU has the dedicated forum \"The League of Chiropractic Women\" along with the \"Be Bold Women's Group.\" \"Some estimates state that 75-80% of practicing chiropractors today are male,\" writes Tolu Oyelowa, professor and department chair at Northwestern Health Sciences University, in this issue. \"Universities, health care organizations and private practices must make deliberate efforts to mentor, recruit and inspire the next generation of women and minorities.\" Between now and next year's Women's Health issue we'll continue to measure the health of women DCs and patients, and how we're coming together to make a difference.

ChiroEco.com/wfc-2022Scientists find brain center that 'profoundly' shuts down pain A Duke University research team has found a small area of the brain in mice that can profoundly control the animals' sense of pain \u2014 turning it off, not on. This brain center is located in the amygdala, which is often considered the home of negative emotions and responses, like the fight-or-flight response and general anxiety. \"Most of the previous studies have focused on which regions are turned on by pain,\" said senior author Fan Wang. \"But there are so many regions processing pain, you'd have to turn them all off to stop pain. Whereas this one center can turn off the pain by itself.\" ChiroEco.com/pain-centerFoot Levelers creates local media outreach for chiropractors Foot Levelers encourages you, the chiropractor, to spread the word about your treatments and how they are part of the solution to the opioid epidemic.

This is an opportunity to educate your community about how your services \u2014 including your adjustments and Foot Levelers custom orthotics \u2014 can help treat so many ailments.

So, how can you optimize Instagram to help grow your practice? A few ideas for Instagram content: Virtual office tour: Run a series of posts that introduce you and your staff, as well as give a virtual tour of your office. This is a great way for potential patients to not only put a face with a name, but to feel as though they already know a little bit about you. Keep it fun and casual. A virtual office tour or short videos of your staff talking about their jobs, or photos of you and your staff doing volunteer or community work, could be great Instagram stories. Free stuff: Offer discount codes for services, giveaways of supplements or skin products, or even partner with another business to offer freebies. One note of caution: carefully read any rules Instagram has regarding contest posts, so that you do not violate terms of service. Healthy living tips: These little nuggets are meant to spark interest in other services you may provide. For example, you can have a graphic that lists five healthy after-school snacks for kids, with a link to your website for further information. You can then have a blog entry that elaborates further on the topic and your services in that regard. Such posts should be kept simple, with either a plain background or one graphic image, and easy-to-read text. The perfect picture, posted on Instagram, can be just what you need to drive more business to your practice. \u2014 Tina Beychok For more social marketing ideas, visit the Business Tips section of chiroeco.com.Each month we'll ask a new question on our Facebook page.

Many chiropractic offices in my area were shut down for over 2 months. I have 3 associates a nd for May of 2020, their income was 76% of 2019, not bad. My staff said this is due to the nutrition and lab work we do. (Several SBN members did even better!) Less than 10% of our Chiropractic business is adjusting at my clinic in Dayton, Ohio. How did we do it? My DC nutrition business is based on the Science Based Nutrition system. I'm Dr. Van Merkle, the developer and inventor of Science Based Nutrition (SBN). This is an innovative, science - based look at nutritional strengths and weaknesses through an individual's blood te st as well as other objective diagnostic tools. This approach can offer a clear plan for determining and monitoring nutritional recommendations. While chiropractic has suffered, nutrition has not! You might have looked at SBN or maybe you were a previous SBN member but it wasn't for you then. Maybe you ought to look closer now. There are many new things that SBN has to offer that make doing online nutrition work easier than ever. Most SBN members are doing online phone consults and ROF's. SBN members can order lab work online through SBN and get the best lab discounts. Test results are automatically uploaded to their patient portal through SBN's patented, computerized laboratory reporting system. The most comprehensive, patient friendly, state of the art analysis, color coded report will then be created. The SBN is offering a NEW ONE DAY WORKSHOP. We will train you how to use the SBN program, implement the system, market this new service, process patients and demonstrate how to do phone consults, plus have a successful cash practice. New SBN members will have an account set up in SBN so that they will actually use and learn on their own computer. THIS IS NOT A CEU COURSE. This is for doctors who are serious about adding SBN to their practice. This one -day workshop is just $50.00 to attend. Sign up early because seats will go fast.

The statement reads, in part: \"The death of George Floyd is inexcusable. At the same time our country struggles to heal from the primary and secondary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the events surrounding Mr. Floyd's death in Minneapolis force us to publicly face the harsh reality that minority groups are still burdened by racism and oppression, which destroys lives and well-being in a way that no virus can match...Sadly, the racism we have witnessed in the news over the past few weeks is a symptom of something much deeper. It is the most visible sign of a problem within the systems that affect our daily lives, such as education, government and, most certainly, health care. ACA is committed to alleviating health care disparities by helping our members to understand and meet the needs of the diverse populations they serve.\" The ACA Committee on Equity, Diversity and Inclusion has worked on several initiatives to raise awareness among doctors of chiropractic of the need for increased education and sensitivity toward ethnic and cultural differences. The Committee drafted a Diversity Statement in December 2018 that acknowledges the important role that cultural competency plays in chiropractic's ability to deliver quality health care, improve patient outcomes and engage in public health initiatives. \"As health care providers, and as citizens, we must acknowledge the dignity and value of every person. Only by doing so can our communities achieve authentic health and wellness,\" said ACA President Robert C. Jones, DC. The American Black Chiropractic Association also published an open letter to members and students, condemning the actions that led to George Floyd's death. It reads, in part: \"As doctors working in communities that treat a majority of people of color, we are reminded that racism is still deeply rooted in our society. We are seeing patients that have a roller coaster of emotions from outrage, distrust, anger, frustration, and sadness. \"As doctors of chiropractic, our mission is to improve the overall health of our patients. \"Sadly, we are having to deal with chronic emotional stress before we address the very reason they come to our offices. \"The ABCA realizes we have a special place in the history of chiropractic, just as African- Americans have a special place in the history of this country. Despite those that do not see diversity as the beauty of our country, our organization is determined to make sure we do our part in developing strong doctors to be leaders in an emerging multicultural health care system. With the COVID-19 pandemic that has plagued our world and more specifically communities of color, the need for diversity in our health care system has become more evident. \"The ABCA recognizes that to have change, there must be a change agent. It is our hope that the current international protests of Mr. Floyd's death brings needed change to many American systems, but especially, our law enforcement. We have a familiar passage in chiropractic that says, 'Symptoms are only the tip of the iceberg and we must treat the underlying cause.' We see the underlying cause of disparities in health care, education, government, and law enforcement as systemic racism...[which ]has no place in our culture. \"The ABCA is encouraging our members to have healthy conversations with our patients about their mental health during these challenging times. We also encourage our members to seek positions of leadership within our professional associations and educational institutions to promote cultural diversity, inclusion, and equity.\" To read both organizations' statements in full, visit acatoday.org and abcachiro.com. 14 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 13, 2020 CHIROECO.COM\"THOUGH IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES, THE PRACTICE OF TELEHEALTH IS SEEING A MOMENT IN THE SUN LIKE NEVER BEFORE AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC.\" \u2014 SHERRY MCALLISTER, DC, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE FOUNDATION FOR CHIROPRACTIC PROGRESS, WRITING IN FORBES MAGAZINESCHOOL NEWS CUKC invests in advanced technology to drive education, research BY THE NUMBERS: THE WOMEN'S ISSUE Students attending Cleveland University-Kansas City's (CUKC) College of Chiropractic are now using new and innovative technology that is redefining the landscape of chiropractic education. CUKC has recently integrated a Technique Simulation Lab experience into the doctor of chiropractic curriculum. The lab includes Force Sensing Table Technology (FSTT), a Cox 8 force-sensing table, and many training aids for assessing the outcome of motor skills learning. Chiropractic students gain valuable and continued experience in the simulation lab starting at the beginning of the academic program, as this new technology has proven to be an effective teaching tool for developing the motor skills fundamental to chiropractic technique and practice. To enhance the development of the skills used by students to deliver a chiropractic manual adjustment, a specific form of spinal manipulation, the FSTT integrates force plate technology and handheld sensors to measure force. This force- sensing technology provides instantaneous data on the mechanical loads of the chiropractic manual thrust that the student applies to a mannequin that anatomically simulates a human torso, head and neck. The technology offers immediate objective feedback about the amplitude and velocity of the student's manual thrust through a digitally displayed force- time profile. These forces can be directly quantified and compared to the force-time profiles of experienced clinicians. This comparison assists the student in achieving the desired outcome. \"The FSTT has been a game changer for faculty, as it elevates the instruction and learning process and delivers a level of specificity and student motor skill development never seen before,\" said Dean of the College of Chiropractic Jon Wilson, DC, MS.\"The chiropractic profession is currently made up of a majority of male practitioners, which is contrary to the percentage of chiropractic patients, typically estimated to be about 60% female.\" \u2014 Diversity in the Chiropractic Profession: Preparing for 2050 CHIROECO.COM JULY 13, 2020 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 15Reduction in labor times for first-time mothers who received chiropractic care Source: Fallon J., The Effect of Chiropractic Treatment on Pregnancy and Labor: A comprehensive studyMabel Palmer published the pamphlet \"A Woman's Appeal to Women\" when she encouraged women to consider a career in chiropractic Source: library.palmer.eduWomen DC respondents in the 2020 Chiropractic Economics Salary & Expense Survey, the most of any previous year Source: 2020 Chiropractic Economics Salary & Expense Survey Women members of the Women Chiropractic (Wdc) Facebook group Source: WdcThe first licensed chiropractor in Canada Musk's great-grandmother Source: chiro.org28% 24%1st 8,200 +1920PROFITABLE PRACTICE GI Flora Balance Program GI Flora Balance Program from Standard Process and MediHerb pairs MediHerb's Gut Flora Complex with Standard Process' Prebiotic Inulin to help rebalance gut flora and support gut health, an essential part of overall health and well-being.

Pfeifer, appointed at the end of February, oversees Logan's campus-based health professions programs, including the College of Chiropractic and the Montgomery Health Center. He most recently served the University of Western States (UWS) in Portland, Ore., where he held the positions of vice president of clinic affairs and chief clinical excellence officer. With more than 20 years of experience as a practicing chiropractic physician, Pfeifer earned a post-professional certification from the Academy of Chiropractic Sports Physicians, a diplomate from the American Board of Chiropractic Neurology (DABCN) and a diplomate from the American Chiropractic Academy of Neurology (DACAN). \"The expertise and experience that Dr. Pfeifer brings to Logan will be instrumental in growing and strengthening the College of Chiropractic and Logan's Health Centers,\" said Logan President Clay McDonald, DC, MBA, JD. Diaz, in his new role, will work with content experts, faculty support coordinators, academic technology and other senior academic affairs leaders to establish a clear vision and strategy for curriculum design, development and delivery for Logan's online, hybrid and campus- based programs. He will also implement and manage the new program development process and provide leadership and mentoring to the online program directors. Diaz first joined Logan's team as an independent contractor assisting the university with reimagining the Logan Basic course series for the College of Chiropractic. When the COVID- 19 pandemic caused Logan to quickly transition to 100% online education, Diaz stepped up to the challenge, demonstrating his knowledge, experience and demeanor as a perfect fit . For over 25 years, Diaz has leveraged his education and organizational development background to develop and implement comprehensive learning experiences. \"He is a very positive, motivated and creative team player with a proven track record designing and developing curricula, managing teaching and learning activities in partnership with faculty,\" said Provost Kimberly Paddock- O'Reilly, DHEd, MSW. \"Dr. Diaz is skilled at bringing individuals and groups together to establish solid and collaborative partnerships... and we're thrilled to have him at Logan.\"SCHOOL NEWS Logan University names two new deans L-R: Frank Diaz, EdD; Joseph Pfeifer, DC For additional information, go to the CE products directory at chiroeco.com/products. 16 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 13, 2020 CHIROECO.COM The latest business, safety, health and up-to-date resources for DCs BY CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS STAFF As the statistics continue to pour in regarding the number of infections and fatalities from COVID-19, it is becoming increasingly clear that this pandemic will not only affect how society works as a whole, but also how we approach our health and wellness at an individual level. Chiropractic patients need more than straight adjustments, but addi - tionally an overall wellness check for their physical, and subsequently mental health. Your patients are likely now looking at their health and well-being in an entirely new light. Suddenly, wellness is not just a good idea, but a matter of survival. How have your patients changed how they manage their wellness routines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and how can you support them during this difficult time?Wellness check: immune system Your patients likely already know about the importance of wearing masks while out in public, thoroughly washing their hands and using social distancing practices. . 1 However, they should also know about how they can further bolster their immune system. While many people associate supplements such as vitamin C, elderberry or bone broth with flu season, they can also bolster the immune system against COVID-19.2 You should expect your patients to have questions for you about which supplements are best for bolstering the immune system throughout the year, rather than just during flu season. Trying to do it all We are all accustomed to having a distinct separation between our work and home life. While we are at the office, we are not Coronavirus (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the U.S. and the world, and Americans are being advised by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to remain vigilant and take precautions, particularly social distancing and avoiding unnecessary contact and gatherings, and for personal protection, maintaining a healthy diet and strong immune system.

Unfortunately, that carefully-drawn line between work and home quickly becomes blurred with the current lockdown situation. Trying to put in a full eight hours, while trying to homeschool kids, prepare family meals and keep on top of housework, quickly becomes impossible. As a result, your patients may find themselves run-down, tired and stressed. They may be looking for ways to release that stress, such as yoga or meditation, but something that only takes a small amount of time out of an already busy day. Simple apps that provide reminders to take short breaks for meditation or simple yoga stretches are a great way for your patients to deal with stress, yet still have time for everything else that needs their attention.3 Sticking to an exercise routine For many of your patients, having a regular exercise routine helps them reduce stress, clear their mind and improve their overall mood, and is part of an overall wellness check. With social distancing and lockdown orders in place, they may worry that they will lose that positive motivation to deal with the current crisis. As a result, your patients may be looking for innovative ways to build their exercise into their current daily routine. This may involve such ideas as equipment for a home gym, changing the day or time of exercise so as to encounter fewer people, or exercising outdoors (providing social distancing is enforced). You can help by offering coaching services or building customized exercise routines for your patients. Back pain from patients not used to working at home is also becoming an issue and a matter of expertise for DCs advising patients on how to set up a better chair and desk, and how to keep better posture. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented changes in the fabric of our society. It is vital for DCs to help support their patients with a general wellness check during this difficult time. \u2014 Tina Beychok CORONAVIRUS CENTRAL Webinar On-Demand: Know Your Virome \u2014 immunity, biotics, personalized genetic implications and moreCORONAVIRUS CENTRAL Follow Us on Social Media @ChiroEcoMag @ChiroEcoMag@chiropractic-economics @ChiroEcoMag For the latest COVID-19 info for doctors of chiropractic, including upcoming webinars, updates, resources and articles from Chiropractic Economics, go to chiroeco.com/coronavirus-covid-19.References can be found online at chiroeco.com CHIROECO.COM JULY 13, 2020 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 19 20 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 13, 2020 CHIROECO.COMFEATURE STORY THE TAKEAWAY Women face a number of barriers in making the leap from a graduating doctor of chiropractic to practicing in the field, including shouldering health care in families, caring for children and aging parents, and starting families on top of chiropractic, business and industry demands.WOMEN DCs: MORE SUPPORT SYSTEMS, MENTORSHIP, TAILORED EDUCATION NEEDED Approximately 25% of practicing DCs are women, but women make up roughly 50% of students in schools BY TOLU OYELOWA, DC, PHD TIME TO READ: 7-9 MIN. UNLIKE MANY HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONS IN WESTERN MEDICINE, WOMEN HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE CHIROPRACTIC INDUSTRY SINCE ITS BEGINNING. Although male-dominant, by the end of the 1920s women represented nearly 15% of licensees in Minnesota (what has always been regarded as a health care hub), compared to about 5% in the U.S. And like other STEM fields, the chiropractic care industry is passionate about encouraging and inspiring women to pursue an education in chiropractic and continues to share the multitude of benefits with the broader health care ecosystem. CHIROECO.COM JULY 13, 2020 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 21FEATURE STORY THIS INCLUDES ENSURING EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ARE EQUALLY AS ACHIEVABLE AND EFFECTIVE FOR WOMEN AS THEY ARE FOR MEN, DESPITE PHYSICAL DIFFERENCES. This empowers women to pursue their desired educational and career paths and equips other health care practitioners with the knowledge of how chiropractic can aid in women's health issues. As with all medical industries, there will always be opportunities for prog - ress, and educational institutions are committed to increasing female engagement in the industry. Balancing the chiropractic gender gap At Northwestern Health Sciences University (NWHSU) nearly half of the students are female. This represents an impressive shift to more balanced gender demographics in its chiropractic college. From 1984-2019, its female enrollment rates increased by 81%. That growth includes a 21% increase in female enrollment in the last five years and 38% in the last 10 years. While the female enrollment uptick in colleges like NWHSU is encouraging, gender disparities still exist in the profession. Industry-wide, men still make up the majority of chiropractic practitioners \u2014 some estimates state that 75-80% of practicing chiropractors today are male. As female students pursue an education in chiropractic, universities and certification programs are being more intentional about teaching them how to use their bodies differently. They are exposed to techniques that don't necessarily require significant physical manipulation, such as the Activator technique, Flexion-distraction and the Thompson Drop- Table Technique.Inspiring through peer coaching, mentorship \"The League of Chiropractic Women\" at NWHSU is a dedicated forum designed to bring female chiropractic students and prac - titioners together to discuss challenges women may encounter as providers. Additionally, the institution leads the \"Be Bold Women's Group,\" a supportive environment for women on the campus to learn how to become fully visible in their lives by building confidence, embracing vulnerability, expressing authen - ticity, and leading brave, intentional lives. This type of peer coaching, support and networking is critical. Similarly, all practitioners, male and female, can encourage students of chiropractic by being academic and professional mentors. These relationships often extend years after students complete their education. Many women who care for aging parents or raise children are struggling to find the resources to advance their schooling on top of their existing responsibilities. PERCENTAGE OF NON-CAUCASIAN CHIROPRACTORS IN THE U.S. 22 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 13, 2020 CHIROECO.COMRecognizing barriers Complementary and integrative care institutions also must recognize the barriers women face. They are generally the health care decision-makers in their family groups and take on many pressures outside of pursuing education. The result can be the inability to afford their schooling or fund a pathway to starting their own practice and achieve self-sufficiency. Colleges and training programs generally understand that students often need additional support to complete graduation requirements. Tackling an education can put a strain on finances for individuals and families. Many women who care for aging parents or raise children are struggling to find the resources to advance their schooling on top of their existing responsibilities. NWHSU recently received a large grant from the WCA Foundation, a nonprofit supporting programs for women and children in the state of Minnesota. Scholarships are awarded for low-income and minority students with a special preference for female students. Similar efforts for minorities are needed to ensure equal representation in chiropractic. Currently, the profession is overwhelmingly Caucasian (92%). However, minorities predominantly seek out practitioners (especially in chiropractic) of a similar background. This is largely due to comfort, historical distrust and experienced biases. One study found that the prevalence of chiropractic use was 8.8% for Caucasians, 2.7% for African Americans, and 3.8% for Latinos. Based on what we know, the prevalence of African Americans and Latinos seeking chiropractic care could be increased with more providers of similar cultural and ethnic backgrounds.FEATURE STORY The ECLIPSE Electric Flexion Starting at only $3,295 The Nova Introductory price of only $2,495 New hinge down abdominal section * Incredible strength and construction * Tild heald with adjustable face cushions * Rear lateral flexion with removable guide-flex handle * Electric spring tension control * Ankle extension with ankle strap * Choice of upholstery colors and table heights * The best priced manual flexion table for the price anywhereThe Comet Introductory price of only $3,595 Rear lateral flexion with removable guide handle Variable flexion speed Tilt head with adjustable face cushions Hingedown abdominal Ankle extension and patient traction handlebars Whisper quiet and glass smooth flexion Choice of heights and upholstery color One of the best built, most versatile and affordable of any electric flexion tables on the market The Medray Acoustic Wave Only $4,495 * Dual power settings * Fully Adjustable parameters * All controls on handpiece(table shown with optional drops)(table shown with optional drops) (table shown with optional drops)Variable electric flexion speed * Front lateral flexion * The quietest table on the market * Hinge down abdominal section * Adjustable patient traction bars * Much, much more!

According to a recent study, women represent a majority (60%) of chiropractic patients. The college hosts residencies with medical students at the University of Minnesota to ensure part of their training highlights the unique benefits chiropractic brings to women's care. Medical students are often most interested in how to help women manage pain or care plans associated with: \u0084Migraines \u2014 Approximately 15% of the U.S. population experiences migraines, with women afflicted three times as often as men. While medications are often used as first- line treatments, up to 50% of people with migraines pursue complementary and integrative medicine. One promising non-pharmacological approach for migraines is chiropractic care, due to the co-occurrence of migraine disease and neuro- musculoskeletal tension and pain. \u0084Low-Back Pain in Pregnancy \u2014 Low-back pain during pregnancy is a common occurrence and is mainly caused by hormonal and biomechanical changes. Patients with pregnancy-induced low-back pain (PILBP) frequently complain of moderate to severe and disabling discomfort, often restricting their daily activities. According to multiple studies, chiropractic can be effective in treating this condition. One study showed that patients who saw a chiropractor as their initial provider for low-back pain had 90% decreased odds of both early and long-term opioid use. \u0084Fertility \u2014 Manual therapy, including spinal manipulation and whole-body mobilization of structures affecting reproductive function, has successfully been used with women diagnosed as infertile as a result of mechanical causes. The path forward We must encourage the chiropractic industry to empower women and advocate for whole-person health through chiro - practic care. Both as patients and practitioners, women are critical to the chiropractic industry. To best serve patients and promote equity within the profession, we must continue to support and make it possible for women to pursue an educa - tion in chiropractic and feel successful in doing so. Universities, health care organizations and private practices must make deliberate efforts to mentor, recruit and inspire the next generation of women and minorities. As young women across the country consider higher education opportunities, we want them to find promise and an impactful future in chiropractic. With good mentors and support systems in place to help ensure their success, the future for our profession is bright.

To overcome these limitations a novel self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) based on VESIsorb \u00aeformulation technologyincorporating CBD, as Hemp-Extract, was developed (SEDDS-CBD). The objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic prole of SEDDS-CBD in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design in 16 healthy volunteers under fasted conditions. As reference formulation, the same Hemp-Extract diluted with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT-CBD) was used. CBD dose was standardized to 25 mg. Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed from individual concentration-time curves. Single oral administration of SEDDS-CBD led to a 4.4-fold higher C maxand a 2.85-/1.70-fold higherAUC0-8h/AUC0-24h compared to the reference formulation. T maxwas substantially shorter forSEDDS-CBD (1.0 h) compared to MCT-CBD (3.0 h). Subgroup analysis demonstrated a higher bioavailability in women compared to men. This dierence was seen for MCT-CBD while SEDDS-CBD mitigated this gender eect. Overall, SEDDS-CBD showed a signicant improvement for all determined pharmacokinetic parameters: increased CBD plasma values (C max), favorablyenhanced bioavailability (AUC) and fast absorption (T max).

The organization is taking a hard look at what DCs should learn from the pandemic and what it means for practices and patients.A BRAVE NEW WORLD How women chiropractors are pivoting successfully to meet change head-on during COVID-19 BY CYNTHIA SHAFT-TOLL, DC, FPAC TIME TO READ: 5-7 MIN. HAVE YOU EVER WATCHED A MOVIE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE WORLD SUDDENLY CHANGES AND HOW THE PEOPLE IN IT RISE TO MEET THOSE CHALLENGES? I know I have watched a number of those dystopian movies while I am secure in my seat, knowing that this storyline is going to be neatly wrapped up with some thrills thrown into it in two hours or less. This winter it sure felt like I was in one of those movies, but I felt like I couldn't get out of it. Not only that, but there were no parts of the world to escape to. In our Women Chiropractors Facebook group we connected continually as we never before have. Most of the 8,200 members of Wdc were in there asking questions of each other about how to respond to this world event multiple times a day. Now looking back just a few short months later (or the longest months of March and April ever!), we have seen emotions that have made us realize we are walking through the stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. CHIROECO.COM JULY 13, 2020 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 27FEATURE STORY Dealing with anger, sadness As a practitioner, initially, most of us in the group could not believe we would have to stop working or be severely curtailed in how much we work. We felt anger in that we had to stop caring for patients, as well as anger that some of our hard-won gains were wiped out in just a few months, or possibly that we were put on the sideline of practicing for many months alto - gether. At this point of bargaining as to how to specifically deal with COVID-19, both the disease and the government interven - tion, we processed through many different stages and variations. For us in the U.S., we started to learn all about how to apply for PPP loans to get us through this wildly volatile time. Depression is something that has been talked about an awful lot inside our group as well. There is sadness for some whose hard work may end up with them closing their office; and as things open back up, there is uncertainty of what will happen to active practices well into the future. When we finally navigate through these various stages we can now move into the final stage of acceptance. This is the stage where we can successfully start picking ourselves up, dusting ourselves off, and having a good hard look about how we can move through this, pick up the pieces, and put things back together again. Emotion in economic uncertainty In writing this for a publication with \"economics\" in the title, the idea of dealing with emotion seems like it isn't part of where the focus is. However, this is exactly what we need to work through during this time. I've seen so many DCs charge through and power past all of these stages and tell us to move ahead \u2014 but if you haven't learned a new skill set from this then you will be left far behind. This has also been a large discussion point in our group. The collective wisdom of these women is saying that \"we as humans need to properly process this event.\" This is an incredibly large blow, not just for the sake of a successful practice. In order for us to be successful human beings, we have to walk through these steps or pay the price in the future. Moving forward Some of us are still struggling through these stages, but for others, we are moving through on action steps to face this brave new world. Right now, as the world is slowly opening back up, we 8,200 WDC MEMBERS ACTIVE IN THEIR FACEBOOK GROUPNow is the time to start reconnecting with those patients.

DC, THE TAKEAWAY Detoxes, diet changes and increased fiber are just a few ways female patients can deal with barriers to successful keto dieting. THE KETO DIET WORKS WELL FOR MEN, WHO GENERALLY GO INTO AND MAINTAIN KETOSIS WITH LITTLE DIFFICULTY. For women, however, the ketogenic diet can be a challenge. Even close adherence to the diet can fail to produce ketosis and weight loss. In fact, for some women, the keto diet can lead to weight gain. Keto macros The ketogenic diet is based on an eating plan that sharply restricts carbohydrates and emphasizes the high consump - tion of healthy fats and protein. The standard ketogenic diet contains 75% fat, 20% protein, and only 5% carbohydrates. The goal is to get the body into a state of ongoing ketosis, where ketone bodies, not glucose, are burned for fuel. The diet is a highly effective approach to weight loss and also has other significant health benefits. In particular, the ketogenic diet can be beneficial for normalizing blood sugar and metabolic syndrome by reducing insulin resistance. Keto and gender Why the difference in response between the sexes? It's estrogen. The presence of normal amounts of estrogen in premenopausal women seems to limit or even block ketosis. A recent study1 using mouse models confirms this. Male and female mice were fed a ketogenic diet for 15 weeks. At the end of the trial, the researchers found that male mice on the keto diet maintained blood glucose control and lost body weight. Female mice, however, gained weight, and tests showed poor blood glucose levels. When female mice had their ovaries removed to eliminate estrogen in their bodies and were placed on a ketogenic diet, they lost body fat. They maintained blood glucose control, similar to their male counterparts. Estrogen and lifestyle Many women between the ages of 15-50 experience estrogen dominance \u2014they have more circulating estrogen than its counterpart hormone, progesterone. The cause is usually excess estrogen, though a lack of progesterone can also create an imbalance. But what causes the excess estrogen? Genetics plays a role, but the most common causes are poor diet high in processed foods and low in fiber and micronutrients, chronic stress, poor liver function, inadequate sleep, exogenous estrogen supplementation, and a sedentary lifestyle. Of increasing concern are environmental toxins,2 32 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 13, 2020 CHIROECO.COMwww.ScripHessco.com | 1-800-747-3488 110% Price Match Guaranteecall to request a FREE 1 oz pain relief roll-on sample today!

These toxins surround us all the time \u2014 they're found in plastic bottles and containers, flame retardants, food packaging, cosmetics and pesticides, among many other sources. Correcting estrogen imbalance Regardless of the cause, estrogen dominance can cause weight gain and problems with blood sugar control. Until the imbal - ance is corrected, getting into ketosis will be challenging. Patients who have been diagnosed with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), uterine fibroids, and other estrogen-sensitive conditions experience estrogen dominance. Other symptoms, often not medically diagnosed or even recognized, can include: Irregular periods Low thyroid function Decreased libido Weight gain Brain fog Insomnia Fatigue Irritability, anxiety, depression Because estrogen dominance is so prevalent, I recommend an estrogen detoxification protocol to many of my female patients. The protocol can help restore a better estrogen/ progesterone balance, reduce undesirable estrogen breakdown metabolites, and help the liver move to more efficient estrogen metabolism. Balanced estrogen metabolism is a necessity for success in following the ketogenic diet. Estrogen detox Estrogen is processed in the liver for elimination following phase I and phase II detoxification pathways. In that sense, an estrogen detox is similar to liver detoxification, with some modifications.

The protocol I recommend supports detoxification and methylation by making sure the body has the needed cofactors to help eliminate estrogens. It begins with a high- fiber diet rich in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and cabbage. High fiber alone has a positive effect on estrogen metabolism,3 while the indoles in cruciferous vegetables help shift estrogen metabolism away from \"bad\" estrones.4 These vegetables are also a good dietary source of diindolylmethane (DIM), a compound that is shown to positively affect estrogen metabolism. For those who find that cruciferous vegetables are hard to digest, supplements containing DIM are an option as well.5 I also strongly encourage all my female patients to get regular physical activity as a way to normalize their estrogen metabolism.6 The typical estrogen detox program lasts for 28 days before the implementation of the keto diet. I prescribe a 3-step approach. 3-step detox Step 1 (4 days): Initial clearing where patients gradually eliminate dairy, gluten, and high-carb sugary and processed foods. They're replaced with high-quality protein, good fats, and at least five half-cup servings a day of cruciferous vegetables. During the detox, patients avoid caffeine, alcohol, and soda. Instead, they drink lots of pure alkaline water. I also recommend a daily green WELLNESS APPROACH WOMEN OF ACTIVATOR Activator and Activator Methods are registered trademarks of Activator Methods International, Ltd. in the United States and other countries.

The green drink provides vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients. The shake provides a wide range of natural micronu - trients, cofactors, fatty acids, and amino acids the liver needs for the detoxification pathways to function efficiently. Step 2 (24 days): Estrogen detoxification. For days 5-28, patients continue with a diet that gradually gets closer to the full ketogenic diet. Good fats are slowly increased to 75% of the diet as a high-quality protein is gradually reduced to 20% of the diet. High consumption of cruciferous vegetables continues, as do the green drinks and detox shakes. Step 3: Full keto diet. At the completion of the estrogen detox period, the full ketogenic diet begins. A greater variety of low-carb foods, such as leafy greens, berries, nuts, and seeds, should now be added. The green drink and detox shake are discontinued, and supplemental support for continuing estrogen detoxification is added. By following the estrogen detox program for 28 days before going to the full keto diet, my female patients achieve much better results. Keto tips for women patients Even after an estrogen detox program, however, some women will have trouble getting into ketosis and staying there. The solution is supplementation with ketone salts, also known as exogenous ketones. These supplements contain ketones in the form of beta-hydroxybu - tyrate bound to a salt such as sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium. Ketone salts are beneficial for inducing ketosis and for relieving many of the discomforts of keto flu.7 Women following the keto diet may run low on magnesium, iron and calcium, micronutrients they need to maintain bone strength, and avoid osteopenia and osteoporosis later in life. I recommend daily supplements to be sure of getting an adequate supply. Oral magnesium bisglycinate supplements are easily absorbed and less likely to cause nausea or diarrhea. Because the keto diet restricts carbohydrates, it is relatively low in dietary fiber from fruits and vegetables. The lack of fiber may cause constipation, especially when beginning These vegetables are also a good dietary source of diindolylmethane (DIM), a compound that is shown to positively affect estrogen metabolism. 36 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 13, 2020 CHIROECO.COMILLEGAL!SOME DISCOUNTS ARE SOM E DiSCOunTS A RE GOO D.

Women, in general, are more likely to experience constipation, and they are also more likely to become constipated on the keto diet than men. The solution is to add more dietary fiber from low-carb fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. Good choices include all leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, artichokes, celery, avocados, fresh berries, chia seeds, flax seeds, hemp seeds, walnuts and almonds. I strongly recommend unrestricted daily amounts of leafy greens such as lettuce, spinach and kale for all my patients on the keto diet. They add almost nothing to the daily carbohydrate grams limit while providing dietary fiber and also a range of vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients. Increasing fiber and the 'keto flu' The goal of adding low-carb plant foods is to increase fiber intake to at least 25 grams a day \u2014 more than the average American gets on a daily basis \u2014 and preferably even more. This isn't difficult to do while still maintaining ketosis. An ounce of almonds (about eight nuts), for example, contains about 3.5 grams of fiber, 6 grams of protein, and 14 grams of fat. An ounce of chia seeds (about three tablespoons) has about 10 grams of fiber, 4 grams of protein, and 9 grams of fat. As they adapt to a diet extremely low in carbohydrates, my female patients seem to feel the effects of \"keto flu\" more than men do. The symptoms of keto flu \u2014 headache, muscle aches, nausea, dizziness, constipation and others \u2014 usually dissipate within the first week. To help the body adapt faster, I urge all my patients to stay fully hydrated and maintain proper levels of electrolytes. Adding salt to food and making sure to include keto-friendly vegetables in the diet helps prevent electrolyte imbalance. As mentioned previously, keto salt supplements can attenuate the effects of the keto flu expeditiously. Women also seem to have more difficulty staying in ketosis than men. I've found that my female patients are responsive to adding medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil to their diet. MCT oil converts quickly to ketone bodies and helps maintain ketosis. Clean vs. 'dirty' keto Clean keto is a critical factor in helping women succeed with the diet. Clean keto and \"dirty\" keto both follow the same macro - nutrient proportions of fat, protein and carbohydrates. Dirty keto, however, allows the macronutrients to come from any indiscriminate source, including dairy foods, processed meats and fast food, and pays little attention to the small but essen - tial carbohydrate component. It leads to high consumption of low-quality fat, salt, and food additives and preservatives. Clean keto sticks to healthy sources of the macronutrients, such as wild-caught salmon, organic eggs, pastured meat, cold-pressed organic vegetable oils, and avocados. Clean keto also encourages the consumption of low-carb vegetables, berries, seeds and nuts to make sure the diet contains enough micronutrients, vitamins and minerals. Weight loss will occur with both approaches, at least initially. In the long run, dirty keto will stall weight loss and cause inflammation, often resulting in an unhealthy outcome. In women, dirty keto may cause deficiencies in calcium and other vital nutrients that lead right back to estrogen dominance and abandoning the ketogenic approach as just another failed diet. Women who adhere to an estrogen detoxification program before and during the (clean) keto diet are able to attain their weight loss and health goals successfully. ROBERT G.

THE TAKEAWAY Despite impending changes to foot fit after they give birth, many women are opting for pelvic-stabilizing orthotics during pregnancy to relieve pain and discomfort and to work as long as they can before the birth of their child. LUMBAR AND PELVIC PAIN ARE COMMON IN PREGNANCY. 1 One of the contributing factors to pelvic destabilization may be found in abnormalities of foot structure. A recent study inves - tigating changes in the feet of pregnant women found that \"... pregnancy is associated with a permanent loss of arch height and rigidity,\" most notably in a woman's first pregnancy. 2 As care providers for pregnant women, chiropractors have the unique opportunity to assess the feet and determine if they are a contributing factor to the patient's pelvic imbalances. If contributory, then ancillary support in the form of pelvic stabilizing orthotics can be considered in addition to chiropractic. The practitioner must also determine whether the patient would benefit more to receive them while pregnant rather than waiting until postpartum. Pregnancy factors in foot structure change Three factors appear to change foot structure, thereby affecting the kinematic chain which connects the lower limb and pelvis. A practitioner may need to update a patient's orthotic inserts if any of these three criteria occur. Pregnant women are often affected by each of these factors: \u0084Changes in the shape of the foot arch may make an orthotic become outdated. Pregnancy considerations suggest ligamentous laxity from the relaxin hormone may alter the foot arches and length.2 \u0084The loss or gain of more than 20 pounds of body weight can affect the customized fit of an orthotic. A pregnant woman will continue to gain weight until giving birth. \u0084Surgery can affect the customization of orthotic inserts. If a child is born by cesarean section, the surgical intervention could affect the pelvis and lower extremities. For these reasons, I once exclusively suggested pregnant mothers wait until after giving birth before purchasing pelvic stabilizing orthotics. Following a few pivotal patient experiences, I began to implement orthotics as part of the pregnancy care plan for a select group of patients after meeting a woman presenting with severe lumbopelvic pain worsening as her pregnancy progressed. She was a nurse working 12-hour shifts at the local hospital. She was already 40 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 13, 2020 CHIROECO.COMTMOther hemp and CBD providers cut corners and deliver hemp and CBD marred by contaminants and subpar processing.

She feared her pain would force her to use limited paid time off work (PTO) before giving birth. She was desperate to save all her PTO for after giving birth because she felt it would minimize the challenges of pumping breast milk during work hours. Breastfeeding was one of her top priorities. Her lumbopelvic pain during pregnancy affected her postpartum goals of maximizing paid maternity leave and breastfeeding. She was panicked and crying when I met her one day, and my heart ached for her. I wanted to offer her every home care option I could to enhance her pregnancy care plan. Her activities of daily living, personal goals and examination findings suggested she would respond well to pelvic stabilizing orthotics. Had she not been pregnant, I would have suggested custom orthotics immediately, but my mentality at the time narrowed her options by suggesting she wait until several weeks postpartum. Given her dire circumstances, I mentioned pelvic stabilizing orthotics during her pregnancy. I informed her that her customized fit might change after the baby was born, and she requested the orthotics anyway. One week later, she called me in tears not from pain, but because she felt hope again. She confidently returned to work and could save her PTO for the future. Chiropractic adjustments, in conjunction with custom orthotics, changed the course of her pregnancy, maternity leave, and breastfeeding relationship. Educating patients to provide options One of the most important things during pregnancy is to empower the woman and help her feel supported. First, we must ask the patient to clearly define her personal goals. Then, we must educate the mother with all her available options, letting her make the ultimate decision. Her current needs and goals while pregnant might outweigh the costs of ordering a second pair of orthotics postpartum. As practitioners, we cannot always predict this for the woman; we must ask her. As I asked my pregnant patients to define their goals, many told me they wanted to be able to work as long as possible before their baby was born in order to maximize maternity leave. Some needed to be able to stand more comfortably on their feet for lengthy periods of time because their family, As I asked my pregnant patients to define their goals, many told me they wanted to be able to work as long as possible before their baby was born in order to maximize maternity leave.

Despite being told to rest more, some insisted that was a luxury they could not afford. They needed a tool, in addition to chiropractic adjustments, to make these goals more achievable. Addressing lower-extremity fatigue After the nurse, other prenatal patients came with similar issues. I met a pregnant cashier who stood on concrete floors all day and did not qualify for paid maternity leave at all. For her, working comfortably until her birthing day and as soon as possible after giving birth was her personal goal. Then, I met a pregnant mother who desperately wanted to walk to the playground each day with her toddler to soak up those one-on-one memories with her firstborn before the new baby arrived. However, her lower extremities fatigued so much during walks that she just couldn't walk anymore. I refused to say there was nothing more that could be done for these pregnant women. Telling them to lower their expectations or change their job or family requirements was not a feasible or fair option. We had already implemented chiropractic adjustments, prenatal exercise and stretching programs, and ergonomic changes at home and work. However, I repeatedly found a select group of women responding well to our pregnancy care plan, but their personal goals still required additional support. Pelvic stabilizing orthotic use during pregnancy satisfied this group of women and enhanced their lives. Bringing relief in the moment I am always honest with my mothers, informing them that their customized fit might change in the future, or over-the-counter orthotics may be a helpful option too. However, the results have consistently spoken for themselves. Pelvic stabilizing orthotics can be an effective part of a comprehensive pregnancy care plan when justified by the exam findings and patient goals. As prenatal chiropractors, we must ask our patients how we can fully serve and support them best, especially while they support our next generation.

Most of the time on a nice day it would be much more fun to be hanging with the kids, playing in the pool or just about anything else. But, if done well, going to a health fair and even better yet, organizing a health fair can be a big boost to any clinic. Participating in a health fair First, let's discuss the key factors to make going to someone else's health fair worthwhile.

Be aware that the event might be close by, but the attendees might be from out of town. This happens a lot with athletic events \u2014 most chiropractors have experienced the marathon right down the street, but when we are working on the athletes, we realize that they all came from 40 miles away. Participants \u2014 Who is coming, and are they ideal patients? Senior health fairs are great if the office works with Medicare, but if it doesn't, it's a big waste of time. So check the demographics \u2014 are they potential good patients who can afford your care? Formulate your plan If we pick an event and location that works, the next step is to design your plan. If there are speaking slots, try hard to get one, as that is where you can get some recognition, and it can have the best potential for new patients. Attracting people to your table or booth is the next most important thing. There must be something to draw attention to your booth and get people to come over. That is probably the biggest reason for failure at a busy event \u2014 just having your sign up and nothing else makes for a lonely day. This is the mistake many chiro - practors make; then they say, \"This health fair thing doesn't work!\" You have to draw them in. Here are some things that may draw a crowd: Sink a putt and win, prize wheel, spine models, free posture screening, and the old-fashioned spinal analysis machine (SAM) unit can still Have appointment slots set out and make appointments right at the event.

Decide which element you want to get the crowds, then make sure you have signage to market it. Get off your butt One mistake I often see is everyone sits behind the table and waits. Push the table back, get rid of the chairs and get out in front and engage. Set up your screening system and make sure to get everyone's contact info: name, email, phone and address. Don't forget the point of this fair is not to chat, make friends, or \"get the word out\" \u2014 the point is to get new patients. Have appointment slots set out and make appointments right at the event. The next big mistake is not following up. Many people won't be ready right then, so put them on a follow-up program. A good plan is to send a letter right away, then put them on your lead list and follow up with them regularly, such as putting them on the monthly newsletter mailing list. The keys to going to a health fair are picking a proper location, picking the proper event, having something to draw people in, and most importantly the follow-up. Your own health fair Even better than attending a health fair is having your own. This is the next level and can completely change the view of the practice in the community. Just like before, picking the location is key. If it's possible to do it on-site, that is the best, but it is very easy to do it somewhere else as well. Next, we need to invite the right people. Who are local health-related people you work with who can be involved? The local gym, primary care office, podiatrist, nutritionist, acupuncturist, whatever fits. Send emails inviting key people. Charging vendors or not depends on a lot of factors. This event isn't about making money; it's about getting new clients and making the practice look like a leader in health care. Make a Facebook event page and maybe an Eventbrite page for the event, and mention that additional vendors are welcome. Create posters and flyers for your clinic and everyone else involved and make sure to include them in your emails and online. Have the other vendors promote as well. There are a lot of details to making this work, but having a health fair that you are in charge of can have amazing benefits \u2014 deciding who can come, positioning in town, and cross marketing can be very beneficial. Health fairs that you attend, and that you put on, can be a valuable source of new patients in your clinic as well as a great tool for branding and to position the chiropractic clinic locally.

Even basic, portable models are a few hundred dollars, with some of the more high- tech options costing well into the thousands. Fortunately, there are some things you can do to help better protect your investment, giving you a table that can withstand the stress of adjustment after adjustment. Here are a few chiropractic table maintenance tips to consider. When you can, go high-end For starters, if you purchase a higher-quality chiropractic table, it will likely cost more, but it will also generally last longer too. So, while you're going to pay more up front to make your buy from a reputable manufacturer, if your table lasts you several years longer than one made by a subpar company, you'll end up further ahead. How do you know which chiropractic table manufacturers are better than others? One way to determine this is to read online reviews. Do a search for the table or brand you want, adding \"reviews\" at the end. See what others have to say about it before making your purchase. Another option is to talk to other chiropractors in your area and see what they recommend (or, alternatively, which brands or tables they suggest you stay away from). Also check out the Chiropractic Economics tables product directory at chiroeco. com/products/product-category/tables.Cleaning advice Regular cleaning of your chiropractic table is necessary to not only make it last longer, but also to protect your patients from bacteria, viruses and other pathogens left behind by others who've been adjusted prior. However, using the wrong cleaners on your table could potentially shorten its life. For example, using a cleaner that isn't meant for that specific type of surface can cause the material to break down more quickly than normal, make it discolor, or otherwise change its appearance. Any of these scenarios will shorten the life of that surface, forcing you to replace it or replace parts sooner than anticipated. For this reason, it's best to follow manufacturer recommendations regarding which cleaners will work best for that particular upholstery or table covering. Some companies sell their own cleaners, but a mixture of dishwashing soap and water or the use of an all-purpose spray cleaner will also often do the trick. Don't forget to pay attention to which cleaners the manufacturer recommends, if any, when cleaning other parts of your chiropractic table, such as those that are metal, plastic or electronic in nature. For instance, if your table has a touch screen, this should not be cleaned with glass cleaner. Instead, distilled water or a white vinegar and distilled water mixture is recommended.

For instance, if it has movable parts that need regular lubrication, calendar this into your schedule so time doesn't inadvertently slip by, leaving your table poorly maintained. Regular maintenance suggestions can typically be found in the product manual or brochure for the table you purchased. Reaching out to the manufacturer and asking what they recommend when it comes to regular table maintenance is an option as well. Just like performing oil changes every 3,000 miles can help prolong the life of your car, performing regular maintenance on your chiropractic table can help it last longer, too. Fix any known issues immediately One of the biggest things you can do to help your table last as long as possible is to fix any issues it develops as soon as you notice them. The longer you let these problems go on, the more likely it is they will get bigger, potentially taking your table to the point where it becomes beyond repair. Some of these issues can be fixed quickly and easily yourself by doing a little troubleshooting. For example, if you notice that the pelvic cushion will cock, but won't stay up, it's possible that the drop pin is off-track. With nothing more than a flat head screwdriver, you can often put the pin back in place so that your table works as intended once again. When the issue is larger or more technical and, therefore, requires actions you're not able to take, you may need to contact the manufacturer to request service. If the table is still under warranty, the cost for this may be covered. Even if it isn't, repairing your table will typically be less costly than replacing it, making it well worth the call.

Patients want to be heard, and have their problems seen through their own eyes BY GARY BORING, DC, BCAO (BOARD CERTIFIED ATLAS ORTHOGONAL), LCP (HON.), FICA TIME TO READ: 5-7 MIN. PRACTICE CENTRAL THE TAKEAWAY The concerned chiropractor who listens begins to validate the patient's problems \u2014 this attentiveness nourishes the patient's own desire in becoming well and engages them toward accepting their responsibility in the process of healing. FOR A PATIENT TO BE HEARD STARTS THEIR HEALING PROCESS. When a patient sees that the chiropractor is attentively listening to what is being said, the patient's fears start to fade. The most ordinary and everyday patient consultation is an appeal for help. Can you feel what they feel? Do you know in your heart what pain and suffering are like? Every piece of advice given by the doctor, in the patient's eyes, is a means of restoring their chances of successful healing threatened by disease or by some symptom. When a patient is heard Healing, meaning a satisfactory outcome for the patient, is relief of pain, diminished anxiety, acceptance of one's lot in life, less disability and a positive mental attitude. The concerned chiropractor who listens begins to validate the patient's prob - lems. The doctor reveals the cause of the patient's condition with the \"hands on\" palpation, nerve tracing and explanation of X-rays. The patient can relax knowing they were heard and understood. Mutual acceptance and validation calms and encourages the patient. They now know their suffering is seen as an acceptable illness that can be handled by chiropractic. Patient validation Validation is a team effort. Positive regard for your patient is a core quality that fuels continued doctor-patient interaction. Confidence, personal involvement and genuine concern are the foundation of the clinical application. Attentiveness nourishes the patient's own desire in becoming well and engages them toward accepting their responsibility in the process of healing. 54 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 13, 2020 CHIROECO.COMThat's the rate of annual growth Cash Practice\u00ae doctors experience on average during the first three years of implementing our systems.

PRACTICE CENTRAL Being a number, seen and not heard by a doctor, alienates patients. \"Medically speaking...the patient becomes a translucent screen through which they peer in order to find a disease entity within,\" said John L. Coulehan, former director of Stony Brook University's medical school programs in ethics and humanities. \"If no disease is evident after appropriate evaluation, they often reassure the patient that 'nothing is wrong' and could be psychological or psychosomatic. Chiropractic clinical analysis does not 'subtract' the patient but remains closer to the patient's experience in explaining symptoms than the medical profession, for it treats the cause, not the symptom. \"Chiropractic presents a logical set of beliefs which appeals to common sense, uses scientific terminology, yet promotes a natural, noninvasive, holistic approach to healing rather than the medical approach which people view as excessive, dependent upon technology and drugs.\" The art of listening We as chiropractors do not just sit and talk and then write a prescription; we join with patients in their care. Listening is a learned art. Doctor, can you stop listening to your own immediate concerns? Can you stop reacting to the pressures of business tugging on you daily? Clear your mind and awaken your senses to observe by sight, touch and verbal communications before entering the treatment room. Remember, it is not about you! You must be a sponge to the words you hear. Yes, listening is a forced action \u2014 learning to discern the patient's feelings of expectation, their frustrations, and even recognizing their fears as they present their situation. Probe your patient for further explanation to specific statements and then repeat what you heard them say. Check your attitude at the door. Do not try to impress them; try to understand them instead. Join with them in their need for a healthier lifestyle. We as chiropractors actively participate with each patient in their treatment. We must awaken our empathy the minute we introduce ourselves to each patient to feel the joy we will receive from helping another human being. This listening leads to action and the natural law of life, which is to be healthy.

THE TAKEAWAY \"A chiropractor should be able to care for any condition which may arise in the families under his care, the same as a physician.\" THE QUESTION OF CHIROPRACTIC PHYSICIANS ADMINISTERING NUTRIENT-BASED INJECTIONS NATIONWIDE is receiving more and more discussion within the discipline. Factual history surrounding the topic, as well as what the inclusion of the authority is and has actually been doing for patients in \"real time,\" is also a consideration. As Benjamin Rush, MD, co-signer of the Declaration of Independence, said, \"Unless we put medical freedom into the constitution, the time will come when medicine will organize into an undercover dictatorship. To restrict the art of healing to one class of men and deny equal privileges to others will constitute the Bastille of medical science. All such laws are un-American and despotic.\" That statement was prophetic. The \"Father of Chiropractic,\" D.D. Palmer, said, \"A chiropractor should be able to care for any condition which may arise in the families under his care, the same as a physician.\" Thus, he opened his second large chiropractic school, which was the D.D. Palmer College of Chiropractic (1908-1910, now Western States University) in which his curriculum included dissection, minor surgery and obstetrics to accomplish that goal. Further, Palmer stated, \"But as soon as the human mind is capable of absorbing a still more refined and advanced method (of dealing with human ailments) and human inspiration demands it, it will be delivered to the denizens of the earth.\" This topic fits well into Dr. Palmer's concept. Where chiropractic injections are legal States such as Oklahoma, New Mexico, Idaho and Utah (along with several other states desiring the same expanded conser - vative rights) have already been administering chiropractic injectable treatments to patients for decades. For those DCs who may have a degree of trepidation pertaining to these rights, understand that these states highly respect the discipline's principle that the chiropractic adjustment is the foundation of the healing art (and we continue to deliver that H2O2 INTRAVENOUS, COMPOUNDED H2O2 IS AN OXIDATIVE THERAPY AND HAS BEEN ADMINISTERED FOR MORE THAN 100 YEARS BEGINNING WITH THE 1918 INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC; IT WAS WRITTEN UP IN THE LANCET IN 1920 58 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 13, 2020 CHIROECO.COMCLINICAL CONCERNS treatment to all our patients). However, to have the belief that the chiropractic adjustment is also the ceiling of our beloved discipline may be slightly misdirected. For example, in Oklahoma, which was the first state in the country to attain the statutory authority for chiropractic injectable nutrients, it is estimated that well in excess of two million intramuscular, intra-articular and trigger-point injections have been administered with natural medicine agents that far outperform allopathic steroids, and without risk of side effects. Further, at least one million nutritional intravenous treatments have been administered by Oklahoma chiropractic physicians. The efficaciousness of these conservative, chiropractic-based injection (parenteral) treatments is exhaustive. Along with the appropriately delivered chiropractic adjustments, the combination has been proven to help patients get off their allopathically prescribed meds, where appropriate, up to at least 70-80% of the time. The results for a variety of conditions from chronic fatigue to chronic viral infections, from enhanced recovery from significant trauma to degenerative arthritis, from vascular conditions to shortening post-surgical recovery and many, many more ailments, are nothing short of amazing. And after almost 40 years of use (at least in Oklahoma) there are no dead bodies from these interventions administered by the appropriately-trained chiropractic physician. Just healthier, pain-free patients who otherwise may not have recovered at all or perhaps in a less timely manner without these chiropractic- injectable protocols. Another level of care The judicious clinical utilization of chiropractic injectable nutri - ents has allowed the chiropractic physicians in those states the legal authority to profoundly help an ever-increasing number of patients who otherwise may have never experienced what chiropractic medicine can offer. In fact, in many instances, chiropractic physicians with these rights have become the conservative primary care providers of choice to many patients. Some examples of what we are talking about could begin with German neural injection therapy for surgical scars, which are a known \"chronic pain generator\" following surgery. Injecting simple B12 into the longitudinal axis of the scars associated with surgery in the patient who continues to have chronic pain following his or her surgery can, in some cases, provide instant relief. We see it all the time. Then there is the elderly patient who has been taking acid- blocking drugs for decades (patients are only supposed to take for a maximum of 14 days) who has not absorbed protein or minerals for years. Their body compensated by stealing protein and minerals from their muscles and bones until they reached the critical point of total collapse (no wonder they can't hold their adjustments). Administering only targeted, oral nutritional supplementation to an atrophied G.I. tract won't get the job done. We must bypass the G.I. tract and administer intravenous concentrated nutrients such as 8.4% free amino acids, ascorbate (vitamin C), B vitamins, calcium, magnesium, trace minerals, etc., to provide building block nutrients in a timely manner. Chronic infection and trigger points How about the patient with low-grade chronic infection (typi - cally EBV or CMV) constantly drained? Intravenous, compounded H2O2 is an oxidative therapy and has been administered for more than 100 years beginning with the 1918 influenza epidemic and was written up in The Lancet in 1920. Understand that viruses cannot produce catalase and thus do not have any protection from oxidative stress. Often, these patients will alternate with I.V. vitamin C, which upregulates the immune response in five different parameters in humans. Then there is the stubborn trigger point. You used ultrasound, IASTM, etc., and it just won't let go. Our allopathic colleagues will inject it with a steroid and lidocaine. Chiropractic injection treatment would use B12, magnesium and homeopathic agents. This would make short work of the stubborn trigger point and would be accomplished in a conservative, biologically-compatible manner consistent with conservative chiropractic roots. And, of course, it is understood that chiropractors will always adjust the patient. There are literally hundreds of these protocols. It will be exciting to see what the next 40 years holds for the wonderful healing art of chiropractic.
