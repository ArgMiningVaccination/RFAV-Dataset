But you should see your doctor if you or your child have flu symptoms and: - are younger than 5 years old - are aged 65 years or older and living in an aged care home - have heart or kidney disease, or a medical condition like type 2 diabetes - are pregnant - are very obese (you have a Body Mass Index [BMI] of 35 or higher) - are an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person - have severe asthma, breathing problems or a lung disease (for example, cystic fibrosis) - have a disease that affects your muscles and/or the nerves that control them, and that can affect your ability to breathe (for example, muscular dystrophy) - have a weakened immune system (for example, people with HIV or people taking medicines to suppress their immune system) - are homeless - are a smoker This is because flu can be serious for you and your doctor may want to prescribe [antiviral medication](/colds-and-flu-medication#antiviral).

[](/australian-health-services) FIND A HEALTH SERVICE \u2014 Our Service Finder can help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services. What causes the flu? Flu is caused by the [type A](/influenza-a-flu), type B or rarely the type C influenza virus. Only types A and B cause major outbreaks and severe disease, while type C can cause an illness in children similar to [the common cold](/colds). Colds and flu are very contagious viral infections and you can catch a cold or flu at any time of the year, not just in winter \u2014 however they are more common during the winter months. This may be because people are more likely to stay indoors and be in close contact with each other. If you have a cold or flu and you sneeze or cough, tiny droplets of fluid containing the virus are launched into the air. These droplets spread about 1 metre and are suspended in the air for a while so they can be breathed in by someone else who may then become infected. These tiny droplets of fluid can also land on surfaces. Anyone who touches these surfaces can catch a cold or flu if they pick up the virus on their hands and then touch their nose or mouth. If you have a cold or flu and you touch your mouth or nose and then touch a person or object without first washing your hands, then you can transfer the virus to that person or object. How is the flu diagnosed? Your doctor may diagnose a probable influenza infection based on your symptoms alone. To help them do this, they may listen to your chest using a stethoscope. If your doctor wants to be sure of the diagnosis, they may take a sample of cells and mucus from your nose or throat using a sterile cotton swab. This sample will be sent to a pathology laboratory for testing. They will most likely also do a test to rule out the possibility of you having COVID-19. Wear a mask when attending your medical appointment to help reduce the spread of the virus to other people. How is the flu treated? In most cases you can treat the symptoms of a mild flu yourself. Most people will get better by themselves within 7 to 10 days and without any treatment. Some things you can do to relieve flu symptoms include: - getting plenty of rest - drinking plenty of water and other non-alcoholic fluids to prevent dehydration - keeping warm - eating a healthy diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables - avoiding exposure to cigarette smoke if possible - inhaling steam from a hot bath or shower in a closed room to help relieve a blocked nose \u2014 remember to always directly supervise children near hot water If you have a sore throat, try: - gargling with warm salty water - sucking on an ice cube, ice block or a throat lozenge - drinking hot water with honey and freshly squeezed lemon juice There are also several medicines available to ease cold and flu symptoms, such as pain and fever. If you are sick with the flu, stay home and avoid close contact with other people until you feel better. Antibiotics only work on infections caused by bacteria. As the flu is caused by a virus, taking antibiotics will not help you get better faster or stop you from spreading it to other people. Taking antibiotics can cause side effects like an upset stomach, diarrhoea and thrush. When you take antibiotics for the cold or flu, you also increase the risk of [antibiotic resistance](/antibiotics) in the future. Can the flu be prevented? Follow these easy tips to help prevent the spread of flu: Get a flu shot It is important to get the [influenza vaccination](/flu-vaccine-faqs) each year to continue to be protected, since it wears off after 3 to 4 months and flu strains (types) change over time. For more information about the flu vaccine, see [Flu Vaccine FAQs](/flu-vaccine-faqs). Wash your hands In addition to vaccination, good hygiene is one of the best ways to help prevent flu and other illnesses from spreading. [Wash your hands](/hand-washing) regularly. Cover coughs and sneezes Cover your mouth and nose when [coughing](/cough) or sneezing. Bin your tissues Throw used tissues in the bin immediately. Avoid sharing Don't share cups, plates, cutlery and towels with other people, if you can. Keep surfaces clean Clean surfaces such as your keyboard, phone and door handles regularly to get rid of germs. Self-care at home In most cases, you can [treat mild flu or cold symptoms at home](/colds-and-flu). NOTE: Antibiotics won't help [Antibiotics](/antibiotics) do not reduce symptoms of flu or a cold, as these illnesses are caused by viruses. Antibiotics only work for bacterial infections. The Immunisation Coalition has produced the below video, which explains how contagious the flu virus can be, how long the virus lasts and what can be done to prevent infection. When is the flu season? The Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care monitors influenza activity and severity in the community.
