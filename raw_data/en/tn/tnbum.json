Chiropractic care regularly will encourage spinal health, restore joint function and range of motion, and support your nervous system. Because chiropractic care does support the nervous system, it indirectly boosts your immune system as well.

Your immune system plays a pivotal role in keeping your body healthy and functioning to its potential. Our immune system's primary role is to protect your body and fight against infectious organisms and keep them from entering your body, preventing illness. If your immune system is working correctly, you won't even know it's there. But when it stops working, you will get sick or ill. Your immune system is made out of proteins, tissues, organs, and white blood cells. All of these parts work together to keep you healthy. Our immune system prevents disease, infection and helps you recover from injury. A poor immune system can cause several problems like allergies, asthma, diabetes, seasonal colds, the flu, and even some forms of cancer. This is why regular chiropractic care that can boost your immune system can come in handy. How Your Nervous System And Immune System Work Together Our nervous systems and immune systems are hardwired to work together to allow your body to function at an optimal level. Both of these systems release hormones and tiny messenger molecules that will communicate with each other and other organs in our bodies. Your nervous system sends information to your brain from the rest of your body and can directly influence the receptors in your immune system. Your brain can use nerve cells to communicate with your immune system and trigger an immune response. Your immune system can also send signals to the brain, letting it know if there are any foreign or unwanted antigens so your brain can then tell the nervous system how to react. One study showed increased levels of antibodies in the immune system after an adjustment. In some instances, people with viruses, colds, sore throats, sinus congestion, and other symptoms reported quicker recoveries after their adjustments. How Does Chiropractic Care Help? Chiropractors help their patient's immune systems stay strong because a chiropractic adjustment will indirectly boost their immune function. Several studies of the human body have found a link between your nerves, endocrine, and immune system. These three systems all share messenger molecules that communicate throughout the body. Information gathered by one system is shared with the others to create optimal responses for the body to adapt and heal. So how does chiropractic treatment come into play? When one system isn't functioning correctly, it will impact the other systems. So when your nervous system isn't functioning properly, or there's an interference, it can affect your immune response. A misaligned spinal cord can interrupt the nervous system's functionality, creating a domino effect, leaving you vulnerable to illnesses. But with chiropractic and immune system care, your body can use the intelligence of all three systems to stay healthy.
