A study published in the British Medical Journal finds that every close, cheery friend you have increases your own happiness odds by 9 percent. \"Friends offer protection against illness by serving as a buffer against stress, which slows your immune system,\" says Steven M.

A: Mushrooms B: Cucumbers C: Tomatoes BEST ANSWER: A Eating any fruit or vegetable regularly is a good thing. But when it comes to germ defense, the fungus has an edge. Research suggests that mushrooms may have antiviral and antibacterial properties. And 'shrooms are the only fresh produce that naturally contain vitamin D. If your D levels are low, your white blood cells won't be able to react to or ward off infections effectively, Dr. Gerbstadt says. No need to shell out big bucks on fancy gourmet varieties: The button mushroom is a potent source of D. If mushrooms aren't your thing, a multivitamin can help you get the suggested 600 international units daily. A: Less than six hours B: Seven hours or more C: Sleep? What's sleep? BEST ANSWER: B People who nab fewer than seven hours of shut-eye each night are three times more likely to catch a cold than those who snooze for eight hours, according to a study in the Archives of Internal Medicine. \"Not getting enough sleep disrupts your natural circadian rhythm, which in turn disrupts the production of key hormones involved in immunity, including cortisol,\" says Dr. Chandler of Mount Sinai. Healthy levels of cortisol bolster the body's ability to handle the stress of battling germs.

And any music you like will work, say the study's authors. Laughter can be healing, too: In a study from Loma Linda University, chuckling along to a humorous video increased the production of natural killer cells\u2014a type of cell that helps protect against viruses and cancer cells\u2014by 14 percent. What won't help: tanning. Dangerous UVB rays damage cells and may dampen your defenses against illness and skin cancer. A: A beer. B: A glass of wine. C: Water. BEST ANSWER: C Sure, a drink can help you unwind, but it also makes it more likely you'll catch that virus working its way around the office. Alcohol of any kind, even heart-healthy vino, reduces your white blood cell count, Dr. Gerbstadt says. \"Alcohol acts as a toxin, slowing down your body's normal repair processes and preventing absorption of immune-boosting nutrients,\" she explains. Although the effects are temporary (up to 24 hours at most), it takes only one drink to make an impact, she says. So if your kid is home sick or you're feeling sniffly, stick to a nonalcoholic beverage until you, and those around you, are healthy again.
