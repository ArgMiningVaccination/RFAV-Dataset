The Learning Collaborative consists of two parts: a three-part webinar series and an affinity group. The webinar series includes presentations from experts in the field as well as tools that states can use to drive improvement in children's oral health outcomes. States interested in taking action on the concepts and tools introduced through the webinar series will have the opportunity to participate in an action-oriented affinity group that will support states in designing and implementing quality improvement (QI) projects. Affinity Group States interested in launching a new quality improvement project or expanding a current project on reducing caries and improving oral health in Medicaid and CHIP children will have the opportunity to join an affinity group beginning in January 2021. QI advisors and subject-matter experts will provide state teams with individualized guidance on using QI tools to (1) improve the delivery of fluoride varnish by primary or community care providers; and (2) connect beneficiaries with ongoing sources of dental care. Participating state teams will receive quality improvement technical assistance support over 24 months (January 2021-December 2022) to design, test, implement, and assess a project to advance prevention and reduce childhood caries in their state.
