Executive Summary 1.1 Smart Farming The concept of smart farming is not new. Producers have always looked for more efficient ways to grow food and raise livestock , but their task is increasingly difficult . Producers and myriad other agrifood stakeholders like processor s or food manufacturer s (see Figure 1) pursue often- competing objectives such as profitability, sustainability, and the freedom to operate, under an ever more challenging set of constraints such as climate change, regulatory pressure, changes in consumer preferences, increasing cost of inputs, commodity price volatility and an increasingly complex geopolitical situation. The availability of critical resources like fertilizers and irrigation water is uncertain, weather -related stresses are increasingly extreme and unpredictable , and market signal s are ambiguous at best. Given the critical role that data and its exchange must necessarily have i n this context, smart farming today: is data-driven bases decisions on sound scientific principles and generally accepted good agricultural practices involves multiple stakeholders in the value chain (i.e., farmers, their advisors, equipment manufacturers, post-harvest sector , customers, regulators, to name a few) happens in a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world (e.g., the prices of both crop inputs and harvested commodities are volatile, yields and the availability of resources like irrigation water are uncertain, growing a crop is getting increasingly complex, and market signals are ambiguous at best). ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 10 Considering the above factors and in support of its mandate, the SAG -SF used the following definition for smart farming: Smart Farming is data- driven, principled decision making in agricultural and food value chains occurring as multi -objective optimization in the context of global volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. Figure 1: An example of stakeholders and data flows in an agrifood system . Very small producers (i.e., smallholders) are shown apart from the system to highlight the challenges associated with making the promise of smart farming and data- driven agrifood systems in general apply to them too. Bringing about smart farming to scale requires data standardization as the need to capture, use and share massive amounts of data across the agriculture and food system - from crop input and equipment manufacturers to distributors to producers to consumers and government agencies - becomes a necessary part of doing business. Data collection and sharing is at the heart of smart farming, but not all data are equally usable. For things to work, the data must be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, or FAIR (Wilkinson et al, 2016) , and have robust and trustworthy governance mechanisms . 1.2 A note on Smart Fa rming vs Data-Driven Agrifood Systems In the course of the work of the SAG -SF it became clear that the term smart farming is interpreted very differently by different parties , and even more so in an international context. This led to some strategic moves: ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 11 1) The SAG -SF initially too k a constructionist approach to determining its scope. Starting from the mandate from the ISO/TMB resolution that created it (See A nnex A), the conveners asked members of core group and the advisory group for as many specific items they could propose that should be within (or outside) the scope of \"smart farming\" and therefore the SAG -SF. 2) The resulting set of scope items (See Annex E.1) had a scope clearly beyond the system boundaries of the farm and more consistent with the idea of agrifood systems . 3) Moreover, there are many items in scope that are important and pertain to data in agrifood system s that do not necessarily fall within the definition of smart farming presented above, but rather act as enabling technologies. An example is calculating costs of production; this is an important function of farm management information systems, but is not necessarily used in the context of principled decision- making, optimization, etc . This led to describing the scope of this work more in terms of data- driven agrifood systems , a broader and more encom passing term than smart farming or smart agrifood systems . 4) Figure 2 shows these scope descriptions in terms of a Venn diagram. 5) For all of the above , the scope of the SAG -SF and of its recommendations corresponds to the idea of data- driven agrifood systems (or which smart farming is a subset) , and that term shall be used t hroughout. Figure 2: Venn diagram showing how agrifood systems contain both agricultural - and food- related aspects, how a subset of the domain is data- driven; and how a narrower subset of these corresponds to smart agrifood systems. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 12 1.3 SAG -SF Mandate and Deliverables The ISO Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming (SAG) received a specific mandate from the TMB resolution 60 /2021 . Table 1 below parses the mandate into individual parts listed top- down in the left column. The corresponding SAG deliverable is referenced in the corresponding row of the right column. The SAG SF completed the mandate as requested by ISO TMB resolution 61/2021 and expected output by delivering its summarised findings in the form of a Roadmap on Smar t farming and presenting the following recommendations for consideration by the ISO Technical Management Board (TMB) Table 1 below summarizes the mandate given to the SAG SF as fulfilled by the SAG deliverables. Table 1 \u2014 ISO/TMB mandate to the SAG -SF, and the corresponding deliverables Mandate item Deliverable Define a set of parameters for the classification of \"Smart Farming\" for the purposes of the SAG.

Special thanks go to the leaders of the subgroups who tirelessly organized their teams to meet across time zones and moved the work forward. Many thanks also go to the ISO Secretariat staff (Monica Ibido and Blandine Garcia), as well as the Convener Support experts (Dan Berne, who elicited knowledge from experts, collated their output and was a primary contribut or to this manuscript ; and Frank Riddick, who provi ded modelling expertise and support to the subgroups). Thanks are also due to DIN and ANSI for providing working resources and submitting the original proposal, thus providing the overall strategic direction of the ISO SAG Smart Farming. This work would have been much more difficult , especially regarding collaboration management and harmonizing content creation in our multi -team , without the generous assistance of Trisotech, who provided licenses to their Digital Enterprise Suite for the whole SAG -SF team . Finally, our gratitude goes to Syngenta Crop Protection AG for its commitment to this standardization effort, including funding the Convener Support staff, procuring collaboration tools and resources, and funding time and travel related to this work. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 14 It is our hope that the body of work of the Strategic Advisory Group for Smart Farming will not only initiate a set of prioritized ISO activities but will streamline and enable future work of technical committees and subcommittees as they leverage the work produced here and strengthen collaboration among international standardization institutes in the area of data-driven agrifood systems.

The Roadmap for Smart Farming Figure 3 below summarizes key activities recommended to support the SAG -SF's objectives , in the context of a horizons model (White et al., 1999) . Figure 3: Roadmap and Horizons model for implementing ISO SAG -SF recommendations. When multiple arrows are arranged end- to-end, the rightward arrows are dependent on completion of the arrows to their left. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 16 The horizon model above serves to clarify and visualize tha t the recommendations of the SAG -SF build on each other over time, and that there are certain dependencies for their implementation. The horizon model is divided into three successive horizons and serves as a guideline for developing a strategy for short -term, medium -term, and long -term measures. Horizon 1 of the roadmap is aimed at the necessary structural changes that can be implemented or initiated in the short term and are required to adequately address the horizontal topic of the SAG -SF by ISO and thus implement the recommendations of the SAG -SF. It forms the foundation of the subsequent horizons and should be implemented within a year. The first horizon suggests a mix of themes : Internal coordination: Kicking off the proposed coordination committee and new ISO committees (see General Recommendation s 3.1.4, 3.1. 6). Partnerships: Kicking off the proposed Joint Smart Farming Landscape Group (see General Recommendations 3.1.5) , as well as an international workshop for a reference architecture for Smart Farming (See Recommendation 3.4.10) . Data Standards: Organizing an Agrisemantics Working Group within the proposed Technical Committee on Smart farming (See Recommendation 3.2.2) and pre paring reference data and semantic infrastructure standards NWIPs (for Recommendations 3.4.2 to 3.4.9) . Communications: Publishing and initiating the promotion of this SAG -SF report (see General Recommendation s 3.1.1 and 3.1.3) . Horizon 2 uses the structures created in Horizon 1 to close major identified gaps in the current ISO standardization landscape , initiating work on some major themes (e.g., Recommendation 3.4.1 regarding FAIR data, Recommendations 3.4.2 - 3.4.9 regarding semantic in frastructure, etc.) . It also includes the setting in motion of work regarding considering interoperability as part of the ISO standardization process (3.1.9) and making further progress on interoperability testing (3.1.10). Horizon 2 should also see major progress in the joint landscaping work proposed in General Recommendation 3.1.5. Horizon 3 is primarily about continuing the recommendation implementation and standardization processes begun in Horizon 2 and building upon the semantic infrastructure and as sociated standardization also merging from it. An important aspect of Horizon 3 should also be the ongoing evaluat ion of the established processes to determine whether they are sufficient to achieve the goals of FAIR data, whether all necessary stakeholders have been considered (especially smallholders), and whether work is being done at the right points with the right intensity to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals through standardizati on. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 17 3 SAG Recommendations 3.1 General Recommendations to the ISO/TMB General Recommendation 3.1.1: SAG SF Report and Recommendations The SAG recommends that the ISO/TMB accept the report and recommendations of the SAG as presented in this document and its annexes and make them publicly available. General Recommendation 3.1.2 : ISO Smart Farming Landscape The SAG recommends that the ISO/TMB accept the landscape assessment as presented using the capability/maturity model in clause 4.3 and make th is landscape publicly available on ISO's website. Gap / Rationale Access to the findings can benefit the entire global agricultural community . Digital agriculture practitioners have a long history of \"reinventing the wheel\" regarding data and data standards, in great part due to not knowing what already exists, and not understanding what may be standardized soon. General Recommendation 3.1.3 : Communication and Promotion of SAG -SF results and Agrifood Systems Standardization The SAG recommends that the ISO Communications Department develop and implement a communications plan in collaboration with the Smart Farming Coordinating Committee (see General Recommendation 3.1.4) to promote the work of the SAG SF, agrifood systems , and corresponding standards and proposed infrastructure . Gap / Rationale Planning and implementing a long -range Communication Plan can help generate interest and participation in future ISO Smart Farming standards development efforts . This extends to communication with smallholder farmers to help them not only use the data for their farming practices but to also understand the collective value of their data. The recommendation also includes putting in place mechanisms to request feedback from standards user communities regarding the standards they use , their usability, etc. as a way of enriching the results of the standardization process . ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 18 General Recommendation 3.1.4 : ISO Smart Farming Coordinating Committee The SAG recommends that the ISO/TMB establish an ISO Smart Farming Coordinating Committee (SFCC). Terms of reference: Oversee the implementation of , 3.1.7 and 3.1.8 . Identify cases of coordination needed among various ISO committees on new or existing projects Make recommendations to the committees and/or ISO/TMB for action. Work with ISO Communications on the implementation of ISO/TMB SAG -SF General Recommendation 3 .1.3 Pursue families -based methodology for finding intra- standard gaps. (Clause 6.3.3) The way this could take place is that, consulting with TC211 and other TCs as needed, the proposed Technical Committee on Data-Driven Agrifood Systems identify different families of standards that primarily involve measuring things (e.g., TC34 and TC93 analytics standards) as per Clause 6.3.3, and apply a battery of questions to test them for smart -farming- readiness / FAIR data, including: Samples are identified uniquely, and instructions are provided for parameters (e.g., depth below ground at which a soil sample is taken) and the metadata that should accompany the sample. The use of c ontrolled vocabularies of observed properties (this topic is covered in Recommendation 3.4.2 ) The use of c ontrolled vocabularies of analytical methods. The use of c ontrolled vocabulary for codes representing units of measure. Advise the ISO Central Secretariat on ISO interfaces with external organizations in relation to Smart Farming SFCC Membership: Chairs and Committee Managers of ISO committees relevant to Smart Farming (see the SAG -SF Consultative Group listing) SFCC Leadership: Convenor: To be chosen from among the SFCC members, allowing for the rotati on on a regular basis to representatives of the other committees Secretary: To be provided by ISO staff Duration: Ongoing Gap / Rationale The development of ISO smart -farming digital agriculture standards requires precise coordination among a diverse set of stakeholders, including committees ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 19 in ISO and other standardization bodies to ensure both semantic and syntactic interoperability. A steering committee can ensure that conflicts and confusion in standardization and harmonization within ISO are avoided. Inconsistent implementation of standards (by market actors) reduces the impact of those standards and causes confusion in the market. There are many ISO s tandards, for example, in TC 34 and TC 93, that define a substance or product, then define properties of those substances or products (e.g., the starch content of barley, or the sugar content of royal jelly), the sampling and analytical methods used to obt ain a value for the properties, and then acceptable ranges for those values. These standards currently do not emphasize the digitization of the data and metadata involved in these observations and measurements. This limits the smart -farming- readiness of these standards, but also presents an opportunity in the context of ISO 19156 / 7673- 2. Coor dination is needed in order to efficiently effect the necessary changes. General Recommendation 3.1.5 : External Coordination The SAG recommends that the ISO/TMB work together with the IEC and the ITU -T to establish a Joint Smart Farming Landscape Group (JSFL G). Terms of reference: Develop and maintain a comprehensi ve Smart Farming standards landscape document across ISO, IEC and ITU -T, and if possible with other relevant global standards developing organizations (for example, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Codex Alimentarius, the Institute of Electr ic and Electronic Engineers ( IEEE ), etc.) This landscape would include initia tives, standards, and terms / definitions maintained by each organization. Take into account the results of the ISO/TMB SAG -SF landscape and the ITU -T landscape document under development by the ITU -T Focus Group on \"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) for Digital Agriculture\" (FG -AI4A). Promote cooperation and coordination across organizations developing relevant global standards and make recommendat ions to the appropriate parties (e.g., ISO/TMB, IEC/SMB, ITU-T TSAG ). o Coordination needs could refer to initiatives, standards, and terms / definitions. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 20 o Examples of coordination topics include Cybersecurity ( the object of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC27, yet very signi ficant to food security ), electrification (e.g., electrical farm vehicles) , on-farm electric power generation, and rural broadband (a necessary condition for successful adoption of many of the technologies described in this report ). Duration: Ongoing Gap / Rationale Other organizations, such as IEC and ITU -T have either completed, or have underway, standards projects which address some of the challenges in smart farming. A shared standards landscape will enable strategic planning across the dif ferent organizations, reduce overlapping efforts and abate confusion in the marketplace. General Recommendation 3.1.6 : New Committees The SAG recommends that the ISO/TMB advance the suggestions on the creation of new committees as presented in clause 3.2 of this report . Furthermore, it is recommended that the ISO/TMB SFCC (see General Recommendation 3.1.4) oversee the implementation of these suggestions on behalf of the ISO/TMB. Gap / Rationale Bringing smart farming to scale requires coordinated work across the agrifood system value chain. Inconsistent implementation of standards reduces the likelihood of adoption by market actors and causes confusion in the industry. General Recommendation 3.1.7 : Internal Coordination The SAG recommends that the ISO/TMB accept the suggestions on internal coordination of existing ISO projects as presented in Clause 3.3 of this report . Furthermore, it is recommended that the ISO/TMB SFC C (see Recommendation 4) oversee the implementation of these suggestions on behalf of the ISO/TMB. Gap / Rationale Bringing smart farming to scale requires coordinated work across the Agrifood system value chain. Inconsistent implementation of standards reduces the likelihood of adoption by market actors and causes confusion in the industry. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 21 General Recommendation 3.1.8: New Data-Driven Agrifood Standards and Other Deliverables The SAG recommends that the ISO/TMB accept the suggestions on possible new ISO Smart Farming deliverables as presented in Clause 3.4 of this report . Furthermore, it is recommended that the ISO/TMB SFCC (see General Recommendation 3.1.4) oversee the imple mentation of these suggestions on behalf of the ISO/TMB. General Recommendation 3.1.9: Standards Interoperability The SAG recommends that the ISO/TMB explore the development of directives and procedures : For committees to assess and address the interoperability of their standards with other related ISO standards, during the development of new standards and in the review and revision of existing standards , and Provide guidance, in cooperation with ISO /DEVCO (given the importance of this subject area for developing countries ), for committees and ISO national standards bodies to engage the relevant stakeholders from within their countries and from other global standards -developing organizations in future ISO standards development related to data-driven agrifood systems in general and smart farming in particular . Appropriate stakeholder categories may include: o Companies (for example, crop input manufacturers , distributors, retailers; manufacturers of agricultural, irrigation, sensors; providers of environmental and remote sensing data and services, processors, food companies) o Government/regulators o Producers (large, medium and small farmers / smallholders ), buyers, advisors, test labs o Grocery stores, restaurants, consumers o Organizations that have regular c ontact with stakeholders (e.g., smallholders) that would otherwise be inaccessible, such as the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research ( CGIAR ), national agricultural research and extension services , and FAO. To instruct committees developing standards in this subject area to have a standing agenda item at their annual plenary meetings in which participating members will share their experiences, challenges and best practices on engaging this range of stakeholders (especial ly smallholders) in their national mirror committees. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 22 Gap / Rationale: Traditional liaisons among committees or joint working groups and directives on the drafting of ISO standards may not be sufficient to ensure interoperability between or among standards . Future ISO standards related to smart farming will need to engage specialized experts not currently engaged in ISO standards development, including small and medium sized enterprises. General Recommendation 3.1.10: Enable User Implementation Interoperabi lity The SAG SF recommends that ISO put into place mechanisms , including a cooperative framework with other standard s development organizations, governments and agrifood sector stakeholder communities , to enable users to ensure interoperability in their implementation of ISO agrifood- related standards. These mechanisms can take the shape of: user communities which ISO can enable and collaborate with third-party conformity assessment schemes/programme guidance (e.g., in the form of implementation standards and guidelines for self - assessment ) and simple, inexpensive software tools Gap / Rationale Maintaining effective implementation interoperability requires an ongoing conformance validation effort. Examples: AEF's for ISO 11783 ISO TR 28380 Health informatics - IHE global standards adoption The challenge is to keep a validation system inexpensive enough so that even small players can participate. Explore ways to make self -declaration (i.e. 1st party attestations ) viable and practical (e.g., accompanied by integration partner attestations ) by accommodating it in the standardization process. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 23 3.2 Recommendations for New ISO Committees Recommendation 3.2.1: Technical Committee on Data- Driven Agrifood Systems The SAG -SF recommends that the ISO/TMB implement the process to consider forming a Technical Committee to develop and maintain standards in the field of Data -Driven Agrifood Systems Terms of Reference: The scope is the big- picture, data- driven, principled- decision- making, multi -objective optimization perspective of smart farming, not currently covered anywhere else within the ISO structure. Recommend liaisons with: TC 34 Food Products o SC 17 Management Systems for Food Safety (and others) TC 207 Environmental Management TC 331 SC 2 Biodiversity: Measurement, data, monitoring and assessment TC 184 (Automation systems and integration) JTC 1 SC 41 (IoT and Digital Twin) TC 23 SC 19 (Agricultural electronics) TC 154 (Processes, data elements and documents in commerce, industry, and administration) Gap / Rationale While ISO has mult iple Technical Committees and Sub committees whose work intersects the agrifood systems domain, its current approach is insufficient to provide a comprehensive planning and management perspective that supports data- driven principled decision making in the multi -objective context of Smart Farming. This lack of a big -picture view poses two key problems: 1. In the absence of an agrifood- data-specific TC t here would not be a source for ongoing direction for the Coordination Committee (Proposed in Gen. Rec. 3.1.4 ). 2. There will be an increasing number of data- related standards in the future; fi tting them into the current ISO structure will be suboptimal, as it will tend to place the standards in TCs / SCs that lack a high concentration of agricultural data expertise. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 24 Note that the proposal is for a TC in \"Data- Driven Agrifood Systems\" as opposed to a TC on \"Smart Farming\". The proposed naming is deliberate, e xplained in Clause 1.2. Recommendation 3.2.2: Agrisemantics Working Group The SAG recommends that the proposed TC on Data- Driven Agrifood Systems c reate a working group on Agrisemanti cs (see Glossary entry in Annex F) . Terms of Reference: Quickly develop the standards described in recommendations 3.4. 2 - 3.4.9. Provide continuing expertise and standards development and maintenance associated with semantic infrastructure, semantic resources contained therein, and other relevant Agrisemantics topics. Proposed placement is under the proposed TC on Data- Driven Agrifood Systems Gap / Rationale: Agrisemantics plays a key role in preserving the meaning of data and consequently, making data FAIR. The need for expertise and standards work on this topic will only increase over time. That being said, there is a need for quick implementation of the standards in Recommendations 3.4.2 - 3.4.9, hence the recommendation for the agrisemantics topic to be initially covered by a working group. This could change over time to a subcommittee if demand justifies it. Recommendation 3.2.3: Subcommittee on Sustainability Models, Metrics and Data The SAG recommends that the proposed TC on Data- Driven Agrifood Systems c reate a sub-committee on Sustainability Models, Metrics and Data. Terms of Reference: Broadly, t he Subcommittee scope is to enable the develop ment of environmental, economic, and soc ial sustainability models for agrifood systems through data. Enable standardization of the inputs (i.e., observations and measurements) and outputs of models used to assess sustainabil ity of agrifood systems or parts thereof, including data models, standardized data exchange messages , and the semantic infrastructure ( e.g., data type registry and controlled vocabularies ) necessary to support them . ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 25 The scope of this subcommittee includes: o Standardiz ing, jointly with the Agrisemantics Working Group, the different aspects of observations and measurements (features of interest, observed properties, etc,) applicable to sustainability o Standardizing the inputs and outputs of simulation models used in the sustainability domain, since these variables fit the da ta model of observations and measurements and the user community would benefit from having their definitions available through a data type registry. o Enable prioritization through the formalization of sustainability indicators (variables) and machine- actionable methods for representing prioritization. Proposed placement is under the proposed TC on Data- Driven Agrifood Systems Recommended liaisons with: TC 207 (Environmental Management) TC 34 SC 17 (Management systems for food safety) TC 331 SC 2 (Biodiversity: measurement, data, monitoring and assessment) TC 184 (Automation systems and Integration) Gap / Rationale: One of the key challenges in sustainable agriculture is how to prioritize, measure and report sustainability problem (s), how to i mplement changes and how to measure the impact (s) when those changes are made . Where measurements or model results do exist today, they are hard to scale, intercompare / interoperate with / use. When possible and feasible, direct measurements of indicator s (i.e., variables) of concern are preferred. However, when direct measurements are not feasible or possible (especially at scale ) then surrogate measurements and/or simulation models that are properly calibrated and validated should be used. There is standardization work to do here that will likely translate into an ongoing effort of identifying properties / variables / indicators of interest, standardizing their definition, standardizing models and machine- actionable descriptions thereof, and so forth. Recommendation 3.2.4: Subcommittee on Greenhouse, Controlled Environment, and Urban Farming The SAG recommends that the TC on Data -Driven Agrifood Systems create a subcommittee to create and manage urban and controlled- environment farming- related data interoperability standards. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 26 Terms of reference Proposed placement is under the proposed Technical Committee on Data- Driven Agrifood Systems Dual scope: Data modelling, representation and exchange standards required for the operational and technological aspects of farming in controlled environments such as hydroponics, aquaponics, aeroponics, etc. Data modelling, representation and exchange standards that can support re - use of urban /industrial land for agricultural purposes (e.g., measurement of pollutants in re- used soil) as far as they are not available yet. Recommended liaisons with: JTC1 SC 41 (Internet of things and digital twin) TC 23 SC 19 (Agricultural electronics ) TC 34 (Food products), especially regarding food safety TC 268 (Sustainable cities and communities ) TC 274 (Light and lighting) TC 184 (Automation systems and integration) TC 299 (Robotics ) TC 190 (Soil Quality) especially for the second scope point. Gap / rationale Greenhouse, controlled- environment and urban farming (domains loosely represented by Figure 4) are not represented directly within ISO; neither in their operational and technological aspects, which blend automation, control, and agronomy, nor in their social aspects that pertain to land use/allocation in urban settings. Moreover, emerging methods for managing these environments rely on the models and the idea of a digital twin; the combination of these reasons suggests that establishing a long- term pool of expertise on these topics is necessary , including the necessary liaisons (e.g., with JTC 1 SC 41 for digital twin) . Figure 4: Landscape of Greenhouse, Controlled Environment and Urban Farming. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 27 Recommendation 3.2.5: Subcommittee on Livestock Activit ies Data Management The SAG recommends that the Technical Committee on Data- Driven Agrifood Systems create a subcommittee on Livestock Activities Data Management . Terms of Reference The purpose of this proposed subcommittee is to create and manage livestock data interoperability standards, especially related to the tracking and management of individual animal and herd activities (e.g., feeding, movement, diseases, etc.) Recommended l iaisons with: TC 34 / SC 5 (Milk and milk products ) TC 34 / SC 6 (Meat, poultry, fish, eggs and their products ) TC 34 / SC 10 (Animal feeding stuffs ) Gap / Rationale Livestock production is a resource- intensive endeavour . Optimizing resource use through standards is a straightforward opportunity to advance SDG s (e.g., 12) . Requirements and specifications for livestock and dairy data exchange are important not only at the commercial and scientific level, but to provide harm onization to enable governments to ensure and improve productivity. This is only possible through international standards development. TC 34 has subcommittees (5, 6 and 10) that create standards related to livestock. However, these standards focus primaril y on the determination of properties of products or substances (e.g., milk, rennet). There is no group within ISO that focuses on managing animals or herds (beyond TC23/ SC19 work on RFID identification). It is important to emphasize that animal and herd m anagement is an increasingly data- intensive activity, hence its proposed placement under the proposed TC on Data -driven Agrifood Systems. Recommendation 3.2.6: Enabling a Delegation Model of Technology Adoption The SAG -SF recommends that the Technical Committee on Data- Driven Agri -food Systems proposed under Recommendation 3.2.1 consider the Delegation Model presented in the rationale below when working on the initiatives proposed under Recommendations 3.2.2, 3.2.3 and 3.2.4. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 28 The new TC is therefore encouraged, when implementing Recommendations 3.2.2 , 3.2.3 and 3.2.4, to consider the emergence of specialists who would be engaged by producers to act on their behalf, as distinct from, and in addition to , producers obtaining s uch expertise from technology vendors. Specific considerations the proposed TC might consider is how to facilitate and optimise the work of professional service providers deploying the delegation model, in terms of standards, interoperability and outcome optimisation, especially for smallholder farmers where such a model can potentially provide significantly improved outcomes from agricultural technology adoption. Gap / Rationale: Agricultural technology adoption can be imagined in terms two approaches: Com petency transfer model : The common approach is based on producers acquiring expertise to help them make optimal decisions in agricultural technology adoption and value extraction, based on training, mentoring, coaching, consulting, or other methods of skil ls enhancement. o This approach is the \"competency transfer model\" and moves expertise to the person with the need to fulfil or problem to solve. Delegation model , which moves the need or problem to the person with the expertise. This less common approach is based on farmers and growers delegating the outcomes they want to achieve to experts, as with the tradespeople and professions mentioned above. o This approach is the \"delegation model\" and moves the need or problem to the person with the expertise. Whereas produc ers, including smallholder farmers, delegate the remedying of complex problems to sophisticated specialists such as electricians, diesel mechanics, agronomists and veterinarians, there is a lack of similar specialists in agri cultural technolo gy in general, and data management in particular, to whom producer s can delegate responsibility to achieve the produc ers' desired outcomes. This impacts the ability of many, typically smaller producers to derive the full value of data- driven opportunities. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 29 3.3 Recommendations for Internal Coordination Recommendation 3.3.1 : Coordination with TC 211 Establish a mechanism whereby TCs that create / manage standards associated with Observations and Measurements data are made fully aware of the potential of the standards created by TC 211. For this purpose, ISO might consider creating training materials (e.g., a series of short videos) to show both experts involved in standards -making on non- 211 TCs, as well as digital agricultur e practitioners, how to use the ISO 191XX series of standards. Gaps / Rationale TC 211 has created, largely through a collaboration with the Open Geospatial Consortium, a series of standards (ISO 191XX) related to geographical data and its representation. Much of the data created in agriculture has a geographical component and fits the TC 211 model well. Moreover, another large fraction of agriculture- adjacent data that one might not automatically associate with geographical data such as that pertaining to manufacturing processes, can still fit the model, referencing assets such as machinery, methods of data capture, etc . as the observations' feature of interest. Of particular importance is standard ISO 19156 related to Observations and Measurements. This abstract standard, and a corresponding agricultural implementation standard being pursued in TC 23 SC /19 WG 1, NWIP 7673 -2, provide a model for representing observations and measurements that are pervasive in agriculture . These range from scouting of field conditions to soil and plant tissue laboratory test results, to the conditions of assets such as scales and grain dryers. Recommendation 3.3.2 : Coordination with JTC 1 SC 41 Establish a mechanism whereby TCs that create / manage agronomic or other smart - farming- related standards associated with digital twins are made fully aware of the potential of the standards created by JT C 1 SC 41. For this purpose, ISO might consider creating training materials (e.g., a series of short videos) to show both experts involved in standards -making on non- 1 JTCs, as well as digital agricultur e practitioners in general, how to use the series of standards created by JTC 1 SC 41. Explore how JTC 1 SC 41 reference architecture can contribute to a reference architecture for Smart Farming (See Recommendation s 3.4.1 0 and 3.4.11) , at least to the IoT and Digital Twin - related capabilities therein. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 30 Gaps / Rationale IoT Networks IoT (the \"Internet of Things\") is a pervasive source of Observations and Measurements data in agriculture (e.g., weather data, soil water content, grain scales, sensors in commod ity storage /drying assets, etc.) Management of IoT networks in agriculture is currently mostly ad-hoc and m essy at best. As a result, there is a growing number of networks of vulnerable, difficult -to- service devices being installed in the field. JTC 1 SC 41 has done much work on this topic. IoT device metadata management at scale is also a limiting factor for agricultural applications of IoT NWIP 7673- 2 includes metadata management component, but only pertaining to data model aspects. Digital Twin Simulation of crop eco-physiological processes is a core capability in smart farming Doing this at scale is extremely complex . Challenges include: Managing multiple sets of model i nput data , e.g., for Monte Carlo analysis. Model calibration and sensitivity analysis Model validation Data fusion at different scales JTC 1 SC 41 has already done work on the digital twin topic . While this work is not specific to plant growth and development, it may be applicable to the management of ecophysiologi cal simulation model parameters. Recommendation 3.3.3 : Coordination with ISO/TC 154 Establish a mechanism whereby TCs that create / manage smart farming- related standards associated with trade facilitation including, notably, supply chain data standards , are made fully aware of the potential of the standards created by TC 154 . For this purpose, ISO might consider creating training materials (e.g., video) to introduce both experts involved in standards -making, as well as digital agriculture practitioners in general, to the range of TC 154- managed standards, which may prove useful to them. Consider whether any TC 154- managed standards should be promoted in smart farming- related work (e.g., ISO 8601). Gaps / Rationale ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 31 Many agriculture processes and data requir ements are unique to the industry. However, many smart farming practitioners are inclined to assume agriculture- industry uniqueness in areas where there is in fact shared process and data characteristics across industries. Such assumptions can lead to \"rei nvent -the-wheel\" scenarios. ISO/TC 154 coordination should reduce the occurrence or severity of some scenarios. One challenging data- continuity issue in agriculture occurs at v the intersection of input supply chain and field operations. From a systems perspective, this is the intersection of ERP / accounting / logistics systems and farm management information systems and/or farm equipment . While smart farming systems and related data management initially focussed on field operations, addressing the intersection with input supply chain is becoming increasingly important. Coordination with TC 154 will not provide immediate solutions, but TC 154 has experts that can assist in leveraging the rich set of supply chain- related standards to work toward solut ions in a steady and low -risk manner. 3.4 Recommendations for New Data-Driven Agrifood Standards and Other Deliverables Several of the following recommendations for new standards are related; F igure 5 below describes the relationships among them. Figure 5: Relationships among semantic infrastructure -related proposed standards (Recs. 3.4.2 - 3.4.9). ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 32 Recommendation 3.4.1 : FAIR Data Principles The SAG recommends that ISO launch a project to develop an international standard(s) for assessing the conf ormance of data, data exchange, and data exchange processes to the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR). This could be implemented either horizontally by Technical Committees as coordinated by the SFCC or withi n ISO/CASCO in accordance with the World Trade Organization Code of Conduct for the Preparation, Adoption, and Application of Standards. Gap / Rationale The FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016) are relatively new, but have become internationally recognized as an important mechanism for maximizing the value of data . The SAG -SF used FAIR as a proxy for assessing the smart -farming- readiness of a given standard; i.e., if the data produ ced / consumed / modified / exchanged by a system based on that standard is FAIR, then the standard is assumed to be smart -farming ready). The problem, however, is that there does not currently exist a standard for assessing the conformance of data, data exchange, and data exchange processes to the FAIR principles . Note 1: Implementing FAIR principles is necessary but not sufficient. These principles were developed in the context of publicly funded research data ; in a commercial context, data still must be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, but in a way that respects data ownership, intellectual property rights, business models, etc. Note 2: Consistent with the previous note, FAIR data is not the same as \"open\" data; the latter implies free access to all; the former does not . Recommendation 3.4.2 : Data Type Registry (Semantic Infrastructure) Develop and share a standard that defines and enables the sharing of agricultural data type definitions thorough appropriate data type registries, manifested as APIs, SPARQL endpoints, and other similar technologies. The definitions themselves can follow the model laid out in CD 7673- 2 and the registries can follow patterns laid out in ISO 19135 for administration and governance . Gaps / rationale Preserving the meaning of data in agriculture is an ongoing problem; agricultural management processes are plagued by the use of metadata- poor comma- separated- values (CSV) files and similar formats. This problem is compounded by the usual absence of unit of measure codes in the data, and, especially in the case of observations & measurements ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 33 data, in data formats' inability to capture parameters (such as the depth below ground at which a soil sample is taken) and other semantic refinements. There is work currently in progress in TC 23 SC 19 WG 1 to produce an implementation standard for observations and measurements (CD 7673- 2). While this work should provide a generalized model for data- type definitions, these definitions are only useful if the y are shared widely across the industry . Recommendation 3.4.3 : Model and Controlled Vocabulary of Crops Develop a standard to define a data model for the concept of \"crop\", representing an extended, albeit analogous version to the machine- oriented idea presented in ISO 11783- 10. This standard would recognize (at least) the following aspects of a crop: Botanical component (e.g., one or more botanical taxa) Refinement component : non-taxonomic physical and physiological features of the organism, as well as other attributes that may contextualize it in the food system (e.g., bearing a specific trait/gene, or not suitable for human consumption) Intended use component (e.g., fresh / p rocessing) Geopolitical context Enable a controlled vocabulary of these crop objects to be stored inside a registry . Make this available to the public in the form of machine- actionable data, through an electronic registry (e.g., a RESTful API). This impli es of creating a relationship with an organization that can host this registry and establish an architecture and governance system as per ISO 19135. Help put in place the community to govern the vocabulary There exists a precedent for a similar effort, established by the Verband Deutscher Maschinen- und Anlagenbau (VDMA ) to deliver a human- readable data dictionary for the ISO 11783 standard (see www.isobus.net). However, in order to enable smart farming at scale, we propose that the data are made machine- readable and machine- actionable. It is important to r ecognize that there will be geopolitical context - dependent variations. This semantic infrastructure is meant to be a reference t o which other systems can map. The registry should include mechanisms for ac tors to assert/manage relationships among different entries. This standard should be considered a candidate for the IEC-ISO Standards Machine Applicable Readable and Transferable (SMART ) program . ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 34 Gaps / Rationale The inability to unambiguously communicate something as fundamental as the crop being grown on a piece of land severely limits the ability of actors within the industry to exchange data electronically. There is a controlled vocabulary of tens of thousands of plant, animal, and pathogen species managed by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO). These \"EPPO Codes\" are distributed with a very workable license model that enables users to house the vocabulary in their own systems, and exchange data using these codes in a royalty -free way. Moreover, there exist mechanisms for adding codes to the vocabularies. Agricultural reality, though, is that the idea of \"crop\" represents more than just the botanical / taxonomic component being expressible through an EPPO code. In addition to the botanical component, the idea of a crop also includes refinements that transcend the merely botanical; for example, whether the plants involved are genetically modified, or the type of an otherwise taxonomically equivalent tomato (e.g., round tomatoes, plum tomatoes and cherry tomatoes are considered different crops in many jurisdictions, even if they refer to the same species). The intended use of the crop (e.g., grain corn vs silage; fresh vs processing tomatoes, etc.) is also relevant for the producer to properly manage the allocation of land to different uses required by contracts, etc. Recommendation 3.4.4 : Controlled Vocabulary of Phenological Stages Develop a standard for a controlled vocabulary and set of machine- readable codes to represent the phenological stages of major food, feed and fiber crops and their pests (e.g, insects) . o Organize these vocabularies hierarchically by crop (e.g., the phenological stages of maize will be different from those of cotton) o Consider an existing dataset such as BBCH as a starting point. o Include labels in different languages o Note that this is essen tially a data type definition, which could be delivered through a data type registry as described in a previous recommendation. Deliver the standard through a registry established via a cooperative agreement with another organization Help put in place the community to govern the vocabulary o There is a precedent for a similar effort, established by the VDMA to deliver a human- readable data dictionary for the ISO 11783 standard (see ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 35 www.isobus.net ). The differ ence is that, in order to enable smart farming at scale, we propose that the data are made machine- readable and machine- actionable. This standard should be considered a candidate for the IEC-ISO Standards Machine Applicable Readable and Transferable (SMAR T) program . Gaps / Rationale Many important crop management decisions, especially in crop protection, are contextualized and driven in no small part by the phenological (i .e., development) stage of the crop, and the life stage (\"instar\") of observed pests on those crops. While there exist regional variations in the scales used to represent phenological stages, there is prior work on standardizing development scales and codes in a way that lends itself to mapping between these codes and their regional equivalents. Of particular note is the BBCH set of scales available at http://www.reterurale.it/downloads/BBCH_engl_2001.pdf Recommendation 3.4.5 : Controlled Vocabulary of Field Operations Develop a standard controlled vocabulary for different types of field operations (e.g., planting, harvest, tillage) . o Organize it hierarchically (e.g., disking is a sub- type of tillage) o Include geopolitical -context -dependence in this registry, because some field operations may be specific to particular region(s). o Include labels in different languages o Note that this is essentially a data type definition, which could be delivered through a data type registry as described in a previous recommendation. Deliver the standard through a registry established via a cooperative agreement with another organization Help put in place the community to govern the vocabulary o There is a precedent for a similar effort, established by the VDMA to deliver a human- readable data dictionary for the ISO 11783 standard (see www.isobus.net ). The difference is that, in order to enable smart farming at scale, we propose tha t the data are made machine- readable and machine- actionable. This standard should be considered a candidate for the IEC-ISO Standards Machine Applicable Readable and Transferable (SMART) program . Gap / Rationale Under the general umbrella of \"you can't manage what you can't measure\", there is increasing emphasis being placed in the calculation of resource (energy, carbon, water, soil) ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 36 footprints for agricultural processes. Field operations such as tillage tend to have large resource footprints: til lage involves dragging a mechanical implement through the soil, thus consuming large amounts of energy; it also has implications on the susceptibility of the soil to erosion, entails the loss of soil moisture, etc . While there are models that allow calculating the energy consumption associated with different types of field operations (e.g., the Soil Tillage Intensity Rating, STIR associated with the Revised Soil Loss Equation, RUSLE used by USDA), this calculation cannot be performed at scale if there are no mechanisms in place for the unambiguous, automated identification of the different kinds of tillage (and, more broadly, agricultural -field operations -related) implements. Recommendation 3.4.6 : Standard machine- actionable set of units of measure codes Develop a standard or technical specification that provides an unambiguous set of machine- readable codes for units of measure, as well as rules and syntax for the composition thereof. Deliver the standard through a registry established via a cooperative agreement with another organization Help put in place the community to govern the vocabulary o There is a precedent for a similar effort, established by the VDMA to deliver a human- readable data dictionary for the ISO 11783 standard (see www.isobus.net ). The difference is that, in order to enable smart farming at scale, we propose that the data are made machine- readable and machine- actionable. This standard should be consi dered a candidate for the IEC -ISO Standards Machine Applicable Readable and Transferable (SMART) program. Gap / Rationale Codes for units of measure in agriculture are not used or shared consistently. This leads to interoperability problems. The problem becomes more complex when laboratory measurements are involved. It is important to note that there is a profusion of units of measure in regular use in agriculture and food industry, and that a system that enables users to make combinations of existing units is highly desirable. For example, to combine basic units of mass or volume and units of area to represent a crop yield per area, etc. There already exist mechanisms for doing this. On one hand, ISO 80000 defines a comprehensive system of units of measure. An example of the creation of code systems, the Universal Code for Units of Measure (UCUM) has the capability to provide codes that can be compounded. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 37 Recommendation 3.4.7 : Nonstandard unit of m easure conversions Develop guidelines for how to convert among units of measure that require ancillary information. This standard should be considered a candidate for an IEC -ISO Standards Machine Applicable Readable and Transferable (SMART) standard. Rationale Conversion among different units of measure is a common practice in agriculture. This is relatively straightforward when the units of measure involved exist in the same dimension, such as converting a value expressed in grams to kilograms. However, t here are additional levels of complexity associat ed with conversions typically found in agricultural laboratory work, where the conversions cannot occur without additional information. Two agricultural examples: Conversions of concentrations that require knowing the molecular weight of the analyte. Conv ersions frequently used when making fertility recommendations, where concentrations (e.g., parts per million) are converted to a unit of mass per unit area. This conversion requires knowledge of the bulk density of the soil, the depth of soil represented b y the sample, etc. These conversions are often poorly understood and performed incorrectly by practitioners. Recommendation 3.4.8 : Active Ingredient Reference Data Develop a standard or guideline for representing the active ingredients of crop protection products in a machine- readable way . Deliver the standard through a registry established via a cooperative agreement with another organization Help put in place the community to govern the vocabulary o There is a precedent for a similar effort, established by the VDMA to deliver a human- readable data dictionary for the ISO 11783 standard (see www.isobus.net ). The difference is that, in order to enable sm art farming at scale, we propose that the data are made machine- readable and machine- actionable. This standard should be considered a candidate for the IEC -ISO Standards Machine Applicable Readable and Transferable (SMART) program. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 38 Rationale As the pressure on producers grows to farm sustainably and in compliance with ever more complex regulations, it becomes increasingly important for the producers to accurately document their use of seed, crop protection and crop nutrition products. This is made very difficult by the lack of uniformity in product identification, and by a lack of standardization of in- field data capture . Recommendation 3.4.9 : Crop Input Product Label Reference Data Develop a standard for machine -actionable seed / crop protecti on / crop nutrition product label information regarding composition and instructions / limitations for use. This standard should build on the controlled vocabularies proposed in Recommendations 3.4.3, 3.4.4, 3.4.5, 3.4.6, 3.4.7 . Provide guidelines for implementation of a registry to deliver product reference data. This standard should be considered a candidate for t he IEC -ISO Standards Machine Applicable Readable and Transferable (SMART) program. Rationale As digital agriculture tools get more complex, the need to provide automated advice and warnings on the planned use of a given c rop nutrition product increases. There is currently no widely accepted way of expressing product use constraints (e.g., buffer zones, maximum annual active ingredient loads, maximum annual number of applications, crop rotation limitations, etc.) in machine- actionable form. Label data is complex, and the restrictions and directions for use contained therein are typically dependent on crop, pest, phenological stage (of both the crop and the pest) , soil type, and geopolitical context (e.g., country). The value of label data to dat a-driven agrifood systems is maximized if the data are standardized and machine- readable and consistent in that the vocabularies used for the abovementioned attributes are also standardized and machine- readable. Note: Unlike other reference data mentioned in previous recommendations (e.g., crop, phenological stages), which are relatively infrequently changing and for which it could be reasonably expected to have the data hosted by an industry association or other non-profit organization operating in a pre-competitive space , delivering product reference data is often a for -profit endeavor given that the data are relatively frequently -changing, geopolitical -context -dependent , and require maintenance and upkeep. For this reason , efforts are likely best expended in publishing guidelines for how to st and up a standardized reference data API or other mechanism to access the data, rather than attempt to publish it through a central system. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 39 Recommendation 3.4.10 : International workshop for reference architecture in Smart Farming. Convene an international workshop to initiate work on a standard for a reference architecture to describe generic smart farming data system characteristics, a conceptual model, a reference model and a number of architectural views aligned with the architecture descriptions defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010. The Smart Farming Reference Architecture should outline what the overall structured approach for the construction of smart farming data systems shall be by providing an archit ectural structure framework. In short, the proposed reference architecture will provide guidance for the architect developing a smart farming data system and aims to give a better understanding of such systems to the stakeholders thereof , including device manufacturers, application developers, customers and users. This effort should have the SAG -SF capability model as its starting point . This effort should be followed by the development of a data model (see Recommendation 3.4.11) . Gap / Rationale: Contemporary data- driven agriculture in general, and smart farming in particular, can be imagined as a system of systems requiring extensive data exchange both within and among systems. Interoperability (and FAIR in general) become especi ally challenging in this situation in the absence of standardized capabilities and interfaces. A reference architecture enables standardization thereof . The variety of stakeholders in smart farming is very broad, and only a small subset of them are current ly represented as ISO experts. While this is one of the motivations for Recommendation 3. 2.1 (the proposed new TC ), convening an international workshop would enable reaching a wider audience, both for their input to the critically important idea of a refer ence architecture for Smart Farming, but also as a mechanism for kickstarting, and recruiting experts to the TC for Data- Driven Agrifood Systems through exposure to ISO and its processes. Note: Clause 1.2 presented a rationale for why the SAG -SF broadened its scope beyond smart farming to data- driven agrifood systems. In that light it may seem counter -intuitive to convene a workshop and create a reference architecture standard for smart farming , but the current global context requires a bold approach to growing and processing food; enabling the de cision support and optimization aspects of smart ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 40 farming along with the broader data- driven aspects of agrifood systems seems appropriate. Recommendation 3.4.11: Standard for reference architecture for Smart Farming Develop, following the international workshop described in 3.4.10 , a standard for a reference architecture to describe generic smart farming data system characteristics, a conceptual model, a reference model and a number of architectural views aligned with the architecture descriptions defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010, and following the initial work of recommendation 3.4.10 . We recommend that this standard be developed by the proposed Technical Committee on Data -Driven Agrifood Systems , in consultation with JTC 1 SC 41, and patterned after ISO/IEC 30141:2018 (Internet of Things (IoT) \u2014 Reference Architecture) developed by that subcommittee. Gap / Rationale Contemporary data- driven agriculture in general, and smart farming in particular, can be imagined as a system of systems requiring extensive data exchange both within and among systems. Interoperability (and FAIR in general) become especially challenging in this situation in the absence of standardized capabilities and interfaces. A reference architecture enables standardization thereof. Recommendation 3.4.12: Enable Food Loss and Waste Management through Data Develop a standard for Food Loss and Waste data payloads at different stages of the supply chain . This is meant to be an enabling complement to an MSS standard on Food Loss and Waste from TC 34 SC 20. We recommend that this standard be developed jointly between the Agrisemantics Working Group of the proposed TC on Data- Driven Agrifood Systems (given its focus on data) and TC 34 SC 20. A liaison with TC 184 (for aspects related to observations in smart manufacturing) may also be desirable. Its scope should include controlled vocabularies and data objects for representing on- farm food loss (and associated disposition events where lost food is allocated to some other purpose or destination such as feeding to animals, plowing underground, composted, sent to the landfill, etc.), as Observations and Measurements as per ISO 19156 / ISO CD 7673- 2. The scop e of the proposed standard should also include dispositio n events associated with loss and waste at subsequent points of the supply chain (e.g., processors, retailers). ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 41 Gap / Rationale According to the UN's The Sustainable Development Goals Report for 2022, over 30% of the world's food is lost or wasted at some point from harvest onward . Food loss and waste (FLW) contributes to greenhouse gas production (e.g., through disposal in landfills) and food insecurity (e.g., food could otherwise be made available to vulnerable populations). Reducing this FLW could thus contribute toward making progress on the UN SDGs (e.g., Zero Hunger, Responsible Production and Consumption). Improving management of a problem such as FLW requires accurate data collection, ranging f rom observations of harvest efficiency to representing complex on-farm dynamics such as feeding a lost crop to livestock, ploughing it into the soil, etc. The ISO SAG anticipates an emergent MSS on FLW to be developed in the context of TC 34 SC 20 and believes this to be a critically important standard . ISO Management System Standards, however, tend to be abstract in nature, so an MSS on FLW is unlikely to include in its scope detailed data collection, both on- farm and in subsequent stages of the supply c hain. Accompanying an MSS with a data- focused implementation standard is likely to reduce barriers to implementation of the MSS. Recommendation 3.4.13: Standardize a data model for field boundaries, nomenclature for field boundary use, and data quality measures associated with field boundaries. Develop a standard describing a data model to represent field boundaries, their change over time, a nomenclature for their different purposes, and data quality measures usable to assess their fitness for a particular use. We recommend that this standard be developed by the proposed TC on Data- Driven Agrifood Systems in consultation with TC 211. Consider using the TC 211 concept of a simple feature (defined in ISO 191 25-1: 2004) as a starting point for representing the geographical aspects of the problem. Gaps / Rationale Although the meaning of the concept of an agricultural field or paddock (henceforth \"field\") may be highly dependent on a particular producer 's needs, a field may have multiple boundaries (imaginable as a multi -polygon simple feature, as per TC 211 nomenclature) that change over time and have different purposes. Examples of different purposes include: ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 42 nominal boundar ies used to represent the idea of the field in a farm management information system, operational or prescription boundar ies used to control planting, spreading and spraying field operations, ex-post boundaries obtained from the spatial footprint of a recorded field operation (e.g., seeding), administrative boundaries used to communicate with regulators, and spatial allocation boundaries used to allocate incoming geographical field operations work record data to a given field. A boundary used for each of these different purposes would conceivably have different data quality requirements (e.g., a prescription boundary used to control a spraying operation would typically need to be very accurate compared to a nominal boundary) . The shape of the boundaries may vary over time as a result of changing planting patterns , equipment size, land ownership or usage patterns, and so forth. Keeping accurate track of these different boundaries, determining their suitability for different purposes , and exchanging purpose inf ormation between the producer and other actors (e.g., advisor) is complex, and not currently standardized. Recommendation 3.4.14: Enable clear data contract labelling Develop a standard for a simple, usable framework for summarizing and communicating terms , conditions and privacy policies used in producer - and service- provider -facing data contracts (e.g., based on a set of graphic symbols ). The framework should be able to communicate : the types of data involved (e.g., production data, per sonally identifiable information, geographically explicit data, etc.) , aspects of intended use (e.g., whether the data are going to be sold / shared with other parties, whether the customer has the right to request deletion of the data, etc.) and what the customer receives in exchange for their data. Gap / Rationale: A lack of legal knowledge and literacy hinders informed consent and transparency (and therefore data sharing / use) associated with digital tools in agriculture, especially when smallholders are the target audience. Promoting transparency and informed consent through a simplification of the language and structure used to communicate aspects of data privacy, ownership and other terms and conditions would likely ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 43 increase adoption of smart farming tools by producers, with the concomitant increase in efficiencies and principled decision- making in agriculture. Recommendation 3.4.15: Enable electronically representing (and exchanging) the terms and features of producer -facing risk- management instruments Develop a standard for representing and exchanging risk management data, including the terms , features , contract creation and validation inputs of producer -facing instruments. Gap / Rationale: Risk management instruments (e.g., crop insurance tools based on smartphone- mediated photos, on weather derivatives, or remote sensing data) are a very promising tool for small producers to rise out of poverty and for producers of any size to be more able to invest in crop inputs and protect their business. The lack of standardization and interoperability of the data involved hinders developing and deploying these tools at scale and makes it more expe nsive and difficult for small producers to participate . Recommendation 3.4.16: Co -registration of Differential (e.g., RTK) Positioning Networks Develop a standard for the co- registration of differential positioning networks, providing clear guidance for the determination of a conventional position (including surveying guidelines) for base stations in RTK (and other differential) network s. We recom mend this standard be developed jointly by TC 211, TC 23 and the proposed TC on Data- Driven Agrifood Systems Rationale A rapidly developing aspect of smart farming is the use of multiple mobile platforms in the field, cooperating in pursuit of a common goal. For example, using unmanned aerial vehicles to observe the presence of weeds in the field, followed by the creation of a prescription, which is then used to guide an autonomous vehicle to target those weeds, either through precision application of a c hemical, or through other (e.g., mechanical) means. These operations are inherently geospatial in nature and require the use of accurate and precise determination of the direct position of equipment on the ground. This is typically performed using GNSS equipment, and increasingly, using real-time kinematic (RTK) units. While these differential systems are very precise, the accuracy of their position determinations is only as good as that of the base station used as a differential reference. If the different parts of the system that require positioning data (e.g., the GPS unit used to capture the field boundary, the GPS unit used to determine the position of the UAV, and the GPS unit to position the precision sprayer) are all using the same RTK system and bas e station, then any inaccuracies ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 44 are rendered moot for the purposes of the operation at hand (because all the units will have the same error), but if they happen to use different RTK base stations, as is becoming likelier as the market for RTK services grows, there may be significant errors, as the same feature on the ground is represented by different latitude/longitude coordinates by the different devices. Recommendation 3.4.17: Observations and measurements associated with dust. Develop a standard for representing and exchanging observations and measurements associated with the phenomenon of dust , both in terms of particles sus pended in the air, and particles present on plant surfaces . This effort is fully compatible with the ISO 19156 abstract standard and the CD 7673- 2 implementation standard currently under development, so the proposed standard implies creating controlled vocabularies for dust -related observed properties, features of interest, observation methods , etc. Gap / Rationale: Agricultural production as well as the environment has faced a serious challenge due to the phenomenon of dust caused by global warming and dehydration or drying of water resources . Dust is one of the most important atmospheric phenomena and source of natural disasters in some regions of the world. It is considered an emergent effect of climate change and is occurring more frequently in recent years , occurring in the western and southwestern regions of Iran and other countries in the region. The destructive effects of dust include reduced light reaching the plant, reducing photosynthesis, preventing the absor ption of micronutrients through foliar spraying, and as a result, reducing t he yield of agricultural products. Standardized m easurement and (data) representation of suspended particles in the air would help provide practical advice to producers and better detect and communicate when dust systems are passing through their region. ( For example, sprinkler irrigation is recommended in those situations to prevent or minimize dust damage) . Standardized measurement and (data) representation of the presence of dust on plant surface s (which is associated with a reduction of chlorophyll content ) can also be used to drive remedial action (e.g., sprinkler irrigation) and delay / pause foliar spraying, which is not recommended under those conditions . ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 45 Recommendation 3.4.18: Controlled vocabulary and data model for a hierarchical, geopol itical -context -dependent, mappable reference data system to represent actors and their roles in agrifood operations Develop a standard for a controlled vocabulary and data model for a hierarchical, geopolitical -context -dependent, mappable reference data sy stem to represent actors and their roles in agrifood operations (e.g., the actors declared in the stories of Annex E.2 , or the agricultural technology advisor mentioned in Recommendation 3. 2.6). Deliver the standard through a registry established via a cooperative agreement with another organization . Each item should include a unique identifier that enables asserting relationships among different entries. Help put in place the community to govern the vocabulary o There is a precedent for a similar effort, established by the VDMA to deliver a human- readable data dictionary for the ISO 11783 standard (see www.isobus.net ). The difference is that, in order to enable smart farming at scale, we propose that the data are made machine- readable and machine- actionable. This standard should be considered a candidate for the IEC -ISO Standards Machine Applicable Readable and Transferable (SMART) program. Gaps / rationale: Keeping t rack of the identity and role of people involved in agrifood operations is often very important, in applications ranging from payroll to occupational safety and health, to tracing back what happened during a particular operation. Socioeconomic analyses of agrifood systems also draw heavily from representing roles within the agrifood system. Modeling these roles is somewhat complex, since they are often hierarchical and geopolitical -context dependent , and t here is currently no standardized vocabulary for actor/party roles in agrifood systems, although work has been done in that direction (e.g., the CGIAR So cioEconomic Ontology, SEOnt, https://github.com/AgriculturalSemantics/SEONT ) Recommendation 3.4.19: A standard to support data exchange between crop and livestock management systems Develop a standard to enable data exchange at different spatial (e.g., farm, field and subfield) and temporal (seasonal, daily) scales between farm and livestock management ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 46 systems. Identify points of contact between these systems, model the data involved, and enable their exchange. Examples include daily pasture biomass production, grazing by the herd, water and nutrient balance, applications of manure, disposition of a lost crop as animal feed, manure pit management, etc. This standard would be developed in the context of the proposed subcommittee on Livestock Activities Data Management (Recommendation 3.2.5) , in consultation with TC 34. Gaps / rationale: There is an increasing global emphasis on reducing the resource footprint of agriculture and livestock production. Integrated crop- livestock systems can be a powerful tool to advance this idea, but w hen lifecycle analyses are performed and sustainability indicators are calculated, it is often the case that they fail to properly account for the transfer of materials and energy between crop and livestock components (e.g., a crop not suitable for sale can be fed to cattle , waste from livestock can be used to reduce commercial fertilizer use, etc. ). This is the result of a lack of standardization and of management information systems for crops and livestock having typically been developed independently and by different providers. Recommendation 3.4.20: Standard for representing provenance of agricultural inputs and calcula ting upstream energy requirements Develop a new , or adapt an existing , standard for a controlled vocabulary and framework to describe the sources, provenance, and upstream energy requirements for producing and using agricultural inputs (e.g., fuel, machinery, fertilizer, animal feed, etc.). Gap/Rationale It is relatively common to evaluate resource footprints associated with the use of agricultural inputs (e.g., diesel consumption associated with each pass over the field, etc.) but there is less emphasis on tracking, and including in decision- making, upstream embedded energy in those inputs. Lack of accounting for upstream processes can have substantial implications on assessments of net greenhouse gas emissions and sustainability. There are a number of exi sting ISO standards in the Environmental Management, Carbon Footprint, and Lifecycle assessment domains that take a unique view of upstream emissions relative to non- ISO carbon footprinting standards where these are grouped into a \"Scope 3\" category that m ay not require even a qualitative assessment. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 47 The ISO 14064 series requires categorization of upstream emissions as \"Controlled\", \"Related\" or \"Affected\", thus identifying a direct link between the management of an agricultural product and its impact. Com plexity is reduced by addressing only the conditions where a management change from a baseline condition has a material effect/impact on upstream emissions. There are, however, many gaps in collecting representative data and in standardizing inputs on a per unit of production basis. These data and quantitative approaches are needed to enable industry and consumers to make informed choices about products relative to the specific regional conditions where they were produced. For example, accurate data and comparable approaches are needed to compare concentrated protein sourced from beef cattle conversions of plant materials (indigestible by humans) on marginal lands, with protein sourced from a range of plant components grown using intensive agricultural pr oduction systems. Enhancing the capacity to make informed comparisons will help identify optimal management strategies suited to regional characteristics in support of UN SDGs, specifically 12, 13, 15. Recommendation 3.4.21 : Standard for Representing the Source, Provenan ce and Disposition of irrigation water Develop a standard for a controlled vocabulary and framework for describing the sources, provenance , and ultimate disposition of water use for irrigation. Gap/Rationale Irrigation water is an increasingly valuable and scarce resource. Moreover, irrigation water can rarely be used without some kind of environmental impact and/or tradeoff. This impact is contingent on the water's source (e.g., groundwater, snowmelt, runoff, grey water , etc.) and provenance (where/how the water was received will translate into different embedded energy) , so unambiguously representing the sources, origin / provenance and disposition of different irrigation water options would be a helpful way of making t hese tradeoffs more explicit during decision- making. This would enabl e documenting and quantifying the sustainability of irrigation with respect to UN SDGs 6, 12, 13, 14 and 15, for example. Recommendation 3.4.2 2: Standardize the data produced and consume d by fine bubble technology in agrifood systems . Develop a standard to represent the data associated with aspects of fine bubble technology that can enable its evaluation / use in agrifood systems . These aspects ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 48 include observations and measurements (e.g., of fine bubble concentration in growth solution) , and the control variables (e.g., of concentration of fine bubbles in a growth medium or irrigation water) used in managing fine bubbles , as covered by existing ISO/TC 281 (Fine Bubble Technology) standards . We recommend that this standard be developed jointly between ISO/TC 281 (Fine Bubble Technology) and the proposed SC on Greenhouse, Controlled- Environment, and Urban Farming Data. Gap / Rationale : Fine bubble technology is an area of active research in (especially controlled- environment) agriculture, with multiple known applications ranging from promoting germination, to disinfection of surfaces and promoting nutrient uptake. ISO has a technical committee (TC 281) dedicated to this domain, but its standards focus primari ly on processes for implementation of the technology, and not on representing the processes or their inputs and outputs in terms of data. Standardizing the data associated with fine bubble systems in agriculture will increase the reach of the existing TC 281 standards, paving the way for further evaluation of the technology in operational systems, as well as its use at scale. Recommendation 3.4.2 3: Standard s for machine -actionable a) data product specifications and b) data management plans . Develop a standard to create machine actionable data product specifications, and a standard for creating machine- actionable data management plans . We recommend that this standard be developed by the proposed TC on Data-Driven Agrifo od Systems jointly with TC 211 . Gap / Rationale : The ISO 19131 standard defin es data product specifications as descrip tions of a dataset or dataset series together with additional information that will enable it to be created, supplied to and used by another party. That standard provides a framework for representing these documents but falls short of making such documents machine actionable; this limits the scale at which they can be used. Additionally, t he velocity and volume of agricultural data that an even modestly sized farm must handle are ever-increasing . The lifecycle management of these data cannot be left to chance because some of it is ve ry valuable and reusable, whereas other datasets may be very voluminous and not be required beyond a certain time horizon. Being able to intentionally manage what happens to the data, where it is stored, for how ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 49 long, etc. and to do so in a data- driven way and at scale is the motivation behind wanting a machine- actionable data management plan. A good example i s the case of an agricultural technology advisor described in Recommendation 3.2.6. This kind of professional can only deliver servi ces at scale if the data flows are streamlined, the necessary data is readily available, and data that are no longer as relevant are not cluttering available storage. This motivates the need for machine- actionable data management plans. Recommendation 3.4.24: Standardized metadata for annotating multi - and hyperspectral imagery Create a standard for machine- actionable metadata for annotating multi - and hyperspectral remote sensing (satellite, UAV and ground vehicle) imagery , including specifying the data format (e.g., of tags within imagery files), the semantic resources ( data types / variables, the controlled vocabularie s required when those variables are enumerated) required, and the semantic infrastructure (e.g., data type registry) needed to distribute the semantic resources. We recommend that this standard be developed by TC 211 in consultation with the proposed TC on Data-Driven Agrifood Systems. Gaps / rationale: Multi - and hyperspectral r emote sensing images are used extensively in agriculture and livestock management for a variety of purposes. Moreover, there is an increasing interest in performing data fusion of i mages taken at different scales with different equipment such as satellites, unmanned aerial systems, and ground- based systems (e.g., sprayers and center -pivot irrigation systems ). The interoperability of these images at scale is hindered, however, by a lack of standardization of metadata regarding the spectral bands or derived products represented by the image layers . Recommendation 3.4.2 5: Update and contextualize ISO 22006 Revise the ISO 22006 standard, emphasizing enhancing and updating Annexes A and B, that provide a set of reference processes and sub- processes for describing crop production (e.g., by including risk management) . We suggest this revision be performed by TC 34, working in consultation with the proposed TC on Data -driven Agrifood Systems. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 50 Gaps / rationale: Enabling producers to formally represent the processes in their operations unlock s important strategic capabilities such as establishing management systems , from which the producers can derive multiple sources of benefit ( e.g., understanding the costs associated with the different processes in their operations , managing working capital, etc.). Farm management systems typically organize and represent production processes using an ad- hoc nomenclature, which makes it difficult for producers to exchange data with partners such as advisors, bankers, insurers, etc. The current version of the ISO 22006 standard provides an excellent list of processes and sub- processes ( for which reason it was used as a starting point by the SAG -SF to contextualize stories , standards and capabilities ), but the list is incomplete ; e.g., it does not include several data- intensive processes such as risk management . A revision that included data- related aspects would render it even more useful. Recommendation 3.4.2 6: Create a Quality management System standard for Livestock Production ( analog ous to ISO 22006) Create a standard providing guidelines for the application of ISO 9001 to livestock production. Special case should be taken with the analog of Annexes A and B of ISO 22006, because the providing a set of reference processes and sub- processes for describing livestock production is very valuable, but these processes / subprocesses differ significantly from those of crop production. We suggest this standard be created by TC 34, working in consultation with the proposed TC on Data -driven Agrifood Systems. Gaps / rationale: It is important for producers to understand the costs associated with the different processes in their operations. Farm management systems typically organize and represent production processes using an ad- hoc nomenclature, which makes it dif ficult for producers to exchange data with partners such as advisors, bankers, insurers, etc. The ISO 22006 standard provides an excellent list of processes and sub- processes (to the extent that it was used as a starting point by the SAG -SF to contextualiz e stories, standards and capabilities), but it is incomplete. A revision would render it even more useful. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 51 Recommendation 3.4.2 7: Enable smart spraying Develop a standard for a framework for automating the geopolitical-context - dependent and environmental and other context-sensitive decision of whether spraying of a particular tank mix is acceptable (\"OK to spray\") in a way that can be evaluated during the planning , preparation, and execution of a spraying operation. o Planning example : Ensure that the product application would not exceed annual maximum active ingr edient load o Preparation example: Ensure that the application is consistent with restricted entry intervals that may be active in the field. o Execution example: Wind speed has increased during the operation, and the current configuration of sprayer parameters such as boom height, pressure, speed and nozzle package is inconsistent with limiting drift to the field, given the sprayer's current position with respect to the wind and the field boundary. This standard should be developed jointly by the proposed TC on Data-Driven Agrifood Systems, and TC 23 SC 6. Gaps / Rationale Agricultural chemicals are both expensive and have can produce deleterious effects when applied off -target. It is thus a sound practice to optimize product placement, avoiding unintended drift and ensuing efficacy on the intended target . There is often tension, however, between the timing windows available for producers to apply chemicals in, and environmental and safety considerations, especially regarding the complex and multi-factorial topic of spray drift. ISO has a tool, ISO TS 11356 that enables accurately capturing the spray parameters during a spraying operation for ex-post analysis. While this may be valuable for understanding how a spray drift event or other problem happened, it does not help prevent such problems. Contemporary sprayers have the capability to adjust their operating parameters (boom height, pressure, speed, nozzles) to manage drift. In parallel, the availability of IoT- mediated environmental data (wind speed and direction, inversion conditions, etc.) as well as the capability to communicate these in real time and to run models, both on the cloud and on the machine controllers themselves, has grown significantly. A framework is needed that can bring together the need for a systematic way of representing spray-limiting conditions in real or near-real time, for modelling how the machine parameter reactions can translate into effects under those conditions, and for ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 52 solving the resulting optimization problem (i.e., for machines to change the ir operation paramet ers in real time in order to remain compliant with regulations and other limitations). This requires integrat ing multiple capabilities: Configuration management (i.e., correct nozzles), machine communicat ion, near -real-time weather data, model execution, etc.) Recommendation 3.4.28: Placeholder for enabling smart apiculture? Develop a standard to enable smart apiculture, through: o Creation of a controlled vocabulary of features of interest, observed properties, observation and measurement methods (both in-field and laboratory, and metadata variables of relevance to apiculture. o Creation of a data model and standard messages to represent the documents used in apiculture (e.g., colony inspections, management recommendations, etc.). We suggest this standard be developed jointly by the proposed Technical Committee on Data-Driven Agrifood Systems and TC 34 SC 19 (Bee Products). Gaps / rationale: Pollinators are a vitally important part of many agricultural ecosystems. In many cases, producers rely on honey bees that are managed through apiculture (i.e., beekeeping). Data-driven, principled decision-making is a good fit for apiculture, and is likely very urgently needed in many ecosystems, to assist in the management of colony health, for example. Enabling standards are needed that can thus bring the concepts and technologies of smart farming to pollinator management. Recommendation 3.4.29: Enable codification of agronomy Create one or more standards for representing, in a machine-actionable way, causal relationships in agronomy and agricultural management. This includes: o Representing input and output data variables (in accordance with Recommendation 3.4.2), including limiting factors in a given context. o Having a controlled vocabulary for models that act upon the input variables, and a data model and registry that expresses, for those models, different versions, which inputs are required, which are optional, information regarding the sensitivity of the inputs, where to go for more information, etc. o The possibility of representing mechanistic/functional models, statistical models, machine-learning models and expert -opinion-driven and indigenous-knowledge- based models in a standard, machine-actionable way (e.g., PMML, DMN, etc.) that enables model-execution-as-a-service. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 53 Gap / rationale Mathematical models are increasingly used to advise producers and other decision- makers. Using these models at scale to deliver advice in environments where there is scant availability of human capital mediated extension and advisory services is promising, but limited in part by interoperability problems, and a lack of understanding about how representative a model might be to specific conditions, and whether it captures the limiting factors correctly in a given environment. We need standards for both making the structure and functions of models clearer to their potential users and enable their use at scale. Recommendation 3.4.30 : Enable testing and learning through data Create a standard for representing, in a machine- actionable way, on-farm and on-premise (for processors and manufacturers) experiments, the variables used therein, the hypotheses being tested, and the results and learnings therefrom. Gap / Rationale: The goal of the SAG-SF has fundamentally been to make recommendations that enable using data to make better management decisions in the agrifood system. While standardization of agricultural technology is an important aspect of this, it is also important to enable stakeholders to use data to test ideas and to learn from the data. This can take several forms, including: Testing emerging digital technologies and learning about their fitness for use in solving specific problems in the context of the user, and Testing and learning from on-farm or on-premise (e.g., for a processing plant) agronomic and management experiments. Having standardized mechanisms for technology providers, advisors, non- governmental organizations, extension services, etc. to integrate the tools and data collection mechanisms supported by them with a learning framework would be very advantageous for helping make data more usable. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 54 4 Fulfilling the TMB Mandate 4.1 Mapping the TMB Mandate to the SAG Deliverables Planning the work of the SAG -SF required merging two very different categories of actors / stakeholders involved: on one hand there are the multiple stakeholders who operate in the agricultural and food domain, conducting some form of primary or supporting activity related to farming and the further processing of the products therefrom , a subset of whom is shown in Figure 1 above . on the other, there are the stakeholders in the standards domain , who conduct standardization processes such as create and review standards. This dual -domain situation was challenging because the SAG -SF's deliverable should make recommendations in the stan dards domain, but input about pain points in agricultural processes and food systems due to a lack of interoperability is primarily available through actors that operate in the agricultural and food domain. The challenge was to develop a model of knowledge elicitation and representation that lent itself to bridging the two domains. The multiple differences among the two domains, expressed in terms of who / what/ when / where / how and why questions, are shown in Table 2 below. Question Agrifood Domain Standards Domain WHO (actors) Stakeholders in agricultural and food processes: producers, agronomists, consultants, processors , retailers, etc. Stakeholders in standardization processes: ISO TCs, SCs, conveners, experts, etc. WHAT (artifacts) Data payloads Standards HOW (processes/ activities) Agricultural processes (e.g., planting, harvest, marketing a crop, examining an animal for clinical signs of disease) and food processes (e.g., further processing, supply chain management, labelling ). Standardization processes (e.g., creating a standard, performing the periodic review of a standard, conducting an international workshop, etc.) . WHEN (events) An event occurs in the context of an agricultural (e.g., crop seasons start, conditions are met for planting / harvest, a pest is detected on a crop, etc.) food process ( e.g., slaughter of an animal, food contamination, post - harvest, etc.) . An event occurs in the context of a standardization process (e.g., a standard comes up for periodic review and a vote is taken). ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 55 WHERE (systems) Infrastructure used to support an agricultural food process (e.g., equipment, software, databases, infrastructure, reference data APIs) . Infrastructure used to support standardization creation and implementation processes (e.g., the ISO11783- 10 data dictionary). WHY (goals) Goals of the actors in the agricultural and food domain (e.g., maximize profitability, sustainability, and compliance of their operations , traceability ). Goals of the actors in the standards domain (e.g., the UN Sustainable Development Goals). Table 2: Comparison between the agricultural domain and the standards domain. 4.2 Bridging the Gap with Capabilities in an End-to -End Model Bridging the gap between the two domains posed a significant challenge. The SAG determined that business capability was a useful concept to represent the domains of smart farming, as well as that of the Standards domain, and use it to connect the two. A business capability and maturity model summarized the need s in smart farming, and their relationships to processes, actors, data artifacts, etc. The capabilities identified the core skills, knowledge and access to data that were necessary for an actor within an agricultural domain. Note that these capabilities did not focus on the agricultural or communication technologies per se, as these have evolv ed over time and will continue to do so. Figure 6 below shows a fragment of the capability model, organized as a hierarchical set of capabilities and containers thereof. Figure 6: An example part of t he capability model used to organize the roadmap document Once the capabilities were derived and verified by the process diagrams (Annex E.3) , personas and/or causal loop diagrams (Annex E.4) , the subgroups mapped the capabilities to standards, SDGs, and organizations both within and outside ISO. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 56 The capability models also enabled the Organizational Perspective , which links capabilities to ISO technical committees (TCs) and subcommittees (SCs), or other, non- ISO organizations responsible for existing (or proposed) standards . The Capability Models, then, became the connecting mechanism between the Agricultural Domain and the Standards Domain. This framework, dubbed the \"End- to-end model\", is shown in Figure 7 below. Figure 7: The End -to-End Model 4.3 The Capability Model Figure 8 below shows capabilities pertaining to reference data.

Figure 11 below presents a set of support capabilities, meant to enable the customer -facing capabilities. Figure 2: Support capabilities, meant to enable the customer -facing capabilities. 4.4 Notable Emergent Properties Over the course of their work, SAG experts identified several important end results of smart farming. These are not capabilities, however, but rather as emergent properties of the use of the capabilities in an agrifood system. S ome of these emergent properties are: ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 59 Food safety Food security Food system resiliency 4.5 Linking Capabilities and SDG Targets Once subgroups identified the core capabilities for their domains , they linked those capabilities with the SDG g oals and targets. See Annex C for more details. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 60 5 Smallholder Farmers 5.1 Challenges Smallholder farms (typically <2 hectares , although the exact definition will vary by geopolitical context ) account for 84% of all farms worldwide, operating about 12% of all agricultural land, and accountable for 35% of the world's food supply. In lower -income regions, smal lholder farmers operate a far greater share of agricultural land. In Sub- Saharan Africa, for example, the average farm size is only 1.6 hectares, yet these farms account for 35% of food production regionally. ( Marie , 2022) . A promise of smart farming is to reduce the barriers to interoperability and make data- driven agronomic advice more affordable to the smallholder, which in turn c an lead to higher productivity and income , as well as reducing the food insecurity for the surrounding population. Structural and socio- economic issues , however, can hobble smallholder farmers from fully reaping the benefits of that promise . Data -driven services afford multiple opportunities to smallholders: Access to financial services, such as banking, money transfer, credit, and micro - loans Access to risk management instruments such as crop insurance Access to market data, such as product requirements, pricing/selling, buyer location Land and crop allocation optimization in planning, field operations and going- to- market Weather f orecasts and alerts Asking questions and receiving expert advice Large farms globally and smallholder farms in higher -income regions are well -positioned to take advantage of improvements in data interoperability. While broadband access remains an issue for both large and smallholder farms, smallholder produc ers face unique challenges, including: Limited access to capital for investments Disproportionate impact of climate change Lack of access to high- quality inputs , which can lower the yield and quality of crops Limited or single access to markets Greater impact from market downturns Lack of knowledge/expert service advice to optimize the use of small parcels of land ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 61 Lack of knowledge to fully understand complex legal contracts and agreements Limit ed to no broadband access , especially in Sub- Saharan Africa Issues with \"last mile\" infrastructure needed to bring technological advances to the farm Lack of open data standards Data that is hard to find, access, interoperate with , and reuse; in other words, un- FAIR Limited access to labour . The producer must thus cover all or most of the items in their value chain and are therefore caught in an activity trap and unlikely to be able to perform those functions well. Lack of availabi lity and scalability of crop advisor / agronomist services. While there is an emergence of local governmental and extension services available to small holders , the lack of interoperability in the industry limits the geographical area a crop advisor can service, and therefore increases the program costs and/or the price of the services beyond the affordability to the smallholder. 5.2 Opportunities Smart farming can, through higher efficiency and transparency in the supply chain, improve access to small quantities of crop inputs and provide access to risk management instruments . Digital solutions at scale can help smallholder farmers achieve greater participation across the Agri -food value chain, from greater access to capital to improved field operations to market access. Standardized data can help provide: Greater access to more cost -effective crop inputs (e.g., crop varieties) tailored to a smallholder's environment and field conditions Safer field operations due to better access to product safety dat a Improved soil testing and faster test results Better identification of plant stresses, nutritional deficiencies, etc . DIGITAL DISRUPTION Digital approaches are needed for accelerated and sustainable agricultural transforma tion that addresses these internal and external factors. At scale, digital disruption is driven by the collection, use, and analysis of massive amounts of agricultural data that can be digested and interpreted by advanced systems. Accessing data- driven digital transformation for smallholder farmers requires advancements in three areas: 1) last-mile infrastructure, 2) open standards, and 3) contextually rel evant software services Antoinette, Marie. 2022. Addressing the Digital Divide for Smallholder Farmers . ALI Social Impact Review (harvard.edu) . ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 62 Decision support tools and highly contextualized expert help which are unavailable at scale to smallholders today. Understandable c ontract language, including icons, increas ing transparency in business transactions. Moreover, the i mpact of higher efficiency and transparency can go beyond the farm, and trickle over to non- farmer consumers . Likewise, access to standardized product data can help local suppliers and agents provide better products and services to their smallholder customers. 6 Background , Structure and Function of the SAG 6.1 SAG Structure The ISO Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming (SAG SF) was approved by the TMB in June 2021 with its mandate and membership defined by TMB Resolution 60/2021. The SAG SF Secretariat launched 4 calls for nomination in July 2021. For the SAG -SF core group: Call for experts nominated by TMB members Call for experts nominated by non- TMB members Call for experts nominated by SMB and IEC members For the SAG -SF consultative group: Call for experts opened to all ISO committees list ed in TMB resolution 60/2021, in addition to ISO/CASCO, ISO/COPOLCO and interested IEC committees The calls for experts highlighted the opportunity to include additional experts for domain specific subgroups working on the scope items identified by the SA G SF activities and strived to ensure a balanced geographical representation to promote the participation of developing countries in this important area. It was composed of over 140 experts from twenty -one national standards bodies, organized into a Core G roup comprised of ISO member country representatives, a Consultative Group of representatives from ISO committees, and nine domain- specific subgroups with experts designated by national standard body and ISO committee representatives (see Figure 12). ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 63 Figure 3: SAG -SF Structure. There are 21 representatives from ISO member countries in the Core Group ( one each from and one representative of the IEC SMB , for a total of 22 members . See Annex B for the Core Group composition. The Core Group met 15 times over the term of its mandate. It benefitted from the input of its Consultative Group, which met 11 times over the same period. The SAG SF had a liaison with CGIAR the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research A collaboration with ITU -T Focus Group on \"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) for Digital Agriculture\" (FG -AI4A) The Consultative Group had representatives from 35 ISO committees (TCs and SCs , see Annex B ). The Consultative Group provided valuable input as to how work from ISO TCs and SCs might support smart farming , the availability of standards to support specific busine ss capabilities, and known difficulties and \"hotspots\" in their domain. See Annex B for the Consultative Group composition The nine Subgroups, which were composed of members of the core group and the consultative group, recruited via a call for experts, wo rked on specific aspects related to Smart Farming. All Subgroups were reporting to the SAG SF core group at each meeting, through their 'Chairs and co- Chairs', appointed on a voluntary basis by the SG members. See Annex B for the Subgroups ' composition. The domains addressed by the subgroups were (listed by subgroup number , and shown in Figure 13 ): 1. Crop Production 2. Livestock ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 64 3. Urban Farming 4. Climate and Environment 5. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) 6. Terminology and Semantics 7. Social Aspects 8. Data 9. Supply Chain Figure 4: Visualization of the structure of the SAG, showing the two different kinds (\"vertical\" and \"horizontal\") of subgroups within the SAG, ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 65 6.2 The Role of Standards Standards are \"recipes for reality\" . When the y are shared across an industry they typically pave the way for scalability in technology adoption. However, and despite decades of good standardization work in multiple agri food technologi es, the data standardization landscape is still fragmented and incomplete. The SAG focused on tackling the challenge of data interoperability so that smart farming practices and solutions can be brought to scale across agrifood systems. In this context, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) chartered a Strategic Advisory Group for Smart Farming (SAG). This group of over 140 experts from 21 countries worked over eighteen months to 1. document the landscape of standards pertaining to smart farming 2. document the gaps in that landscape and assess their impact on ISO' s ability to make (and measure) progress toward the UN Sustainable Devel -op-ment Goals (SDGs); and 3. make prioritized recommendations for action. 6.3 Multiple Methodological Perspectives Three different perspectives enabled the SAG to structure and view their work through different points of view and activities. 6.3.1 The Scope Item Perspective Since the definitions of smart farming vary widely and available time was limited, the ISO SAG on Smart Farming decided to take a bottom -up approach in the form of a sur vey of what should be in scope. To this end, the experts in the Core and Consultative groups provided over 300 topics, or \"scope items\" (See Annex E.1) , that represented ideas they considered to be in scope of smart farming, as well as topics that they exc luded. The scope items ranged in complexity and granularity, from \"Fertilizer\" to \"Greenhouse gas emissions (CO 2) / unit of production\" to \"Methods and models for using ontologies to facilitate interoperability,\" but generally aligned to one or more proces ses / sub- processes (as per the ISO 22006 Annex A/B nomenclature). The scope item perspective seeks to identify underlying processes implicit within a scope item provided and serves as an enabler for the Process perspective as well as a basis for the deriv ed subgroup topics (see Figure 14). ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 66 Figure 5: Categories and sub- categories of the scope items elicited from experts to determine scope of the SAG. 6.3.2 The Process Perspective Experts in the SAG's subgroups reviewed the ISO 22006 reference lists of processes and sub-processes (Annex A in that standard) and to propose modifications to those lists as needed to more accurate ly describe the reality of the domain they were working in. While the SAG's ultimate aspiration was to have a single list of processes, this may prove of diminishing returns, e.g., attempting to force the processes and subprocesses at work in crop farming and those from livestock production into a single framework. Along with the revision of those processes, the experts were asked to write stories (in narrative form), and to annotate those stories in a way that can answer fundamental who, what, when, where, how and why questions. This work was done using a tool called the Triso tech Discovery Accelerator (Figure 15 ), which shows the annotations very explicitly. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 67 One of the annotation types in Discovery Accelerator is the artifact , which corresponds to the what questions, and is used to represent physical objects and data artifacts. One of the objectives pursued by providing experts with the Discovery Accelerator w as to motivate discussion and enable the groups to quickly identify and reflect upon the actors (the who) involved in the processes, the activities ( how) they perform, the events that trigger those activities ( when), the actors' goals ( why), the systems th e activities take place in (the where), and the data payloads ( what ) involved in the processes under consideration. Figure 6: Example of the Discovery Accelerator Text view from the Crop Production Subgroup. Once this exercise wa s completed, a subgroup identified a subset of stories that merited representation in the form of a BPMN diagram ( Figure 16), where actors, activities, events, systems and artifacts are explicitly and unambiguously shown. At this point, where data exchanges are laid out explicitly, it is possible to shift to the standards perspective. Figure 7: Example of a BPMN created by the Crop Pro duction Subgroup ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 68 6.3.3 The Standards Perspective This perspective identified standards which might be relevant to a particular context. These candidate standards were gap- checked against the criteria used to determine relevance to Smart Farming. This per spective was key, as it is the one that all others ultimately lead to. The Core Group developed hypotheses for determining if a standard is smart -farming- ready: i. The smart -farming- readiness of a standard can be assessed using a simple set of questions. ii. Standards can be grouped in families, such that the questions needed to establish smart -farming- readiness are the same for all standards in a family. iii. Placing a standard within an existing family can be done using a simple set of questions. iv. Families of standards can be identified by classifying on some set of attributes of the standards contained therein. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 69 7 Key Findings from the SAG Subgroups 7.1 SG1: Crop Production Scope: The subgroup identified the s tandards/definitions required for: data categories (reference data, setup/master data, configuration data and field operation data) crop types soil types crop field identification and crop field boundaries multi - and hyperspectral imaging data struct ure (class model) for the exchange of crop related operations that were carried out in the field. connection to process computers for climate control for storing batches of produce Insights: There are no smart -farming specific standards or definitions ex isting for reference data, setup/master data, configuration data and field operation data etc. Such definitions and standardisation are required internationally for: o data categories (reference data, setup/master data, configuration data and field operation data) o crop types o soil types o crop field identification and crop field boundaries o multi and hyperspectral imaging o data structure (class model) for the exchange of crop related operations that were carried out in the field. o connection to process computers for climate control for storing batches of produce Items which may be addressed by future ISO efforts: consideration of drones in the application of products, as well as other uses in crop production (payload, duration, flight permissions, receiv e precise maps, applicable to small holders as well as drone and robot information in agriculture) continuation of the work that ISO is doing with s mart irrigation sensors and dosing/fertigation/fertilisation water testing/water quality ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 70 integration of environmental data into autonomous control systems field sanitation data exchange with climate control systems trade agreements Organisations with which ISO should engage to help develop standards in crop production AgGateway AEF - Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation CropLife Organisation Agro -EDI-Europe European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO) Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) - Global Sustainability Standards Board (GSS B) GS1 Kuratorium f\u00fcr Technik e. v.

This also extends to urban and vertical farming's ability to serve remote communities that have limited access to fresh food, due to environmental conditions or geographical location. Urban farming processes are extremely compl ex and require a data- driven system. There are different levels of maturity in the industry regarding automation, interoperability, etc. There are m any core linkages and commonalities between the various type s of Urban Farming , especially on the most common types , such as those listed above. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 72 These linkages may also extend to traditional farming, (e.g., sterilization of the soil being analogous to tray sterilization). From an automation perspective, urban farming systems, ranging from sunlight / soil - based, to fully artificially lit, have similar data collection and process control requirements , and interoperability challenges . Standardizing the Observation. Insights in relation to urban farming and smart farming : While there are a wide range of urban farming types, higher volume mechanized/automated product (i.e.: hydroponics) have unique aspects and requirements compared with terrestrial or rooftop farming, which are more closely related to traditional broad acre farming. 7.4 SG4: Climate and Environment Scope: inputs / resources, e.g. water, nutrients, energy quality / health, e.g. impacts on soil, water, air, biodiversity resilience / adaptation / sustainability production efficiencies, e.g. grams of protein or CO2e per kilogram of product This group recognized the overarching or horizontal context of the scope and focused on identifying \"hot spots\" that overlay the wide range of specific topics identified by the Crop Production, Animal Products and Urban Farming subgroups. Insights: Optimizing agricultural systems in unique environmental contexts requires standardization of inputs, processes and outputs to make efficient use of resources while minimizing advers e impacts beyond managed system boundaries. For example, inefficient management of nitrogen inputs results in the release of potent greenhouse gas emissions of nitrous oxides, as well as damage to freshwater systems by eutrophication. Impacts will have varying degrees of severity that will be influenced by the type of hotspot driver, as well as the vulnerability of the broader environmental context , e.g., whether a constraining threshold is exceeded to trigger a non- linear response. The ISO/TC 207 (Envir onmental Management ) have developed 64 published standards and are developing 14 new standards to address environmental and climate impacts aspects of UN SDG 13. However, their application to agricultural production systems has been limited. In addition, data needed to characterize agricultural production systems in regional contexts is very limited, very diverse, and in some cases, only available behind paywalls. Standards with direct applicability to smart farming / data-driven agri food initiatives can b e found within ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 73 subcommittees: Environmental Management Systems (SC 1), Life Cycle Assessment (SC 5), Greenhouse Gas and Climate Change Management and Related Activities (SC 7), including Carbon Footprints, Water Footprints, Adaptation to Climate Change, Land Degradation and Desertification, Circular Economy Coordination and Carbon Neutrality. 7.5 SG5: Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) Scope: production equipment and sustainable agriculture autonomy and interoperability autonomous vehicles drones robot ics data co-registration of different sources of position data interoperability and data management smart spraying of crop protection products machine- to-machine data transfer machine- to-cloud data transfer equipment compatibility sensors, IoT, and AI Insights : The development and application of intelligent agricultural equipment and unmanned agricultural machinery are developing rapidly around the world. The software, hardware, and data interfaces and formats used by various R&D and production institutions vary widely. The development of intelligent sensors, control systems, data, and network, cloud platform and other international standards. ISO standards should consider the agricultural development of less developed countries, and r elevant standards for low -cost smart equipment should be formulated. 7.6 SG6: Terminology and Semantics Scope: standardized terminology vocabulary and syntax ontology semantics ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 74 sustainability metrics (FAIR) data principles (f indable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) CARE data principles (collective benefit, authority to control, responsibility, ethics) units of measure certificates While other subgroups were writing stories about the activities and proces ses of their stakeholders, this subgroup extracted, developed, and recorded the terminology related to smart agriculture based on the relevant scientific sources and recorded them in the appropriate software. The subgroup assembled over 200 terms in the Tr isotech knowledge entity accelerator . Insights: smart farming is dependent upon the ability to provide consistent syntactic and semantic interoperability controlled vocabularies are key to allowing for geopolitical context without overburdening a semantic infrastructure 7.7 SG7: Social Aspects Scope: conflicts health and safety contracts education training access to data market economic agronomic supply chain legal labour policies, practices, and availability data ownership and privacy Insights : ISO Agrifood standards should be written with low -income country smallholder farmers and agribusiness entrepreneurs in mind. Application of Agri -technology in the developing world is essential to achieving the SDGs, but standards are oft en written ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 75 for better educated and well capitalized farmers and agribusinesses in industrialized countries. Agrifood standards should take into account the health, safety and quality of life concerns of non- farm rural residents and those who come to the c ountryside for recreation. Agrifood standards should explicitly be developed to encourage trust among farmers, agribusinesses and government agencies that could benefit from access to farm data. \"Big Data\" has the potential to improve food security and environmental performance, but that potential can be achieved only if farmers trust those who aggregate and analyse data. Improved standards for anonymizing data would help; even so, commodity buyers might use supply information to manipulate prices . input suppliers could target those areas where growers are in urgent need of specific inputs and governments could use the data in regulatory enforcement. ISO standards should be developed to enable collection, sharing and analysis of farm data for policy development in areas such as: farm labour, agricultural energy use, water use, greenhouse gas emission, field biodiversity, food waste, and land tenure 7.7.1 Food Loss/Food Waste Insights: Due to a lack of data and standardized ways to measure food loss, f arm-level losses aren't as visible and have less economic value than consumer food waste. Growers can use data specific to their farm using the same method to determine which of their crops may have the potential for higher utility and possible profit. (Johnson, L.K., Dunning, R.D., Gunter, C. C., Bloom, J. D., Boyette, M.D., Creamer N.D. (2018) Field measurement in vegetable crops indicates need for reevaluation of on farm food loss estimates in North America. Agricultural Systems ,167, 136- 142). Interoperable, shared data is required to meet the preferred paths of preventing food loss. As shown in Figure 17 below. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 76 Figure 8: Factors impacting food loss 7.8 SG8: Data Scope : The main task of Subgroup 8 (Data) was to make recommendations on data standardization, activities and priorities in the scope of smart farming, actively working on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while taking into account the interests of small landowners . Subgroup 8 developed a work plan based on a Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN) diagram used to create a process model and putting forward the ISO reference framework of \"physical layer - base layer - service layer - analysis layer - application layer\" for s mart farming. Subgroup 8 built a capability model (merged into the model of Clause 4.3) and used it to analyze metadata and process views of smart farming. The group focuses on data exchange involved in agricultural production, combing and analyzing the current situation and gap s in existing standards. Subgroup 8 successfully held 20 group meetings and used Trisotech Discovery Accelerator to write and analyze 86 stories that were created by other ISO working groups (based on ISO 22006); 216 metadata notes and 124 notes on data-related process were preliminarily confirmed, and 173 potential standard gaps were found. ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 77 Insights: Data is the core of smart farming; however, currently, agricultural production needs a complete standard system of data coding, dat a security and data sharing. The lack of a standardized, globally accepted and used data model for agriculture is a major gap. Recommend more focus on this and identification of motives that help to develop and maintain the model. Standard(s) for reference data are a key gap. Standard system is needed on data coding, data security and data sharing. Basic data standards are needed Data standards among agriculture, processing industry and commercial are needed. o Emphasize on enterpr ises o Emphasize on standardization organization and industry associations. o Emphasize on the Media 7.9 SG9: Supply Chain Domain A supply chain is a network of facilities that procure raw materials, transform them into intermediate goods and then final products to customers through a distribution system. It includes storage and brokerage. It refers to the network of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in delivering a product or service to a consumer. Supply chain activities involve the transformation of natural resources, raw materials, and components into a finished product and delivering the same to the end customer [ adapted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain ]. Scope: food production food transfer and distribution agriculture horticulture fiber production (e.g., cotton) biofuel production (e.g., ethanol) animal products (e.g., fish, pork, beef, honey, dairy) ISO / TMB / SAG SF - Strategic Advisory Group on Smart Farming Final Report - January 2023 78 Insights: traditional agricultural supply chains are well -understood supply many of the processes and principles of supply chain for smart farming are the same as for any other industry the complexities of the smart farming supply chains are on par with those of ot her industries recent examples of supply chain disruptions indicate the need for supply chains with increasing flexibility 8 References Johnson, L.K., Dunning, R.D., Gunter, C.

These 17 goals , shown in Figure 9 below, emerged from the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by the UN Member States in 2015, and serves as a valuable blueprint and framework for discussing global sustainable development. Figure 9: The 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) The SDGs are part of a tiered system, where each of the 17 goals has one or more targets (see \"SDG target\" entry in the Glossary for more detail) that may describe either desired outcomes (denoted as x.y, where x is the number of the goal and y is a number (e.g., \"1.2\")) or means of implementation (denoted as x.z, where x is the number of the goal and z is a letter (e.g., \"1.a\") . The ISO -SAG was made aware of Guide 82: 2019, Guidelines for addressing sustainability in standards , which led us , seeking to maximize specificity and the usefulness of the corresponding recommendations , to map capabilities and standards to the target level in Annexes C and D rather than to the SDGs themselves. The list of targets, their alignm ent with the SAG -SF scope, and notes about their relationship with the SAG -SF capabilities and recommendations follows below. 92 SDG Targets SDG Target Description Alignment with SAG scope Rationale 1.2 By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions MEDIUM Many of the capabilities considered by the SAG-SF, and the recommendations resulting from them, target smallholders directly or indirectly. 1.4 By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance HIGH Many of the capabilities considered by the SAG-SF, and the recommendations resulting from them, target smallholders directly or indirectly. In the case of this particular target, access to new technology, financial services and microfinance (and the data privacy policies and terms and contions that underlie them) are the object of several recommendations in Clause 3.4. 1.5 By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate -related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters MEDIUM Many of the capabilities considered by the SAG-SF, and the recommendations resulting from them, target smallholders directly or indirectly. In the case of this particular target, increased access to risk management instruments and enabling decision support capabilities are the object of several recommendations in Clause 3.4. 1.a Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions LOW Although the topic intersects data -driven agrifood systems, the strong policymaking component made it less compatible with the SAG -SF scope (SAG -SF experts f lagged policy and regulation as NOT in scope). 1.b Create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, based on pro -poor and gender - sensitive development strategies, to support accelerated investment in poverty eradication action LOW Although the topic intersects data -driven agrifood systems, the strong policymaking component made it less compatible with the SAG -SF scope (SAG -SF experts flagged policy and regulation as NOT in scope). 2.1 By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round MEDIUM Enabling data -driven mechanisms to increase productivity, income, sustainab iliy and compliance at scale for producers both large and small is a core part of the work of the SAG -SF. Increasing access includes out - of-scope policy considerations, but is enabled by capabilities such as improved logistics and supply -chain traceability . 93 2.2 By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons LOW Although the topic intersects data -driven agrifood systems, the strong policymaking component made it less compatible with the SAG -SF scope (SAG -SF experts flagged policy and regulation as NOT in scope). The standards -actionable aspects seemed concentrated in 2.1 2.3 By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small- scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment HIGH Enabling data -driven mechanisms to increase productivity, income, sustainability and compliance at scale for producers both large and small is a core part of the work of the SAG -SF. 2.4 By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality HIGH Enabling data -driven mechanisms to increase productivity, income, sustainability and compliance at scale for producers both large and small is a core part of the work of the SAG -SF. 2.5 By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild s pecies, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international levels, and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associ ated traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed HIGH The SA G-SF emphasis on semantic infrastructure , making data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR), and accurate field operations recordkeeping will enable this target. 2.a Increase investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks in order to enhance agricultural productive capacity in developing countries, in particular least developed countries MEDIUM Semantic in frastructure, a core theme of the SAG -SF, increases the value of these resources and perhaps can translate into increased investment. 94 2.b Correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the parallel elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect, in accordance with the mandate of the Doha Development Round LOW Although the topic intersects data -driven agrifood systems, the strong polic ymaking component made it less compatible with the SAG -SF scope (SAG -SF experts flagged policy and regulation as NOT in scope). 2.c Adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility MEDIUM Enabling better traceability and data interoperability throughout the supply chain is an emergent property of the recommendations of the S AG-SF. (See Clause 4.4 for more detail on the concept of emergent property. ) 3.9 By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination MEDIUM This target is enabled by interoperability of observations and measurements (in this case, of pollutants in the air, water and soil), and by better tracking of the field operations such as application of crop inputs, both core themes of the SAG -SF. 3.d Strengthen the ca pacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks MEDIUM This target is enabled by interoperability of observations and measurements (in this case, of contaminants, pathogens, etc.), a core theme of the SAG -SF. 4.3 By 2030, ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university LOW Although the topic intersects data -driven agrifood systems, the strong policymaking component made it less compatible with the SAG -SF scope (SAG -SF experts flagged policy and regulation as NOT in scope). 4.4 By 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship MEDIUM The general recommendations 3.1.3 and 3.1.10 are meant to enable greater understanding by (current and prospective) practitioners of the value and ap plicability of standards to different parts of the agrifood systems domain. There is also a recommendation (and corresponding capabilities) about enabling better learning from on -farm research and technology adoption. 4.5 By 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situations LOW Although the topic intersects data -driven agrifood systems, the strong policymaking component made it less compatible with the SAG -SF scope (SAG -SF experts flagged policy and regulation as NOT in scope). 95 4.b By 2020, substantially expand globally the number of scholarships available to developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States and African countries, for enrolment in higher education, including vocational training and information and communications technology, technical, engineering and scientific programmes, in developed countries and other developing countries LOW Although the topic intersects data -driven agrifood systems, the strong policymaking component made it less compatible with the SAG -SF scope (SAG -SF experts flagged policy and regulation as NOT in scope). 5.a Undertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, financial services, inheritance and natural resources, in accordance with national laws LOW Although the topic intersects data -driven agrifood systems, the strong policymaking component made it less compatible with the SAG -SF scope (SAG -SF experts flagged policy and regulation as NOT in scope). 6.3 By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally MEDIUM This target i s enabled by interoperability of observations and measurements (in this case, of pollutants in the water), and by better tracking of the field operations such as application of crop inputs, both core themes of the SAG -SF. 6.4 By 2030, substantially increase water -use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity MEDIUM This target is enabled b y interoperability of observations and measurements (in this case, of water content, pumped water, water levels, and evapotranspiration model inputs and outputs), and by better tracking of the field operations such as application of irrigation water and cr op harvest, all core themes of the SAG -SF. 8.3 Promote development -oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro -, small- and medium -sized enterprises, including through access to financial services LOW Although the topic intersects data -driven agrifood systems, the strong policymaking component made it less compatible with the SAG -SF scope (SAG -SF experts flagged policy and regu lation as NOT in scope). 8.4 Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10 -Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production, with developed countries taking the lead HIGH This target is enabled by interoperability of observations and measurements (in this case, of nutrient levels, water content, crop and livestock conditions, etc.), and by better tracking of the field operations such as application of irrigation water, crop nutrition and crop protection products, as well as crop harvest, all core themes of the SAG-SF. 96 9.3 Increase the access of small -scale industrial and other enterprises, in particular in developing countries, to financial services, including affordable credit, and their integration into value chains and markets MEDIUM Many of the capabilities considered by the SAG-SF, and the recommendatio ns resulting from them, target smallholders, their advisers and manufacturers and distributers of inputs and tooling, directly or indirectly. In the case of this particular target, access to new technology, financial services and microfinance (and the data privacy policies and terms and contions that underlie them) are the object of several recommendations in Clause 3.4. 9.4 By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource -use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities MEDIUM The theme of enabling interoperable observations and measurements, standardi zing asset health reporting and enabling process formalization through data product specifications are all aspects of the work of the SAG -SF. 9.5 Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending MEDIUM Stand ardization contributes to the upgrade of technological capabilities. The capabilities associated with data- driven agrifood systems were the focus of the SAG-SF. 9.b Support domestic technology development, research and innovation in developing countries, including by ensuring a conducive policy environment for, inter alia , industrial diversification and value addition to commodities LOW Although the topic intersects d ata-driven agrifood systems, the strong policymaking component made it less compatible with the SAG -SF scope (SAG -SF experts flagged policy and regulation as NOT in scope). 12.1 Implement the 10 -Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns, all countries taking action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries MEDIUM This target is enabled by interoperability of observations and m easurements (in this case, of nutrient levels, water content, crop and livestock conditions, etc.), and by better tracking of the field operations such as application of irrigation water, crop nutrition and crop protection products, as well as crop harvest , all core themes of the SAG-SF. 12.2 By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources HIGH This target is enabled by interoperability of observations and measurements (in this case, of nutrient levels, water content, crop and livestock conditions, etc.), and by better tracking of the field operations such as application of irrigation water, crop nutrition and crop protection products, as well as crop harvest, all core themes of the SAG-SF. 97 12.3 By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post -harvest losses HIGH The SAG -SF considered food loss and waste an important topic, considered in the capability model and in one of its domain recommendations. 12.4 By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment MEDIUM This target is enabled by interoperability of observations and measurements (in this case, of nutrient levels, water content, crop and livestock condi tions, contaminants in the air, soil and water, etc.), and by better tracking of the field operations such as application of irrigation water, crop nutrition and crop protection products, as well as crop harvest, all core themes of the SAG-SF. 12.6 Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle LOW Although the topic intersects data -driven agrifood systems, the strong policymaking component made it less compatible with the SAG -SF scope (SAG -SF experts flagged policy and regulation as NOT in scope). This IS enabled by greater interoperability, however. 13.2 Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning LOW Although the topic intersects data -driven agrifood systems, the strong policymaking component made it less compatible with the SAG -SF scope (SAG -SF experts flagged policy and regulation as NOT in scope). 13.b Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change -related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing States, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities LOW Although the topic i ntersects data -driven agrifood systems, the strong policymaking component made it less compatible with the SAG -SF scope (SAG -SF experts flagged policy and regulation as NOT in scope). 14.1 By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land -based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution MEDIUM This target is enabled by interoperability of observations and measurements (in this case, of nutrient levels, water content, crop and l ivestock conditions, contaminants in the air, soil and water, etc.), and by better tracking of the field operations such as application of irrigation water, crop nutrition and crop protection products, as well as crop harvest, all core themes of the SAG-SF. 15.1 By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements MEDIUM This target is enabled by interoperability of observations and measurements (in this case, of nutrient levels, water content, crop and livestock conditions, contaminants in the air, soil and water, etc.), and by better tracking of the fie ld operations such as application of irrigation water, crop nutrition and crop protection products, as well as crop harvest, all core themes of the SAG-SF. 98 15.2 By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt de forestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally MEDIUM This target is enabled by interoperability of observations and measurements (in this case, of nutrient levels, water content, crop and livestoc k conditions, contaminants in the air, soil and water, etc.), and by better tracking of the field operations such as application of irrigation water, crop nutrition and crop protection products, as well as crop harvest, all core themes of the SAG-SF. 15.3 By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation -neutral world MEDIUM This target is enabled by interoperability of observations and measurements (in this case, of nutrient levels, water content, crop and livestock conditions, contaminants in the air, soil and water, etc.), and by better tracking of the field operations such as application of irrigation water, crop nutr ition and crop protection products, as well as crop harvest, all core themes of the SAG-SF. 15.6 Promote fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and promote appropriate access to such resources, as internationally agreed MEDIUM The SAG -SF emphasis on semantic infrastructure, making data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR), and accurate field operations recordkeeping will enable this target. 16.6 Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels LOW Although the topic intersects data -driven agrifood systems, and is enabled by better data findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability, the strong policymaking component made it less compatible with the SAG -SF scope (SAG -SF experts flagged policy and regulation as NOT in scope). 17.7 Promote the development, transfer, dissemination and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on favourable terms, including on concessional and preferential terms, as mutually agreed MEDIUM The general recommendations 3.1.3 and 3.1.10 are meant to enable grea ter understanding by (current and prospective) practitioners of the value and applicability of standards to different parts of the agrifood systems domain. There is also a recommendation (and corresponding capabilities) about enabling better learning from on-farm research and technology adoption. 17.16 Enhance the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development, complemented by multi -stakeholder partnerships that mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources, to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in all countries, in particular developing countries MEDIUM This data is enabled by good -quality, timely data.

The Discovery Accelerator allowed subgroup members to answer the Who, What, When, Where, How and Why questions for any given process. These became the basis for generating the BPMN diagrams. In the stories, an Activity denotes how things get done; the Actor identifies who is involved in getting things done; the Artifact denotes what is involved in getting things done; the Event is when are things getting done; the System is where getting things done takes place; and the GOAL is why things are getting done. The stories led directly to the development of Business Process Management Notation (BPMN) diagrams shown in the section following. Story: Expert or crop monitoring services Expert receives an order from the farmer to inspect one or several fields. Expert arranges a date to visit the field. Expert alone or in company of the farmer visits the fields and decide what needs to be done and sends the data of what they determine is required to the farmer's FMIS (fertilizer, plant protection product, machines to be used, application rates etc.). Crop monitoring data are sent regularly to the farmer as text message or are directly pushed to the FMIS of the farmer . Story: Application of fertilizer and crop protection products Farmer consults experts to get an application map for fertilizer and plant protection products application Farmer defines an application map for the fertilizer and plant protection products in his FMIS . 118 The FMIS connects to a cloud database with relevant data about the crop protection products that are allowed to be used for this specific crop, in this specific time of the year and in this specific region. Farmer contacts an online forecast service to check the weath er. Farmer exports the application map from the FMIS to the machine terminal . Farmer identif ies the fertilizer or plant protection products when filling the fertilizing or spraying machine by scanning the QR -code on the product label . Farmer applies the fertilizer or plant protection products on the field based on the application map . Machine terminal logs data by the machine (e.g. time, geolocalisation, used machine, used product, application rate, temperature , air humidity, crop images etc.) during work. Farmer imports the logged data of the field work (e.g. machinery used, amount and type of seeds, fertilizer, plant protection product amount and dosage, etc.) into the FMIS . Used fertilizer or plant protection products are automatically booked out of the FMIS (farm storage). Story: Supply industry (machinery, fertilizer, plant protection products) Plant protection product, fertilizer and seed industries produce plant protection products , fertilizers and seeds . The suppliers deliver the identification data for the different products (e.g. active substances, concentrations, nutrient content etc.) to a central database . The suppliers send the ordered products to retailers . Retailers deliver the ordered products to the farmers . Comment: It needs to be defined as to what exactly has been produced: active substances, nutrient content etc. An ISO stan dard is needed for this. Story: Setup and reference data field use Note: This scenario involves data preparation work prior to the planning, preparation and execution of the field operation, but this work translates into a frictionless experience processing the data afterward. farmer uses an FMIS for managing f ield operations 119 When field operation planning , the FMIS operator exports setup data ,reference data and configuration data The FMIS operator sends the setup data , reference data and configuration data to the MICS During field operation preparation, the machine operator alloca tes a -priori -identified resources to the field operation on the MICS (fields, products, crops, people, etc.) The machine operator starts the task on the MICS The MICS on the machine logs field operations data; i.e., field operation documentation field operation execution : The machine operator performs the field operation with the machine The machine operator ends the task on the MICS The machine operator sends the data to the FMIS The FMIS notifies the FMIS operator of inbound data , imports the inbound data into the FMIS When importing the inbound data into the FMIS , the FMIS recognizes the resource identifiers it exported to the machine The FMIS stores the field operations data Story: Farmer orders product from retailer Retailer receives order from farmer . Order is recorded in retailers database . Retailer orders products from the supplier . Order is recorded in retailers database/system and suppliers database/system Retailer delivers product to farmer . Delivery is recorded in retailers database/system and logged in the farmer's FMIS . Story: Application of fertilizer and crop protection products Farmer contacts experts to get their advice for field operations . Farmer sends field data to the expert . Farmer and expert visit th e field together and determines the need for pest or fertilizer treatments . 120 Farmer contacts an online forecast service to check the weather . Farmer defines an application map for the fertilization and plant protection product in his FMIS or writes the application data on paper (or another medium). The FMIS connects to a cloud database with relevant data about the crop protection products that are allowed to be used for this specific crop, in this specific time of the year and in this specific region. If needed, corrections need to be applied. Farmer sends orders for services like tillage, fertilization, plant protection or harvest including all the needed products from a supplier. Farmer executes the different field works (tillage, planting, fertilization, plant protection, irrigation, harvest, in case of perennial crops additional works like tree -cut, fruit thinning etc.). Farmer loads the application map from the FMIS to the machine terminal. Farmer determines the coupled machine and the settings of the machine. When filling the fertilising or spraying machine , the QR -code on the product label is scanned and the product is identified. Farmer defines the amount of product per field that he has to use in the tractor terminal using the instructions in the FMIS . During the operations the data may be logged by the machine : time, geolocalisation, used machine, used product, application rate, temperature, air humidity, crop images etc . If no data are logged , work data are simply registered on paper or typed into the smartphone FMIS app. After the work the farmer writes the data for the field work (e.g., machinery used, amount and type of seeds, fertilizer, plant protection product amount and dosage, etc.) into the FMIS . Data are pushed from the machine terminal to the FMIS (ISO -standard of to be recorded parameters for different crops and operations?) . Used products are automatically booked out of the FMIS (farm storage). 121 Story: No -process- calculations and data transfer to third parties Farmer calculates the nutrient balance of each single field (Nutrient impo rt - Nutrient export of each single field based on national rules). Farmer establishes the plant protection protocol of the fields according to the different standards of related organisations, national rules etc. (e.g. product i dentity, applied amount, time, exact location, weather conditions like wind speed) Production data are checked by an expert to guarantee that the agreed production standards have been met. In accordance with the different standards the farmer sends the production data for his fields to the wholesalers, label organisations and the government . Farmer calculates th e revenue and the costs of the different fields . Farmer calculates the needed working hours of the different fields . Story: Analytical laboratories Analytical laboratories are regularly actualizing their identification codes . Laboratories receive samples (soil, plant, manure, water etc .) from the farmer . Laboratories analyse soil, plant, manu re and water samples . the standard test results : for soil :chemical constituents & particle dispersion for water : ph ,ec ,organic mater for plant : dry mater ,microbiology, toxins & pesticides Results are sent to the farm management information system FMIS that deals the payroll, machine ry, products and workers, field and geographical information, and decision and task management will all be available to the farmer . Story : Closed loop spray The farmer or contractor prepares the spraying operations for pest control in a crop , using a Farm Management Information System (FMIS) . The FMIS contains up- to-date and detailed information 122 about all the crop fields of the farm; field identifiers , types of crop , field boundaries , a record of all the operations that we carried out on this crop field, etc. The FMIS connects to the cloud application with the actual and forecasted weather conditions . The FMIS connects to a cloud data base with relevant data about the crop protection products that are allowed be uses for this specific crop , in this specific time of the year and in this specific region. All the information is used to ge nerate a planned spray operation for the specified field. The planned operations is transferred as a 'work order' to the tractor or spraying machine . When filling the spraying machine with water and the crop production product , the QR -code on the product label is scanned and the product is identified . A final check is done, connecting to the cloud database with crop protection reference data , verifying if the conditions are still met for carrying out the spray operation. The executed workorder is captured by the tractor or spraying machine and fed back to the FMIS to be used for compliance pur poses and for agronomic analysis . Story: Fertilizing Note: This sub- process may include irrigation, fertilizer, soil amendments, or crop protection chemicals as indicated by the crop plan or the crop field observation report. Equipment associated with inputs should be suitable and calibrated as appropriate to ensure proper application. Farmer starts tractor and smart farming platform (SFP) , then enters username and password . Farmer chooses offline/online mode in SFP , of which offline operations apply t o fields with sufficient historical soil and crop yield information and online operations apply to fields without historical data and re quiring in -season monitoring . Farmer retrieves basal fertilization informati on for the fields in SFP. Farmer operates SFP monitoring module online mode to acquire soil information and crop growth information . Farmer chooses a fertilizer recommendation algorithm in SFP. SFP determines required nutrition (N) and farmer chooses sensor -based or prescription map- based topdressing . 123 Farmer prepares the tractor for sensor -based or map -based variable -rate fertilizer application on the go by se tting precisely : fertilizer type (compound or straight, solid or liquid) AND flow control valve (amount of fertilizer, determined for a specific fertilizer type) AND run time for the fertilizer (duration of applying this amount of fertilizer). Story: Monitoring crops health status and application of phytosanitary products Satellite or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images are taken measuring the health sensitive vegetation index (HVI) of the crops . Afield is selected , and satellite or UAV images are taken periodically of it and the variation of the HVI of the crop is evaluate d, analyzing the different parts of the field . Sections of the field , whose HVI suffers unusual changes, are observed. An alert is triggered to the monitoring company , who go through the field and evaluate the situation in site . If it is determined that the decrease in HVI is due to a disease or pest , an order is triggered to the plant protection products application company to apply fungicides through a specific mapping of the field , producing variable application of fungicides , carrying out the treatment only in the affected area . Story: Image processing weed control An autonomous weed control robot is used in the field to remove weed in a crop in order to maximise crop production . Weed detection algorithms for autonomous weed control robots are developed and placed on a server in the cloud . The weed control robot downloads on a regu lar base the most up -to-data and appropriate algorithm it can use to real time detect and remove in a chemical or mechanical way the wee d in a specific crop. During the operation the robot takes many images to detect the weed . The captured images are, enriched with meta data (times tamp, type of crop, weather conditions, angle of the camera, etc.), 124 uploaded to a cloud server where the images are available for improving the algorithm and for other purposes; e.g. for detect fungus infections in the crop . Story: Weeding - Selective sprays A crop monitoring company is hired to make the monitoring of the plots of a field . They determine the presence of patches of weeds in the fiel d, but not enough to spray it massively, rather selective spraying is require d. An alert is triggered to the farmer , and he contacts the herbicide application company that has a sprayer with the selective application system . This contractor has mounted on the boom of the sprayer , some infrared sensors that, when detecting weeds (by NDVI) , produce the application of herbicides , making selective applications in the places where the weeds are located and not elsewhere, reducing the risk of contamination and producing a more profitable application . Story: Proper harvest time Adjust harvest timetable and schedule based on actual field, weather and crop conditions . This step is taken whenever adjustments are required to the harvest schedule. These actions ensure final timing and schedule meet contract and yield requirements. Weather data (solar/soil temperature/rainwater) is sent daily from automatic weather stations (AWS) and collected on a cloud -based server . An API request calls data from the cloud to the model . The model analyses the new data and updates the harvest prediction date for each field. Farmer opens the app (decision support system) and directs harvest teams to field in order of priority. In this way crop yield and quality are maximised and labour allocated more efficiently . Story: Grain Harvest The farmer gives the contractor the order to harvest a field of wheat . From the farm management system , the farmer transmits the order with position , field boundaries and obstacles, i.e., the position of a large stone in the field to the contractor . The contractor uses the guidance system and the field boundaries to plan the tracks of the combine harvester. 125 The contractor transmits all data for the order to the driver and the combine . These are the job number, the arable crop, the position of the field, the position of the transport trailer at the edge of the field, the tracks and the position of the stone. The driver drives to the field using the position and a navigation system . Here he starts harvesting . He sets the standard value for wheat on the combine's terminal according to the manufacturer' s specifications. He drives along the tracks with the parallel drive system . The combine adjusts the driving speed according to the amount harvested. The moisture of the wheat and the yield are recorded via the sensors in the combine and documented with the position data on a map . As it is already evening and the straw is getting wetter, the combine does not clean the short straw as well . The driver recognizes this via the sensors in the combine and the straw in the field. He then adjusts the standard settings for wheat on the combine and saves the new setting on the combine as an alternative setting for wheat in the combine. After he has finished, he completes the job . All data is transferred to the contractor via the cloud . For the contracto r, this is working time, machine utilization and fuel consumption. The contractor then sends the map with the yield and moisture measure ments to the farmer's farm management system . Story: Automatic Operation of Harvesting Machines Fruit harvester driver operates both a trunk and shaker system simultaneously. When driver starts harvesting a fruit row , an artificial vision system detects trunk to grab with the trunk shakers arms. Simultaneously, canopy shaker is also self -adjusted through a pressure sensor to approach the tree canopy itself: The purpose of the system is to ass ist fruit harvester driver to optimize fruit harvesting automatically in a specific fruit orchard . The fruit harvester driver should onl y select trunk -shaking time, different vibration events per tree and canopy shaking time to detach most of the fruits from each fruit orchard . 126 E.3 Business Process M odeling Notation (BPMN ) Diagrams Members of the SAG used Business Process Management Notation (BPMN) diagrams to map out processes, identifying actors and data flow. These diagrams are shown in the figures below.

Second generation: I n addition to stor ing records uploaded by farmers, the se systems also ingest data from IoT sensors and the like and make those data available to farmers and their advisors, on which they can make better informed decisions . Third generation Farm Management Decision Systems are FMISs with the added capability to ingest data and make decisions algorithmically, which can then be made available to farmers and growers and their advisors, usually in three categories after the system reaches a decision, (a) the system alerts the farmer and awaits a response before action e.g. a predictive irrigation schedule is generated but nothing happens until the farmer approved the schedule (b) the system alerts the farmer advising an action will be implemented until cancelled e.g. stock water is low but daily water 159 consent limits are about to be breached or (c) the system determines an action needs to be taken, and takes that action and advises the farmer accordingly e.g. a travelling effluent irrigator distributing effluent onto pasture has jamme d and stopped moving and will imminently over -apply in one place in the field, thus breaching allowed application rate limits and leaching contaminants into the water table, so the system shuts off the effluent pump.

See Scope Item Perspective scope item perspective Definition A methodology within the SAG seeking to identify processes / sub- processes that are in the context of one or more scope items. SDG indicator SDG perspective SDG target Definition Each goal typically has 8 -12 targets, and each target has between one and four indicators used to measure progress toward reaching the targets. The targets are either \"outcome\" targets (circumstances to be attained) or \"means of implementation\" targets. [11] The latter targets were introduced late in the process of negotiating the SDGs to address the concern of some Member States about how the SDGs were to be achieved. Goal 17 is wholly about how the SDGs will be achieved. [11] The numbering system of targets is as follows: \"Outcome targets\" use numbers, whereas \"means of implementation targets\" use lower case letters. [11] For example, SDG 6 has a total of 8 targets. The first six are outcome targets and are labeled Targets 6.1 to 6.6. The final two targets are \"means of implementation targets\" and are labeled as Tar gets 6.a and 6.b. segregation Definition separation of nonconforming products from products that conform to the customer's order EXAMPLE Separation of different quality types or varieties. sensors Definition 170 device that observes and measures a physical pr operty of a natural phenomenon or man- made process and converts that measurement into a signal Note 1 to entry: Signal can be electrical, chemical, etc. Notes SG 2 Livestock setup data Definition Data that describe one particular instance of a thing or idea, but not including its state. slurry tanker Definition thick, flowable mixture of solids and a liquid, usually water Notes SG 2 Livestock smart farming Definition Andres note: We need to harmonize (likely replace) this with the problems -centric (as op posed to technology -centric) definition being used by the SAG. Smart farming is a management concept focused on providing the agricultural industry with the infrastructure to leverage advanced technology - including big data , the cl oud, and the internet of things (IoT) - for tracking, monitoring, automating, and analyzing operations. Also known as precision agriculture, smart farming is software -managed and sensor -monitored. Smart farming is growing in importance due to the combination of the expanding global population, the increasing demand for higher crop yield, the need to use natural resources efficiently, the rising use and sophist ication of information and communication technology, and the increasing need for climate -smart agriculture. Notes SG1- CROP PRODUCTION smart farming platform SFP Definition The Smart Farming Platform is an integrated platform providing a number of tools for disseminating and making easier the use of Smart Farming technologies. soil map Definition two- or three -dimensional representation of soil or its properties for a geographic extent Notes SG 2 Soxhlet extractor Definition piece of laboratory apparatus [1] invented in 1879 by Franz von Soxhlet .[2] It was originally designed for the extraction of a lipid from a solid material. Typically, Soxhlet extraction is used when the desired compound has a limited solubility in a solvent , and the impurity is insoluble in that solvent. It allows for unmonitored and unmanaged operation while efficiently recycling a small amount of solvent to dissolve a larger amount of material.

[SOURCE: ISO/IEC Guide 2:2004, 3.2] standards domain Definition area of control or a sphere of knowledge covered by a standard Notes Andres work -in progress standards perspective Definition The impetus for standardization comes from the marketplace - from the stakeholders of ISO and from its broad base of public and private sector organizations that have liai son status. ISO is careful to make sure that the standards it develops are there to meet the needs of the market, not the needs of ISO itself. sub-process Definition a process that is included within another process. Notes The Sub -Process can be in a colla psed view that hides its details. A Sub- Process can be in an expanded view that shows its details within the view of the Process that it is contained in. A Sub- Process shares the same shape as the Task, which is a rectangle that has rounded corners. suppli er Definition crop production provider of inputs used in crop production EXAMPLE Crop producers, those supplying seed and plant material, fertilizer, equipment, chemicals, and others providing inputs or services (including consultants and advisors) to farm operations. supply chain Definition linked set of resources and proces ses that upon placement of a purchase order begins with the sourcing of raw material and extends through the manufacturing, processing, handling and delivery of goods and related services to the purchaser 172 Note 1 to entry: The supply chain may include vendo rs, manufacturing facilities, logistics providers, internal distribution centres, distributors, wholesalers and other entities involved in the manufacturing, processing, handling and delivery of the goods and their related services. Notes The supply chain can be differentiated from the value chain using the Porter model. SG 9 Livestock supply chain sustainability Definition supply chain sustainability refers to companies' efforts to consider the environmental and human impact of their products' journey thro ugh the supply chain, from raw materials sourcing to production, storage, delivery and every transportation link in between The goal is to minimize environmental harm from factors like energy usage, water consumption and waste production while having a pos itive impact on the people and communities in and around their operations. These concerns are in addition to traditional corporate supply chain concerns around revenue and profit. Notes SG 9 Supply chain sustainable development goal SDG Definition The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The 17 SDGs are integrated \u2014they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability. Countries have committed to prioritize progress for those who're furthes t behind. The SDGs are designed to end poverty, hunger, AIDS, and discrimination against women and girls. The creativity, knowhow, technology and financial resources from all of society is necessary to achieve the SDGs in every context. time-phased budget Definition allocation of the cost to accomplish the work over established periods of time or phases Notes SG 2 Livestock top management Definition crop production single person or group of people who directs and controls farm operation or farm cooperati ve operations at the highest level EXAMPLE Farm management, single owner, owners, proprietor, farm coop management board, partners, president, chief executive officer, managing director, chairman, board of directors, executive directors, managing partner (s), or third party advisors that provide high level control over the farm operation by establishing policy and setting objectives for the farm operation. NOTE In small organizations, farm management and top management may be the same person. 173 topography Definition topography general configuration of a land surface (3.1.23) or any part of the Earth's surface, including its relief and the position of its natural and manmade features Note 1 to entry: The natural or physical surface features of a region, considered collectively as to form the features revealed by the contour(3.6.3) lines of a map.

Intent is to base it on Porter's value chain model ,and to differentiate between this and a supply chain. SG 9 Su pply chain variety Definition unique and uniform member of a species of plant (except for hybrid species) that retains its characteristics from generation to generation through its natural mode of reproduction Note 1 to entry: The concept of \"cultivar\" is essentially different from the concept of the botanical variety \"varietas\", in that \"cultivar\" is an infraspecific division resulting from controlled selection, even if empirical; \"varietas\" is an infraspecific division resulting from natural selection. Th e terms \"cultivar\" and \"variety\" (in the sense of cultivated variety) are equivalent. In translations or adaptations of botanical nomenclature for particular uses, the terms \"cultivar\" or \"variety\" (or their equivalents in other languages) may be used in t ext.
