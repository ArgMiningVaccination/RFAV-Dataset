We continue to face local, national, and global health issues\u2014emerging pathogens, food insecurity, changing climate, biodiversity loss, and antimicrobial resistance, among others. Despite these daunting challenges, we've seen an encouraging shift toward consilience and interdisciplinary collaborations, which is critical if we are even to begin to tackle these wicked problems. We've accomplished much this year by focusing on research, education, and outreach. Through our seed funding program, we awarded six research teams small grants of $40,000 each, including one exploring healthy, living shorelines on the Tennessee River in partnership with Tennessee RiverLine and one globally- focused award in partnership with the Smith Center for International Sustainable Agriculture and the Center for Global Engagement. In addition to these new projects, we celebrated nearly $3M of extramural funds generated from the inaugural round of awardees, bringing the total of extramural funds generated from teams fostered by OHI in the past two years to over $10M! The new One Health minor (for undergraduate and graduate students) and the \"Introduction to One Health\" course launched in the fall of 2021, and we've received very encouraging feedback so far. In fact, we've added courses to the minor as more faculty approach us to have their programs included. Through our partnership with UT Extension, UT Gardens, Biology in a Box, MEGA:BITESS, the Tennessee Department of Health, Tennessee Department of Agriculture, and the Nashville Zoo, we're developing an amazing K-12 program, including curricula for classrooms and educators. We also continue to offer high caliber presentations from experts around the globe in our monthly Lunch and Learn series. All presentations are available on our website, as are episodes of our podcast series with comedian Shane Mauss, which feature interviews with our amazing UT faculty. In addition to these recurring resources, we hosted several noteworthy events in our second year. In November, our One Health Day celebration was a truly global event. The theme was \"Climate Change and One Health,\" and we had outstanding keynote speakers and a panel discussion featuring experts from UT and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Also in November, we partnered with the Center for Global Engagement to host a jointly held One Health workshop with presenters from UT, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and Tel Aviv University, designed to share research ideas and foster collaboration. More recently, we hosted a Team Science workshop in March of this year that was well-received and truly the beginning of a full line of team-building workshops. All that we have accomplished this past year is a testament to our amazing UT faculty. It emphasizes that there is nothing we cannot achieve when we believe in something and work together to make it happen. So, let us continue to inspire one another locally, nationally, and globally as we continue uniting disciplines to protect and promote the health of all life on Earth! Uniting disciplines to protect and promote the health of all life on Earth.

Green Spaces Led by Drs. Carole Myers (College of Nursing) and Sharon Jean-Philippe (Herbert College of Agriculture), a broad complement of community scholars and practitioners came together to explore opportunities to address inequities in the distribution and availability of parks and green spaces. In late June 2022, the group will meet with key stakeholders to discuss opportunities related to several recently announced UT interdisciplinary cluster hires and collaborative grant proposals. Broadening the focus of the group and integrating mental health and wellness is under consideration. Mental Health Led by Dr. Carole Myers (College of Nursing) and Kristi Gordon (College of Education, Health, and Human Sciences), the group is in discussions with school representatives to collaboratively assess needs and funding opportunities. They are also exploring how work on green spaces and mental health can be integrated. Microbiome Currently seeking a leader, this group connects microbiome researchers across UT (including College of Nursing, College of Veterinary Medicine, College of Arts and Sciences, Herbert College of Agriculture, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory) to foster collaboration and improve techniques across campus. One Health in K-12 Led by Dr. Kimberlyn Roosa (College of Arts and Sciences), this group seeks to introduce One Health to the next generation and to serve as a liaison to underserved communities. Over the past year, the group has expanded partnerships across the state to include Tennessee Department of Agriculture, UT Gardens, TN STEM, and the Nashville Zoo. The group continues to incorporate One Health messaging to a K-12 audience, including presentations at local schools and a virtual event with zookeepers at the Nashville Zoo. They have also developed an activity book for children to learn about One Health and how it relates to what they see in their own backyards, which has been distributed at various events and presentations. They have also developed training for educators to convey One Health ideas through in-service training for 4-H agents.

The team has successfully set up the experiment by placing 20 silos at each study site, which contained 5 hatchery-reared, healthy A. pectorosa, for a total of 100 mussels. From August-November, a wild mussel die-off event was observed at both sites in the first year of the experiment; no silo mussels presented signs of disease, and few mortalities occurred that were not associated with disease. During the period of mass mortality, they worked with partners to conduct three surveys for wild moribund A. pectorosa. collecting data on survival and growth, clinical signs of disease, hemolymph indices, histopathology, and bacterial microbiome in moribund and hatchery-reared mussels. Around half of the mussels stocked in silos remain to be sampled in 2022. Moving forward, they plan to pair this data with historical population demographic and die-off data. These data, in combination with environmental data (i.e., river flow, temperature), will be used to build models that explore likely causes of die-off events and make predictions considering climate change scenarios. This work is the focus of UT-CEM PhD student, Jeronimo Silva. They are presently working with a team at US Geological Survey and National Wildlife Health Center to publish the observation of a novel rickettsial-like organism in wild and hatchery-sourced mussels. They have also started a collaboration with Tennessee State University and the USGS Lower Mississippi Gulf coast Water Science Center to correlate harmful algal bloom toxins detected in the water and in the tissues of the silo mussels.

Research. Socio-Economic Epidemiology of Disease Risk in Wildlife Trade Networks Dr. Matthew Gray (Herbert College of Agriculture, Dept. of Forestry, Wildlife, and Fisheries) Dr. Neelam Poudyal (Herbert College of Agriculture, Dept. of Forestry, Wildlife, and Fisheries) Dr. Nina Fefferman (College of Arts and Sciences, Dept. of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Dept. of Mathematics) The team created a project website and met weekly with the US pet amphibian industry to design socioeconomic surveys. Two online surveys were launched in summer 2021 targeting US pet amphibian businesses and consumers. The team assessed the knowledge of US pet amphibian businesses and consumers on the threat of amphibian pathogens in trade and risk of spillover to wild populations, as well as quantified ongoing biosecurity practices in businesses and disposal practices of wastewater, aquarium contents, and dead or unwanted amphibians of businesses and consumers. They also estimated the willingness of businesses and consumers to pay a price premium for certified, pathogen-free amphibians and summarized their findings in an executive summary that is available on the project website. One manuscript has been submitted to the Journal of Cleaner Production and two additional are in preparation. Businesses that participated in the survey were asked to volunteer to participate in amphibian pathogen surveillance at their facilities. In total, nine businesses sent samples from captive amphibians in their facility, and two businesses sent samples from arriving amphibian shipments. Currently, the team is in the process of testing these samples for the presence of three notifiable amphibian pathogens and one beneficial microbe species. Future activities include using surveillance sample results to estimate where is best to target future pathogen surveillance sampling, and working with industry to identify possible components of a clean trade program. In November 2021, they submitted a $3M proposal to the National Science Foundation to expand this research. Data collected using OHI seed grant funds were instrumental to increasing the competitiveness of our proposal submission.

Examination of 30 chicken fecal samples in east Tennessee and 270 fecal samples from the chickens in 9 different farms in Mississippi (6 farms) or Alabama (3 farms) led to isolation of 18 E. albertii isolates. The team completed a longitudinal surveillance to analyze a total of 289 raccoon fecal samples collected in Tennessee and Kentucky, and successfully isolated 22 raccoon E. albertii strains. Additionally, they performed whole genome sequencing for a total of 70 diverse E. albertii strains of different origins (18 US chicken, 22 US raccoon, 20 Japan raccoon, 7 Japan human, 1 Japan swine, and 2 Japan bird) for comparative genomics analysis together with those US human strain sequences deposited in public domain. The comparative characterizations led to important and insightful discoveries, and strongly supported the hypothesis that chickens and raccoons are unique and significant players in the dynamic interactions among the enteric E. albertii pathogen, animals, humans, and their shared environment. This project has led to three published journal articles, and the novel and solid data obtained from this project position the team well to pursue various funding opportunities in the future.

Developing a System for Molecular Detection/Identification of Zoonotic Pathogens of Most Concern in the US Dr. Chunlei Su (College of Arts and Sciences, Dept. of Microbiology) Dr. Richard Gerhold (College of Veterinary Medicine, Biomedical and Diagnostic Sciences) Dr. Michelle Dennis (College of Veterinary Medicine, Biomedical and Diagnostic Sciences) Dr. Sree Rajeev (College of Veterinary Medicine, Biomedical and Diagnostic Sciences) This project proposes the establishment of an integrated system to detect and identify zoonotic pathogens. This system aims to detect novel and known zoonotic pathogens from animals. This project was meant to be a proof of concept, and it is aimed to be scalable for surveillance of a large number of pathogens from animals, plants, humans and environment in the future. There were three objectives: (1) establish a shared resource database of biological samples; (2) develop molecular methods to detect and identify zoonotic pathogens; and (3) isolate zoonotic pathogens and establish reference depositories. The team made progress on all three objectives. For objective 1, they established a prototype biobank consisting of over 300 domestic and wild animal samples organized in a shared database available for future research on disease transmission dynamics. For objective 2, they established a comprehensive methodology that is able to detect and identify viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites by metagenomic and targeted sequencing analysis. Specifically, they tested samples from bat, white-tailed deer, goose, turkey, duck, and cat, and are to detect and identify alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, Staphycoccus, Salmonella , Toxoplasma gondii and related parasites. For objective 3, they were able to isolate and expand over 20 T. gondii strains from animals; these isolates will be included in a national reference depository. The team is currently looking for extramural funding to expand the biobank sample collection, target additional pathogens for detection, test sample pooling strategy to increase detection efficiency at the animal population level, and isolate a variety of zoonotic pathogens of interest. The OHI seed grant provided a much needed resource for them to prove the concept that a comprehensive system for pathogen detection and identification is feasible. 2021 Seed Grant Updates Developing a Model of Chronic Inflammation to Elucidate its Effects on Reproduction Dr. Brian Whitlock (College of Veterinary Medicine, Large Animal Clinical Sciences) Dr. Bhavya Sharma (College of Arts and Sciences, Dept. of Chemistry) Allison Renwick (College of Veterinary Medicine, Comparative and Experimental Medicine Program) The animal portion and parts of the laboratory work related to this project have been completed. The animal work was completed at the Johnson Animal Research and Teaching Unit with the assistance of the unit staff, many undergraduate student volunteers, and UTCVM Drs. Strickland, Lear, Adkins, Griffin, and Daniel. The team used 23 individually housed wethers in the study, which were equipped with HOBO accelerometers (to track animal activity), Star-Oddi temperature sensors (subcutaneous implants to capture temperature), CowManager ear accelerometers (to track eating, ruminating, and activity) and monitored continuously with security cameras and Blue Iris security software (behavior data from the video files will be compared to HOBO and CowManager accelerometers). Sheep were acclimated to serial venipuncture before experimentation where they received one of five treatments (control, single acute dose of endotoxin, daily acute dose of endotoxin, daily rising dose of endotoxin, and chronic subcutaneous administration of a static dose of endotoxin) over seven days. Blood samples were collected at the beginning and end of the week of treatment administration. At the end of the last day of treatments, sheep were humanely euthanized and tissue samples were collected. Most importantly, the heads were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and brains and pituitaries were collected. Temperature and activity data have been analyzed as well as plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone, cytokines and cortisol. Immunohistochemical determination of hypothalamic expression of kisspeptin and c-fos have been completed and analysis is pending. Assessment of hypothalamic expression of Iba-1 (marker of activated microglia indicating neural inflammation) and pituitary expression of LH-beta are pending. Temperature data and plasma luteinizing hormone concentration profiles indicate that the most appropriate dosing scheme for chronic endotoxin-induced suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is a daily rising dose. Once the immunohistochemical analysis of the KNDy neurons is complete, the team will have a greater understanding of the effects of chronic inflammation on hypothalamic regulation of reproduction.

Impact Assessment of Climate Change on Cotton Production via Computational Simulation Dr. Xinhua Yin (Herbert College of Agriculture, Dept. of Plant Sciences) Dr. Joshua Fu (Tickle College of Engineering, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering) Dr. Sangeeta Bansal (Herbert College of Agriculture, Dept. of Plant Sciences) The team has finished the simulation of the weather conditions for the designated years and acquired all necessary data. They have also collected and measured most of the relevant crop, soil, and weather parameters needed for the simulation of climate change on cotton production with the DSSAT Cotton Model. Meanwhile, they submitted a grant proposal titled \"Calibrating and validating soybean model in DSSAT and simulating future climate change impacts on Southeast soybean production\" to the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR) with a budget of about one million dollars, but they were not selected for funding. The postdoc research associated needed for this project needs to have good knowledge of the DSSAT crop models and the skills for using them. After receiving the OHI seed grant, they began the search process for such a research associate for this project in early January, 2021. However, due to delays caused by COVID-19, the research associate did not begin work until June 1, 2021. Therefore, a five-month, no- cost extension was approved for this project. Other OHI-Supported Research Detecting Chronic Wasting Disease Prions in Environmental Samples Dr. Shigetoshi Eda (Herbert College of Agriculture, Dept. of Forestry, Wildlife, and Fisheries) Joseph Ramos (Herbert College of Agriculture, Dept. of Forestry, Wildlife, and Fisheries) Chronic wasting disease (CWD) causes drastic weight loss, stumbling, listlessness, and eventually the death of the affected animals. The disease is present in 26, states causing both ecological and economic issues. Since there is no treatment or vaccine for the disease, early detection and management of CWD-affected animals are vital for mitigating the significant ongoing and future impacts of the disease. A major method currently used for detecting CWD prion is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); however, this method lacks sensitivity to detect prion proteins in live animal samples and the environment. Since March 2021, the team has been working on the development of a new platform for detecting CWD prion in live animal samples and the environment. The platform utilizes a combination of magnetic nanoparticles and our newly invented electrochemical detection method, which enables rapid detection of the protein with a higher sensitivity than ELISA. The team made significant progress in selecting reagents and optimizing assay conditions, which resulted in funding from USDA-ARS's Detect to Protect Challenge Program. In collaboration with Kord Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory, the team tested live animal tissue samples (brain and lymph node). The result showed that the platform could detect CWD prion in brain samples with 100% accuracy. Since lymphoid tissue and other environmental samples contain a lower amount of CWD prion, the team is currently improving the platform to increase the sensitivity of CWD prion detection for testing other tissue and environmental samples. Through this project, two undergraduate students were trained and presented at EUReCA 2022. Dr. Eda, the project PI, has led the University of Tennessee CWD Working Group since May 2021. The group prepared a roadmap, met with the external advisory board, had regular meetings, and created its website.

Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network: Southern Region Dr. Heather Sedges (Herbert College of Agriculture, Family and Consumer Sciences) In 2020, the USDA created the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network (FRSAN) to provide stress management assistance to people in farming, ranching, and other agriculture-related occupations, as well as their families. UT leads the Southern Region (SR) of the program under the direction of Dr. Heather Sedges. During its first year, the FRSAN-SR has expanded from 5 founding states to 13 states and 2 US territories, making it the only one of the four regions in the program to have 100% engagement from all eligible states and territories. This was particularly important when the USDA offered each state and territory $500,000 to further the efforts of the program, resulting in an additional $1.5 million leveraged directly to UT. In addition to the new states, the following national organizations have joined the FRSAN-SR network: Rural Advancement Foundation International (RAFI), Intertribal Agriculture Council, Migrant Clinicians Network, the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, and Latino Farmers Outreach Initiative. By the end of 2021, over 100 participants engaged in an inaugural (virtual) working meeting and conference, a few highlights of included: unveiling options for official branding, welcoming speakers from the USDA and Farm Service Agency, sharing the plans and procedures for the official network- based hotline before its launch in spring 2022, and providing a network-based approach to a collective evaluation plan, along with data management and sharing practices. Interwoven into the event were countless presentations about farmers' stress throughout the region, increased capacity via evidence-based trainings to respond to farmers' mental health concerns, and ongoing research dedicated to uncovering the nuances of farmers' stress and effective interventions.

Myers Education ONE HEALTH COURSE A new course is available in the 2021-22 course catalog that allows students to explore the interconnectedness of human, animal, plant, and environment health, develop an understanding of the One Health approach, and serve as an introductory experience for students considering One Health careers. The course, Introduction to One Health: From Antimicrobial Resistance to Zika with a side of Thousand Cankers, is taught by Dr. Adam Willcox, a One Health Scholar. ONE HEALTH MINOR PROGRAM Also new to the 2021-22 catalog is the One Health Minor, available to undergraduate and graduate students wishing to develop skills to prepare themselves for careers in agricultural, environmental, and human sciences, in addition to scientific policy and communication. The required courses are interdisciplinary and will provide training that is relevant for all majors. Nine students declared the One Health Minor in its first year. Based on growing interest from the UT community, the OHI team will be adding courses to both the undergrad and graduate minor in the fall of 2022. Undergraduate Minor The undergraduate minor consists of 18 hours, including at least one course from each of the six categories below. (Introduction to One Health is required.) Introduction Communication and Leadership Policy Global Issues Science One Health CapstoneGraduate Minor The graduate minor consists of 10 hours (four courses) in the three areas of focus below. Communication and Leadership Translation of Science to Policy One Health FocusEducation.Education.Education K-12 EDUCATOR MATERIALS The One Health in K-12 working group continues to curate and promote education resources for K-12 audiences and educators. Through a partnership with Biology in a Box (College of Arts and Sciences), the team produced the \"Junior One Health Scholars Activity Book\" in the fall of 2021, which teaches elementary school children about the One Health concept and how it relates to what they see in their own backyards. OHI staff have distributed this booklet at several community events and two elementary schools. In addition to content for students, the working group is developing materials for educators and held an in-service training event for 4-H agents to introduce them to the One Health concept and provide them with resources to spread One Health messaging beyond the classroom. One Health, specifically its ties to environmental health, was also incorporated into the Backyard STEM in-service training. SCIENCE OF TEAM SCIENCE WORKSHOP In March 2022, Dr. Elizabeth strand (College of Veterinary Medicine, College of Social Work) and OHI staff organized a workshop on \"High Functioning Teams and Breakthrough Solutions.\" The virtual event was sponsored by the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS); the Bredesen Center; the Office of Research, Innovation, and Economic Development; and the UT-Oak Ridge Innovation Institute. The goal of the event was to increase an understanding of emotion and collaborative cognition from the perspectives of Polyvagal Theory and the Science of Team Science. Featured guests were Dr. Stephen Porges and Dr. Stephen Fiore, giants in the fields of psychiatry and team science, respectively. Workshop attendees represented 15+ internal units and 20+ external universities and organizations. Feedback from the event was very positive, and Dr. Strand and her team plan to create a free, open access short course to share the ideas presented in the workshop. The University of Tennessee Jr. One Health Scholars Activity Book 2021Community Engagement MONTHLY SEMINAR SERIES OHI has continued holding its monthly Lunch and Learn Seminar Series. The series has attracted excellent speakers from across UT, the nation, and world to discuss their work, how they tackle current global challenges, and how solutions can be achieved with a One Health approach. Seminars are held on the last Thursday of each month, and all past seminars are available on demand on the OHI website and YouTube channel. ONE HEALTH DAY OHI participated in One Health Day on November 3, 2021, with an all-day hybrid event. Speakers included Dr. Kristi Ebi (Professor of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, Department of Global Health, University of Washington), Dr. Heidi Hanson (Senior Scientist, Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Research Scientist and Assistant Professor, University of Utah), and Dr. Richard Hamelin (Professor of Forestry, Department of Forest and Conservation Sciences, University of British Columbia). In addition to these virtual presentations, an in-person panel discussion was held on \"Climate Change and One Health,\" facilitated by Dr. Elizabeth Strand ( College of Veterinary Medicine, College of Social Work). Panelists included Dr. Gus Engman (Herbert College of Agriculture), Dr. Kate Evans (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), Dr. Kristina Kintziger (College of Education, Health, and Human Sciences), Dr. Joshua Fu (Tickle College of Engineering), and Dr. Sindhu Jagadamma (Herbert College of Agriculture). COMMUNICATIONS OHI continues to follow a communications plan to promote the initiative. The main components of the plan are: a quarterly electronic newsletter focused on periodic news and updates; a website with general and more enduring content about the One Health Initiative along with posting of timely content; and a social media presence to further develop the One Health brand and spread awareness. Initially, OHI has focused its social media efforts on a Twitter account, curating information, connecting people with people, as well as people with information. PODCAST OHI has partnered with comedian and science enthusiast Shane Mauss to produce One Health-themed episodes of his podcast, Here We Are . Through his interviews with One Health Scholars and other UT guests, Shane takes complex issues and makes them entertaining and accessible to the public.
