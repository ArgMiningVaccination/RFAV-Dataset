CDC recommends an annual flu vaccine for everyone 6 months and older. Annual flu vaccination varies in how well it works, but it is the best available way to prevent flu and its potentially serious consequences. The study was conducted over four flu seasons from 2012 to 2015 and found that flu vaccination prevented severe disease: - Flu vaccination among adults reduced the risk of being admitted to the hospital with flu and placed in a general ward bed by 37 percent. - Flu vaccination was even more effective in preventing the most severe forms of flu and reduced the risk of being admitted to an ICU with flu by 82 percent. Risk among vaccinated vs. unvaccinated Because flu vaccine varies in how well it works and people who are vaccinated may still get sick, the study also looked at whether flu vaccination reduced the severity of illness among hospitalized people who were vaccinated compared to those who were unvaccinated and found that: - Among adults who were admitted to the hospital with flu, vaccinated adults were 59 percent less likely to have very severe illness resulting in ICU admission than those who had not been vaccinated. - Among adults in the ICU with flu, vaccinated patients on average spent 4 fewer days in the hospital than those who were not vaccinated previously. The study was a collaborative project with CDC, conducted through the Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance project, which prospectively enrolled hospitalized adults 18 years and older from 2012 to 2015 in Auckland, New Zealand. Eligible hospitalized patients were those who had an overnight admission with acute respiratory illness. Once enrolled in the study, patients self-reported their flu vaccination status and were tested for flu infection by RT-PCR. Since 2005, CDC has conducted annual flu vaccine effectiveness studies to assess how well the vaccine works in preventing medically attended illness. Until recently, there were few studies that looked at how well the vaccine works in preventing serious outcomes like admission to ICU. This study adds to a growing body of evidence that supports the importance of vaccination in order to prevent more serious flu outcomes.
