There are many different types, but some popular ones are: Mindful, Spiritual, Focused, Movement, Mantra, Transcendental, Progresssive relaxation, Loving kindness, Visualisation, Body Scan, Vipassana and Silent Meditation. While meditation is not an instant cure-all, it can certainly bring some much-needed space in your life. Sometimes, that's all we need to make better choices for ourselves and our loved ones. The most important tools you can bring with you to your meditation practice are a little patience and some kindness for yourself. When we meditate, we absorb far-reaching and long-lasting benefits into our lives. Mindfulness is to practice being fully aware of what we are doing, where we are, and how we feel, on purpose, in the present moment, without judgement. We therefore can be mindful at any time of our day doing anything. Some benefits of Mindfulness and Meditation are **Understanding your pain ** Improving mental health **Lower your stress **Connect better to yourself others and the planet **Improve focus and wellbeing** Lower Blood Pressure **Reduce brain chatter and quiet the mind. We provide a number of Meditation options: sessions and retreats, as above, for one to one and small groups. Please ask for details.

It is not only for the physical body, but can also be used to increase intuition and awareness as well. Balance is always a good thing, because your body can only self-heal when your nervous system is balanced. By encouraging your system toward balance, Reiki practice can help you in any situation, even when it isn't the only help you need. Reiki practice is safe, and cannot interfere with any medical care you are receiving. **Do you have a chronic condition and want to feel better while supporting your health care? **Are you struggling to sleep well, feeling stressed?
