It is used to treat thyroid cancer, kidney cancer and primary liver cancer. [What is cabozantinib (Cometriq\u00ae, Cabometyx\u00ae)?] Cabozantinib belongs to two groups [targeted therapy](/cancer-information-and-support/treatments-and-drugs/targeted-therapies) drugs. It is known as a cancer growth inhibitor, and also an angiogenesis inhibitor. Cabozantinib is used to treat medullary thyroid cancer, kidney cancer and liver cancer. Cabozantinib (Cometriq\u00ae) capsules may be used to treat [medullary thyroid cancer](/cancer-information-and-support/thyroid-cancer/medullary) that cannot be removed with an operation or that has spread to other parts of the body (advanced cancer). Cabozantinib (Cabometyx\u00ae) tablets may be used to treat a type of [kidney cancer](/cancer-information-and-support/kidney-cancer) called renal cell cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (advanced cancer). It is sometimes given with another cancer drug called Nivolumab. Cabozantinib (Cabometyx\u00ae) tablets are sometimes used to treat a type of cancer that starts in the liver called [hepatocellular cancer](/cancer-information-and-support/liver-cancer/types-of-liver-cancer). Your cancer doctor can tell you if it is appropriate for you. Some people may have it as part of a [clinical trial](/cancer-information-and-support/treatments-and-drugs/clinical-trials). Cabozantinib may not be available on the NHS. We have [further information](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/your-treatment-options/what-you-can-do-if-a-treatment-is-not-available) on what to do if a treatment is not available. It is best to read this information with our general information about the [type of cancer](/cancer-information-and-support/cancer-types) you have. Your doctor will talk to you about this treatment and its possible side effects before you agree ( [consent](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/your-treatment-options/giving-your-consent)) to have treatment. [How cabozantinib is given] Cabozantinib comes as tablets or capsules, so you can take them at home. During treatment you usually see a cancer doctor, a cancer nurse or specialist nurse, and a specialist pharmacist. This is who we mean when we mention doctor, nurse or pharmacist in this information. Taking cabozantinib tablets You take cabozantinib tablets or capsules once a day. Take them at the same time every day. You should not have anything to eat two hours before, or an hour after taking the tablets. They must be swallowed whole with a glass of water. They should not be chewed, opened or crushed. Always take cabozantinib exactly as your nurse or pharmacist explained. This is important to make sure it works as well as possible for you. Your doctor will talk to you about how long to take cabozantinib for. If you forget to take the tablets or capsules, the missed dose should be taken only if it is more than 12 hours before the next dose. If your next dose is due in less than 12 hours, do not take the dose you have missed. Take your next dose at the normal time. Do not take a double dose. Other things to remember when taking your capsules or tablets: - Wash your hands after taking your tablets and capsules. - Other people should avoid direct contact with your capsules/tablets. - Keep them in the original package and at room temperature, away from heat and direct sunlight. - Keep them safe and out of sight and reach of children. - If you are sick just after taking the capsules or tablets, contact the hospital. Do not take another dose. - If your treatment is stopped return any unused capsules/ tablets to the pharmacist. - Avoid eating grapefruit and drinking grapefruit juice during your treatment as it may increase side effects. [ Possible side effects of cabozantinib] About side effects We explain the main side effects of this treatment here. We also include some other possible side effects. You may get some of the side effects we mention, but you are unlikely to get all of them. If you are also having treatment with other cancer drugs, you may have some side effects that we have not listed here. Always tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist about any side effects you have. Your doctor can give you drugs to help control some side effects. It is important to take them exactly as your nurse or pharmacist explains. This means they will be more likely to work for you. Your nurse will give you advice about managing your side effects. After your treatment is over, most side effects start to improve. Serious and life-threatening side effects Some cancer treatments can cause severe side effects. Rarely, these may be life-threatening. Your cancer doctor or nurse can explain the risk of these side effects to you. Contact the hospital Your nurse will give you telephone numbers for the hospital. If you feel unwell or need advice, you can call them at any time of the day or night. Save these numbers in your phone or keep them somewhere safe. More information We cannot list every side effect for this treatment. There are some rare side effects that are not listed.

Feeling sick Your doctor will give you anti-sickness drugs to help prevent or control sickness during your treatment. Take the drugs exactly as your nurse or pharmacist tells you. It is easier to prevent sickness than to treat it after it has started.If you [feel sick](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/nausea-and-vomiting), take small sips of fluids often and eat small amounts regularly. It is important to drink enough fluids. If you continue to feel sick, or are sick (vomit) more than once in 24 hours, contact the hospital as soon as possible. They will give you advice. Your doctor or nurse may change the anti-sickness drug to one that works better for you. Loss of appetite This treatment can [affect your appetite](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/eating-problems). Don't worry if you do not eat much for a day or 2. But if your appetite does not come back after a few days, or if you are losing weight, tell your nurse or dietitian. They can give you advice. They may give you food or drink supplements. Or they may suggest changes to your diet or eating habits to help. Feeling tired [Feeling tired](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/tiredness) is a common side effect of this treatment. It is often worse towards the end of treatment and for some weeks after it has finished. Try to pace yourself and plan your day so you have time to rest. Gentle exercise, like short walks, can give you more energy. If you feel sleepy, do not drive or use machinery.

If the number of red blood cells is low, this is called anaemia. You may have symptoms such as: - pale skin - lack of energy - feeling breathless - feeling dizzy and light-headed. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have these symptoms. If you are very anaemic, you may need a drip to give you extra red blood cells. This is called a blood transfusion.

[Other information about cabozantinib] Blood clot risk Cancer and some cancer treatments can increase the risk of a [blood clot](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/blood-clots-and-cancer). Symptoms of a blood clot include: - throbbing pain, redness or swelling in a leg or arm - suddenly feeling breathless or coughing - sharp chest pain, which may be worse when you cough or take a deep breath. If you have any of these symptoms, contact the hospital straight away on the 24-hour contact number you have been given.

Your doctor or nurse can give you more information. You can help reduce the risk of developing a blood clot by: [staying active](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/preparing-for-treatment/eating-well-and-keeping-active)during treatment - drinking plenty of fluids, especially water. You may be given anticoagulants to help prevent a clot. Other medicines Some medicines can affect how this treatment works or be harmful when you are having it. Always tell your cancer doctor about any drugs you are taking or planning to take, such as: - medicines you have been prescribed - medicines you buy in a shop or chemist - vitamins, herbal drugs and complementary therapies. Tell other doctors, pharmacists or dentists who prescribe or give you medicines that you are having this cancer treatment. You can visit the [electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC)](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc) for more detailed information about your treatment. Contraception Your doctor will advise you not to get pregnant or make someone pregnant while having this treatment. The drugs may harm a developing baby. If you use a hormonal contraception, you are advised to also use barrier contraception, such as a condom. It is important to use contraception during your treatment and for a while after treatment finishes. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist can tell you more about this. Breastfeeding You are advised not to [breastfeed](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/your-treatment-options/pregnancy/breastfeeding) while having this treatment, or for some time after treatment finishes. This is because the drugs could be passed to the baby through breast milk. Your doctor or nurse can give you more information. Fertility Some cancer drugs can affect whether you can [get pregnant](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/fertility) or [make someone pregnant](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/fertility). If you are worried about this, it is important to talk with your doctor before you start treatment. Vaccinations Vaccinations can reduce your risk of getting certain infections. Your doctor or nurse may talk to you about having vaccinations. Doctors usually recommend that people with cancer have a flu vaccination and a [coronavirus (covid) vaccination](https://www.macmillan.org.uk/coronavirus/vaccine). These are both inactivated vaccinations that can help reduce the risk of infection. People with weak immune systems can have these, as they are not live vaccinations. If your immune system is weak, you need to avoid live vaccinations. This is because they can make you unwell. Live vaccines contain a very weak version of the illness they are vaccinating you against. Your cancer doctor or GP can tell you more about live and inactivated vaccinations. Medical and dental treatment If you need medical treatment for any reason other than cancer, always tell the doctors and nurses you are having cancer treatment. Give them the contact details for your cancer doctor so they can ask for advice. If you think you need dental treatment, talk to your cancer doctor or nurse. Always tell your dentist you are having cancer treatment. [Information about coronavirus] We understand that people are worried about coronavirus (COVID-19).
