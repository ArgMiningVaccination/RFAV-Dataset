Mission Statement \"To protect and enhance the health, safety, and well-being of District of Columbia residents by promoting evidence-based best practices in health regulation, high standards of quality care and implementing policies that prevent adverse events.\" Established in 1879, the DC Board of Medicine (BoMed), a division within the DC Department of Health, Health Regulation and Licensing Administration (HRLA), has the responsibility to regulate the practice of medicine (MD/DO) in the District of Columbia. The Board accepts applications for licensure through national examination; waiver of national examination; reactivation of an inactive license; reinstatement of an expired, suspended, or revoked license, or by eminence pursuant to the Health Occupations Revision Act (HORA). All applicants for licensure must establish, to the Board's satisfaction, that they possess the appropriate skills, knowledge, judgment, and character to practice medicine in the District of Columbia. In addition, applicants must demonstrate to the Board that they are proficient in understanding and communicating medical concepts and information in English. The Board also oversees the regulation of Trauma Technologists, Physician Assistants, Naturopathic Physicians, Anesthesiology Assistants, Acupuncturists, Surgical Assistants, Polysomnographers, and Postgraduate Physicians in Training. Regulation is achieved through the application process; the disciplinary process and through outreach and educational activities.

The Board issues a [quarterly newsletter](/node/610382) that provides up-to-date information on the Board's current activities.
