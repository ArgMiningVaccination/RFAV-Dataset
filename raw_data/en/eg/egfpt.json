E-mail: alex.jenkins@mcgill.ca ABSTRACT Introduction: Low fat -free mass (FFM) is linked to poor health outcomes in COPD, including impaired exercise tolerance and premature death . The aim of this systematic review was to synthesi se evidence on the effectiveness of interventions for increasing FFM in COPD. Methods: Searches of electronic databases (MEDLINE, Cochrane EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus) and trial registers (ClinicalTrials.gov) were undertaken from inception to August 2022 for randomi sed studies of interventions assessing measures of FFM in COPD. T he primary outcome was change in FFM (including derivatives). Secondary outcomes were adverse events, compliance, and attrition. Results: 99 studies (n=5,138 people with COPD ) of 11 intervention components, used alone or in combination, were included . Exercise training increased mid -thigh cross - sectional area ( k=3, 95% p=0.1 6). Combined, exercise training and nutritional supplementation increase d measures related to FFM in 67% of studies. Anabolic steroid s 98, 95% CI 0.24-1.72, p=0.0 09). Neuromuscular electrical stimulation increased measures related to FFM in 50% of studies. No interventions were more at risk of serious adverse events, low compliance, or attrition. Discussion: Exercise training and nutritional supplementation were not effective in isolation to increase FFM but were for localised muscle and index measures , respectively. Combined, exercise and nutritional supplementation shows promise as a strategy to increase FFM in COPD. A nabolic steroids are efficacious for increasing FFM in COP D. INTRODUCTION Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by a progressive and irreversible decline in lung function (1). In addition , COPD is recognised as a sys temic disease with significant extra -pulmonary effects (1). Loss of skeletal muscl e mass is a well described and clinically relevant systemic consequence of COPD . Across the disease severity spectrum of COPD, t he prevalence of abnormally low muscle mass (i.e., sarcopenia or cachexia) is estimated to be ~23% (2). Proposed pathophysiological mecha nisms include i) disease -related factors such as systemic inflammation , ii) ageing , and iii) behaviour modification , particularly less time spent physically active and more time spent sedentary (3, 4) . Importantly, low muscle mass is not just a systemic manifestation affecting people with COPD who are underweight, but also those who are pre -obese or obese, termed sarcopenic obesity, which is similarly associated with poor health outcomes in COPD (3, 5) . People with COPD who possess higher muscle or fat-free mass have a better quality of life (6) and prognosis (7, 8) . In addition, a systematic review from our laboratory recently identified a positive association between muscle or fat -free mass and exercise tolerance in COPD (9). This has led to low muscle mass being recognised as a treatable trait of COPD to help alleviate disea se burden and improve clinical health outcomes (10). Despite abnormally low muscle mass being a prevalen t and clinically meaningful extra - pulmonary manifestation of COPD , it is still unclear how to best treat this trait (11). Current evidence and clinical advice for tre ating low muscle mass in COPD primarily centres around nutritional supplementation and/or exercise training (12). However, previous systematic reviews exploring the benefits of nutritional supplementation for increasing fat -free mass in COPD have report ed conflicting results , with the evidence base appearing more favourable in people with COPD who are malnourished (13-17). Likewise, the effects of exercise training on increasing measures related to muscle or fat-free mass in COPD are inconsistent, as reported in two previous systematic reviews (18, 19) . Despite the prominence of nutritional supplementation and exercise training as methods to increase measures of fat -free mass in COPD, which have been the focus of previously discussed reviews, little is known about other interventions and their potential benefit . Therefore, the primary aim of this systematic review and meta -analysis was to collate and synthesi se available evidence from randomi sed studies to estimate the size of the effect of intervention s to alter measures of fat -free mass in COPD. The secondary aim was to assess adverse events, compliance, and attrition with interventions to alter measures of fat -free mass in COPD. METHODS The protocol for this review ( CRD42020202052) was pre -registered on PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; www.crd.york . ac.uk/PROSPERO/). Protocols deviations are outlined in the supplementary material. This systematic review was reported following PRISMA reporting guidel ines (20). Population Adults aged 18 years with either a clinical (i.e., by a physician) and/or spirometry determined (forced expiratory volume in 1 -second (FEV 1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of less than 0.70 or below the lower limit of normal ) diagnosis of COPD. Intervention Examined the effect of an intervention on measures related to fat-free mass in COPD . Studies assessing a combination of two or more intervention s as adjunctive therapies were also included. Comparator Comparator groups of any form w ere included . Where adjuncts to interventions were assessed, the standalone intervention groups were considered as comparators (e.g., nutritional supplementation + exercise training versus exercise training) . Healthy comparator groups were excluded from this review. Outcomes Reported measures of fat -free mass, or derivatives including lean mass, skeletal muscle mass, muscle cross -sectional area, circumference measurements, body cell mass, and phase angle, either as a primary or secondary outcome. The primary outcome of this review was measures related to fat -free mass. Secondary outcomes were adverse events, compliance and attrition. Study design Randomized studies were included . Studies that used a randomi sed cross -over design were eligible up to the point of cross -over. Studies were excluded from this review if they were: non -randomised, observational or cohort studies ; narrative or systematic reviews ; case studies ; editorials ; a thesis ; or conference abstracts. Search strategy The Cochrane Database o f Systematic Reviews (CDSR), PROSPERO, and the Database o f Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), were searched to identify any relevant published or ongoing systematic reviews. Searches of the following bibliographic databases and trial registers were undertaken : MEDLINE ; Cochrane Central Register of Controll ed Trials (CENTRAL) ; EMBASE ; Web of Science Core Collection ; Scopus ; and Clinicaltrials.gov. Search parameters were set from inception to 19th August 2022 with no limit on language . Search terms were structured around the population (e.g., \" COPD\") and outcome (e.g. , \"fat-free mass \") of interest. The search strategy conducted in MEDLINE is displayed in Table S1 with MeSH terms adapted for use in other databases in consultation with a medical librarian . Searches were supplemented with forward and backward citation tracking from included studies and review articles identified from the search process . Selection process References identified from the search process were imported into EndNote referencing software (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA). After removal of duplicate citations, remaining unique references were exported to Rayyan software (Rayyan Systems I nc., Cambridge, MA, USA) (21) to be independently screened based on title and abstract by two reviewers. Full -text papers were requested for studies not excluded based on title/abstract and independently reviewed by two reviewers for eligibility. Any discrepancies in study inclusion d ecisions were resolved through discussion and consensus, or by consultation with a third reviewer . Where possible, attempts were made to obtain potentially eligible studies published in a language other than English and translated for screening against eli gibility criteria. Data collection process and data items Data extraction was completed using an adapted Microsoft Excel form based on the Cochrane Data Extraction Template. This template was piloted on a small subset of studies and subsequently refined. A single reviewer extracted data from eligible studies, which was cross -checked for accuracy by a second reviewer. Data items extracted from each study (Table S2) and further information can be found in the supplementary material. Risk of bias assessment The revised Cochrane Tool for Risk of Bias ( RoB 2 ) (23) was used to evaluate risk of bias. The domains assessed were: bias arising from the randomi sation process ; bias due to deviations from intended interventions ; bias due to missing outcome data ; bias in the measurement of the outcome ; and bias in the selection of the reported re sult. Individual domains were categorised as having high, unclear or low risk of bias. Domain ratings were pooled to provide an overall risk of bias assessment of low (all domains were found to be of low risk of bias), some concerns (some concerns raised in at least one domain in the absence of any domains with a high risk of bias), or high (at least one domain with a high risk of bias, or some concerns across multiple domains). Risk of bias assessments were undertaken independe ntly by two reviewers with an y disagreements resolved through discussion and consensus or the inclusion of a third reviewer. Data synthesis strategy Meta -analyses were performed in accordance with Cochrane guidance using Review Manager version 5.4 (24). Measures of effect for c ontinuous outcomes were computed as mean diff erences or standardi sed mean differences where appropriate . Post- intervention values were only used when pre-intervention values were deemed sufficiently homogenous between intervention and co mparator groups. Where mean differences were reported without accompanying standard deviation values, attempts were made to impute for these values using approaches deemed suitable by Cochrane guidelines (25), including : calculating correlati on coefficients derived from other studies included in the same analyses ; converting 95% confidence intervals to standard deviations ; or using a conservative correlation coefficient of 0.5 a ccording to previous formulae (26). Risk ratios were used for dichotomous outcomes . Individual study estimates were statistically combined using a generic inverse random -effects method. The I2 value was used to determine statistical heterogeneity in meta - analyses. Potential sources of heterogeneity in meta -analyses were explored when the I2 statistic was >40%. Pre -specified subgroup analys es to determine po tential sources of heterogeneity according to clinical and methodological factors included: population characteristics ; intervention characteristics ; comparator type ; and outcome measures . The generalised terms of 'depleted' or 'non -depleted' were adopted for population characteristics in studies that recruited, or sub -grouped participants, based on body composition characteristics ; however, no consistent criteria were used to define participants as 'depleted' due to the varying definitions adopted across studies . All individual study definitions of 'depleted' are defined in the footnotes of Table S3 . A minimum of three studies were required to perform a meta -analysis. Sensitivity analyses were planned based on studies with a low risk of bias, but as no meta - analyses of primary outcomes presented with three or more studies with a low risk of bias, these analyses were not undertaken . Studies unable to be included in meta - analyses were narratively synthesi sed. Further details surrounding the data synthesis strategy can be found in the supplementary material. RESULTS Following removal of duplicates, the search strategy identified 14,164 records to be screened, of which , 13,097 were excluded based on title and abstract. Full te xts were obtained for the remaining 1,067 records, of which , 99 met the inclusion criteria with 9 of these being studies utilising the same dataset of an included study , leaving a total of 90 included studies (Figure 1 ). Figure 1. Flow diagram of study selection Characteristics of included studies The 90 included studies were published between 1987 and 2022 (27-116) (Table S3). A total of 5,138 people with COPD were randomi sed, with study sample sizes ranging from 14 to 233. The severity of COPD ranged from mild to very severe . Intervention components assessed in studies included : nutritional supplementation ( k = 45); exercise training (k = 45); anabolic steroids (k = 7) ; neuromuscular electrical stimulation (k = 7); inspiratory muscle training ( k = 5); hormon e ( k = 4); ACE- inhibitors (k = 2); antibody therapy (k = 1); lung volume reduction surgery (k = 1); acupuncture (k = 1); and behaviour change (k = 1), with some interventions assessed in combination. Comparator groups varied and included : usual care ; placebo ; sham ; different modalities and dosages of exercise training ; nutritional supplementation ; and anabolic steroids , with some comparators utilised as a combination . Interventions varied widely in terms of duration , ranging from 5 days to 24 months. Outcomes of fat - free mass , which were measured in a variety of ways and sometimes utili sing multiple tools within single studies, included: bioelectrical impedance analysis (n = 37) ; dual- energy x -ray absorptiometry (n = 24) ; tape measure (n = 18) ; muscle biopsy (n = 8) ; computed tomogra phy scan (n = 5) ; ultrasound (n = 4) ; deuterium and bromide (n = 4); magnetic resonance imaging (n = 3); and measurement tool not reported in f ive studies. High risk of bias was present in 5 3 (59%) studies, some concerns around bias were apparent in 30 (33%) studies, with low risk of bias present in 7 (8%) studies. Elements of risk of bias were mainly apparent due to: poor study reporting of randomi sation procedures ; missing data ; and a lack o f blinding of participants and outcome assessors (Table S 4). Meta -analyses and qualitative synthesis Exercise training v ersu s non-exercise based care Ten studies (27-34, 94, 117) explored exercise training versus non-exercise based care and assessed 12 different outcomes. The frequency of exercise training ranged from twice daily to twice a week . Training intensity ranged from 50 -80% of 1 repetition maximum ( RM)/40-80% work rate maximum or was determined by Borg score or baseline measures . Training duration ranged from 30 to 120 minutes per session with intervention duration ranging from 5 days to 2 years . Training modality was aerobic and/or resistance exercise. Meta -analysis of four studies (29, 34, 35, 94) found that exercise training alone did not significa ntly increas e fat-free mass measures compared to non-exercise based care , with heterogeneity deemed unimportant (standardi sed mean difference ( SMD) = 0.03, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.24, 75; I2 = 0%; Figure 2A). Meta -analysis of three studies (27, 31, 33) found that exercise training alone significantly increased measures of mid -thigh cross -sectional area compared to non - exercise based care, with substantial heterogeneity present (S MD = 1.04, 95% CI - 0.02 to 2.06 , p = 0. 04; I2 = 68%; Figure 2 B). Due to the small number of included studies, subgroup analyses were not performed to investigate sources of heterogeneity. All reported outcomes have been narratively summarised in Table S5 . Of the included studies, three (27, 30, 33) out of 10 (30%) reported significant increases in measures related to fat -free m ass, with significant outcomes being measures of lower limb fat - free mass . Alcazar et al. (27) reported significant increases in vastus lateralis thickness and mid -thigh cross -sectional area with a combination of aerobic and resistance high intensity interval exercise versus usual care. Farias et al. (30) reported significant increases in skeletal muscle mass of the lower limbs with aerobic exercise versus usual care. Kongsgaard et al. (33) report ed significant increases in mid -thigh cross -sectional area with lower -limb resistance exercise versus usual care. Secondary outcomes are reported in the supplementary material and Figure S1 . A B Figure 2.

Nutritional supplementation v ersu s no supplementation Thirty six studies (46-49, 56 -81, 83 -86, 105, 116) assessed nutritional supplementation versus no supplementation using 24 different outcomes . The supplement s included: macronutrient s; essential , non -essential or branched acids ; antioxidants ; L-carnitine ; polyunsaturated fatty acids ; herbal remedies ; creatine ; probiotics ; and nitrate . Intervention duration ranged from 9 days to 12 months. Meta -analysis of 1 9 studies (46-49, 57, 60 -64, 66, 67, 69, 70, 79, 81, 83 -85) found that nutritional supplementation alone did not increase fat -free mass measures versus no supplementation , with substantial heterogeneity present ( SMD = 0. 16, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.39, = 0.1 6; I2 = 63%; Figure 3A ). There was no evidence of publication bias (Figure S 2A). Subgroup analyses performed to investigate heterogeneity found no statistically significant differences between subgroups (all, p 0.05) ( Figure S 2B-E). Meta -analysis of 11 studies (46, 47, 58, 60, 61, 68, 70, 77 -79, 83) found that nutritional supplementation alone significantly increased fat-free mass index versus with ortant ( SMD = 95% 0.13 p < 0.001; I2 = 16%; Figure 3B ). There was no evidence of publication bias (Figure S 3). Meta -analysis of three studies (46, 56, 72) found that nutritional supplementation alone did not increase arm circumference versus no supplementation , with heterogeneity deemed unimportant (mean difference ( MD) 95% -0.61 to 0.43cm, 0%; Figure 3 C). Meta -analysis of four studies (56, 73, 74, 76) found that nutritional supplementation alone did not increa se arm muscle circumference versus no supplementation , with heterogeneity deemed unimportant (MD = to 1.88cm, p = 0.13; I2 = 0%; Figure 3 D). All reported outcomes have been narratively summarised in Table S6 . Of the included studies, four (46, 66, 67, 77) out of 36 (11%) studies reported significant increases in fat-free mas s measures with nutritional supplement ation alone versus no supplementa tion. Fuld et al. (67) reported significa nt increases in fat-free mass with creatine supplementation versus placebo. Likewise, Marinari et al. (77) reported significant increases in fat-free mass index with a combination of coenzyme QTer\u00ae and creatine supplementation versus placebo. Ahmadi et al. (46) reported significant increases in fat -free mass and fat-free mass index with whey protein ( 15.9g/day ) fortified with magnesium and vitamin C supplementation versus usual care. Engelen et al. (66) reported significant increases in whole -body lean mass and lean mass of the extremities with polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation versus placebo. Two studies (49, 61) report ed significant decreases in fat -free mass measures with nutritional supplementation versus no supplementation . Beijers et al. (49) reported significant decreases in fat-free mass, lean mass, leg lean mass, and trunk lean mass with resveratrol supplementation versus placebo. Dal Negro et al. (61) reported significant decreases in fat-free mas s with essential amino acid supplementation versus placebo. Secondary outcomes are reported in the supplementary material and Figure S4 .

IV, inverse variance; SE, standard error. Anabolic steroids versu s Placebo Seven studies (94, 95, 103 -106, 108) assessed anabolic steroids (specifically testosterone enanthate or nandrolone decanoate) versus placebo on nine different outcomes. Intervention duration ranged from six to 27 weeks. Meta -analysis of five studies (94, 95, 104, 106, 108) found that anabolic steroids significantly increased fat -free mass measures versus placebo , with substantial heterogeneity present (SMD = 0.98, 95% CI 0. 24 to 1.72, p < 0.001 ; I2 = 71%; Figure 4). Subgroup analyses found a significant ly greater increase in fat -free mass measures (p = 0.01) in 'depleted' people with COPD (SMD = 2.68, 95% CI 1.27 4.08, 'non -depleted' individuals (SMD = 0.68, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.27, p = 0.02 ; Figure S 5B). No subgroup differences were found for measurement tool (p = 0.13 ; Figure S 5A) or intervention type (p = 0.10 ; Figure S 5C). Study designs were not homogenous enough to permit a subgroup analys is. All reported outcomes have been narratively summarised in Table S 7. Four (94, 95, 104, 108) of the seven (57%) included studies reported sig nificant increases in fat -free mass measures with anabolic steroids versus placebo. These four studies (94, 95, 104, 108) all reported significant increases in either fat -free or lean mass. In addition, Ferreira et al. (104) reported significant increases in thigh and mid -arm muscle circumference with anabolic steroids . Casaburi et al. (94) reported significant increases in leg and arm lean mass with anabolic steroids . Secondary outcomes are reported in the supplementary material and Figure S6 . A Figure 4.

IV, inverse variance; SE, standard error. Other interventions/comparisons Other interventions or comparisons unable to be meta -analysed due to a lack of studies or lack of availability of appropriately formatted data included: exercise training of different modalities (e.g., resistance versus aerobic, eccentric versus concentric, single-limb versus two-limb) ; nutritional supplementation combined with exercise training ; hormonal therapy ; neuromuscular electrical stimulation ; ACE-inhibitors ; inspiratory muscle training ; antibody therapy ; lung volume reduction surgery ; acupuncture ; behavi our change ; and anabolic steroids combined with exercise training or nutritional supplementation . The results of these interventions /comparisons have been narratively summari sed in the supplementary material and in Table S 8. Discussion This is the first systematic review to synthesise evidence from randomised studie s exploring the efficacy of interventions, of any nature, for increasing measures related to fat -free mass in people with COPD. The main findings were: 1) an extensive array of interventi ons have previously been explored for their effect on fat -free mass in people with COPD, which vary in their type and dose, making it difficult to ascertain what might be the optimal interventional approach; 2) t here is currently limited evidence that exercise training or nutritional supplementation alone are sufficient to improve measures of fat-free mass , but nutritional supplementation appears efficacious for increasing index measures of fat -free mass ; 3) combining aerobic and resistance exercise tra ining with nutritional supplementation may be more effective than either intervention alone to increase fat-free mass ; 4) anabolic steroids are effective for increasing measures of fat-free mass, particularly in people with COPD classified as 'depleted '; and 5) alternative approaches such as neuromuscular electrical stimulation have shown promise for increasing lower limb muscle mass. The findings of the current review , that exercise training alone was not sufficient to increase measures of fat -free mass in COPD, are somewhat surprising given the established evidence base in healthy populations showing that exercise training, specifically resistance -based exercise training, increases skeletal muscle mass (118) . A previous review in the COPD population supported the benefits of exercise training on increasing fat -free mass, albeit the review in question was narrative in nature and included non -randomised studies (18), whereas the current review pooled randomis ed studies only. Assessment of study characteristics may explain , at least in part, the lack of observed effect in terms of increases in measures of fat -free mass. Alcazar et al. (27) and Kongsgaard et al. (33) were two of only three studies to demonstrate a significant increas e in measures of fat -free mas s with exercise training . Notably, these studies were well designed to induce muscle hypertrophy given that they focussed heavily on resistance exercise training and worked in line with the progressive overload principle as well as the intensity frame work outlined by the American College of Sports Medicine , which recommends 1 to 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions at an intensity of 70 -85% of one repetition maximum (119) . Such information about exercise training is often poorly reported or assessed in studies surrounding people with COP D. The three studies reporting significant improvements in measures of fat -free mass ranged from 8 to 12 weeks in duration, with the remaining studies ranging from 5 days to 24 months. Therefore, i t would appear that intensity and progressiv e overload are more important factor s than duration when it comes to inducing muscle hypertrophy in COPD with exercise training. However, we cannot discount th e possib ility that another factor contributing to this lack of observed effect with measures of f at-free mass may be the heterogeneous response to exercise experienced by people within the COPD population, whereby some subgroups are recognised as non -responders (120) . It could be speculated that anabolic resistance , which is present in people with COPD (121) , could play a role in th ese non-respon ders. However, recent evidence has suggested that impaired responses to resistance exercise training do not appear to be apparent in COPD (122) . It is important to acknowledge that positive e ffects were seen with mid -thigh cross -sectional area. Assessing studies included in this meta -analysis suggested that exercise and outcomes tailored to specific muscle groups, in this case the lower -limbs, are required to observe changes in measures related to fat -free mass. The beneficial effects of training specific muscle groups are likely to be diluted if utilising whole -body fat -free mass measures as opposed to localised measures . In line with the findings of the current review, two prior reviews report ed a lack of effect of nutritional supplementation on fat-free mass measures in COPD (13, 14) . The variation in findings between studies included in this review may in part be explained by study design. As outlined in Table S3 , very few studies included in our review tailored nutritional supplementation regimens to individual patient needs by accounting for their energy expenditure requirements and recommended daily allowances , with most studies applying a 'one size fits all' approach aiming to solely increase calorie intake but not standardising this across people involved within the study. This is critically important as 'depleted' people with COPD require a larger increase in calorie intake than 'non -depleted' people who may not require supplementation at all. Many different types of supplementation were implemented among the studies included in our review . It could be argued that some supplements, mainly resveratrol (an antioxidant) , are not designed to increase fat -free mass measures, hence the negative results observed in the single study that assessed this (49). With normative ageing, it is well established that anabolic resistance occurs (123) . In COPD, anabolic resistance may also be present (121) meaning that higher amounts of protein may be required as part of nutritional supplementation to overcome this barrier. However, there is evidence to suggest that there is no disease specific heightening of anabolic resistance in COPD compared to healthy aged adults (59, 124) , meaning that dietary protein requirements are likely similar between these two groups . The majority of included studies implementing protein supplementation did so at a dosage of <20g/day. It has been demonstrated that older adults are less sensitive to 20g protein ingestion following exercise via attenuated muscle protein synthesis and may require greater dosages up to 40g/day (125) . The relatively low daily dose of protein used in most included studies may help explain the lack of observed effects in the current review. In additio n to this, only two studies (48, 80) provided targ eted protein supplementation on a gram per kilogram body mass basis, but neither of these studies reported significant increases in fat -free mass measures . Also, very few studies assessed or utilised assessments of protein intake prior to commencing protei n supplementation to determine whether people were meeting the ir recommended daily allowance. This is important as it details whether supplementation was targeted to enable people with COPD to meet the recommended daily allowance for protein, or whether the target was to exceed the recommended daily allowance. Even tho ugh most studies supplemented their COPD participants with more protein than otherwise provided by their normal diet, it still may not have been enough to optimise muscle protein synthesis and hypertrophy. Conventionally , it is seen that nutritional supp lementation and resistance exercise training are required to increase measures of fat -free mass (126) . Two out of three studies included in our review reported significant increases in measures of fat -free mass when these two interventions were used in combination , which is promising and deserves greater attention . Nutritional supplementation and resistance training work well together as resistance exercise can increase the rate of muscle protein synthesis whilst concurrently, nutritional supplementation, particularly dietary protein supplementation , can suppress muscle protein breakdown providing an ideal environment to support muscle growth (126) . Our findings relating to increasing fat -free mass measures with anabolic steroids (specifically testosterone enanthate and nandrolone decanoate) in COPD support the results of studies in healthy adults (127) and people with diseases such as chronic renal failure, muscular dystrophy, and human immunodeficiency virus (128) as well as recent evidence in people with COPD (129, 130) . Substantial heterogeneity was observed in our findings suggesting a wide range of effects . Subgroup analyses suggested that people with COPD variably classified as 'depleted' (e.g., malnourished, underweight, sarcopenic) are more likely to benefit from anabolic steroids than their 'non-depleted' counterparts . However, t his subgroup effect was dri ven primarily by the results of a single study by Ferreira et al. (104) that was different than other included studies. Most notably, it was the only study to supplement a baseline 250mg dose of intramuscular testosterone with a daily 12mg dose of oral stanozolol (testosterone) as opposed to periodic top -ups (i.e., every 1 -4 weeks) . Ferreira et al. (104) had the longest intervention period of 27 weeks, with Svartberg et al. (108) providing a 250mg dose of testosterone enanthate every four weeks for 26 weeks, which also produced significant increases in fat -free mass in a non -depleted population. Other included studies in 'non-depleted ' groups of people with COPD were of a shorter duration (6- 16 weeks ) and utilised either testosterone e nanthate (100mg/week) or nandrolone decanoate (25 mg and 50mg every two weeks for females and males , respectively). This suggests that in people with COPD (especially those who are 'depleted'), daily doses of anabolic steroids over a n extensive period (i.e., 6 months) may be needed to optimise the ir interventional efficacy in terms of increasing fat-free mass measure s. Half of the six studies that assess ed neuromuscular electrical stimulation as a therapy reported increases in measures of fat -free mass. These findings are of interest as neuromuscular electrical stimulation is often used to target muscle strength . Neuromuscular electrical stimulation has also been shown to preserve muscle mass during periods of immobili sation in healthy adults (131) , but it has been noted that such changes in muscle mass require further investigation (132) . Whilst all included studies in the current review were assessed in groups of 'non-depleted ' and non -hospitalised people with COPD, neuromuscular electrical stimulation shows promise for increasing localised (i.e., quadriceps or calf) fat -free mass measures as opposed to focussing on preserving fat-free mass measures in people that are hospitalised/bed -bound. In addition to this, previous research in healthy adults and rats has shown that neuromuscular electrical stimulation in isolation may not be sufficient to induce muscle hypertrophy, but is efficacious when used in combination with blood flow restriction (133-136). This combination is an unexplored avenue in people with COPD that should be addressed. Given the lack of studies assessing growth hormones, Bimagrumab, acupuncture, lung volume reduction surgery, ACE -inhibitors and behaviour change , it is diff icult to draw meaningful interpretations about their efficacy or lack thereof at th is current stage. However, for certain interventions such as acupuncture, lung volume reduction surgery, ACE-inhibitors and behaviour change (depending on whether behaviour change specifically targets resistance exercise training and nutrition ), there is little to no physiological rationale for a direct effect on muscle hypertrophy. Thus, such interventions should not be used in people with COPD for the sole purpose of increas ing measures of fat -free mass. In contrast, t here is a physiological rationale for using growth hormones (137) and Bimagrumab (138) to promote muscle anabolism , and these interventions deserve further attention in COPD . Methodological considerations A strength of the current review is that successful efforts were made to obtain data from several study authors to permit the inclusion of more studies in meta -analyses. However, this was not the case in all studies and the exclusion of studies from certai n analyses should be considered a limitation, even though these were narratively included to provide balance. Some analyses , for example nutritional supplementation versus no supplementation, presented with substantial heterogeneity that could not always be explained by subgroup analyses ; thus, it is not clear where the 'true' effect lies for certain outcomes. The varying definitions utilised by studies in the current review for conditions such as cachexia, sarcopenia, malnourished and others, all grouped t ogether under the umbrella term of 'depleted', are likely to have impacted the findings of our subgroup analyses. The deviations from the original pre -registered protocol , as outlined in the supplementary material , should also be considered a limitation of this review. It is important to note that we focused on measures of fat -free mass alone and did not consider other indices of muscle dysfunction common in COPD , specifically strength and endurance. Whilst there is a positive correlation between whole -body lean mass and each of quadriceps muscle strength and endurance in COPD (139) , changes in measures of fat-free mass do not always translate to increases in muscle s trength and/or endurance (44, 89, 140) . Therefore, making assumptions with regards to changes in muscle strength and /or endurance based on changes in fat -free mass measures presented in the current review should be done so with caution . It is important to highlight that many of the studies included in the current review only incl uded male s with COPD . In particular , only two out of 7 studies involving anabolic steroids included females . Given the sexual dimorphism that reportedly exists in, for example, the physiol ogical response to aerobic and resistance exercise training (141, 142) , addressing the biological sex knowledge gap by including females in therapeutic trials focused on muscle hypertrophy in COPD shoul d be a top priority in moving forward . Whilst our comprehensive and broad review brings together evidence on interventions to alter fat-free mass measures in COPD, it is important to highlight that not all included studies were specifically designed to inc rease measures of fat-free mass (i.e., fat -free mass was not the primary outcome and studies may have been underpowered to demonstrate interventional efficacy on fat -free mass) . Finally, the lack of reporting of between group differences for some narratively synthesi sed studie s means that the effects observed in th ose studie s cannot be fully compared with other included studies . Implications for clinical practice Given the mixed findings b etween outcomes for exercise training and nutritional suppl ementation , questions remain about utilising these interventions in isolation to increase measures of fat -free mass in COPD. Exercise training is effective at inducing muscle hypertrophy when properly prescribed in terms of frequency, intensity, time and type (i.e., mainly resistance -based) (118) , and even more so when combined with nutritional supplementation (i.e., protein and creatine) (126, 143) on an individualised basis in healthy adults . Assessing the characteristics of the studies included in our review , it is likely that exercise training -based interventions were not optimised to increase measures of fat -free mass in COPD. Narrative synthesis suggests more therapeutic promise of utilising exercise training and nutrition al supplementation in combination for increasing measures of fat -free mass in COPD . Whilst increases in fat-free mass measures were demonstrated with anabolic steroids, substantial heterogeneity was present, but suggested this treatment modality would be m ore beneficial for people with COPD who are 'depleted'. The number of studies assessing anabolic steroids was relatively small to warrant recommendations for clinical practice. Research is regularly published assessing interventions to increase measures of fat - free mass in COPD , especially with the identification of sarcopenia ( abnormally low skeletal muscle mass) as a treatable trait of COPD (10), paving the way for regular updates on interventions specifically highlighted within the current review. In the meantime, clinicians should follow consensus/expert -based guidance for exerci se training and nutritional supplementation (144, 145) . Implications for future research The utilisation of a wide variety of outcomes for assessing fat -free mass related measures is an area for consideration in future research. A consensus driven approach to developing a core set of outcomes for body composition measurement (e.g., fat -free ma ss, lean mass, skeletal muscle mass) that accounts for the availability of equipment (e.g., bioelectrical impedance analysis, dual -energy x -ray absorptiometry) should be considered . Furthermore, the choice and availability of outcomes should be carefully c onsidered to increase specificity , as well as sensitivity, with the intended intervention. For example, segmental measures of fat -free mass may be better suited to interventions targeting specific limbs (i.e., lower -limb resistance exercise training), as o pposed to whole -body measures which may dilute the signal. Importantly, future studies should tailor interventions to each individual with COPD instead of adopting a 'one size fits all' approach . This includes prescribing mainly resistance exercise training to a moderate -high intensity with progressive overload and conducting regular re -evaluations of strength to ensure adequate progression of intensity . In addition, nutritional supplementation should be provided , mainly in the form of a high protein diet, which is dosed to the requirement (s) of the population . In practice, this is likely to be targeting people with COPD who are 'depleted' as this group has been identified as being more amenable t o intervention s targeted at increasing muscle mass (144) . With this in mind, research should also consider examining subgroups such as sarcopeni a within recruited populations making sure to define these populations based on the definitions provided by expert -based panels such as European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (146) . Given the promising findings surrounding the combination of exercise and nutritional supplementation, future research should look to assess the efficacy of multiple interventions in tandem (e.g., resistance exercise training + protein su pplementation + anabolic steroids) with a specific view of targeting people with COPD that are cachectic or sarcopenic. Research should also make sure that appropriate statistical analyses are undertaken to permit comparison of between group differences , instead of solely analysing within -group comparisons which fail to provide an observation of the interaction effect between intervention and comparator groups . Randomi sed studies should also be designed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool vers ion 2 in mind to promote more high quality randomised controlled studie s. Finally, the lack of assessment of compliance with interventions is an area that should be considered given the clinical importance of adherence for intervention implementation and efficacy . Conclusions The results of this systematic review and meta -analys is suggest that : exercise training increases localised fat -free mass measures (e.g., mid-thigh cross -sectional area) , but not whole -body fat -free mass measures ; and nutritional supplementation increases index measures of fat -free mass. A nabolic steroids were shown to be effective at increasing measures related to fat -free mass in people with COPD . Narrative analyses supported the efficacy of nutritional supplementatio n and exercise training in combination for increasing measures related to fat -free mass in COPD . Future research should assess combinations of interventions and be sure to tailor interventions in an individualized manner to target increases in fat-free mass in accordance with established guidelines for prescription (i.e., resistance training in accordance with frequency, intensity, time and type as well as progressive overload principles , and setting nutritional supplementation targets based on recommended daily allowances to optimise muscle hypertrophy ).

First, due to the volume of randomized and non -randomized trials retrieved from searches, it was not deemed feasible to include these succinctly within the context o f this review. Therefore, we focused solely on randomized trials. Second, it became apparent during forward and backwards citation tracking that papers had been missed by our original search strategy, so in consultation with a librarian, new terms were added to our strategy, and we re -ran our search from inception as opposed to updating the previous searches from February 2019 and June 2020. The limit on English language was also dropped upon advice of the librarian to maximise inclusion. Finally, the outco me of muscle strength was not included in this review as the search strategy was primarily tailored towards measures of fat -free mass. Given that increases in muscle mass do not always translate to increases in muscle strength (1, 44, 89 ), the value of ass ociating muscle mass and strength in the current review was questioned, with assessing interventions to increase muscle strength deemed to be a separate research question.

Extracted data from studies meeting inclusion criteria Data extraction Study details Title, date of study, author(s), study aim(s), study duration Methods Study design, intervention, primary outcome(s), secondary outcome(s) Participants Population demographics (age, sex, ethnicity, diagnosis, disease severity, co -morbidities), inclusion/exclusion criteria, sample size Intervention/Comparators Number randomized to groups, description of intervention and comparator (setting, method of delivery/administration, frequency, intensity/dose, time/duration, type) Outcomes Outcome name and definition, outcome type, method of outcome measurement and reporting, time points reported Data collection process and data items Where any data were missing, study authors were contacted. The online WebPlotDigitizer tool (2) was used to extract data from figures if not readily available in tables, text, or from contact with study authors. Where the same dataset was publis hed across different studies, the study that provided the most complete data pertaining to our outcomes of interest was used for data extraction. These studies were combined and treated as one study in the analyses. Data synthesis strategy Data from the longest follow -up time point were extracted from studies with interventions reporting multiple time points, provided an 'active' intervention was being administered throughout this period. If not, the nearest post active intervention time point was used. Studies that provided adjunctive therapies in the intervention group, compared with a standalone intervention in the comparator group, were conservatively included in meta -analyses provided the only difference between groups was the interventi on of focus. For example, comparisons of nutritional supplementation and exercise training versus exercise training alone were included in nutritional supplementation versus no supplementation analyses. This approach assumes that there was no synergistic e ffect and both groups receiving exercise training mitigated the effect of that intervention, but subgroup analyses were performed to assess the impact of including these types of studies if heterogeneity was present. Where studies reported multiple similar measures of fat -free mass (i.e., fat -free mass (index), lean mass (index), skeletal muscle mass (index)), fat -free mass or fat -free mass index were preferentially selected for inclusion in the meta -analysis with other outcomes narratively synthesised. In studies where single versus combination, or high versus low dose, intervention arms were assessed, the combination or high dose arm was utilised for the meta -analysis with the single or low dose intervention arms narratively synthesised. Comparator groups had to be deemed sufficiently homogeneous to perform meta -analyses. Table S3.

Compliance with nutritional supplementation was reported in nine studies and ranged from 74 to 100% (46, 47, 49, 58, 64, 78, 81, 83, 85). Pooled attrition data from 23 studies (46-48, 57-59, 62 - 64, 66 -71, 75, 78, 79, 81, 83 -85, 116) suggested there was no significant difference in the risk of dropout between nutritional supplementation versus no supplementation, with heterogeneity deemed unimportant (RR = 1.15, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.46, p = 0.27, I2 = 9%; Figure S4). Two of the includ ed studies (66, 79) had multiple intervention arms, which were combined for the purposes of assessing the risk of attrition. Two studies (49, 105) reported attrition of the overall study population and not per group; therefore, these data were not included in the meta -analyses. Nineteen studies reported on adverse events and found no significant difference between nutritional supplementation and no supplementation groups, with no serious intervention related adverse events reported (46, 47, 49, 57, 58, 62 , 64-69, 72, 78, 79, 84, 85, 105, 116 ).

Pooled attrition data from four studies (94, 95, 104, 108) suggested there was no significant difference in the risk of dropout between anabolic steroid versus placebo groups, with heterogeneity deemed unimportant (RR = 1.17, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.88, p = 0.7 4, I2 = 0%; Figure S5 ). One study (105) reported attrition of the overall study population and not per group; therefore, these data were not included in the meta -analysis. Sharma et al. (106) reported no dropouts in either anabolic steroid or placebo group s; thus, this study was not included in the meta -analysis. Six studies reported on adverse events and found no significant differences between anabolic steroid and placebo groups in relation to the number of events experienced (94, 103, 104-106, 108 ). Figure S6. Study -level data, effect estimates and forest plot of comparison for risk of attrition following anabolic steroid supplementation versus placebo . IV, inverse variance; SE, standard error. Other interventions/comparisons Four (36, 38, 44 , 114) out of 17 (24%) studies comparing differing exercise modalities reported significant increases in fat -free mass measures. Bernard et al. (36) reported a significant increase of thigh cross -sectional area with a combination of aerobic and resistance ex ercise training versus aerobic exercise training alone. Covey et al. (38) reported a significant increase of arm lean mass with upper -limb resistance exercise versus gentle stretching exercise. Klijn et al. (44) reported a significant increase in fat -free mass index with non -linear periodized aerobic and resistance exercise versus conventional aerobic and resistance exercise. Wang et al. (114) reported a significant increase in fat -free mass index with aerobic cycling exercise versus free walking, as well a s with a combination of aerobic cycling exercise and inspiratory muscle training versus free walking. Of three studies comparing nutritional supplementation combined with both aerobic and resistance exercise training versus usual care, two studies (31, 35) reported significant increases in fat -free mass index with significant increases in quadriceps cross -sectional area additionally reported by Gurgun et al. (31). Of four included studies assessing the efficacy of growth hormones versus placebo, a single study (25%) (89) reported significant increases in the proportion of people with COPD who experienced a 3% increase in whole -body lean mass. Of six studies compar ing neuromuscular electrical stimulation with sham or usual care, three (50%) studies (97, 99, 100 ) reported significant increases in fat free measures. Maddocks et al. (97) reported significant increases in rectus femoris cross -sectional area. Vieira et al. (99) reported significant increases in thigh circumference measured at 28cm below the iliac crest. Vivodtzev et al. (100) reported significant increases in mid -thigh and calf cross -sectional area. One study (94) reported significant increases in whole -body lean mass, arm lean mass, trunk lean mass and leg lean mass with anabolic steroids plus lower -limb resistance exercise versus placebo alone or in combination with lower -limb resistance exercise. Casaburi et al. (94) also reported significant increases in whole -body lean mass, arm lean mass, and trunk lean mass with anabolic steroids versus a combination of placebo and lower -limb resistance exercise. Polkey et al. (111) reported a significant increase in appendicular lean mass and thigh muscle volume w ith the human monoclonal antibody Bimagrumab versus placebo. Mineo et al . (109) reported significant increases in fat -free mass and mid -arm muscle circumference with lung -volume reduction versus exercise and inspiratory muscle training. Suzuki et al. (113) reported a significant increase in mid -upper arm circumference with acupunctur e versus sham. No significant differences in fat -free mass measures were reported in two studies assessing the efficacy of ACE -inhibitors or in a single study comparing a behaviour change intervention to usual care.
