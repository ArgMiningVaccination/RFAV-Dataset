NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Rebif 22 micrograms solution for injection in pre -filled syringe 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each pre -filled syringe (0.5 mL) contains 22 micrograms (6 MIU*) of interferon beta-1a**. * Million International Units, measured by cytopathic effect (CPE) bioassay against the in -house interferon beta-1a standard which is calibrated against the current international NIH standard (GB-23-902-531). ** produced in Chinese hamster ovary Cells (CHO -K1) by recombinant DNA technology. Excipient with k nown effect: Contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose of 0.5 mL. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection in pre -filled syringe. Clear to opalescent solution, with pH 3.5 to 4.5 and osmolarity 250 to 450 mOsm/L. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rebif is indicated for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was characterised by two or more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without ongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physici an experienced in the treatment of the disease. Rebif is available in three strengths: 8.8 micrograms, 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms. For patients initiating treatment with Rebif, Rebif 8.8 micrograms and Rebif 22 micrograms are available in a pack that corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of therapy. Posology The recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms given three times per week by subcutaneous injection. A lower dose of 22 micrograms, also given three times per week by subcutan eous injection, is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating specialist. When first starting treatment with Rebif, the dose should be gradually escalated in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing a dverse reactions. The Rebif initiation package corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of treatment. Paediatric population No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. However, a paediat ric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records in children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in 3 children (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years ol d) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. The safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif should not be used in this age group. Method of administration Rebif is administered by subcutaneous injection. Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised to decrease flu -like symptoms associated with Rebif administratio n. At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with Rebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should be evaluated at least every second year in the 4 -year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and a decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating physician. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to an y of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, th e name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. General recommendations Patients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta administration, including symptoms of the flu -like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued treatment. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) Cases of thrombotic purpura (TTP) or haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to several yea rs after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased platelet counts, increased (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes (erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, further testing of blood platelet levels, ser um LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate discontinuation of Rebif is recommended. Depression and suicidal ideation Rebif should be administered wi th caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis popula tion and in 4 association with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation of therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Seizure disorders Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving treatment with anti -epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with antiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). Cardiac disease Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be cl osely monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. Symptoms of the flu -like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to patients with cardiac conditions. Injection site necrosis Injection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: use an aseptic injection technique, rotate the injection sites with ea ch dose. The procedure for the self -administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if injection site reactions have occurred. If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before continuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until healing has occurred. Patients with single lesi ons may continue provided that the necrosis is not too extensive. Hepatic dysfunction In clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1 -3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic transaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, serum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy and periodically thereafter. Dose r eduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times the ULN, and gradually re -escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated with caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of a ctive liver disease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be stopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. Rebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe li ver injury including acute hepatic failure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six months of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No specific risk fact ors have been identified. Renal and urinary disorders Nephrotic syndrome Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during treatment with interferon -beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon -beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and discontinuation of tr eatment with Rebif should be considered. Laboratory abnormalities Laboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme monitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at regular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms. Thyroid disorders Patients being treated with Rebif may occasiona lly develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. Thyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6 -12 months following initiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be perform ed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). Severe renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression Caution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to patients with severe ren al and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. Neutralising antibodies Serum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of antibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with Rebif 22 micrograms, approximately 24% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to interferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic response to interferon beta-1a (beta -2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance of the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies is associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient resp onds poorly to therapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the benefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positi vity limits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. Other forms of multiple sclerosis Only sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non -ambulatory patients with multiple sclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in pa tients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis and should not be used in these patients. Excipients Sodium content This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium -free'. 6 Benzyl alcohol This medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. Monitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. Advise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential ri sk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450 -dependent enzymes in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. The interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been studied systematically. Clini cal studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and corticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy A large amount of data (more than 1 ,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post -marketing experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre -conception exposure to interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure dur ing the second and third trimester is very limited. Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. If clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy Breast -feeding Limited information available on the transfer of interferon bet a-1a into breast milk , together with the chemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta -1a excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast -feeding. Fertility The effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. 7 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Central nervous system -related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta (e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu -like synd rome. Flu -like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70% of patients treated with Rebif can expect to experience the typical interferon flu -like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. Approximately 30% of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild inflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and decreases i n white blood cells are also common. The majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, and respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of Rebif may be tem porarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. List of adverse reactions The adverse reactions presented have been identified from clinical studies as well as from post - marketing reports (an asterisk [*] indicates adverse reactions identified during post -marketing surveillance) . The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (1/10) , very rare (<1/10,000) , frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) . Blood and the lymphatic see section 4.4 ), pancytopenia * Endocrine disorders Uncommon: Thyroid dysfunction, most often presenting as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism Immune system disorders Rare : Anaphylactic reactions* Hepatobiliary disorders Very or without icterus* Rare: Hepatic failure* (see section 4.4), autoimmune hepatitis* Psychiatric disorders Common: Depression, insomnia Rare: Suicide a ttempt* 8 Nervous system disorders Very common: Headache Uncommon: Seizures* Frequency not known: Transient neurological symptoms (i.e. hypoesthesia, muscle spasm, paraesthesia, difficulty in walking, musculoskeletal stiffness) that may mimic multiple sclerosis exacerbations* Eye disorders Uncommon: Retinal vascular disorders (i.e. retinopathy, cotton wool spots, obstruction of retinal artery or vein) * Vascular disorders Uncommon: Thromboembolic events* known: Pulmonary arterial hypertension* (class label for interferon products, see below Pulmonary arterial hypertension) Gastrointestinal disorders Common: Diarrhoea , syndrome *, glomerulosclerosis * (see section 4.4) General disorders and administration site conditions Very common: Injection site inflammation, injection site reaction, influenza -like symptoms Common: Injection site pain, fatigue, rigors, fever Uncommon: Injection site necrosis, injection site mass, injection site abscess, injection site infections*, increased sweating* Rare: Injection site cellulitis* Frequency not known: Panniculitis (occurred in the injection site) Paediatric population No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. Limited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 1 7 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times week ly is similar to that seen in adults. Class effects The administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, vasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia. An increased formation of auto -antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. 9 Pulmonary arterial hypertension Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are ask ed to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V . 4.9 Overdose In case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive treatment should be given. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 glycoproteins with immunomodulatory, antiviral and antiproliferative properties. Rebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human interferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hams ter ovary) and is therefore glycosylated like the natural protein. Regardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the administration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2 '5'OAS synthetase and serum concentrations of beta -2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to decline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable responses. After repeated subcutaneous administr ation every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological responses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. Biological response markers (e.g., 2',5' -OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2 -microglobulin) are induced by interferon beta -1a following su bcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer subjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours for neopterin, beta -2-microglobulin and 2'5'OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and OAS2 gene exp ression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after first and sixth administration. The precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. Relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis The safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3 -12 million IU), administered subcutaneously three times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 22 microg rams has been demonstrated to decrease the incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at least 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0 -5.0 at entry. The proportion of patients with di sability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed three months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 30% (Rebif 22 micrograms). Over 4 years, the 10 reduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Re bif 22 micrograms, and 29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated with placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis In a 3 -year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence of clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the preceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was reduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and those without relapses in the 2 -year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in patients witho ut relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at the end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be interpreted cautiously. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should not be used in these patients. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Absorption In healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp multi -exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular administrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposur e to interferon beta. Distribution Following repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum concentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. Elimination After repeated subcutaneous dose s in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUC tau and C max) increased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated apparent half -life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple dosing. Metabolism Interferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated -dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. Rebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. A study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An increased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studie s of other alpha and beta interferons. No information is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility. 11 6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Rebif 44 micrograms solution for injection in pre -filled syringe 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each pre -filled syringe (0.5 mL) contains 4 4 micrograms (12 MIU*) of interferon beta-1a**. * Million International Units, measured by cytopathic effect (CPE) bioassay against the in -house interferon beta-1a standard which is calibrated against the current international NIH standard (GB-23-902-531). ** produced in Chinese hamster ovary Cells (CHO -K1) by recombinant DNA technology. Excipient with known effect: Contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose of 0.5 mL. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for i njection in pre -filled syringe. Clear to opalescent solution, with pH 3.5 to 4.5 and osmolarity 250 to 450 mOsm/L. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rebif is indicated for the treatment of patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1) patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical t rials, this was characterised by two or more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without ongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the disease. Rebif is available in three strengths: 8.8 micrograms, 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms. For patients initiating treatment with Rebif, Rebif 8.8 micrograms and Rebif 22 micrograms are available in a pack that corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of therapy. Posology When first starting treatment with Rebif, in order to allow tachyphylaxis t o develop thus reducing adverse reactions it is recommended that patients be started at 8.8 micrograms dose subcutaneously and the dose be increased over a 4 week period to the targeted dose, according to the following schedule: 14 Recommended Titration (% of final dose) Titration dose for Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week (tiw) Weeks 1 -2 20% 8.8 micrograms tiw First demyelinating event The posology for patients who have experienced a first demyelinating event is 44 micrograms of Rebif given three times per week by subcutaneous injection. Relapsing multiple sclerosis The recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms given three times p er week by subcutaneous injection. A lower dose of 22 micrograms, also given three times per week by subcutaneous injection, is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating specialist. Paediatric population No forma l clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. However, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records in children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of t his study suggest that the safety profile in children (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. The safety and efficacy o f Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif should not be used in this age group. Method of administration Rebif is administered by subcutaneous injection. Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each inj ection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised to decrease flu -like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with Rebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should be evaluated at least every second year in the 4 -year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and a decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the tr eating physician. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. General recommendations Patients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta administration, including symptoms of the flu -like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend 15 to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued treatment. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) Cases of thrombotic purpura (TTP) or haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta produ cts. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous s ystem symptoms (e.g. confusion, paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased platelet counts, increased (LDH) due schistocytes (erythrocyte fragmentation) on a b lood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate discontinuation of Rebif is recommended. Depression and suicidal ideation Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in association with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report any symptoms of depression and/or s uicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation of therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Seizure disorders Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving treatment with anti -epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with antiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). Cardiac disease Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. Symptoms of the flu -like syndro me associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to patients with cardiac conditions. Injection site necrosis Injection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise the risk of injection si te necrosis patients should be advised to: use an aseptic injection technique, rotate the injection sites with each dose. The procedure for the self -administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if injection site reactions have occurred. If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before continuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until healing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too extensive. 16 Hepatic dysfunction In clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations o f hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1 -3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic transaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, serum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy and periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times the ULN, and gradually re -escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated with caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver disease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be stopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. Rebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic failure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six months of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No specific risk factors have been identified. Renal and urinary disorders Nephro tic syndrome Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal (MGN) have been reported during treatment with interferon -beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon -beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinu ria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and discontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. Laboratory abnormalities Laborato ry abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. The overall incidence of these is slightly higher with Rebif 44 than Rebif 22 micrograms. Therefore, in addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme monitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at regular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clini cal symptoms. These should be more frequent when initiating Rebif 44 micrograms. Thyroid disorders Patients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. Thyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6 -12 months following initiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be performed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). Severe renal or hepatic failure an d severe myelosuppression Caution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to patients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. Neutralising antibodies Serum neutral ising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of antibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with Rebif 44 micrograms, approximately 13 to 14% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to interferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic 17 response to interferon beta-1a (beta -2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance of the induction of antibodies has n ot been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies is associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to therapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reass ess the benefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity limits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. Other forms of multiple scle rosis Only sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non -ambulatory patients with multiple sclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis and should not be used in these patients. Excipients Sodium content This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium -free'. Benzyl alcohol This medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. Monitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. Advise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in p atients with hepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interacti on studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450 -dependent enzymes in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. The interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been studied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and corticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy A large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post -marketing experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre -conception exposure to interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of preg nancy. However, the duration of exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very limited. 18 Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. If clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy Breast -feeding Limited information available on th e transfer of interferon beta -1a into breast milk, together with the chemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta -1a excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/in fant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast -feeding. Fertility The effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Central nervous system -related adverse events associated with the u se of interferon beta (e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu -like syndrome. Flu -like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70% of patients treated with Rebif can expect to experience the typical interferon flu -like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. Approximately 30% of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild inflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and decreases in white blood cells are also common. The majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, and respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of Rebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. List of adverse reactions The adverse reactions presented have been identified from clinical studies as well as from post - marketing reports (an asterisk [*] indi cates adverse reactions identified during post -marketing surveillance) . The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (1/10), common (1/100 to <1/10), uncommon <1/100), rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Blood and the lymphatic system beta see section 4.4 ), pancytopenia * Endocrine disorders Uncommon: Thyroid dysfunction, most often presenting as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism 19 Immun e system disorders Rare : reactions* Hepatobiliary disorders or without Rare: Hepatic section 4.4), au toimmune disorders Common: Depression, insomnia Rare: Suicide a ttempt* Nervous system disorders Very common: Headache Uncommon: Seizures* Frequency not known: Transient neurological symptoms (i.e. hypoesthesia, muscle spasm, paraesthesia, difficulty in walking, musculoskeletal stiffness) that may mimic multiple sclerosis exacerbations* Eye disorders Uncommon: Retinal vascular disorders (i.e. retinopathy, cotton wool spots, obstruction of retinal artery or vein) * Vascular di sorders known: Pulmonary arterial hypertension* (class label for interferon products, see Pulmonary arterial hypertension) Gastrointe stinal disorders Common: Diarrhoea Nephrotic syndrome *, glomerulosclerosis * (see section 4.4) General disorders and administration site conditions Very common: Injection site inflammation, injection site reaction, influenza -like symptoms Common: Injection site pain, fatigue, rigors, fever Uncommon: Injection site necrosis, injection site mass, injection site abscess, injection site infections*, increased sweating* Rare: Injection site cellulitis* Frequency not known: Panniculitis (occurred in the injection site) 20 Paediatric population No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. Limited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults. Class effects The administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, vasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia. An increased formation of auto -antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. Pulmonary arterial hypertension Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points including up to seve ral years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V . 4.9 Overdose In case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive treatment should be given. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 immunomodulatory, antiviral and antiproliferative properties. Rebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human interferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore glycosylated like the natural protein. Regardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the administration of Rebif . After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2'5'OAS synthetase and serum concentrations of beta -2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to decline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produc e fully superimposable responses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological responses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. Biological response markers (e.g., 2',5' -OAS activity, neopterin a nd beta 2 -microglobulin) are induced by interferon beta -1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer subjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours for neopterin, beta -2-microglobuli n and 2'5'OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and OAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after first and sixth administration. 21 The precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis i s still under investigation. Single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis One 2 -year controlled clinical trial with Rebif was performed in patients with a single clinical event suggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The patients enrolled into the trial had at least two clinically silent lesions on the T2 -weighted MRI scan, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of which is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could better explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded. Patients were randomised in a double -blind manner to either Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week, Rebif 44 micrograms once weekly, or placebo. If a second clinical demyelinating even t occurred confirming definite multiple sclerosis, patients switched to the recommended posology of Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week in an open label manner, while maintaining blinding as to initial randomisation. Efficacy results of Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week compared to placebo from this study are as follows: Parameter Statistics Treatment Treatment Comparison Rebif 44 Log-Rank p-value McDonald KM Estimate 37.5% 20.6% Mean CUA Lesions per Subject per Scan During the Double Blind Period Least Square Means (SE) 2.59 (0.30) 0.50 (0.06) 81% 0.19 [0.14;0.26] * <0.001 per week , CI: confidence interval, CUA: combined unique active * Least Squared Mean Ratio [95% CI] For the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a more conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least one new T2 or one new Gd -enhancing lesion on a follow -up scan taken at least 1 month after the initial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. Relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis The safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3 -12 million IU), administered subcutaneously three times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 44 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease the incidence (approximat ely 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at least 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0 -5.0 at entry. The proportion of patients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed three months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 27% (Rebif 44 micrograms). Over 4 years, the reduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and 29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated with placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. 22 Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis In a 3 -year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence of clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the preceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was reduced by approximate ly 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and those without relapses in the 2 -year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in patients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at the end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be interpreted cautiously. Primary progress ive multiple sclerosis Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should not be used in these patients. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Absorption In healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp multi -exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular administrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta. Distribution Following repe ated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum concentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. Elimination After repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AU Ctau and C max) increased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated apparent half -life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple dosing. Metabolism Interferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated -dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. Rebif has no t been investigated for carcinogenicity. A study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An increased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No information i s available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility. 23 6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for in jection in pre -filled syringe. Clear to opalescent solution, with pH 3.5 to 4.5 and osmolarity 250 to 450 mOsm/L. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rebif is indicated for the treatment of patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1) patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical t rials, this was characterised by two or more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without ongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the disease. 26 Posology The Rebif initiation package corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of treatmen t. When first starting treatment with Rebif, in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing adverse reactions, it is recommended that patients be started at 8.8 micrograms dose subcutaneously and the dose be increased over a 4 week period to the targeted dose, according to the following schedule: Recommended Titration (% of final dose) Titration dose for Rebif 44 micrograms three times per Weeks Paediatric population No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. However, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records in children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in children (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. The safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif should not be used in this age group. Method of administration Rebif is administered by subcutaneous injection. Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised to decrease flu -like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with Rebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should be evaluated at least every second year in the 4 -year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and a decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating physician. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. General recommendations Patients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta administration, including symptoms of the flu -like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued treatment. 27 Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) Cases of thrombotic purpura (TTP) or haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include thrombocytopen ia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased platelet counts, increased (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes (erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate discontinuation of Rebif is recommended. Depression and suicidal ideation Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in association with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to im mediately report any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation of therapy with Rebif should be c onsidered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Seizure disorders Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving treatment with anti -epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with antiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). Cardiac disease Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. Symptoms of the flu -like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to patients with cardiac conditions. Injection site necrosis Injection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: use an aseptic injection technique, rotate the injection sites with each dose. The procedure for the self -administration by the patient should be reviewed period ically especially if injection site reactions have occurred. If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physici an before continuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until healing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too extensive. Hepatic dysfunction In clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1 -3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic 28 transaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the ab sence of clinical symptoms, serum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy and periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times the ULN, and gradually re -escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated with caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver disease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Re bif should be stopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. Rebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic failure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six months of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No specific risk factors have been identified. Renal and urinary disorders Nephro tic syndrome Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal (MGN) have been reported during treatment with interferon -beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon -beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinu ria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and discontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. Laboratory abnormalities Laborato ry abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme monitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and pla telet counts are recommended at regular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms. Thyroid disorders Patients being treated with Rebif may occasionally deve lop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. Thyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6 -12 months following initiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be performed if cl inical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). Severe renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression Caution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to patients with severe renal and h epatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. Neutralising antibodies Serum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of antibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with Rebif 22 micrograms, approximately 24% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to interferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic response to interferon beta-1a (beta -2 microgl obulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance of the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies is associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poor ly to therapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the benefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. 29 The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity limits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. Other forms of multiple sclerosis Only sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non -ambulatory patients with multiple sclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients wi th primary progressive multiple sclerosis and should not be used in these patients. Excipients Sodium content This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium -free'. Benzyl alcohol This medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. Monitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. Advise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, whic h might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450 -dependent enzymes in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. The interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been studied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and corticosteroids or ACTH d uring relapses. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy A large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post -marketing experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre -conception exposure to interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very limited. Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abort ion. The risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. 30 If clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be c onsidered during pregnancy Breast -feeding Limited information available on the transfer of interferon beta -1a into breast milk, together with the chemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta -1a excret ed in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast -feeding. Fertility The effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and us e machines Central nervous system -related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta (e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu -like syndrome. Flu -like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70% of pat ients treated with Rebif can expect to experience the typical interferon flu -like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. Approximately 30% of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild inflamma tion or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and decreases in white blood cells are also common. The majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, and respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of Rebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. List of adverse reactions The adverse reactions presented have been identified from clinical studies as well as from post - marketing reports (an asterisk [*] indicates adverse reactions identified during post -marketing surveillance) . The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (1/10), common (1/100 to <1/10), uncommon <1/100), rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Limited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults. Class effects The administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, vasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia. An increased formation of auto -antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. Pulmonary arterial hypertension Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 immunomodulatory, antiviral and antiproliferative properties. Rebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human interferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore glycosylated like the natural protein. Regardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the administration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2'5'OAS synthetase and serum concentrations of beta -2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to decline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations p roduce fully superimposable responses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological responses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. Biological response markers (e.g., 2',5' -OAS activity, neopte rin and beta 2 -microglobulin) are induced by interferon beta -1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer subjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours for neopterin, beta -2-microgl obulin and 2'5'OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and OAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after first and sixth administration. 33 The precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclero sis is still under investigation. Single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis One 2 -year controlled clinical trial with Rebif was performed in patients with a single clinical event suggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The pat ients enrolled into the trial had at least two clinically silent lesions on the T2 -weighted MRI scan, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of which is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could better explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded. Patients were randomised in a double -blind manner to either Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week, Rebif 44 micrograms once weekly, or placebo. If a second clinical demyelinating event occurred confirming definite multiple sclerosis, patients switched to the recommended posology of Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week in an open label manner, while maintaining blinding as to initial randomisation. Efficacy results of Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week compared to placebo from this study are as follows: Parameter Statistics Treatment Treatment Comparison Rebif 44 Log-Rank p-value McDonald KM Estimate 37.5% 20.6% Mean CUA Lesions per Subject per Scan During the Double Blind Period Least Square Means (SE) 2.59 (0.30) 0.50 (0.06) 81% 0.19 [0.14;0.26] * <0.001 per week , CI: confidence interval, CUA: combined unique active * Least Squared Mean Ratio [95% CI] For the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a more conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least one new T2 or one new Gd -enhancing lesion on a follow -up scan taken at least 1 month after the initial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. Relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis The safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated i n patients with relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3 -12 million IU), administered subcutaneously three times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 22 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease the incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at least 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0 -5.0 at entry. The proportion of patients with disability progression, as defined by at least one poin t increase in EDSS confirmed three months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 30% (Rebif 22 micrograms). Over 4 years, the reduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and 29% in patients treated with R ebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated with placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. 34 Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis In a 3 -year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence of clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the preceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was reduced by ap proximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and those without relapses in the 2 -year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in patients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the pr oportion with progression in disability at the end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be interpreted cautiously. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should not be used in these patients. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Absorption In healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp multi -exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular administrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta. Distribution Following repe ated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum concentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. Elimination After repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AU Ctau and C max) increased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated apparent half -life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple dosing. Metabolism Interferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated -dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. Rebif has no t been investigated for carcinogenicity. A study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An increased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No information i s available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility. 35 6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODU CT Rebif 22 micrograms/0.5 mL solution for injection in cartridge 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each pre -filled cartridge contains 66 micrograms (18 MIU*) of interferon beta-1a** in 1.5 mL solution, corresponding to 44 micrograms/mL. * Million International Units, measured by cytopathic effect (CPE) bioassay against the in -house interferon beta-1a standard which is calibrated against the current international NIH standard (GB-23-902-531). ** produced in Chinese hamster ovary Cells (CHO -K1) by recombinant DNA technology. Excipient with known effect: Contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose of 0.5 mL. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection in cartridge. Clear to opalescent solution, with pH 3.7 to 4.1 and osmolarity 250 to 450 mOsm/L. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rebif is indicated for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was characterised by two or more acute exacerbation s in the previous two years (see section 5.1). Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without ongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the disease. Posology The recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms given three times per week by subcutaneous injection. A lower dose of 22 micrograms, also given three times per week by subcutaneous injection, is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating specialist. When first starting treatment with Rebif, the dose should be gradually escalated in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing adverse reactions. The Rebif initiation package corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of treatment. Paediatric population No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. However, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records in children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in children (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. 38 The safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif should not be used in this age group. Method of administration Rebif solution for subcutaneous injection in a cartridge is intended for multidose use with the RebiSmart electronic injection device following adequate traini ng of the patient and/or carer. For administration, the instructions provided in the package leaflet and in the instruction manual (Instructions for Use) provided with RebiSmart should be followed. Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic ana lgesic is advised to decrease flu -like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with Rebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It i s recommended that patients should be evaluated at least every second year in the 4 -year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and a decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating physician. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. General recommendations Patients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta administration, including symptoms of the flu -like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued treatment. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) Cases of thrombotic purpura (TTP) or haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were repor ted at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. c onfusion, paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased platelet counts, increased (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes (erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore i f clinical features of TMA are observed, further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate discontinuation of Re bif is recommended. 39 Depression and suicidal ideation Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicid al ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in association with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to th eir prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation of therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Seizure disorders Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving treatment with anti -epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with antiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). Cardiac disease Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. Symptoms of the flu -like syndrome associated with interfer on beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to patients with cardiac conditions. Injection site necrosis Injection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: use an aseptic injection technique, rotate the injection sites with each dose. The procedure for the self -administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if injection site reactions have occurred. If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before continuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesion s, Rebif should be discontinued until healing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too extensive. Hepatic dysfunction In clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (pa rticularly alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1 -3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic transaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, serum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy and periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times the ULN, and gradually re -escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated with ca ution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver disease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be stopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfuncti on appear. Rebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic failure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six months of treatment . The mecha nism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No specific risk factors have been identified. 40 Renal and urinary disorders Nephrotic syndrome Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal (MGN) have been reported during treatment with interferon -beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon -beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinu ria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and discontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. Laboratory abnormalities Laborato ry abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme monitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and pla telet counts are recommended at regular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms. Thyroid disorders Patients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. Thyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6 -12 months following initiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be performed i f clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). Severe renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression Caution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to patients with severe renal a nd hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. Neutralising antibodies Serum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of antibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with Rebif 22 micrograms, approximately 24% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to interferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic response to interferon beta-1a (beta -2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance of the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies is associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to therapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the benefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity limits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. Other forms of multiple sclerosis Only sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non -ambulatory patients with multiple sclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patient s with primary progressive multiple sclerosis and should not be used in these patients. 41 Excipients Sodium content This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium -free'. Benzyl alcohol This medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. Monitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. Advise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosi s. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450 -dependent enzymes in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepilepti cs and some classes of antidepressants. The interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been studied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and corticosteroi ds or ACTH during relapses. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy A large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post -marketing experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre -conception exposure to interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use was contraindicated during pregna ncy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very limited. Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontane ous abortion. The risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. If clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy Breast -feeding Limited information available on the transfer of interferon beta -1a into breast milk , together with the chemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta -1a excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast -feeding. 42 Fertility The effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Central nervous system -related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta (e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the saf ety profile The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu -like syndrome. Flu -like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency with continued treatment. Approximatel y 70 % of patients treated with Rebif can expect to experience the typical interferon flu -like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. Approximately 30 % of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild inflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and decreases in white blood cells are also common. The majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, and respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of Rebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. List of adverse reactions The adverse reactions presented have been identified from clinical studies as well as from post - marketing reports (an asterisk [*] indicates adverse reactions identified during post -marketing surveillance) . The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (1/10), common (1/100 to <1/10), uncommon <1/100), rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Blood and the lymphatic syste see section 4.4 ), pancytopenia * Endocrine disorders Uncommon: Thyroid dysfunction, most often presenting as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism Immune system disorders Rare : Anaphylactic disorders Very without Rare: Hepatic see section 4.4), autoimmune disorders Common: Depression, insomnia Rare: Suicide a ttempt* 43 Nervous system disorders Very common: Headache Uncommon: Seizures* Frequency not known: Transient neurological symptoms (i.e. hypoesthesia, muscle spasm, paraesthesia, difficulty in walking, musculoskeletal stiffness) that may mimic multiple sclerosis exacerbations* Eye disorde rs Uncommon: Retinal vascular disorders (i.e. retinopathy, cotton wool spots, obstruction of retinal artery or vein)* Vascular disorders kn own: Pulmonary arterial hypertension* (class label for interferon products, below Pulmonary arterial hypertension) Gastrointestinal disorders Common: Diarrhoea , Nephrotic syndrome *, glomerulosclerosis * (see section 4.4) General disorders and administration site conditions Very common: Injection site inflammation, inject ion site reaction, influenza -like symptoms Common: Injection site pain, fatigue, rigors, fever Uncommon: Injection site necrosis, injection site mass, injection site abscess, injection site infections*, increased sweating* Rare: Injection site cellulitis* Frequency not known: Panniculitis (occurred in the injection site) Paediatric population No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. Limited saf ety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults. Class effects The administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, vasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia. An increased formation of auto -antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. 44 Pulmonary arterial hypertension Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are ask ed to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V . 4.9 Overdose In case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive treatment should be given. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 glycoproteins with immunomodulatory, antiviral and antiproliferative properties. Rebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human interferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore glycosylated like the natural protein. Regardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the administration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2'5'OAS synthetase and serum concentrations of beta -2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to decline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable responses. After repeated subcutaneous admin istration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological responses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. Biological response markers (e.g., 2',5' -OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2 -microglobulin) are induced by interferon beta -1a followin g subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer subjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours for neopterin, beta -2-microglobulin and 2'5'OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and OAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after first and sixth administration. The precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. Relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis The safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3 -12 million IU), administered subcutaneously three times per week. At licensed posology, Rebi f 22 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease the incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at least 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0 -5.0 at entry. The proportion of patie nts with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed three months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 30% (Rebif 22 micrograms). Over 4 years, the 45 reduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients trea ted with Rebif 22 micrograms, and 29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated with placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. Secondary progressive multiple scleros is In a 3 -year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence of clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the preceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was reduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and those without relapses in the 2 -year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in patients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at the end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of pat ients a posteriori should be interpreted cautiously. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should not be used in these patients. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic prope rties Absorption In healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp multi -exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular administrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta. Distribution Following repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum concentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. Elimination After repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUC tau and C max) increased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated apparent half -life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulati on observed after multiple dosing. Metabolism Interferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated -dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. Rebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. A study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An increased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No information is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility. 46 6.

Clear to opalescent solution, with pH 3.7 to 4.1 and osmolarity 250 to 450 mOsm/L. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rebif is indicated for the treatment of patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1) patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trial s, this was characterised by two or more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without ongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the disease. For patients initiating treatment with Rebif, Rebif 8.8 micrograms and Rebif 22 micrograms are available in a pack that corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of therapy. Posology When first starting treatment with Rebif, in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing adverse reactions it is recommended that patients be started at 8.8 micrograms dose subcutaneously and the dose be increased over a 4 week period to the targeted dose, according to the following schedule: 49 Recommended Titration (% of final dose) Titration dose for Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week (tiw) Weeks 1 -2 20% 8.8 micrograms tiw First demyelinating event The posology for patients who have experienced a first demyelinating event is 44 micrograms of Rebif given three times per week by subcutaneous injection. Relapsing multiple sclerosis The recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms given three times p er week by subcutaneous injection. A lower dose of 22 micrograms, also given three times per week by subcutaneous injection, is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating specialist. Paediatric population No form al clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. However, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records in children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in children (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. The safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif should not be used in this age group. Method of administration Rebif solution for subcutaneous injection in a cartridge is intended for multidose use with the RebiSmart electr onic injection device following adequate traini ng of the patient and/or carer. For administration, the instructions provided in the package leaflet and in the instruction manual (Instructions for Use) provided with RebiSmart should be followed. Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised to decrease flu -like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with Rebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should be evaluated at least every second year in the 4 -year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and a decision for longer term treatme nt should then be made on an individual basis by the treating physician. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideatio n (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 50 General recommendations Patients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta administration, including symptoms of the flu -like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation o f therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued treatment. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) Cases of thrombotic purpura (TTP) or haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include thrombocytope nia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased platelet counts, increased serum (LDH) due to haemolysi s and schistocytes (erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate discontinuation of Rebif is recommended. Depression and suicidal ideation Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in particular to those wit h antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in association with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to i mmediately report any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation of therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Seizure disorders Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving treatment with anti -epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with antiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). Cardiac disease Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with int erferon beta-1a. Symptoms of the flu -like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to patients with cardiac conditions. Injection site necrosis Injection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see se ction 4.8). To minimise the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: use an aseptic injection technique, rotate the injection sites with each dose. The procedure for the self -administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if injection site reactions have occurred. If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of fluid fr om the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before continuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until 51 healing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may con tinue provided that the necrosis is not too extensive. Hepatic dysfunction In clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1 -3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic transaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, serum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy and periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times the ULN, and gradually re -escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated with caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver disease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be stopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. Rebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic failure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six months of treatment . The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No specific risk factors have be en identified. Renal and urinary disorders Nephrotic syndrome Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal reported during treatment with interferon -beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon -beta. Peri odic monitoring of early signs or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and discontinuation of treatment wit h Rebif should be considered. Laboratory abnormalities Laboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. The overall incidence of these is slightly higher with Rebif 44 than Rebif 22 micrograms. Therefore, in addition to those laborat ory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme monitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at regular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebi f therapy and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms. These should be more frequent when initiating Rebif 44 micrograms. Thyroid disorders Patients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnor malities. Thyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6 -12 months following initiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be performed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunc tion appear (see section 4.8). Severe renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression Caution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to patients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients wit h severe myelosuppression. 52 Neutralising antibodies Serum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of antibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with Rebif 44 micrograms, approximately 13 to 14% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to interferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic response to interferon beta-1a (beta -2 microglobulin and neopteri n). Although the clinical significance of the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies is associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to therapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the benefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity limits the ability to c ompare antigenicity among different products. Other forms of multiple sclerosis Only sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non -ambulatory patients with multiple sclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progress ive multiple sclerosis and should not be used in these patients. Excipients Sodium content This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium -free'. Benzyl alcohol This medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. Monitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. Advise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosi s. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450 -dependent enzymes in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepilepti cs and some classes of antidepressants. The interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been studied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and corticosteroi ds or ACTH during relapses. 53 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy A large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post -marketing experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre -conception exposure to interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use was contraindicated during pregna ncy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very limited. Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontane ous abortion. The risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. If clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy Breast -feeding Limited information available on the transfer of interferon beta -1a into breast milk, together with the chemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta -1a excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast -feeding. Fertility The effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Central nervous system -related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta (e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the saf ety profile The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu -like syndrome. Flu -like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency with continued treatment. Approximatel y 70 % of patients treated with Rebif can expect to experience the typical interferon flu -like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. Approximately 30 % of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild inflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and decreases in white blood cells are also common. The majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, and respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of Rebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. 54 List of adverse reactions The adverse reactions presented have been id entified from clinical studies as well as from post - marketing reports (an asterisk [*] indicates adverse reactions identified during post -marketing surveillance) . The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (1/ 10), common (1/100 to <1/10), uncommon to <1/100), rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Blood and the lymphatic system beta see section 4.4 ), pancytopenia * Endocrine disorders Uncommon: Thyroid dysfunction, most often presenting as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism Immune system disorders Rare : Anaphylactic reactions* Hepatobiliary disorders Very or without icterus* Rare: Hepatic failure* (see section 4.4), autoimmune hepatitis* Psychiatric disorders Common: Depression, insomnia Rare: Suicide a ttempt* Nervous system disorders Very common: Headache Uncommon: Seizures* Frequency not known: Transient neurological symptoms (i.e. hypoesthesia, muscle spasm, paraesthesia, difficulty in walking, musculoskeletal stiffness) that may mimic multiple sclerosis exacerbations* Eye disorders Uncommon: Retinal vascular disorders (i.e. retinopathy, cotton wool spots, obstruction of retinal artery or vein)* Vascular disorders known: Pulmonar y arterial hypertension* (class label for interferon products, below Pulmonary arterial hypertension) Gastrointestinal disorders Common: Diarrhoea , vomiting, Nephrotic syndrome *, glomerulosclerosis * (see section 4.4) General disorders and administration site conditions Very common: Injection site inflammation, injection site reaction, influenza -like symptoms Common: Injection site pain, fatigue, rigors, fever Uncommon: Injection site necrosis, injection site mass, injection site abscess, injection site infections*, increased sweating* Rare: Injection site cellulitis* Frequency not known: Panniculitis (occurred in the injection site) Paediatric population No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. Limited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults. Class effects The administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, vasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia. An increased formation of auto -antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. Pulmonary arterial hypertension Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Reporting of suspected adverse react ions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse r eactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V . 4.9 Overdose In case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive treatment should be given. 56 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 ins with immunomodulatory, antiviral and antiproliferative properties. Rebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human interferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore glycosylated like the natural protein. Regardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the administration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of synthetase of beta -2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to decline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable responses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological responses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. Biological response markers (e.g., 2',5' -OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2 -microglobulin) are induced by interferon beta -1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer subjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours for neopterin, beta -2-microglobulin and 2'5'OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and OAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after first and sixth administration. The precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. Single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis One 2-year controlled clinical trial with Rebif was performed in patients with a single clinical event suggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The patients enrolled into the trial had at least two clinically silent lesions on the T2 -weighted M RI scan, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of which is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could better explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded. Patients were randomised in a double -blind manner to either Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week, Rebif 44 micrograms once weekly, or placebo. If a second clinical demyelinating event occurred confirming definite multiple sclerosis, patients switched to the recommended posology of Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week in an open label manner, while maintaining blinding as to initial randomisation. 57 Efficacy results of Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week compared to placebo from this study are as follows: Parameter Statistics Treatment Treatment Comparison Rebif 44 Log-Rank p-value McDonald KM Estimate 37.5% 20.6% Mean CUA Lesions per Subject per Scan During the Double Blind Period Least Square Means (SE) 2.59 (0.30) 0.50 (0.06) 81% 0.19 [0.14;0.26] * <0.001 per week , CI: confidence interval, CUA: combined unique active * Least Squared Mean Ratio [95% CI] For the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a more conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least one new T2 or one new Gd -enhancing lesion on a follow -up scan taken at least 1 month after the initial scan. In any case, tre atment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. Relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis The safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micro grams (3 -12 million IU), administered subcutaneously three times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 44 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease the incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at least 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0 -5.0 at entry. The proportion of patients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed three months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 27% (Reb if 44 micrograms). Over 4 years, the reduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and 29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated with placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis In a 3 -year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence of clinical progression in the preceding two yea rs and who had not experienced relapses in the preceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was reduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and those without relapses in the 2 -year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in patients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at the end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be interpreted cautiously. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should not be used in these patients. 58 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Absorption In healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp multi -exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular administrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta. Distribution Following repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum concentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. Elimination After repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUC tau and C max) increased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated apparent half -life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple dosing. Metabolism Interferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidn eys. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated -dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. Rebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. A study on embry o/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An increased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No information is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on ma le fertility. 6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rebif is indicated for the treatment of patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1) patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clin ical trials, this was characterised by two or more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without ongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the disease. Posology The Rebif initiation package corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of treatment. When first starting treatment with Rebif, in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing adverse reactions, it is recommended that patients be started at 8.8 micrograms dose subcutaneously and the dose be increased over a 4 week period to the targeted dose, according to the following schedule: 61 Recommended Titration (% of final dose) Titration dose for Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week (tiw) Weeks 1 -2 20% 8.8 micrograms tiw 44 Paediatric population No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. However, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records in children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in children (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is s imilar to that seen in adults. The safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif should not be used in this age group. Method of administration Rebif solution for subcutaneous injection in a cartridge is intended for multidose use with the RebiSmart electronic injection device following adequate traini ng of the patient and/or carer. For administration, the instructions provided in the package leaflet and in the instruction manual (Instructions for Use ) provided with RebiSmart should be followed. Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised to decrease flu -like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. At the present time, it is not k nown for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with Rebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should be evaluated at least every second year in the 4 -year period after initiation of tre atment with Rebif and a decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating physician. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. General recommendations Patients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta administration, including symptoms of the flu -like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued treatment. 62 Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, purpu ra (TTP) or haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased platelet counts , and schistocytes (erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal fun ction is recommended. If TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate discontinuation of Rebif is recommended. Depression and suicidal ideation Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in association with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif an d treated appropriately. Cessation of therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Seizure disorders Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving treatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with antiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). Cardiac disease Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely monitore d for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. Symptoms of the flu -like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to patients with cardiac conditions. Injection site necrosis Injection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: use an aseptic injection technique, rotate the injection sites with each dose. The procedure for the self -administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if injection site reactions have occurred. If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of fluid from t he injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before continuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until healing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continu e provided that the necrosis is not too extensive. Hepatic dysfunction In clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1 -3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic 63 transaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, serum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy and periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Reb if should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times the ULN, and gradually re -escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated with caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver disease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be stopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. Rebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury incl uding acute hepatic failure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six months of treatment . The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No specific risk factors have been i dentified. Renal and urinary disorders Nephrotic syndrome Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal (MGN) have been reported during treatment with interferon -beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon -beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinu ria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and discontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. Laboratory abnormalities Laborato ry abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme monitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and pla telet counts are recommended at regular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms. Thyroid disorders Patients being treated with Rebif may occasionally deve lop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. Thyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6 -12 months following initiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be performed if cl inical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). Severe renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression Caution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to patients with severe renal and h epatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. Neutralising antibodies Serum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of antibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with Rebif 22 micrograms, approximately 24% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to interferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic response to interferon beta-1a (beta -2 microgl obulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance of the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies is associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poor ly to therapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the benefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. 64 The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity limits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. Other forms of multiple sclerosis Only sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non -ambulatory patients with multiple sclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patient s with primary progressive multiple sclerosis and should not be used in these patients. Excipients Sodium content This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium -free'. Benzyl alcohol This medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. Monitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. Advise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential ri sk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450 -dependent enzymes in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. The interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been studied systematically. Clini cal studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and corticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy A large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post-marketing experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre -conception exposure to interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of exposure during the first trimester is u ncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very limited. Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be evaluated based on the currently available dat a, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. 65 If clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy Breast -feeding Limited information available on the transfer of interferon beta -1a into breast milk, together with the chemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta -1a excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast -feeding. Fertility The effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Central nervous system -related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta (e.g. dizziness) might influence the patien t's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu -like syndrome. Flu -like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70 % of patients treated with Rebif can expect to experience the typical interferon flu -like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatm ent. Approximately 30 % of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild inflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and decreases in white blood cells are also common. The majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, and respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of Rebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at th e discretion of the physician. List of adverse reactions The adverse reactions presented have been identified from clinical studies as well as from post - marketing reports (an asterisk [*] indicates adverse reactions identified during post -marketing surve illance) . The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (1/10), common (1/100 to <1/10), uncommon <1/100), rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), frequency not known (cannot be estimat ed from the available data). Blood and the lymphatic beta see section 4.4 ), pancytopenia * Endocrine disorders Uncommon: Thyroid dysfunction, most often presenting as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism Immune system disorders Rare : Anaphylactic reactions* 66 Hepatobiliary disorders Very or without icterus* Rare: Hepatic failure* (see section 4.4), autoimmune hepatitis* Psychiatric disorders Common: Depression, insomnia Rare: Suicide a ttempt* Nervous system disorders Very common: Headache Uncommon: Seizures* Frequency not known: Transient neurological symptoms (i.e. hypoesthesia, muscle spasm, paraesthesia, difficulty in walking, musculoskeletal sti ffness) that may mimic multiple sclerosis exacerbations* Eye disorders Uncommon: Retinal vascular disorders (i.e. retinopathy, cotton wool spots, obstruction of retinal artery or vein)* Vascular disorders not known: Pulmonary arterial hypertension* (class label for interferon products, see below Pulmonary arterial hypertension) Gastrointestinal disorders Common: Diarrhoea , Nephrotic syndrome *, glomerulosclerosis * (see section 4.4) General disorders and administration site c onditions Very common: Injection site inflammation, injection site reaction, influenza -like symptoms Common: Injection site pain, fatigue, rigors, fever Uncommon: Injection site necrosis, injection site mass, injection site abscess, injection site infections*, increased sweating* Rare: Injection site cellulitis* Frequency not known: Panniculitis (occurred in the injection site) 67 Paediatric population No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. Limited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults. Class effects The administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, vasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia. An increased formation of auto -antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. Pulmonary arterial hypertension Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points including up to seve ral years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactio ns via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V . 4.9 Overdose In case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive treatment should be given. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 immunomodulatory, antiviral and antiproliferative properties. Rebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human interferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore glycosylate d like the natural protein. Regardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the administration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2'5'OAS synthetase and serum concentrations of beta -2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to decline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable responses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological responses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. Biological response markers (e.g., 2',5' -OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2 -microglobulin) are induced by interferon beta -1a following subcutaneous doses administered to health y volunteer subjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours for neopterin, beta -2-microglobulin and 2'5'OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and OAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and ti me were observed for most of these markers after first and sixth administration. 68 The precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. Single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis One 2 -year controlled cl inical trial with Rebif was performed in patients with a single clinical event suggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The patients enrolled into the trial had at least two clinically silent lesions on the T2 -weighted MRI scan, with a size o f at least 3 mm, at least one of which is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could better explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded. Patients were randomised in a double -blind man ner to either Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week, Rebif 44 micrograms once weekly, or placebo. If a second clinical demyelinating event occurred confirming definite multiple sclerosis, patients switched to the recommended posology of Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week in an open label manner, while maintaining blinding as to initial randomisation. Efficacy results of Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week compared to placebo from this study are as follows: Parameter Statistics Treatment Treatment Comparison Rebif 44 Log-Rank p-value McDonald KM Estimate 37.5% 20.6% Mean CUA Lesions per Subject per Scan During the Double Blind Period Least Square Means (SE) 2.59 (0.30) 0.50 (0.06) 81% 0.19 [0.14;0.26] * <0.001 per week , CI: confidence interval, CUA: combined unique active * Least Squared Mean Ratio [95% CI] For the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a more conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least one new T2 or one new Gd -enhancing lesion on a follow -up scan taken at least 1 month after the initial scan. In any case, treatment should only be co nsidered for patients classified as high risk. Relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis The safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3 -12 million IU), administered subcutaneously three times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 22 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease the incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at least 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0 -5.0 at entry. The proportion of patients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed three months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 30% (Rebif 22 micrograms). Over 4 years, the reduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and 29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated with placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. 69 Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis In a 3 -year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence of clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not exper ienced relapses in the preceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was reduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and those without relapses in the 2-year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in patients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at the end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 microg rams and 44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be interpreted cautiously. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple scl erosis, and should not be used in these patients. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Absorption In healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp multi -exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular administrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta. Distribution Following repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum concentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. Elimination After repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUC tau and C max) increased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated apparent half -life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple dosing. Metabolism Interferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated -dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. Rebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. A study on e mbryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An increased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No information is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility. 70 6.

DATE OF REVISION OF THE TEXT Detailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu . 72 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Rebif 22 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled pen 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each pre -filled pen contains 22 micrograms (6 MIU*) of interferon beta-1a** in 0.5 mL solution. * Million International Units, measured by cytopathic effect (CPE) bioassay against the in -house interferon beta-1a standard which is calibrated against the current international NIH standard (GB-23-902-531). ** produced in Chinese hamster ovary Cells (CHO -K1) by recombinant DNA technology. Excipient with known effect: Contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose of 0.5 mL. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection in pre -filled pen. Clear to opalescent solution, with pH 3.5 to 4.5 and osmolarity 250 to 450 mOsm/L. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rebif is indicated for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was characterised by two or more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without ongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the disea se. Rebif is available in three strengths: 8.8 micrograms, 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms. For patients initiating treatment with Rebif, Rebif 8.8 micrograms and Rebif 22 micrograms are available in a package that corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of therapy. Posology The recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms given three times per week by subcutaneous injection. A lower dose of 22 micrograms, also given three times per week by subcutaneous injection, is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating specialist. When first starting treatment with Rebif, the dose should be gradually escalated in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing adverse reactions. The Rebif initiat ion package corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of treatment. Paediatric population No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. However, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records in children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The resu lts of this study suggest that the safety profile in 73 children (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. The safety and ef ficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif should not be used in this age group. Method of administration RebiDose is a ready to use pre -filled pen for subcutaneous injection. It is intended for single use and should only be used following adequate training of the patient and/or carer. For administration of Rebif with RebiDose, the instructions provided in the package leaflet should be followed. Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injec tion, an antipyretic analgesic is advised to decrease flu -like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with Rebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should be evaluated at least every second year in the 4 -year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and a decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the trea ting physician. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 4.4 Special warnings and p recautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. General recommendations Patients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta administration, including symptoms of the flu -like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with con tinued treatment. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) Cases of purpura (TTP) or haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous syste m symptoms (e.g. confusion, paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased platelet counts, increased (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes (erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate discontinuation of Rebif is recommended. 74 Depression and suicidal ideation Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Dep ression and suicidal ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in association with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report any symptoms of depression and/or suici dal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation of therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Seizure disorders Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving treatment with anti -epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with antiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). Cardiac dise ase Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. Symptoms of the flu -like syndrome associ ated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to patients with cardiac conditions. Injection site necrosis Injection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: use an aseptic injection technique, rotate the injection sites with each dose. The procedure for the self -administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if injection site reactions have occ urred. If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before continuing injections with Rebif. If the pat ient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until healing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too extensive. Hepatic dysfunction In clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of h epatic transaminases (particularly alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1 -3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic transaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, serum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy and periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times the ULN, and gradually re -escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif sho uld be initiated with caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver disease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be stopped if icterus or other clinical sym ptoms of liver dysfunction appear. Rebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic failure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six months of treatment. T he mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No specific risk factors have been identified. 75 Renal and urinary disorders Nephrotic syndrome Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal (MGN) have been reported during treatment with interferon -beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon -beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinu ria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and discontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. Laboratory abnormalities Laborato ry abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme monitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and pla telet counts are recommended at regular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms. Thyroid disorders Patients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. Thyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6 -12 months following initiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be performed i f clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). Severe renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression Caution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to patients with severe renal a nd hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. Neutralising antibodies Serum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of antibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with Rebif 22 micrograms, approximately 24% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to interferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic response to interferon beta-1a (beta -2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance of the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies is associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to therapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the benefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity limits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. Other forms of multiple sclerosis Only sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non -ambulatory patients with multiple sclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patient s with primary progressive multiple sclerosis and should not be used in these patients. 76 Excipients Sodium content This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium -free'. Benzyl alcohol This medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. Monitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. Advise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosi s. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450 -dependent enzymes in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepilepti cs and some classes of antidepressants. The interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been studied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and corticosteroi ds or ACTH during relapses. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy A large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post -marketing experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre -conception exposure to interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use was contraindicated during pregna ncy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very limited. Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontane ous abortion. The risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. If clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy Breast -feeding Limited information available on the transfer of interferon beta -1a into breast milk , together with the chemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta -1a excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast -feeding. 77 Fertility The effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Central nervous system -related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta (e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu -like syndrome.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 immunomodulatory, antiviral and antiproliferative properties. Rebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human interferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore glycosylated like the natural protein. Regardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the administration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2'5'OAS synthetase and serum concentrations of beta -2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to decline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable responses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological responses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. Biological response markers (e.g., 2',5' -OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2 -microglobulin) are induced by interferon beta -1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer subjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours for neopterin, beta -2-microglobulin and 2'5'OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and OAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar heig ht and time were observed for most of these markers after first and sixth administration. The precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. Relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis The safety and efficacy of Rebi f has been evaluated in patients with relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3 -12 million IU), administered subcutaneously three times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 22 micrograms has been demonstrated to d ecrease the incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at least 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0 -5.0 at entry. The proportion of patients with disability progression, as define d by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed three months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 30% (Rebif 22 micrograms). Over 4 years, the 80 reduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and 29% in p atients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated with placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis In a 3 -year study in patients with sec ondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence of clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the preceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rat e was reduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and those without relapses in the 2 -year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in patients without relapses, but in patients wi th relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at the end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be interpreted c autiously. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should not be used in these patients. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Absorption In healthy volunteers af ter intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp multi -exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular administrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta. Distributio n Following repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum concentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. Elimination After repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUC tau and C max) increased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated apparent half -life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple dosing. Metabolism Interferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated -dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. Rebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. A study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An increased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta in terferons. No information is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility. 81 6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Rebif 44 micrograms solution for injection in pre -filled pen 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each pre -filled pen contains 44 micrograms (12 MIU*) of interferon beta-1a** in 0.5 mL solution. * Million International Units, measured by cytopathic effect (CPE) bioassay against the in -house interferon beta-1a standard which is calibrated against the current international NIH standard (GB-23-902-531). ** produced in Chinese hamster ovary Cells (CHO -K1) by recombinant DNA technology. Excipient with known effect: Contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose of 0.5 mL. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection in pre -filled pen. Clear to opalescent solution, with pH 3.5 to 4.5 and osmolarity 250 to 450 mOsm/L. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rebif is indicated for the treatment of patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1) patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical t rials, this was characterised by two or more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without ongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the disease. Rebif is available in three strengths: 8.8 micrograms, 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms. For patients initiating treatment with Rebif, Rebif 8.8 micrograms and Rebif 22 micrograms are available in a package that corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of therapy. Posology When first starting treatment with Rebif, in order to allow tachyphylaxi s to develop thus reducing adverse reactions it is recommended that patients be started at 8.8 micrograms dose subcutaneously and the dose be increased over a 4 week period to the targeted dose, according to the following schedule: 84 Recommended Titration (% of final dose) Titration dose for Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week (tiw) Weeks 1 -2 20% 8.8 micrograms tiw First demyelinating event The posology for patients who have experienced a first demyelinating event is 44 micrograms of Rebif given three times per week by subcutaneous injection. Relapsing multiple sclerosis The recommended posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms given three times per week by subcutaneous injection. A lower dose of 22 micrograms, also given three times per week by subcutaneous injection, is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher do se in view of the treating specialist. Paediatric population No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. However, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medic al records in children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in children (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. The safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif should not be used in this age group. Method of administration RebiDose is a ready to use pre -filled pen for subcutaneous injection. It is intended for single use and should only be used following adequate training of the patient and/or carer. For administration of Rebif with RebiDose, the instructions provided in the package leaflet should be followed. Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised to decrease flu -like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. S afety and efficacy with Rebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should be evaluated at least every second year in the 4 -year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and a decision for longer ter m treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating physician. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Current severe depression and/or suicida l ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 85 General recommendations Patients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta administration, including symptoms of the flu -like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued treatment. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) Cases of thrombotic purpura (TTP) or haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), inc luding fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased platelet counts, increased (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes (erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate discontinuation of Rebif is recommended. Depression and suicidal ideation Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in association with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation of therapy with Rebi f should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Seizure disorders Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving treatment with anti -epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately con trolled with antiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). Cardiac disease Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of ther apy with interferon beta-1a. Symptoms of the flu -like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to patients with cardiac conditions. Injection site necrosis Injection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using R ebif (see section 4.8). To minimise the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: use an aseptic injection technique, rotate the injection sites with each dose. The procedure for the self -administration by the patient should be review ed periodically especially if injection site reactions have occurred. If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with thei r physician before continuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until 86 healing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too extensive. Hepatic dysfunction In clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1 -3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic transaminases above 5 times the upper limit of norma l (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, serum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy and periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times the ULN, and gradually re -escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated with caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver disease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be stopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. Rebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic failure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six months of treatment. T he mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No specific risk factors have been identified. Renal and urinary disorders Nephrotic syndrome Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal (MGN) have been reported during treatment with interferon -beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon -beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinu ria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and discontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. Laboratory abnormalities Laborato ry abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. The overall incidence of these is slightly higher with Rebif 44 than Rebif 22 micrograms. Therefore, in addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme monitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and platelet counts are recommended at regular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clini cal symptoms. These should be more frequent when initiating Rebif 44 micrograms. Thyroid disorders Patients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. Thyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6 -12 months following initiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be performed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). Severe renal or hepatic failure an d severe myelosuppression Caution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to patients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. 87 Neutralising antibodies Serum neutral ising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of antibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with Rebif 44 micrograms, approximately 13 to 14% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to interferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic response to interferon beta-1a (beta -2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance of the induction of antibodies has n ot been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies is associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poorly to therapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reass ess the benefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity limits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. Other forms of multiple sclerosis Only sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non -ambulatory patients with multiple sclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis and should not be used in these patients. Excip ients Sodium content This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium -free'. Benzyl alcohol This medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. Monitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. Advise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studi es have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450 -dependent enzymes in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classes of antidepressants. The interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticot ropic hormone (ACTH) has not been studied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and corticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. 88 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy A large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post -marketing experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre -conception exposure to interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very limited. Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot ade quately be evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. If clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy Breast -feeding Limited information available on the transfer of i nterferon beta -1a into breast milk, together with the chemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta -1a excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are antici pated. Rebif can be used during breast -feeding. Fertility The effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Central nervous system -related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta (e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu -like syndrome. Flu -like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70% of patients treated with Rebif can expect to experience the typical interferon flu -like syn drome within the first six months after starting treatment. Approximately 30% of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild inflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and decreases in white blood cells are also common. The majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, and respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of Rebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. 89 List of adverse reactions The adverse reactions presented have been identified from clinical studies as well as from post - marketing reports (an asterisk [*] indicates ad verse reactions identified during post -marketing surveillance) . The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (1/10), common (1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (1/1,000 <1/100), rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very ra re (<1/10,000), frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Blood and the lymphatic system beta see section 4.4 ), pancytopenia * Endocrine disorders Uncommon: Thyroid dysfunction, most often presenting as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism Immune system disorders Rare : Anaphylactic reactions* Hepatobiliary disorders Very or without icterus* Rare: Hepatic failure* (see section 4.4), autoimmune hepatitis* Psychiatric disorders Common: Depression, insomnia Rare: Suicide a ttempt* Nervous system disorders Very common: Headache Uncommon: Seizures* Frequency not known: Transient neurological symptoms (i.e. hypoesthesia, muscle spasm, paraesthesia, difficulty in walking, musculoskeletal stiffness) that may mimic multiple sclerosis exacerbations* Eye disorders Uncommon: Retinal vascular disorders (i.e. retinopathy, cotton wool spots, obstruction of retinal artery or vein)* disorders not known: Pulmonary arterial hypertension* (class label for interferon products, see below Pulmonary arterial hypertension) Gastrointestinal disorders Common: Diarrhoea , vomiting, Nephrotic syndrome *, glomerulosclerosis * (see section 4.4) General disorders and administration site conditions Very common: Injection site inflammation, injection site reaction, influenza -like symptoms Common: Injection site pain, fatigue, rigors, fever Uncommon: Injection site necrosis, injection site mass, injection site abscess, injection site infections*, increased sweating* Rare: Injection site cellulitis* Frequency not known: Panniculitis (occurred in the injection site) Paediatric population No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. Limited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults. Class effects The administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, vasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia. An increased formation of auto -antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. Pulmonary arterial hypertension Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points including up to seve ral years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactio ns via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V . 4.9 Overdose In case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive treatment should be given. 91 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 endowed h immunomodulatory, antiviral and antiproliferative properties. Rebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human interferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore glycosylated l ike the natural protein. Regardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the administration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2'5'OAS synthetase and serum concentrations of beta -2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to decline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable responses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these bi ological responses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. Biological response markers (e.g., 2',5' -OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2 -microglobulin) are induced by interferon beta -1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy v olunteer subjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours for neopterin, beta -2-microglobulin and 2'5'OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and OAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after first and sixth administration. The precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. Single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis One 2 -year controlled clinical trial with Rebif was performed in patients with a single clinical event suggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The patients enrolled into the trial had at least two clinically silent lesions on the T2 -weighted MRI scan, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of which is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could better explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded. Patients were randomis ed in a double -blind manner to either Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week, Rebif 44 micrograms once weekly, or placebo. If a second clinical demyelinating event occurred confirming definite multiple sclerosis, patients switched to the recommende d posology of Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week in an open label manner, while maintaining blinding as to initial randomisation. 92 Efficacy results of Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week compared to placebo from this study are as follows: Parameter Statistics Treatment Treatment Comparison Rebif 44 Log-Rank p-value McDonald KM Estimate 37.5% 20.6% Mean CUA Lesions per Subject per Scan During the Double Blind Period Least Square Means (SE) 2.59 (0.30) 0.50 (0.06) 81% 0.19 [0.14;0.26] * <0.001 per week , CI: confidence interval, CUA: combined unique active * Least Squared Mean Ratio [95% CI] For the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a more conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least one new T2 or one new Gd -enhancing lesion on a follow -up scan taken at least 1 month after the initial scan. In any case, tre atment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. Relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis The safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micro grams (3 -12 million IU), administered subcutaneously three times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 44 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease the incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at least 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0 -5.0 at entry. The proportion of patients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed three months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 27% (Reb if 44 micrograms). Over 4 years, the reduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and 29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated with placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis In a 3 -year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence of clinical progression in the preceding two yea rs and who had not experienced relapses in the preceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was reduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and those without relapses in the 2 -year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in patients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at the end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be interpreted cautiously. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should not be used in these patients. 93 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Absorption In healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp multi -exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular administrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta. Distribution Following repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum concentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. Elimination After repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUC tau and C max) increased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated apparent half -life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple dosing. Metabolism Interferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidn eys. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated -dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. Rebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. A study on embry o/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An increased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No information is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on ma le fertility. 6.

Clear to op alescent solution, with pH 3.5 to 4.5 and osmolarity 250 to 450 mOsm/L. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rebif is indicated for the treatment of patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if alte rnative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1) patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was characterised by two or more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis without ongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the disease. 96 Posology The Rebif initiation packs correspond to the patient needs for the first month of treatment. When first starting treatment with Rebif, in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing adverse reactions, it is recommended that patients be started at 8.8 micrograms dose subcutaneously and the dose be increased over a 4 week period to the targeted dose, according to the following sched ule: Recommended Titration (% of final dose) Titration dose for Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week (tiw) Weeks 1 -2 20% 8.8 micrograms tiw 44 Paediatric population No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. However, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records in children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study s uggest that the safety profile in children (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. The safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif should not be used in this age group. Method of administration RebiDose is a ready to use pre -filled pen for subcutaneous injection. It is intended for single use and should only be used following adequate training of the patient and/or carer. For administration of Rebif with RebiDose, the instructions provided in the package leaflet should be followed. Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyreti c analgesic is advised to decrease flu -like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. Safety and efficacy with Rebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should be evaluated at least every second year in the 4 -year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and a decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating physician. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 97 General recommendations Patients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta administration, including symptoms of the flu -like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued treatment. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) Cases of thrombotic purpura (TTP) or haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were repor ted at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. c onfusion, paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased platelet counts, increased (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes (erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore i f clinical features of TMA are observed, further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate discontinuation of Re bif is recommended. Depression and suicidal ideation Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicid al ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in association with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to th eir prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation of therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Seizure disorders Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving treatment with anti -epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with antiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). Cardiac disease Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. Symptoms of the flu -like syndrome associated with interfer on beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to patients with cardiac conditions. Injection site necrosis Injection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: use an aseptic injection technique, rotate the injection sites with each dose. The procedure for the self -administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if injection site reactions have occurred. If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before continuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesion s, Rebif should be discontinued until 98 healing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too extensive. Hepatic dysfunction In clinical trials with Rebif, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (pa rticularly alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1 -3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic transaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, serum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy and periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times the ULN, and gradually re -escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated with ca ution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver disease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif should be stopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfuncti on appear. Rebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic failure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liver injury occurred within the first six months of treatment. T he mecha nism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No specific risk factors have been identified. Renal and urinary disorders Nephrotic syndrome Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal (MGN) have been reported during treatment with interferon -beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon -beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinu ria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and discontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. Laboratory abnormalities Laborato ry abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme monitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and pla telet counts are recommended at regular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms. Thyroid disorders Patients being treated with Rebif may occasionally deve lop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. Thyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6 -12 months following initiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be performed if cl inical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). Severe renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression Caution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta-1a to patients with severe renal and h epatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. Neutralising antibodies Serum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of antibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with 99 Rebif 22 micrograms, approximately 24% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to interferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic response to interferon beta-1a (beta -2 microgl obulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance of the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies is associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient responds poor ly to therapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the benefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivity limits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. Other forms of multiple sclerosis Only sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non -ambulatory patients with multiple sclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients wi th primary progressive multiple sclerosis and should not be used in these patients. Excipients Sodium content This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium -free'. Benzyl alcohol This medicinal product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. Monitor patients less than 3 years of age for respiratory symptoms. Advise patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol, whic h might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, because of the potential risk from excipient benzyl alcohol which might accumulate over time and cause metabolic acidosis. 4.5 Intera ction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450 -dependent enzymes in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and some classe s of antidepressants. The interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been studied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and corticosteroids or ACTH during relapses. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy A large amount of data (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) from registries and post -marketing experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies after pre -conception exposure to interferon beta or such exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the duration of exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when interferon beta use was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when the pregnancy was 100 detected and/or con firmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third trimester is very limited. Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to int erferon beta cannot adequately be evaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. If clinically needed, the use of Rebif may be considered during pregnancy Breast -feeding Limited information availab le on the transfer of interferon beta -1a into breast milk, together with the chemical/physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta -1a excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed ne wborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used during breast -feeding. Fertility The effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Central nervous system -related adverse events associated w ith the use of interferon beta (e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu -like syndrome. Flu -like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70% of patients treated with Rebif can expect to experience the typical inte rferon flu -like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. Approximately 30% of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild inflammation or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and decreases in white blood cells are also common. The majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, and respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable ef fects, the dose of Rebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. List of adverse reactions The adverse reactions presented have been identified from clinical studies as well as from post - marketing reports (an asteri sk [*] indicates adverse reactions identified during post -marketing surveillance) . The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (1/10), common (1/100 to <1/10), uncommon <1/100), rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Blood and the lymphatic system interferon beta products, see section 4.4 ), pancytopenia * 101 Endocrine disorders Uncommon: Thyroid dysfunction, most often presenting as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroi dism Immune system disorders or without icterus* Rare: Hepatic failure* (see section 4.4), autoimmune hepatitis* Psychiatric disorders Common: Depression, insomnia Rare: Suicide a ttempt* Nervous system disorders Very common: Headache Uncommon: Seizures* Frequency not known: Transient neurological symptoms (i.e. hypoesthesia, muscle spasm, paraesthesia, difficulty in walking, musculoskeletal stiffness) that may mimic multiple sclerosis exacerbations* Eye disorders Uncommon: Retinal vascular disorders (i.e. retinopathy, cotton wool spots, obstruction of retinal a rtery or Vascular not known: Pulmonary arterial hypertension* (class label for interferon products, see below Pulmonary arteri al hypertension) Gastrointestinal disorders Common: Diarrhoea , Nephrotic syndrome *, glomerulosclerosis * (see section 4.4) 102 General disorders and administration site conditions Very common: Injection site inflammation, injection site reaction, influenza -like symptoms Common: Injection site pain, fatigue, rigors, fever Uncommon: Injection site necrosis, injection site mass, injection site abscess, injection site infections*, increased sweating* Rare: Injection site cellulitis* Frequency not known: Panniculitis (occurred in the injection site) Paediatric population No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. Limited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults. Class effects The administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, vasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia. An increased formation of auto -antibodies may occur during treatment with interferon beta. Pulmonary arterial hypertension Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points including up to seve ral years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V . 4.9 Overdose In case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive treatment should be given. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 immunomodulatory, antiviral and antiproliferative properties. Rebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human interferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore glycosylated like the natural protein. Regardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the administration of Rebif . After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of 2'5'OAS synthetase and serum concentrations of beta -2 microglobulin and neopterin increase within 24 hours, and start to decline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produc e fully superimposable 103 responses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological responses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. Biological response markers (e.g., 2',5' -OAS activity, neopterin a nd beta 2 -microglobulin) are induced by interferon beta -1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer subjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours for neopterin, beta -2-microglobuli n and 2'5'OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and OAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after first and sixth administration. The precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis i s still under investigation. Single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis One 2 -year controlled clinical trial with Rebif was performed in patients with a single clinical event suggestive of demyelination due to multiple sclerosis. The patients enrolled into the trial had at least two clinically silent lesions on the T2 -weighted MRI scan, with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of which is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could better explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded. Patients were randomised in a double -blind manner to either Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week, Rebif 44 micrograms once weekly, or placebo. If a second clinical demyelinating even t occurred confirming definite multiple sclerosis, patients switched to the recommended posology of Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week in an open label manner, while maintaining blinding as to initial randomisation. Efficacy results of Rebif 44 micrograms given three times per week compared to placebo from this study are as follows: Parameter Statistics Treatment Treatment Comparison Rebif 44 Log-Rank p-value McDonald KM Estimate 37.5% 20.6% Mean CUA Lesions per Subject per Scan During the Double Blind Period Least Square Means (SE) 2.59 (0.30) 0.50 (0.06) 81% 0.19 [0.14;0.26] * <0.001 per week , CI: confidence interval, CUA: combined unique active * Least Squared Mean Ratio [95% CI] For the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a more conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least one new T2 or one new Gd -enhancing lesion on a follow -up scan taken at least 1 month after the initial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. Relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis The safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3 -12 million IU), administered subcutaneously three times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 22 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease 104 the incidence (approximat ely 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at least 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0 -5.0 at entry. The proportion of patients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in EDSS confirmed three months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 30% (Rebif 22 micrograms). Over 4 years, the reduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and 29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 micrograms group compared with a group of patients treated with placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis In a 3 -year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple scler osis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence of clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the preceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was reduced by approximately 30%. If the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and those without relapses in the 2 -year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in patients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with progression in disability at the end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be interpreted cautiously. Primary progressive m ultiple sclerosis Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should not be used in these patients. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Absorption In healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp multi -exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular administrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta. Distribution Following repeated subcutaneou s injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum concentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. Elimination After repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUC tau and C max) increased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated apparent half -life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple dosing. Metabolism Interferon beta-1a is mainly metaboli sed and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated -dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. Rebif has not been investiga ted for carcinogenicity. A study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. An increased risk of abortions has been reported in animal studies of other alpha and beta interferons. No information is available on t he effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility. 105 6.

Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pas s it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What Rebif is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you use Rebif 3. How to use Rebif 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Rebif 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Rebif is and what it is used for Rebif belongs to a class of medicines known as interferons. These are natural substances that transmit messages between cells. Interferons are produced by the body and play an essential role in the immune system. Through mechanisms that are not totall y understood, interferons help to limit the damage of the central nervous system associated with multiple sclerosis. Rebif is a highly purified soluble protein that is similar to the natural interferon beta that is produced in the human body. Rebif is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the severity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. 2. What you need to know before you use Rebif Do not use Rebif if you are allergic to natural or recombinant interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). if you are severely depressed at present. Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Rebif. Rebif should only be used under the supervision of your doctor. Before treatment with Rebif, read carefully and follow the advice given under \"How to use Rebif\" in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis (skin breakdown and tissue destruction) that has been reported i n patients treated with Rebif. If you experience troubling local reactions, contact your doctor. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rebif if you have an allergy (hypersensitivity) to any other medicines. 153 Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could affect your kidney s. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Rebif. Your doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your kidney. Inform your doctor if you have a disease of the bone marrow, kidney, liver, heart, thyroid, or if you have experienced depression, or if you have any history of epileptic seizures, so that he/she can closely monitor your treatment and any worsening of these conditions. Other medicines and Rebif Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. In particular you should tell your doctor if you are using antiepileptics or antidepressants. Pregnancy and breast -feeding If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Rebif can be used du ring breast - feeding. Driving and using machines Effects of the disease itself or of its treatment might influence your ability to drive or to use machines. You should discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned. Rebif contains sodium and benzyl al cohol This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially 'sodium -free'. This medicine contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions. Benzyl alcohol has been linked with the risk of severe side effects including breathing problems (called \"gasping syndrome\") in young children. Do not use for more than a week in young children (less than 3 years old), unless advised by your doctor or ph armacist. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are pregnant or breast -feeding, or if you have a liver or kidney disease. This is because large amounts of benzyl alcohol can build -up in your body and may cause side effects (called \"metabolic aci dosis\"). 3. How to use Rebif Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not sure. Dose The usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week. Your doctor has prescribed you a lower dose of 22 micrograms (6 million IU) given three times per week. This lower dose is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose. 154 Rebif should be administered three times per week, and if possible: on the same three days every week (at least 48 hours apart, e.g. Monday, Wednesday, Friday) at the same time of day (preferably in the evening). Use in children and teenagers (2 to 17 years old) No formal clinical studies have been conducted in children or teenagers. However there is some clinical data available suggesting that the safety profile in children and teenagers receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. Use in children ( below 2 years of age) Rebif is not recomm ended for use in children below 2 years of age. Method of administration Rebif is intended for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. The first injection(s) must be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified healthcare professional. A fter receiving adequate training, you, a family member, friend or carer can use Rebif syringes to administer the medicine at home. It may also be administered with a suitable auto -injector. For administration of Rebif, please read the following instructio ns carefully: This medicine is for single use. Only clear to opalescent solution without particles and without visible signs of deterioration should be used. How to inject Rebif Choose an injection site. Your doctor will advise you on the possible injection sites (good sites include the upper thighs and the lower abdomen). Hold the syringe like a pencil or dart. It is recommended that you keep track of and rotate your injection sites, so that one area is not injected too frequently in order to minim ise the risk of injection site necrosis. NOTE: do not use any areas in which you feel lumps, firm knots, or pain; talk to your doctor or healthcare professional about anything you find. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Remove the Rebif syr inge from the blister pack by peeling back the plastic covering. Before the injection, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection site. Let the skin dry. If a bit of alcohol is left on the skin, you may get a stinging sensation. Gently pinch the skin together around the site (to lift it up a bit). Resting your wrist on the skin near the site, stick the needle at a right angle straight into the skin with a quick, firm motion. Inject the medicine by using a slow, steady push (push the plunger all the way in until the syringe is empty). Hold a swab on the injection site. Remove the needle from the skin. 155 Gently massage the injection site with a dry cotton ball or gauze. Dispose of all used items: once you have finished your injection, immediately discard the syringe in an appropriate disposal unit. If you use more Rebif than you should In case of overdose, contact your doctor immediately. If you forget to use Rebif If you miss a dose, continue to inject from the day of the next schedu led dose. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop using Rebif The effects of Rebif may not be noticed immediately. Therefore , you should not stop using Rebif but continue to use it regularly to achieve the desired result. If you are uncertain about the benefits, please consult your doctor. You should not discontinue the treatment without first contacting your doctor. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 4. Possible side effects Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Tell your doctor immediately and stop using Rebif if you experience any of the following serious side effects: Serious allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions . If, immediately following Rebif administration you experience a sudden difficulty breathing, which may appear in association with swelling of face, lips, tongue or throat, nettle rash, itching all over the body, and a feeling of weakness or faintness, contact your doctor immediately or seek urgent medical attention. These reactions are rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). Inform your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following possible symptoms of a liver p roblem : jaundice (yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), widespread itching, loss of appetite accompanied by nausea and vomiting and easy bruising of the skin. Severe liver problems can be associated with additional signs, e.g. difficulty con centrating, sleepiness and confusion. Depression is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) in treated patients with multiple sclerosis. If you feel depressed or develop thoughts of suicide , report it immediately to your doctor. Talk to your doctor if y ou experience any of the following side effects: Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, chills, muscle and joint pains, fatigue and nausea are very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). These symptoms are usually mild, are more common at the start of the treatment and decrease with continued use. To help reduce these symptoms your doctor may advise you to take a fever reducing painkiller before a dose of Rebif and then for 24 hours after each injection. Injection site reactions including red ness, swelling, discoloration, inflammation, pain and skin breakdown are very common . The occurrence of injection site reactions usually decreases over time. 156 Tissue destruction (necrosis), abscess and mass at injection site are uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). See recommendations in section \" Warnings and precautions \" to minimise the risk of injection site reactions.

What Rebif is and what it is used for Rebif belongs to a class of medicines known as interferons. These are natural substances that transmit messages between cells. Interferons are produced by the body and play an essential role in the immune system. Through mechanisms that are not totally understood, interferons help to limit the damage of the central nervous system associated with mu ltiple sclerosis. Rebif is a highly purified soluble protein that is similar to the natural interferon beta that is produced in the human body. Rebif is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the severity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. It is also approved for use in patients who have experienced a single clinical event likely to be a first sign of multiple sclerosis. 2.

What Rebif is and what it is used for Rebif belongs to a class of medicines known as interferons. These are natural substances that transmit messages between cells. Interferons are produced by the body and play an essential role in the immune system. Through mechanisms that are not totally und erstood, interferons help to limit the damage of the central nervous system associated with multiple sclerosis. Rebif is a highly purified soluble protein that is similar to the natural interferon beta that is produced in the human body. Rebif is used f or the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the severity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. It is also approved for use in patients who have experienced a single clinical event likely to be a first sign of multiple sclerosis. 2. What you need to know before you use Rebif Do not use Rebif if you are allergic to natural or recombinant interferon beta or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). if you are severely depressed at present. Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Rebif. Rebif should only be used under the supervision of your doctor. Before treatment with Rebif, read carefully and follow the advice given under \"How to use Rebif\" in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis (skin breakdown and tissue destruction) that has been reported in patients treated with Rebif. If you experience troubling local reactions, contact your doctor. 191 Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Rebif if you have an allergy (hypersensitivity) to any other medicines. Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots could affect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting Rebif. Your doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the function of your kidney.

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not sure. 192 Initiating treatment Treatment is initiated by a gradual increase of the dose (a so -called 'dose titration') over a period of 4 weeks in order to re duce some of the side effects, it is recommended that: During weeks one and two, Rebif 8.8 micrograms should be injected three times per week. During weeks three and four, Rebif 22 micrograms should be injected three times per week. From the fifth week on wards, after you have completed your initiation period, you will follow the usual dose regimen prescribed by your doctor. Dose The usual dose is 44 micrograms (12 million IU) given three times per week. A lower dose of 22 micrograms (6 million IU) given three times per week is recommended for patients with multiple sclerosis who cannot tolerate the higher dose. Rebif should be administered three times per week, and if possible: on the same three days every week (at least 48 hours apart, e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday) at the same time of day (preferably in the evening). Use in children and teenagers (2 to 17 years old) No formal clinical studies have been conducted in children or teenagers. However there is some clinical data available suggesting that the safety profile in children and teenagers receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or Rebif 44 micrograms three times per week is similar to that seen in adults. Use in children (below 2 years of age) Rebif is not recommended for use in children below 2 years of age. Method of administration Rebif is intended for subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. The first injection(s) must be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified healthcare professional.

Your doctor will advise you on the possible injection sites (good sites include the upper thighs and the lower abdomen). It is recommended that you keep track of and rotate your injection sites, so that one area is not injected too frequently in order to minimise the risk of injection site necrosis. NOTE: do not use any areas in which you feel lumps, firm knots, or pain; talk to your doctor or healthcare pr ofessional about anything you find. Before the injection, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection site. Let the skin dry. If a bit of alcohol is left on the skin, you may get a stinging sensation. How to inject Rebif Your doctor will tell you how to choose the correct dose. Please read also the instructions in the manual provided with your device (RebiSmart) . RebiSmart RebiSmart is programmed to guide you through the entire initiation process and automatically increases the dose during the initiation period. It will also instruct you when you need to change the cartridge. You or your doctor will need to select the dose prescribed via the RebiSmart menu to ensure the correct recording of your dose. To activate the \"initiation/titration\" menu you or your doctor need to first select 44 micrograms, then 'initiation/titration', select 'on' and confirm 'initiation/titration on ' by pressing 'ok'. The device will ensure that: During weeks one and two, Rebif 8.8 micrograms are injected three times per week. During weeks three and four, Rebif 22 micrograms are injected three times per week. From the fifth week onwards, RebiSmart will automatically switch to the usual dose regimen. Place RebiSmart at a right angle (90\u00b0) to the skin. Press the injection button. During the injection, the button will flash. Wait until the light switches off. This tells you that the injection is completed. Remove RebiSmart from the injection site. After the injection of Rebif with RebiSmart Remove and discard the needle according to the instruction manual provided with your device. Gently massage the injection site with a dry cotton ball or gauze. Store your device containing a cartridge of Rebif as instructed in section 5 \"How to store Rebif\".

What Rebif is and what it is used for Rebif belongs to a class of medicines known as interferons. These are natural substances that transmit messages between cells. Interferons are produced by the body and play an essential role in the immune system. Through mechanisms that are not totally understoo d, interferons help to limit the damage of the central nervous system associated with multiple sclerosis. Rebif is a highly purified soluble protein that is similar to the natural interferon beta that is produced in the human body. Rebif is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to reduce the number and the severity of relapses and to slow the progression of disability. It is also approved for use in patients who have experienced a single clinical event likely to be a first sign of multiple sclerosis. 2.

How to inject with RebiDose Do not remove the cap until you are ready to administer the injection. Before the injection, use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection site. Let the skin dry.
