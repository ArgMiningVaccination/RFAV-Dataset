AHRQ Healthcare Horizon Scanning System Status Update. (Prepared by ECRI Institute under Contract No. HHSA290201000006C.) Rockville, MD: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. December 2011 . http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/reports/final.cfm . iii Preface The purpose of the AHRQ Healthcare Horizon Scanning System is to conduct horizon scanning of emerging health c are technologies and innovations to better inform patient -centered outcomes research investments at AHRQ through the Effective Health Care Program. The Healthcare Horizon Scanning System provides AHRQ a systematic process to identify and monitor target technologies and innovations in health care and to create an inventory of target technologies that have the highest potential for impact on clinical care, the health care system, patient outcomes, and costs. It will also be a tool for the public to identify a nd find information on new health care technologies and interventions. Any investigator or funder of research will be able to use the AHRQ Healthcare Horizon Scanning System to select potential topics for research. The health care technologies and innovati ons of interest for horizon scanning are those that have yet to diffuse into or become part of established health care practice. These health care interventions are still in the early stages of development or adoption except in the case of new applications of already -diffused technologies. Consistent with the definitions of health care interventions provided by the Institute of Medicine and the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research, AHRQ is interested in innovations in drugs an d biologics, medical devices, screening and diagnostic tests, procedures, services and programs, and care delivery. Horizon scanning involves two processes. The first is the identification and monitoring of new and evolving health care interventions that a re purported to or may hold potential to diagnose, treat, or otherwise manage a particular condition or to improve care delivery for a variety of conditions. The second is the analysis of the relevant health care context in which these new and evolving int erventions exist to understand their potential impact on clinical care, the health care system, patient outcomes, and costs. It is NOT the goal of the AHRQ Healthcare Horizon Scanning System to make predictions on the future utilization and costs of any he alth care technology. Rather, the reports will help to inform and guide the planning and prioritization of research resources. This edition of the Status Update lists interventions that have been identified and are being monitored. The next edition will b e published in 2 months.

The Status Update is a summary of data elements collected from implementation of the Horizon Scanning Identification and Monitoring Protocol. Status Updates are produced every two months, with each new report superseding the prior version. This Status Update report builds on pilot reports prepared during the first eight months of horizon scanning. It is o rganized by topic status and then by priority condition, with each of the priority conditions and a \"cross - cutting\" category presented as individual tables. The table of contents provides links directly to tables within each topic category for each priorit y condition. Those topics that were already in the system are presented first (\"currently tracked interventions\"), followed by new topics added during the two -month interval since the prior report, followed by interventions identified but archived, and fin ally, those interventions identified but not tracked. Within each table, we provide the Topic Title, the Potential Patient Population, the Intervention description (including the Developer/Manufacturer(s) and Phase of Development), the Potential Comparator s, and Potential Health or Other Impacts. Criteria for including topics in the Status Update are provided in detail in the protocol, which is available on the Effective Health Care Web site. Briefly, broad scanning is performed for each priority condition to detect \"leads\" to interventions and innovations. Sets of questions are applied to determine whether any given intervention addresses an \"unmet need\" such as a gap in effective ways to screen, diagnose, treat, monitor, manage, or provide or deliver care for a health condition or disease. Interventions might be lacking entirely, or existing options may be less than optimal. Leads that appear to address an unmet need are assigned to horizon scanning analysts and are assessed for grouping into potential top ics. Potential topics are then described according to the \"PICO\" framework: potential patient Population, the Intervention, potential Comparators to the intervention, and potential Outcomes of interest for the patient population. During a topic nominatio n meeting, additional criteria are applied to each topic, including questions about the potential importance of the unmet need, the likelihood of the intervention being adopted in the U.S., the innovativeness of the intervention, and the potential impact o f the intervention on current treatments, sites of care, disparities in care, health care processes and infrastructure, patient and population health outcomes, understanding of the disease or condition, clinician and patient training needs and costs of car e. Topics accepted during the topic nomination meeting are then entered into the System for tracking, and appear in the Status Update report as \"currently tracked interventions\" and \"interventions added since last update.\" Some of the accepted topics may also be selected during the meeting for Target Technology report development. Clinical interventions (i.e., drugs, devices, procedures) that are voted for advancing to target must be far enough along in development (typically phase III) to have some prelim inary efficacy and safety data available for inclusion in the profile. Topics that are programs or care delivery innovations may be advanced to target with less data available if enough information is available to describe the care delivery innovation well , and if demonstration projects or pilot studies are underway. The horizon scanning medical librarians and analysts proceed with more in -depth and topic -specific searching for information on the topics selected for advancement. 2 During this process of gath ering more information, it sometimes becomes apparent that an intervention does not in fact meet criteria for monitoring. Such topics are listed in the Status Update as \"identified but not tracked.\" Once target technology reports are developed, comments are sought from up to eight experts with a variety of perspectives and areas of expertise in health care. A topic may also be archived or retired if aggregated comments from the experts suggest that an intervention is unlikely to meet an unmet need or to hav e impact on health outcomes or health care in the U.S. Over time, a topic may be archived because development has ceased, because it is no longer novel, or because the intervention has diffused past early adoption. Included in this Status Update report ar e a total of 937 identified interventions. Of these, there are 757 interventions being tracked at the beginning of the current reporting period, 138 newly added interventions since the previous pilot report delivered in September 2011, 40 ident ified but ar chived topics, and two topics identified but not tracked. The reasons for archiving or not tracking individual topics are provided in the respective tables. As of this update, interventions related to cancer account for 30% of identified and currently moni tored topics. The next most frequently identified were categorized as addressing functional limitations and disability (19%), cardiovascular diseases ( 12%), infectious diseases ( 11%), and diabetes (6%). Interventions relevant to the remaining priority cond itions (arthritis, dementia, depression and other mental illness, obesity, peptic ulcer disease and dyspepsia, pregnancy and childbirth, pulmonary diseases and substance abuse) account for 22% of the total. 3 Section 1 .

Although physical therapy and medication provide a solution in most cases, spinal surgery involving either total disc replacement or spinal fusion is needed by a subset of patients. Noninvasive treatments are needed relieve the symptoms of patients who do not require surgery, would like to prevent the need for surger y, or are at risk of losing disc height following surgery. Allogeneic adult stem cells combined with hyaluronic acid (NeoFuse) are injected into severely damaged intervertebral discs with the intention of reversing the degenerative process, stimulating regrowth of disc cartilage, and sustain ing normalization of disc pathology, anatomy, and function; mesenchymal precursor cells are purported to produce the proteoglycans found in disc cartilage, so the manufacturer hypothesizes that the injection of mesenchy mal stem cells into a degenerated intervertebral disc will lead to replacement of the proteoglycan of cartilage resulting in a minimally invasive , lower cost therapy for patients with moderate or severe DDD.

SD -6010 (SC -84250) is an inhibitor of inducible NO synthase intended for the potential treatment of osteoarthritis; the iNOS pathway is activated through proinflammatory signals, and iNOS further promotes inflam mation by the protein's role phagocyte - mediated oxidative cell killing (oxidative bust), which can erode cartilage in osteoarthritis patients . Administered 50 and 200 mg , orally , once per day. Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY Phase II/III trials ongoing Celec oxib Ibuprofen Naproxen Improved mobility Reduced pain Reduced rate of joint space narrowing Tofacitinib (tasocitinib, CP- 690,550) for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis Patients in whom RA has been diagnosed Tofacitinib (CP-690,550) is a selective and potent oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is being investigated as a targeted DMARD for treatment of RA. Tofacitinib inhibits a Janus -kinase -3 (JAK -3) signaling pathway believed to mediate several processes involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as antibody production by B cells, production of rheumatic factor and activation of T cells.By inhibiting the JAK -3 pathway, tofacitinib may suppress the inflammatory reactions that are the basis of RA.

Mavoglurant is an antagonist of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), which is purported to be found in regions of the br ain that serve as key control points in the neuronal motor circuits responsible for abnormal glutamate signaling . Perturbations in glutamate signaling (along with disruptions in dopaminergic signaling) are believed to be an underlying cause of PD . By inhib iting mGluR5, mavoglurant is intended to restore normal movement via a nondopaminergic mechanism, thereby offering a dopamine sparing therapy . Additionally, preclinical findings suggest that mGluR5 inhibitors may be neuroprotective and may hold potential t o slow PD progression . Mavoglurant is purported to reduce both of the major PD -LID symptoms, chorea (rapid uncontrolled movements), and dystonia (writhing and cramping movements). Drug is administered 100 mg , daily.

Fetal programming (FP) is a comprehensive concept that aims to enhance a child's metabolism into adulthood by using drug therapy, nutritional supplements, and enhanc ed nutrition during pregnancy. FP aims to decrease risk of many adult diseases, including coronary artery disease, breast cancer, and diabetes, by improving the uterine environment through programming of hormone -production levels with intention of maintain ing healthy organ function throughout life . An example of FP is treating obese pregnant women with metformin even if they do not have a diagnosis of diabetes because blood glucose levels tend to be higher during pregnancy and glucose may pass through the p lacenta to the fetus.

InQuickER \u00ae is an online service that form s partnerships with hospitals, so patients with non -life-threatening injuries or illnesses can \"reserve\" an \"appointment\" time at their local ED, then wait at home until that time comes . The service is a \"check -in process\" that holds a patient's place in line and projects his or her anticipated trea tment time, using data from EDs. Once patients arrive at the hospital at the projected time, the service guarantees that they will be seen in 15 minutes or their conv enience fee ($9.99) is refunded. C heckpoints are put in place to ensure that patients with emergent injuries or illnesses do not wait at home.

Kiosk -based patient self -service triage and treatment enables a patient to, without direct staff interaction, complete registration and assessment, measure vital signs, and dispense medication based on telemedicine control by a physician and pharmacist . The approach is intended to be implemented as follows: (1) patients regis ter at the first kiosk by swiping/scanning their insurance card ; kiosk touch screen guides them through self -assessment where they register, describe symptoms , and outline the reasons for their visit; (2) patients ' vital signs are taken at the second kios k; and (3) patients speak with a doctor via video conferencing for diagnosis and, if medication is prescribed, it is dispensed.

Currently Tracked Interventions Topic Title Potential Patient Population Intervention Developer/Manufacturer(s) Phase of Development Potential Comparators Potential Health or Other Impacts Senior -specific emergency departments for treatment of elderly patients Senior or elderly patients who visit the emergency department (ED) Twenty percent of all seniors use an ED at least once a year, and half of all ED patients are seniors . General EDs are not senior -specific, and can be uncomfortable or unsaf e for elderly patients. Additionally, risk for hospital readmission and drug interactions are high in this population . Finally, EDs do not always have access to geriatrician staff members. EDs for seniors are designed specifically for the elderly populatio n. Structural, safety, and comfort changes include wider hallways (for wheelchairs), hand rails, different lighting systems, easier -to-read visuals, pressure -reducing beds, and alarms for wandering patients. C are teams and care delivery are redesigned to i nclude clinicians and nurses with special training in geriatric medicine, including education on issues related to ageism and sensory appreciation in the elderly (so that these skills can be used to communicate more effectively with old er adults and their caregivers). The different approach to care involves being more thorough with each patient and conducting on a routine basis assessments that typically are only made as needed (e.g., cognitive exams to detect issues that normally would go unchecked in othe r EDs). Health systems piloting this change include Trinity Health System, Novi, MI, and Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY.

Samalizumab is a novel, intravenously administered monoclonal antibody being studied for the treatment for CLL. Samalizumab is specific for CD200, and antibody binding to CD200 is purported to block CD200 's binding to its cognate receptors. CD200 activation of CD200 receptors on cells of the immune system appears to downregulate the activ ity of these immune cells. Multiple cancers including CLL have been shown to upregulate CD200, which may lead to immune tolerance of the cancer.

Like proton beams, particles in carbon ion beams lose the majority of their energy immediately before deposit ing the energy at a tumor target. This phenomenon is known as the Bragg peak, which potentially allows planning for targeting the radiation dose to a specific tissue depth and sparing adjacent tissue. Compared with protons, the path of heavier carbon ions is less influenced by passage through o verlying tissue and, therefore, the peak of ionizing radiation is tighter, potentially allowing more precise targeting and delivery. Addition ally, heavier particles such as carbon ions have a more severe impact on atoms within target cells, which produces more intense cellular damage and can potentially increase the biologic effectiveness of carbon ion beams relative to proton or photon beams. In particular, the relative biologic effectiveness of carbon ions purportedly increases with tissue depth, coincidi ng with the Bragg peak. Lastly, collisions between carbon ions and atomic nuclei produce positrons through nuclear fragmentation. The generated positrons can be imaged using positron emission tomography (PET), potentially allowing visualization of the deli vered dose distribution.

ACY -1215 is a novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that is specific for HDAC6. While multiple HDAC inhibitors have come to market, none are approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. In addition, currently available HDAC inhibitors are pan-HDAC inhibitors, which have inhibitory activity against a wide range of HDACs. By targeting HDAC6 specifically, ACY -1215 might avoid some of the toxicity associated with pan -HDAC inhibition. HDAC6 is purported to be an appropriate anticancer target because of its function in a protein degradation pathway known as the aggresome. Due to their high rate of protein production, cancer cells produce a large number of aggresome substrates (e.g., misfolded proteins) and HDAC6 may lead to the preferential accumulation of toxic levels of waste proteins in cancer cells.

Anemia is sometimes treated with therapies targeting the erythropoietin pathway ; however , therapies targeting this pathway have exposed patients to increased risk of tumor stimulation and progression, as well as increased risk of thrombosis. In MDS, defects in RBC production occ ur in the latter stages of red cell maturation, whereas current therapies target earlier stages of RBC production. ACE - 536 is a ligand trap therapy that inhibits signaling of several members of the transforming growth factor -beta protein super family, resp onsible for stimulation of RBC production, late cell -type differentiation, and inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis. Essentially, ACE -536 affects late RBC maturation, effectively increasing RBC production for treatment of anemia in MDS.

Elastic loops and surgical clamps are devices used to temporarily block blood flow, but the damaging and weakening of blood vessel s has been a complication. LeGoo is a thermosensitive gel polymer that works paradoxically by solidifying at high temperature and liqu efying at room temperature or below. The gel polymer is injected into the preferred suture site of the blood vessel, where a plug is formed in the shape of the blood vessel, blocking blood flow for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, the gel polymer dissolve s and pass es through the microcirculation before being passed in urine. If a surgeon is finished in less than 15 minutes, a co ld pack of ice or cold saline can be used to dissolve the gel polymer.

INSTI rapid HIV antibody test includes a unique antigen construct comprised of recombinant transmembrane proteins from HIV -1 (gp -41) and HIV -2 (gp -36), which is purpo rted to provide greater than 99% sensitivity and specificity and can add to the predictive power of any rapid testing algorithm currently in use. INSTI uses a novel flow -through technology which purportedly allows more rapid detection of HIV , within 60 sec onds , compared with the lateral -flow technology currently used in rapid HIV detection kits. INSTI also includes a unique procedural control using a true human immunoglobulin G which purportedly will allow the test to react only when the correct quantity of human blood is added, which may reduce user error. The test is purported to be highly stable and does not require refrigeration or specialized storage. By combining pre test and posttest counseling into one visit, INSTI may increase the capacity of a healt h care facility to provide HIV testing to more patients and promote prompt treatment.

Effective and more tolera ble treatments are needed. INX-189 is an orally administered prodrug and 2' -C-methylguanosine analog. It is purported to inhibit the HCV NS5B protease activity, which ma y limit viral replication by inhibiting viral genome replication. INX -189 is intended to be used in combination with pegylated interferon (INF) and ribavirin for this indication . Administered orally at a dose of 100 to 200 mg.

A long -lasting, effective , universal vaccine is sought. Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vector vaccine encoding nucleoprotein and matrix protein 1 (MVA -NP+M1) of influenza virus has been designed to induce br oad T-cell responses in patients. The NP and M1 antigens are naturally expressed inside viruses and virus - infected cells and do not mutate annually , unlike the neuraminidase and hemagglutinin antigens targeted in traditional antibody -based influenza vaccines. Thus , the investigators purport , this vaccine is not expected to need annual reformulations. The MVA vector is purported to express NP and M1 proteins resulting in the generation of T -cell based immunity in the absence of a productive viral infection.

HIV drug resistance, poor tolerance to existing treatments, a nd high lifelong cost of therapy continue to suggest that improved therapeutic options be pursued to treat patients. Addition ally, patients with successfully managed HIV infection frequently develop neurocognitive impairment that is associated with residua l chronic inflammation. Aprepitant (Emend\u00ae) , a drug already approved for treatment of chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) , is purported to have immunomodulator and antiviral activity. That activity is intended to target residual inflammation by acting on host cells and not the virus, thus leading to prevention of inflammatory and neurocognitive events associated with HIV infection. Aprepitant is purported to be a neurokinin -1 receptor (NK1R) antagonist, inhibiting HIV replication in macrophages by decreasing expression of the chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) coreceptor which is needed for HIV to infect cells and possibly other mechanisms. Aprepitant is also purported to improve natural killer cell function , which may help patients better control the virus. Aprepitant is purported to act synergistically with HIV protease inhibitors.
