PROGRAM GUIDELINES PROJECT FUNDING In recognition of the urgent need to accelerate scientific and medical breakthroughs in pancreatic cancer and with the guidance of our scientific advisors, in February 2011 the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN) adopted a bold initiative to double survival for pancreatic cancer by the year 2020. For more information about this goal, see http://www.pancan.org/section -about/vision -of-progress/ . In an effort to facilitate achievement of this goal, PanCAN has introduced several new grant mechanisms to fund translational and clinical research. The 2015 Translational Research Grant is intended to continue the momentum on high priority pancreatic can cer research that is poised for important translational next steps in order to help move discovery to application in patients. The T ranslational Research Grant will provide $300,000 over two years to fund a translational research project that has as its e ndpoint the development of a pancreatic cancer assessment, prevention or treatment modality. The scientific validation of the proposed modality must already exist and the project proposed for funding should represent a practical application of this knowled ge. Fundamental discovery or basic science research projects are not eligible for funding through this grant mechanism. Applicants must be full time, independent junior or senior investigators. The type of project that will qualify for funding will typically benefit from the inclusion of cross -disciplinary expertise and collaboration. Therefore, applications can include one Contact -Principal Investigator (PI) , or a Contact - PI and a Co-PI. If there are two PIs, it should include a basic scientist and a clinician. The Contact -PI is the applicant. DEFINITION OF TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH For the purposes of this grant, translational research is defined according to the framework c onceived by the Translational Research Working Group (TRWG). The TRWG was created in 2005 under the auspices of the U .S. National Cancer Advisory Board to evaluate the status of the National Cancer Institute's investment in translational research and enhan ce the translational research enterprise. (Before completing an application, researchers are encouraged to review the TRWG report Transforming Translation: Harnessing Discovery for Patient and Public Benefit , published in June 2007, and a series of seven a rticles published in the 2008 (Vol. 14, No. 18) issue of Clinical Cancer Research. ) The TRWG defined translational research as an iterative and multidirectional process that consists of applied research that transforms discoveries from fundamental laboratory, clinical or population -based research into new drugs, devices or interventions; a s well as findings from the clinic and population that loop back and inform new research to refine or expand an innovation. The TRWG focus was on \"early translational research\" and specifically on the phases that follow scientific validation of a discovery up until definitive, late stage -trials. Consistent with the TRWG framework, on a research translation continuum, the Translational Research Grant will support research that follows fundamental discovery, all the way through Phase I/II clinical trials. Importantly, to be eligible for funding, the scientific validation, clinical application and need, and feasibility of developing the clinical modality must already be established and the supporting evidence must be submitted as part of the application proces s. The Translational Research Grant will support the following research phases: the development of enabling tools or technologies that are required to create the modality; the actual creation and refinement of the new modality; preclinical development; an d/or initial validation of the modality in 2 humans to determine if there is sufficient evidence of safety and efficacy to warrant a definitive trial. See Project Eligibility below for additional important details. IMPORTANT DATES E-Application Deadline Friday, January 30, 2015 at Noon, Eastern Time Decision Date May 2015 Grant Term Start Date: July 1, 2015 End Date: June 30, 2017 Scientific Meeting August 27 -30, 2015, San Diego, CA and 2016 and 2017 (dates and location to be determined) - Grant recipients are required to attend , if invited. This is an annual se ries of activities that involve scientific and networking sessions for knowledge exchange, research feedback, mentorship, and collaborations. Also in attendance are other PanCAN grant recipients, members of PanCAN's Scientific and Medical Advisory Board and Board of Directors, donors, and the broader pancreatic cancer community. These opportunities have been effective in build ing a robust Community for Progress, comp rised of multidisciplinary researchers dedicated to studying pancreatic cancer. Support for travel is provided by PanCAN separate from the grant. APPLICANT ELIGIBILITY Applicants must have a medical and/or doctoral degree (including PhD, MD, DO, PharmD, o r equivalent doctoral degree) in the biomedical sciences or in a field applicable to health science research , and be affiliated with an academic, medical or research institution within the United States . There are no citizenship requirements; however, an applicant who is not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, by submitting an application for this grant, assures that his/her visa status will provide sufficient time to complete the project and grant term within the United States. The project supported by a Translational Research Grant is expected to benefit from collaboration between basic and clinical scientists. Therefore, if the Contact -PI is a basic scientist, a clinician/clinical scientist can be designated as a Co-PI on the proposed project. Or if th e Contact PI is a clinical scientist, a basic scientist can be designated as a Co-PI. The Co-PI can be located at the same or at a different institution. The different institution can be within or outside the United States. Researchers with active Pancreat ic Cancer Action Network grants or who have submitted applications for a 2015 Pancreatic Cancer Action Network Research Acceleration Network Grant or Career Development Grant administered in partnership with AACR are also eligible to apply for a 2015 Trans lational Research Grant. Only one application for a Translational Research Grant will be accepted per Contact -PI, though it is possible to serve as a Co-PI on another proposed project. Employees or subcontractors of a government entity or for -profit indu stry are not eligible to be a PI but may serve as collaborators, though no grant funds may be directed towards these individuals. Members of the 2015 Translational Research Grant Scientific Review Committee are not eligible to apply for this grant. 3 PROJECT ELIGIBILITY The project proposed for a Translational Research Grant must build on progress already made in pancreatic cancer research and cannot consist of fundamental discovery or basic science research. The below figure illustrates the TRWG fram ework which will be used to determine whether a project is ready and eligible for a T ranslational Research Grant. Overview of the Six TRWG Pathways Consistent with th e TRWG framework, the proposed project must have as its endpoint a risk assessment or interventive clinical modality. Risk assessment modalities characterize the cancer - related health status of an individual, and include pancreatic cancer screening, detection, d iagnosis, prognosis , or treatment response assessment. Interventive modalities change the cancer -related health status of an individual and deal with pancreatic cancer prevention or treatment. Within the Risk Assessment modality, there are two pathways: I. Biospecimen -based assays , in volve biomarkers (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein, lipids, carbohydrates) for the detection, diagnosis or prognosis of pancreatic cancer or the assessment of response to treatment derived from any of a variety of biospecimens (e.g ., blood, other body fluids or tissues). II. Image -based techniques (e.g., nanotechnology, fluorescence , MRI, PET ) to analyze tissue noninvasively for the detection, diagnosis or prognosis of pancreatic cancer and pre - cancer; or to assess treatment response. Within the Interventive modality, there are four pathways: I. Drug or biologic agents (e.g., novel chemotherapeutic compounds) II. Immune response modifiers (e.g., vaccines, cytokines) III. Interventive devices (e.g., novel surgical techniques, radiotherapy image -guided interventions) IV. Life-style alterations (e.g., modifying risk -related behaviors, changing environmental exposures) Each of these six pathways is characterized by the following developmental phases: Credentialing: research that validates the m odality; i.e., establishes a strong empirical basis for the clinical relevance of the discovery, its clinical need, and feasibility of being developed . Credentialing research does not qualify for a Translational Research Grant. NO CREDENTIALING CREATION OF MODALITY PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT CLINICAL TRIALSSUPPORTING TOOLSI. BIOSPECIMEN- BASEDMODALITY RISK ASSESSMENT Research to characterize the cancer-related health status of an individualINTERVENTIVE Research to change the cancer-related health status of an individual through prevention or treatment DEVELOPMENTAL PHASE II. IMAGE-BASED I. AGENTS (Drugs & Biologics)II. IMMUNE RESPONSE MODIFIERSIII. INTERVENTIVE DEVICESIV. LIFESTYLE ALTERATIONS 4 Development of supporting to ols: research that develops collateral tools, techniques or processes that support the other phases and are essential to create or refine the endpoint modality. Creation of the modality: research that translates the n ovel concept into the new or refined ta ngible modality. Preclinical development: research that refines the modality in animal models to comply with real -world conditions. Early phase clinical trials: pilot studies, Phase 0, I/II testing in humans to determine safety and efficacy of the modality and whether a definitive clinical trial is warranted. Applicants for a Translational Research Grant will be required to classify their proposed project according to the TRWG framework. First, they will need to specify which clinical modality their proposed project addresses: risk assessment or interventive. If risk assessment, they will then need to select whether the modality is bio specimen -based and/ or image -based; if Interventive, th en whether it deals with drug or biologic agents, immune response modifiers, inter ventive devices, and/ or life -style alterations. And finally, the development phase that is addressed in their proposed project: creation of supporting tools, creation of the modality, preclinical development, and/ or early stage clinical testing in human s. Applicants will need to describe the \"translational bridge\" of their proposed project, including the scientific discovery to be translated and its readiness for next steps, plans for applying the discovery, the practical outcome of the proposed project, solutions to translational barriers, and the potential individual or population -level impact. Given its importance in driving the translational process, cross - disciplinary col laborations should be identified where there is a benefit to the integration of different skill sets. These can include, for example, plans for sharing research materials, methodologies/ technologies, animal models, or human samples. Milestones/deliverabl es along the pathway, from the present level of research knowledge to the practical application, will need to be specified. Reliable and quantifiable indicators of progress must be identified, and not the simple completion of tasks. Examples of key milesto nes might include, but are not limited to , the clinical validation of risk factors that predict pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in individuals with diabetes mellitus in a small retrospective study; development of a validated pharmacodynamic assay that rep roducibly demonstrates a small molecule inhibitor alters target activity; demonstration that an agent elicits the desired immunological response in pilot clinical trials; or completion of preclinical studies to determine optimum combinations and sequencing of standard of care and new agents in preparation for clinical studies. Research funded by a T ranslational Research Grant will typically represent a critical step in a longer - term project that will go beyond the timeframe and budget of this two year grant . Applicants should have a general plan for subsequent steps that will be needed for the translational and clinical exploitation of the proposed stud y to demonstrate the clinical relevance and potential for improving survival from pancreatic cancer. BUDGET STIPULATIONS The Translational Research Grant provides $300,000 over two years. Funds can be used for direct research expenses related to the proposed project, which may include salary and benefits, research/laboratory supplies, equipment, and publi cation charges for manuscripts that pertain directly to the funded project. Salary and benefits for the Contact -PI and collaborator(s) can account for up to 20% ($60,000) of the grant funds; and up to 30% ($90,000) if a Co-PI is included on the proposed project. Salaries and benefits for postdoctoral or clinical research fellows, technicians, and support staff 5 are not counted toward this cap; neither are consultant fees. Funds also can be requested for regular communications if a Co-PI is located at a diffe rent institution. Up to 10% ( $30,000 ) of the grant funds may be allocated for equipment. For institutions that mandate payment of indirect costs, a maximum of 10% ($27,274) of the total direct costs may be used for this purpose across all institutions. For the purposes of this grant, any general office supplies or individual institutional administrative charges (e.g., telephone, other electronic communication, utilities, IT network, etc.) are considered to be part of indirect and are not allowable budget line items. Tuition, professional membership dues, pre -award charges and any other research - related expense not directly related to this project are not allowable expenses. In addition, no grant funds may be directed toward salary or benefits of any indiv iduals from a U.S. government institution or for -profit industry, nor for any research expenses related to the project that are incurred by these individuals. EVALUATION OF APPLICATIONS Applications for the T ranslational Research Grant will be reviewed by a Scientific Re view Committee comprised of a multidisciplinary panel of scientists respected for their own accomplishments in pancreatic cancer research and/or translational/clinical cancer research , who are viewed as leaders in the field.
