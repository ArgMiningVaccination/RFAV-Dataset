Gov. GrayDavis signed SB 907 into law, which will allow naturopathic doctors to belicensed as independent practitioners that can diagnose, treat and aid in theprevention of disease. The regulation will go into effect Jan. 1, 2004, andlicenses are expected to be issued beginning in late 2004. California is the13th state to allow graduates of accredited naturopathic institutions to belicensed doctors. The regulation will allow N.D.s to perform physical andlaboratory exams for diagnostic purposes, draw blood, and order lab tests anddiagnostic imaging studies. They can dispense nonprescription products,including herbs, vitamins, minerals, amino acids and homeopathics, as well asnatural and synthetic hormones. They can also prescribe medications incollaboration with an M.D. or D.O. under supervision requirements similar tothose of nurse practitioners. The bill does not allow N.D.s to practice acupuncture orTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) or any other practice requiring a Californialicense. The new regulation requires N.D.s to take 60 hours of continuingeducation biannually, and to be recertified 10 years after initial licensure. Inaddition, those using the titles such as N.D. or Doctor of Naturopathywithout a license will be subject to a misdemeanor charge. The Bureau of Naturopathic Medicine, which was also createdunder SB 907, will establish rules, regulations, fees and procedures necessaryto carry out the provisions of the law. Until current N.D.s become licensed,they must practice under the Medical Practice Act provided by SB 577. The regulation is contingent on a two-year study to evaluatethe education and training currently being undertaken by N.D.s. Recommendations for improving the education or training ofN.D.s will be made to the California legislature by Jan. 1, 2006. Following this news, Washington-based Bastyr Universityannounced it would be opening a California branch. California is a bellwetherstate, and licensing our doctors there will have a ripple effect throughout thecountry, said Thomas Shepherd, DHA, Bastyr president. You May Also Like "}
