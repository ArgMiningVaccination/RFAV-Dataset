It provides a double dose of vitamin C, alongside minerals such as Zinc and Selenium, and key vitamins such as B complex, and vitamin D3. The protocol requires the nutrients must be administered intravenously or intramuscularly, so they are able to get directly where they need to, in order to strengthen the immune system and protect against immunological dysfunctions. HOW DOES THE INFUSION WORK? Immune Support Protocol is administered through infusion via intravenous or intramuscular routes. This ensures fast, direct delivery of the nutrients into the blood circulation. Below we have created a breakdown of each specific nutrient's benefits, and the effect it has when administered directly via infusion: Vitamin C Vitamin C is an immune system strengthener, and provides relief from the symptoms of infections and allergies. Being a natural antioxidant, it works to minimise free-radical damage that can affect our bodies both internally and externally. Zinc Through catalysing the activation of the immune cells, Zinc promotes their defence functions against germs. Thereby strengthening the immune barrier and potentially reducing the risk of repeated infections. Selenium Selenium reduces the inflammation that can arise in healthy tissues by regulating the secretion of pro-inflammatory substances by the immune system. By supporting the activities of the white blood cells, this element works to help to clear infections at a faster rate than your body usually would. B Vitamins B Vitamins are a vital component of our Immune Support Protocol when it comes to enhancing nerve functions. They work through restoring a healthy communication network between the immune system and the organs at the cellular level. Vitamin D3 Vitamin D3 further amplifies the aforementioned benefits with its power to regulate and strengthen the immune system. The infusion of Vitamin D3 in our Immune Support Protocol injections contributes to overall health by reducing the risk of conditions linked to common immunological dysfunctions. Treatment Indications Immune Support Protocol is recommended for those who suffer from repeated bouts of infections due to having weak immunity. Specially formulated to support the immune system's functions, it protects against harmful pathogens, so that your body can reinforce a barrier that encourages optimum health and resilience. Through reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in healthy organs and tissues, the injections are also able to regulate the functions of the immune cells.
