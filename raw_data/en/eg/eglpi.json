And what does it involve? So let me try to answer that for you... The children of today are sicker than ever before and autism (ASD) is on the rise, last statistics said that in 2014 nearly 28% of children in America * are on the Autistic spectrum this figure has tripled since 2000. There are several components that are contributing to this. Diet, lifestyle, sprays and pesticides used on our foods. Did you know many commercial crops are now ripened using Glyphosate (round up) this means if you are consuming commercial fruit and vegetables, there is a high concentration of round up in the food you are eating. The over use of antibiotics is a huge factor to this increase in autism and vaccinations. The toxic load for most people is nearly at tipping point. Consider that everything that touches your body, is put in your mouth, even environmental factors like sprays in the gardens and playgrounds that we often can't see or even know that they are there. All the plastics that people use to store food in and reheat their lunches in. The microwaves that are in most homes. Shampoos, conditioners, soaps, pots & pans the list is nearly endless. All of these things are adding to a person's toxic load. And there is a tipping point for each and every person. The liver and kidneys can only cope for so long with such a heavy work load. Heavy metals and specifically aluminium is a real concern. Did you know that there is aluminium in things like our conventional flours, baking powders and even cheese. Have you ever wondered why the grated cheese in the supermarket does not stick together? They use aluminium to stop it from clumping together. Aluminium is very commonly used as an anti-caking agent in much of the food that you might find at Coles. Homeopathic Principles The basis of how homeopathy works is that like cure like. The Law of similar. Let me begin with some examples. Coffea is a homeopathic remedy made for coffee. So take a moment to think about what you would feel like if you drank 8 cups of coffee in an afternoon. You might be a bit shaky, heart racing, very jittery, If I then asked you to go to bed you would probably really struggle. Now if a person was experiencing heart palpitations, racing mind, insomnia, Coffea might be a remedy that we could use to help this person. As it will cause the symptoms in the well person drinking all the coffee then it can reverse those same set of symptoms in a sick person. Allium cepa is another remedy that is great for explain how homeoapthy works. Allium cepa is made from white onions. If you were to cut up 10 kgs of white onions what might happen. It would cause runny nose, stinging eyes, crying eyes, burning stinging feeling. Allium cepa is used often to treat colds with stinging, burning eyes, runny nose. Do you see how that works? If something can cause a set of symptoms in a well person, it can reverse the same set of symptoms in a sick person displaying those same set of symptoms. HDT uses this traditional principle of homeopathy and also another principle of Homeopathy called Tautopathy. Tautopathy refers to treatment of an artificial disorder with a micro-dose or potency of the drug or toxic agent that caused that disorder. Using homeopathic potentised remedies made from the drug or often the vaccine that has caused the disorder to the body we can bring about healing. Thus the drug that has caused the disorder can certainly restore balance and health back to the body when prescribed in homeopathic form. There are many factors that are taken into account each and every time I see a new patient for detoxing. Before I will start any form of detox, I support the bodies elimination processes, often there is some liver and kidney support so that the body will tolerate the detox. We work on gut helath and diet which is also supporting the body to detox gently. HDT can take many months as it is important to do it slowly and gently. Here's what people have been saying Names have been changed for privacy Billy aged 4 - limited verbal ability, 50 words that mum can understand maybe 20 that a stranger could understand. Still in nappies, doesn't communication with others much at all, doesn't give eye contact, is always very serious. Within the first 3 weeks of the first round of detox Billy said a few new words, he was more interactive. By the end of the first 8 weeks Billy had 30 more words that he was using frequently, and many that could be understood by strangers. He was much more social and we even heard him laugh a couple of times. He would notice other people and even acknowledge the family members. Lisa aged 7 - very aggressive, would hit, hurt her sisters and family. Lisa would yell and scream often. She was a terrible sleeper and would not sleep through the night. She was terrified of the dark and strangers. Within the first 8 weeks we saw an amazing change in Lisa, she began to sleep, was much calmer and gentler with her family. Much less screaming and shouting and hurting. Following the initial 8 weeks there was little change for a few months. Then there was another rapid change over 6 weeks.
