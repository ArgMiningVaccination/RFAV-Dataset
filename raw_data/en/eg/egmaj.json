Presenting a compendium of some of the most revolutionary yet still widely unknown discoveries in health and energy medicine, this book edited by Finley Eversole, Ph.D., explores the use of microcrystals to harmonize the energies of body, mind, and environment; the healing effects of ozone and hydrogen peroxide therapy; ways to combat electromagnetic fields and environmental toxins; sources of disruptive energy that cause stress and health problems, including other people's negative emotions; and how to tap in to healing antioxidant electrons from the Earth. The book reveals the scientifically proven health risks of genetically modified foods--the first irreversible technology in human history with still unknown consequences. It looks at the link between industrial farming and the precipitous rise in heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's over the past 100 years, providing a 10-point Low-Toxin Program to reduce your risk. It explores the cancer-curing electromedicine of Royal Raymond Rife and its suppression by the medical establishment as well as Nobel laureate Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgi's follow-up discovery of Frequency Therapy. Offering a window into the holistic future of medicine, the book shows the body not simply as a biological machine to be patched and repaired but as a living organism made up of cells dynamically linked to their inner and outer environments.

Praise For... \"Energy Medicine Technologies persuasively presents the wisdom of some of the world's foremost authorities on ancient and modern modalities of energy medicine--the only paradigm of healing that can effectively meet our health care needs in the twenty-first century. If you read only one book about this emerging healing model, let it be this one!\" \u2014 Simone Gabbay, author of Edgar Cayce's Energy Medicine and Visionary Medicine: Real Hope for T \"This meaty volume explores diseases of civilization due to electromagnetic pollution, the dangers of genetically modified and pesticideladen foods, and other examples of what might be considered 'man's inhumanity to man.' It also recommends ways to prevent or reduce these in chapters devoted to the benefits of organic foods, light and sound energies, ozone and hydrogen peroxide therapy, as well as intercessory prayer and remote healing.\" \u2014 Paul J. Rosch, M.D., F.A.C.P., clinical professor of medicine and psychiatry at New York Medical Col \"Offering a window into the holistic future of medicine, Energy Medicine Technologies shows the body not simply as a biological machine to be patched and repaired but as a living organism made up of cells dynamically linked to their inner and outer environments.\" \u2014 Creations Magazine, August 2013 \"Energy Medicine Technologies is a powerful book, coming at precisely the right moment. To get a clear grasp on where we stand in our awareness of life, health, disease and healing, is to take the first step towards preserving and improving one's own condition, and that of one's family, friends and the world we share. In these critical times, we need books like this to help us navigate the waters of threat and opportunity, so a safe harbor can be found.\" \u2014 Metaguide Magazine, September 2013 \"Energy Medicine Technologies: Ozone Healing, Microcrystals, Frequency Therapy, and the Future of Health is a recommended pick for alternative health and new age collections alike, and provides a powerful survey of inexpensive alternatives to conventional medicine that have been suppressed by the pharmaceutical companies intent on expensive profits.\" \u2014 Bookwatch, September 2013 \"I recommend this to anyone who wants to get well and stay well in the 21st century.\" \u2014 Jennifer Hoskins, New Dawn Magazine, March 2014 "}
