Addition to all these, there are more than 50 Waldorf schools and 600 kindergartens was established all over the country, since China's first Waldorf school was es tablished in September 2004 in Chengdu. At the same time, the Waldorf Education is developing vigorously in public schools and charter schools and the home education. As a college teacher who has 13 years' experience in the pre-se rvice teacher training. The author became more aware of the superficial and the formality of tradi tional teacher training. As a movement comes from the folk, Waldorf Education has spread all over the world. Especially in china, it is always keep an amazing speed. It is so worthy of attention and thinking. 2. Waldorf Education: From the Anthroposophy Perspective 2.1. About the Anthroposophy Anthroposophy is a spiritual science founded by Dr. Rudolf Steiner, a philosopher, scientist, educator in the early part of last century in Austria. It seeks to explore the natu re of mankind, life, and the whole world especially t he nature of spiritual activity in a scientific way. It also seeks to explore the relationship between mankind, wisdom, and all things in the universe. It believes that mankind and the universe are one whole. They have a deep emotio nal attribution and share the same fate of breathing. The emergence and development of every person are in some way strikingly consistent with the evolution of the whole earth and the history of human civilization. Dr Steiner used the natural science to make human spiritual exp eriences, including super sensory spiritual experiences can be unde rstood and communicated. He be lieved that each person can 2017 International Conference on Financial Management, Education and Social Science (FMESS 2017) Copyright \u00a9 (2017) Francis Academic Press , UK 157develop their ability to acquire a direct spiritual experience in a certain way. Knowing the world / themselves and changing the world / themselves are at the same time. We everybody needs to grow up in spiritual world, and need s to do everything corresponding to what we have known, so that the pure thinking can be taken into an advanced spiritual existence and can connect to the universe. So each higher-self and advanced spiritual existence can become th e creator of the world together. According to Steiner, modern people should be aware of the spir itual reality, whether as individuals or. And that personal life and soc ial life all should be built on it. 2.2. About the Waldorf education Based on the deep thinking of the serious social problem after World War I. Dr. Steiner set up the first Waldorf School at the invitation of a cigarette facto ry's boss in German for the children of employees of the factory. Because this factory's name was Waldorf, so named the school Waldorf School. The school's teaching methods and content are in full a ccordance with Dr. Steiner's own understanding of people and their development. Since then, Wald orf Education became a model of future education and has expande d to different countries with d ifferent cultural backgrounds and social values. Waldorf Education is in the ascendant in china b ecause of the harmony with our traditional Chinese culture. Waldorf Education is so different from all those traditional ed ucation because of the profound philosophical background, the uni que outlook on children and the systematic teaching methods. Based on Steiner's theory of Anthroposophy, the most important point of Waldorf education is that mankind does not only exist as a physical body, but even more i mportantly as a spiritual existence. Therefore, it advocates the educ ation of the mind. In other wor ds, it is the the natural education towards health which will dedicate to the harmonious developmen t of body, mind and spirit. Therefore, Waldorf Education purs ues artistic educational metho ds to a great extent. From Waldorf Education, prospectiv e: people totally has 4 basic dimensions. In addition to the physical body (such as the mineral kingdom), people also has th e etheric body (such as plants kingdom), astral body (the emoti onal body, such as the animal k ingdom) and I (only humans have). The purpose of education is to bring up healthy and balanced ch ildren, based on full respect for the 4 basic dimensions development order. Children develop differen t abilities gradually in different stages of life to understand the world and themselves. Each lif e takes 7 years as a cycle to grow up gradually and it always shows a certain growth law. Education should conform to the law. If it is violated or destroyed, children will lose the balance and healt h. So do affect the society in every aspect. Children's development stage can be broadly divided int o the following three stages in Waldorf Education: From birth to Changing teet h, about 0-7 years old. In this period, children mainly develop their willing. They cou ld not distinguish the world and the self. They are integral to the whole world and share an eth eric body with their mother. They learn everything from their surroundings and develop through im itation. This period should make children to experience \"goodness\" from all le vels instead of in tellectual influence. From Changing teeth to pube rty, about 7-14 years old. In this period, children mainly d evelop their feeling primarily through the mind experience. The protection of astral body has not been completely opened yet in this period. It is still not suitable to use too abstract concept to teach. We should adopt the way of u sing pictures, images and examples to promote study and guide their imagination. In this period Ed ucation should allow children to experience \"beauty\" at all levels. From puberty to adolescence , about 14-21 years old. In this period, children mainly develop their thinking. Astral body protects are unlocked. The mind obtains complete freedom, so it can be subjected to exteri or influence. Based on the development of willing and feeli ng, intellectual and abstract understanding will lead to even more independent judgment and challenge the authority. Education in this period should allow children to experience \"truth\" at all levels. 158Just for all these, Waldorf Education does not pay more attenti on to the \"children-centered\", but to \" understanding of the children's development.\" Therefore, t he teacher's main task is to make children's body, mind and spirit get harmonious through the art istic way which is closing to the nature of the world. Thus, who is as a Waldorf Teacher must hav e higher self-awareness, strong sense of mission and rich artis tic talent, strong imagination, reverence, gratitude, love and sacrifice. 3. An Overview of Waldorf Teacher Training 3.1. The Healthy Holistic Education has become a prominent social de mand Education is a product of the human society development. Its mi ssions are different in different historical stages. More and more social problems arising in tod ay's globalization background with great wealth of material. Our human beings have to rethink the nature of the relationship between material and spirit, man and na ture, education and human develo pment. More and more parents began to pur sue a healthy education which can balance the material and spiritual. They even began to s houlder the important task of ed ucating their children by themselves. More and more private schools and home schools quietly rising. More and more people with breadth of vision are exploring ne w education which conforms to the nature and respect for humanity. More and more people are willing to follow kids' natural development and accompany to achieve self-growth. As a kind of education helping children re cognize themselves and become healthy and harmonious themselves, Waldorf Education just cater to the great internal demands of these people. 3.2. The Development of Waldorf Teacher Training in China In 2004, Chengdu launched the first Chinese Waldorf school, only a few teachers had studied Waldorf Education abroad, the others had went to Thailand, Aust ralia and the United States to participate in short-term training. Sending new teachers to for eign countries for training is a tough move without the generous support from teacher's family, the pa rents of the schoo l. In 2007, 3 years after Chengdu Waldorf School was founded. The first 3 years part-time training for primary school was started under the well arrangement planed by Chengdu Waldor f School and well curriculum designed by Grandpa Ben. There were all over the country's more than 120 people crowded in less than 70 square learning classrooms. A lot of them founded their Waldorf Schools in other areas. They played a key role in the development of Waldorf Education in china. Chengdu Waldorf Training Center, so is called Waldorf \"Huangpu Military Academy \". Since then, different local training programs were established all over the country. All these programs mainly can be divided into 3 categories and different professional division projects: Kindergarten teacher training programs: Beijing Spring Valley, Beijing Tianxiaxi, Xi'an, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, etc. Primary school teacher training programs: Beijing Spring Valley , Xi'an, Chengdu, Guangzhou etc. High school teacher training prog rams: Chengdu, Beijing Spring Valley, Xin zhuang Normal and Beijing Lezhi run jointly. All above the training programs almost started based on the fir st training project in Chengdu, in 2004. They all are designed and implemented by the internationa l scholars, artists, and senior Waldorf teachers from all over the world. They all are usually a 3-years cycle. Totally 6-8 phases and 3 weeks per phase. In addition to the above 3 types of trai ning programs, there are more other professional programs, such as: school and community management , art, drama, medicine, architecture, space biological farming, maths, English, sports etc. There are also many other various professional training programs distributed in China. In addition to all these above pr ograms, many Waldorf schools a lso carried out training programs only for their own teachers. In particular, the spring valley c ollege, founded in 2010, has started a full-time staff training since 2012. In 2014, Beijing Xinzhuang normal university also began 1 year full-time training. In the autumn of 2016, Chengdu Waldorf school started a training program 159especially for those pre-service primary teachers in Sichuan Normal University. In the same year, Chengdu Waldorf School first start ed the school-based curriculu m for adults. All these different kinds of Wa ldorf training have been coming up continually in china in the past 10 years. It has expanded our learning resources and space, has brought fresh air and nutrients for us every trainer. 4. The Characteristics of Waldorf Teacher Training in China 4.1. Spiritual and practi cal training goals Although all those training program s have different objectives, they all have the same goal, because they all are rooted in the Anthroposophy theory and spi ritual strength are especially valued and developed in all programs. They all aim at making teachers have full curiosity, enthusiasm and awe for the world, clear their inner world, find their own miss ion through developing deep and alive thinking, and to practice firmly. In order to better support train ees successfully reach the spir itual goal and practice effectively during the training process, these training programs are locked with distinctive practice goal: Understand the development of li f e f r o m t h e o v e r a l l c o n t e x t o f the development of human civilization through continuously exploration of the autobiogra phy research, cosmic evolution, human culture era evolution and the relationship between the in dividual development and the evolution of human civilization. Have a more profound understanding of 3 basic dimensions, 4 basic dimensions and 9 basic dimensions of people. Form awareness of oneself, others, and the world. Complete the internal transformation of self, strengthen willpo wer and creativity. Reconcile scientific methods with humanistic spirit, natural sc ience and meditation, as well as different ways of thinking between the East and the west, and l earn to think in the communion of science, art and spirit. Carry out research work independently. This does not aim at the specific knowledge and skills as the g oal, but a highly spiritual significance and practical orienta tion. This prompt all teacher s to pursue their own life values, and make them more effectively to meet those children live in today 's continuous culture development and evolution era. 4.2. Broad and Profound Training Content and Curriculum System In order to achieve the above s eries training objectives, those different training programs are so colorful in curriculum system, content arrangement and design. But they are all lin ked closely to the theoretical core of Anthroposophy. All these training programs generally involve the following three aspects of the training content: Theoretical foundations of Anthroposophy. This part is mainly c arried out through systematic study of the basic works of Anthroposophy. It aims at cultivati ng trainees to: think in the communication of science, art and religion, gain internal devel opment and transformation, aware their own, others and the world, strengthen their willpower and creativity, gain the independent research ability and lifelong learning ability, improve the ind ependent personality and find the mission in self-development. In my opinion, this part is the tr ue spirit and value of Waldorf Training. It helps teachers to find their own mission and value of life as a truly independent individual. The confirmation of the mission and the value guide them to keep keen awareness of themselves and the world in daily life and continuous developme nt and improvement, so that they can achieve a meaningful life. The majors and specialties of Waldorf Training. This part aims at: awareness and insight on children's behavior and development, understanding of the syllabus and teaching methods , organic and artistic perspective, the tra nsformation of teachers role i n different stages, good mastery of teaching methods and organizing suitable content for different types of children's needs, improvement of teachers' self-management, class management and parents management, the ability to use a variety assessment met hods, persistent learning and pe rsistent practice of internal development, etc. 160Most participants devote to Waldorf Education just because deep thinking about their children's education. So in addition to their educational ideals and enthu siasm, their basic skills of Waldorf Education almost are none. So the practical content is a very i mportant part. Those rich and diverse content including: arts and crafts , music and rhythm, recorder and flute and other instruments playing, speech, drama, eurythm y, gymnastics, sports education, clay, plastic, woven, beeswax game and sewing, form drawing, wet water color painting, powder painting, sculpture and blackboard visual art etc.. Practice and work ability. Prac tice and probation, listen to le ctures, teaching discussion, preparation meeting for every grade, etc. Understand Waldorf school organization, operation and management model based on the 3 basic dimensions community conc ept, understand the construction of teachers' team a nd ther cooperation with each o ther, understand the construction of the relationship between family and school, and know how to pro mote the work of parents and community activities. It is particularly worth mentioning is that in addition to the formal curriculum content, daily life of living, the relationship betw een ourselves and others and th e environment together all become the fresh informal curriculum contents. It can be said that eve rywhere is training and from time to time in Waldorf Training. It comb ines training w ith life very well indeed. Even more gratifying is that, more and more schools begin to think more about the Chinese localization of Waldorf Educatio n after many years practice. Mo re and more experience of teaching practice are increase d during the training. 4.3. Rhythmic and colourful training methods Forming good rhythm is the most effective way to establish orde r , s e c u r i t y a n d h e a l t h . I n Waldorf Education, all activities will take care of the natural rhythm and the rhythm of life, breathing and dynamic balance. All those training programs are very good at this, so they all apply the same process: morning circle, verse reciting, keynote speec hes, modular teachi ng, special group discussion, daily review, end circle etc.. The trainer will arr ange relatively flexible activities to help all trainees always be in a relatively balanced state between a bsorption and relaxation. The inherent training model, as well as the teaching methods of the combinat ion of movement and breathing are also the daily basic rhythm of ch ildren's learning at Waldorf s chool. In addition to this rhythmic process, many other forms of activ ities are used also, such as evening forums, writing assignments, readings, specified classr oom observation, listen to each other's class, dialogue between teachers and students, inquiry way of communication and interaction. The organic and int eractive are integrated to the greatest extent. It is worth mentioning that there are all will be a cultural ni ght in all the Waldorf training programs which is loved by all tr ainers and trainees. Trainers and trainees will perform those moved them in an artistic way. It is the most beautiful and authentic feedback of every training. 4.4. High standard teaching team from all over the world Since the teacher training at the Waldorf School in Chengdu, in 2007, the teaching team has always been senior intellectuals , artists and teachers of Waldo rf school all over the world. Most of them have advanced in age, many retired or near retirement, com pleted the main lesson teaching 2- 3 round of 1-8 grade work in the ir own countries. All of them h ave a wealth of teaching experience. Some trainers also serve as the instructor of the international Waldorf teacher training program. They are responsible for the guidance and supervision of the de velopment of Waldorf Education in different countries and regions. All those trainers of each training team are from all over the world, they closely cooperate with each other to create good learning environment for the trainees, to ensure the characteristics of the local curriculum based on the essence of Waldorf education .Although different projects, different teachers, dif ferent styles, they all are surprisingly consistent in: reverence for lif e, love for education, rich tea ching experience and these years, they are bringing more and more fres h local cases of their practice for the training. 1614.5. Diversified trainees full of Education ideal The training programs are mainly for teachers and parents of Wa ldorf school. They also attract attention from all levels of society who are practicing or focu sing on the holistic education. At present, those trainees are mainly composed of the following pe rsonnel: in-service teachers and pre- service teachers from Waldorf schools; Waldorf school parents; practitioners of natural education and home education. Fortunately, under the leadership of Mu Peihua who is the former director of the Zhengzhou Bureau of Education, the majority educators of Zh engzhou traditional schools have also joined the Waldorf teacher training. At the same time, mor e and more teachers from the traditional schools began to join all these training programs i n other places. Although they are from different fields, but they all have a common characteristic is that they also have a better education ideal, and are willing to reali ze it through their own efforts. resources, whole-hearted spirit glory. These are always affecte d the trainees. As Steiner said: \"the children are not through what you say or do, but by who you are to learn\", what those trainers do is the best interpr etation of this saying. It is worth mentioning that, s ome local trainers have grown up after continuously practice for 4.6. Humanized training organization and management All these training programs are b asically initiated by the orga nizer, designed and developed by those experienced teachers who are invited from different count ries. There are many people support the organization and management of every training program. In order to ensure the flexibility and efficiency of the training, all trainers and supporters will re view and reflect all the activities at the end of everyday work to make a timely adjustment. Before the fo rmal training, the related information and requirements will be released through WeChat Group. All trainees can prepare for the coming training in advance with clear goals and needs. Duri ng the training, trainers and trainees will be able to communicate with each other through one-to-one interviews and other channels. At the same time, the training programs are usually supported by t he teachers and volunteers of the respective training institutions. All trainees will also active ly everyday's environment cleaning and maintenance, materials prepa ration and other related works. Fro m all these work and other informal. all trainees also can experience the principles and spirit of W aldorf Education which enlarged the traditional regular training con cept and method that trainers t each and trainees accept. At the same time, in order to bet ter coordinate all power from every aspect, and better ensure the training quality, CWF (Chinese W aldorf Forum) was established. It's a monument for the development of Chinese Waldorf Education. It plays an important role to ensure the formality of all the training programs. 4.7. Good transferability These well structure of the training programs, especially the course of self-growth, not only can help the trainees to establish a better knowing of the spiritual world and the actual life. It can help them establish a scientific world-view and value-view that will lead them to find their own self and meaning. All these programs are not only limited to the knowled ge and skills. So no matter teachers or parents, in-service or pre-service teachers, even the others, they all can get fresh nutrition from the training programs, and transfer them into their daily work and life. Many trainees have chosen to built their own Waldorf School or be a Waldorf teacher in th eir local areas inspired by these powerful training. They all are exploring towards the health ed ucation. They usually form a strong community of Waldorf education resources after each trai ning programs. They are continu ing support each other and sharing the richest resources . It has become a spontaneous but extremely warm folk strength. This strength is becoming more an d more stronger and is warming more and more practitioners. 1625. Summary Information technology revolution is so rapidly that it is maki ng people look on intellectual development even more seriously. The materialistic social envir onment, heavy pressure and the extremely restless life rhythm are constantly spawned a variety of educational problems and social problems. In this case, correct recognition and pursuit of the value and meaning of life is so particularly important. It is inevitably important for us to re consider the function and value of education, the starting point and standpoint of education, the content of education and the methods and forms of education. The great ancient Greek thinker Socrate s once said: education is not indoctrination, but to light the flames. This sentence have jus t described what the Waldorf Education is doing perfectly. There are so many worthies us to reflect again and again. The training work of teachers s hould pay more attention to the following problems: the cognition and awe of life should be given s ufficient attention, the educa tion should be thought about in the history line and under the present world background, spirit strength should be pay more attention, the content of education should be consistent with the law of l ife growth and development and connected with life and the our real world more effectively, im itation of the nature to adjust the education methods consistent with the natural rhythm, teaching scientifically and artistically so that real nurturing can happen effectively, combining the formal cur riculum with the informal curriculum, keeping the system as a whole and make sure it as f lexible as possible. These are not only applicable to teacher trainer s, but also to every teacher' s peer. References [1].
