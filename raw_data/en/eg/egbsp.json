Then the acupuncturist inserts thin, sterile needles into the body at different points and depths and leaves them there for 20 minutes. You will feel each needle prick. The acupuncturist will ask if you feel dull aches, numb, heavy, or tingling sensations. The feelings signify that the treatment is working. After the treatment You may have common side effects such as minor bruising or soreness at the needle puncture sites. The risk of infection is low because of the single-use, disposable nature of the needles. However, it is crucial to have treatment with a trained and certified acupuncturist and always consult him/her before the procedure. Generally, the acupuncturist may recommend having treatment once a week. How many treatments you need depends on the severity of your condition and the response to acupuncture. You should receive at least five treatments for the full effects of acupuncture treatment. If you are on medications or undergoing other treatments, such as cancer therapy, you should continue the prescribed medications. You should not stop taking medications just because you feel better or have less pain from acupuncture treatment. Article by Dr Petploy Phuvakirivivat A doctor specialist in Physical "}
