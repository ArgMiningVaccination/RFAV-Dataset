Surrounding the Buddha are 8mm sized natural gemstones including Evil Eye Agate stones for negative energy protection Super Seven, also known as Melody Stone is a natural combination of Amethyst, Clear Quartz, Smoky Quartz, Cacoxenite, Rutile, Goethite, and Lepidocrocite. These stones carry all of the metaphysical properties for each of these stones. It is a wonderfully powerful crystal that needs no cleansing or recharging. Your handmade bracelet will arrive in a soft organic cotton pouch accompanied by a description card with affirmation and stone properties. A gift box option is available at checkout. Cleansing + Charging Focus on Your Goal....... Your piece arrives to you already charged and ready for use or wear. Once you take it out of it's packaging, hold the stones close to you. Close your eyes and focus on what you hope to accomplish. Your intention. Periodically, the stones should be cleansed and recharged . 1. Place your piece outside or by a window where they can soak up moonlight over night. We recommend moonlight because some stones can fade in sunlight. A few of the stones that are known to fade are amethyst, celestite, opal, and turquoise. 2. After cleansing hold the piece close to you to fully charge it. Take some quiet time to focus and visualize your intentions. Breathe leisurely until you feel connected to that intention. Your crystals and gemstone pieces are now ready! Sizing How to Determine Sizing: Our sizes are measured before a bracelet is closed, tied and finished. Simply measure your wrist in the areas you'd like your bracelet to sit. Skimming the skin. Not loose, not tight. Add 1/2\" to 3/4\" to that size. My own wrist measures 5 7/8\", but I like the bracelet to move a little, so all of the pieces I wear are 6 3/4\". A 6 1/4\" bracelet would fit me it has no movement on my wrist and is too snug. If you are ordering a bracelet with a large focal stone and/or 10mm + sized stones, we recommend sizing at least an inch from the size of your wrist as these stones take up more of the circumfirence in s circle. Please note that it is difficult to be exactly precise when working with gemstones in sizing and there can be +/- 1/8\" variation in size.
