The long, stalk-like piece of produce can prove to be a challenge for people saddled with the vegetable (yes, it's a vegetable) in CSA shares and farmers market bundles, but rhubarb is a culinary wonder just begging for unique input. Here's everything you need to know about this semi-obscure food. What Is Rhubarb? Rhubarb is a vegetable that tends to be used like a fruit. Unlike tomatoes and avocado, fruits that are used in more savory preparation, rhubarb's tartness lends itself to being paired with more sweet flavors. And though it may look like some familiar vegetables, rhubarb is in a class of its own. \"Rhubarb, oddly enough, is not related to the celery or Swiss chard families, it's actually part of the buckwheat family,\" explains Brian Beadle, regional director of operations and higher education at an ethical food service company called Genuine Foods. It is typically in season from May to late summer, and is cultivated in hothouses, but can also be found outside of those seasons. The 30 Healthiest Foods to Eat Every Day How to Shop for Rhubarb When choosing rhubarb, look for stalks with a firm texture that do not break or bend, says Alain Verzeroli, director of culinary operations at Le Jardinier, a New York City restaurant. \"The pink to red color of the stalks, also called Petioles, indicates ripeness, and the green part of the stalks tends to be more tart,\" he says. \"You can not eat the rhubarb leaves, only the stalks.\" Along with standard garden rhubarb, the most common types of rhubarb are the Victoria, Crimson Red, Cherry Red, Chipman's Canada Red, and Prince Albert, which each have a distinctive flavor, color, size, and natural sugar content. Rhubarb Nutrition Benefits A cup of rhubarb contains about 25 calories, has no cholesterol, and very low sodium. It's a good source of Vitamin C, and also has calcium and about 2 grams of fiber per serving. Keep in mind that rhubarb's tartness means it is typically eaten with sugar or other sweeteners, which are not considered nutritious. Rhubarb is popular in Eastern medicine, and has been used as an anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and even anti-cancer medicine in China for centuries. 5 Nutritious Reasons to Keep Crunching on Bell Peppers How to Cook With Rhubarb To prep your rhubarb, wash and gently peel the stalks with a knife in order to remove the stringy texture of the skin, and cut the stalks in 1-inch to 1/1-inch pieces, Verzeroli suggests. From here, it depends on what you're doing with the rhubarb. Verzeroli likes making a rhubarb compote with various types of sweetener, like unrefined brown sugar or honey. Overripe sweet strawberries or apples can be added to the simmering compote for sweetness, and it can be enjoyed at room temperature with Greek yogurt, or over cake, pastries, and ice cream. \"Rhubarb is also a good combination with foie gras, cold like a torchon or pan fried,\" Verzeroli says. How Long Does Rhubarb Last? \"If you cook it down, it can last for a while (as with a jam), but I prefer baking it fresh,\" Beadle says. In the refrigerator, unwashed, unwrapped rhubarb will last for about three weeks.
