Design: This systematic review was undertaken according to the PRISMA 2020 statement. Data sources: We searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in seven English databases and four Chinese databases up to March 2022. Review/analysis methods: The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 was used for the quality assessment, and the mean difference with a 95% confidence interval for data pooling. The review was registered in the INPLASY (INPLASY202240016). Results: Twenty-three RCTs were identified, (SCS), trigeminal neuralgia, and pain. Pooled results showed that used alone (MD: -0.91], P0.01, week 4) showed advantages over physiotherapy alone on pain relief. However, there was no statistical difference on physical function. For CSR, TCM mind-body movement combined with physiotherapy had better effect alone on pain relief (MD: -1.15, [-1.37, -0.94], P0.01, week 4). Six trials reported safety. Nausea, dizziness, fatigue, and pain at the acupuncture point were observed. Conclusions: Low-quality evidence showed that TCM mind-body therapies might reduce pain intensity and improve physical function when used as an adjuvant therapy or monotherapy. There is a need to conduct high-quality trials to confirm the effectiveness and safety of TCM mind-body therapies for neuropathic pain. Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
