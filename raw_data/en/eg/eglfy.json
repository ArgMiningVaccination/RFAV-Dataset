According to the FDA, coronavirus is not spread by eating contaminated foods. However, you can protect your customers and staff by using the same food safety practices you would use to prevent food-borne illnesses like norovirus. This includes washing fruits and vegetables thoroughly to remove any contamination from pesticides, waxes, and pathogens. Tips for Washing Produce When washing produce, remember that there are multiple precautionary steps you should take. Before you get started, here are a few tips to keep in mind to make the process easier: - Wash your hands with soap for 20 seconds or longer - Designate and sanitize a produce washing station - Remove produce from bags and boxes immediately - Discard all bags and containers - Do not use hand soap, bleach, or alcohol on produce How to Wash Vegetables To learn how to properly wash produce, watch the video below for a step-by-step guide on the process: How to Wash Produce Soaking and spraying are the two common methods for washing produce. Use a soaking method to clean softer produce or leafy greens and use a spray solution to clean firmer-skinned vegetables. Below, we outline these two methods of cleaning fruits and veggies so you can serve your customers safe, fresh foods. 1. How to Wash Produce with the Soaking Method The soak method is ideal for washing tightly packaged fruits like berries and vegetables with crevices like broccoli. Not only does soaking produce rid it of harmful germs or chemicals, but it can also revitalize its flavor and extend its shelf life. If you purchase [local, organic fruits and vegetables](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/blog/1930/difference-between-local-and-organic-food.html) that contain no chemicals or harmful preservatives, you can use warm water to rinse your produce. To correctly use this method, you'll need the following items on hand: - Stainless steel sink - Food storage bin [Vegetable wash](/193/vegetable-wash.html)or distilled vinegar - Colander - Fresh water Follow these steps to clean fruits and vegetables with the soaking method: - Sanitize sink, wash hands, and use soap and water to clean all areas coming into contact with your fresh produce. - Fill sink with either diluted wash or vinegar solution. If you are using a commercial wash, use a 1:30 ratio of wash to water, or approximately 4 to 6 oz. of wash to 1 gallon of water. - Soak vegetables for at least 30 seconds. - Place them in a colander and use hands to rub the produce while rinsing with cold water. - Let produce air dry and enjoy. What Should You Use the Soaking Method For? While effective, you can only use the soaking method on certain fruits and vegetables. Discover the fruits and vegetables you should use the soaking method for below: | || | 2. How to Wash Fruits and Vegetables with the Spray Method Use a spray or scrub to remove dirt and pesticides from produce with firmer skin such as eggplant, potatoes, or cucumbers. This method is also ideal for large, smooth fruits and vegetables without crevices or cracks. To clean your fruits and vegetables with the spray method, you'll need the following items: - Kitchen sink - Spray bottle - Distilled vinegar [Vegetable prep brush](/2907/food-prep-brushes.html)(optional) - Fresh water To effectively clean your fruits and vegetables using the spray method, be sure to follow the steps below: - Wash hands and all areas coming into contact with your fresh produce with soap and water. - Fill a spray bottle with your solution and mist the entire surface of each vegetable or fruit. - Let the coated produce sit for at least 30 seconds. - Use your hands or a vegetable cleaning brush to scrub produce and rinse the solution off under cold running water. - Let produce air dry and enjoy. What Should You Use the Spray Method For? You should only use the spray method with certain types of produce. This method works best with these types of fruits and vegetables: | || |[Back to Top](#top) Cleaning Vegetables with Vinegar Adding vinegar to your fruit and veggie cleaning can help remove extra bacteria. Cleaning with just water removes 98% of the bacteria on fruit and vegetables, but adding vinegar will not hurt the process. Washing your fruits and vegetables with vinegar can [increase the shelf-life of produce](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/570/produce-storage-guide.html). If you're opting for vinegar instead of water, we recommend using a ratio of 1 part vinegar to 3 parts water. You can use vinegar in the soaking method with the steps above and the spray method. Why Do You Have to Wash Fruits? Washing fruit and vegetables is an important part of food safety because it can [help prevent cross-contamination](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/48/preventing-cross-contamination.html) while ridding your produce of pesticides or chemicals. Examining and washing vegetables before service increases helps you avoid a food-borne illness outbreak caused by contaminated produce. Plus, the chemicals used in pesticides can irritate guests with sensitive stomachs or allergies. [Back to Top](#top) By washing every piece of produce, you'll reduce the chance of your customers getting a food-borne illness, and you'll execute safe food preparation practices in your restaurant, deli, bar, or catering business. Additionally, [obtaining a food handling certification](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/126/food-handling-certification-how-to-obtain-a-food-handling-certificate.html) is critical in the foodservice industry and will help you serve safe and clean food to your customers.

Related Resources [ ](/blog/3222/restaurant-readiness-emergencies.html) Restaurant Readiness: Preparing for Emergencies If your restaurant has been affected by the recent measures taken to stop the spread of coronavirus, we have some tips to keep your business going despite dine-in closures. It's important to adapt quickly to the changing needs of your customers and staff so you can maintain sales and provide a valuable service to your community. Follow these steps to preserve the continuity of your business: 1. Open For Business The current restrictions placed on restaurants and bars due to coronavirus will have many of your customers wondering whether you are still open for business. Make it obvious that you are open by keeping your neon signs lit, placing a sandwich board sign out front, or attaching colorful balloons to your storefront. If you have the capabilities, consider sending out an email blast to highlight your takeout and delivery services. Utilize free social media marketing through Instragram and Facebook to inform your customers that you are open. 2. Promote Gift Cards Purchasing a gift card is a great way for your loyal customers to support your business even if they can't leave their homes. A gift card acts as a temporary loan by providing immediate financial support. Guests can use the gift certificate at a later date or gift it to someone they know in financial need. 3. Put Delivery, Takeout, and Curbside Services Into Action Preventative measures against the spread of COVID-19 have many Americans sheltering in place. If your customers can't come to you, it's time to pivot your business to bring your services to them. Put the focus on your takeout business and set up a delivery service for your restaurant. Make it as easy as possible for customers to pick up orders by providing curbside pickup. Pare down your menu to include only those items that travel well, and stock up on takeout supplies. 4. Review Your Handbook This is the perfect time to review your restaurant employee handbook and go over policies with your staff concerning paid leave and sick time. If you don't have an employee handbook, consider creating one now. Your handbook should contain a section outlining your contingency plan and the steps you'll take to prepare your business for an unplanned event. Having a contingency plan in place will help you to achieve continuity of your business. Consider adding these steps as part of your crisis plan: Nominate a crisis team Assess business risks Document procedures Test your plan 5. Brush Up On Labor Laws Make sure you're familiar with the restaurant labor laws that protect employees. When a crisis like coronavirus affects the attendance of your workforce, you might need to adjust work schedules to meet the needs of your business. Your serving staff relies on tips for their main source of income, so you may need to adjust their hourly wages if your dine-in services have been restricted. 6. Monitor Your Supply Chain Just as your business is seeing the effects of COVID-19, your supply chain may be suffering as well. Monitor your inventory closely, make sure your distributors are stocking the items you need, and be on the lookout for shipping delays. Shortages and delays may require you to research other sources for your most needed items. 7. Deep Clean Your Business Right now, there is no better time to deep clean your bar or restaurant. If your sales are suffering because of coronavirus restrictions, you can keep your staff busy with a cleaning checklist and ensure your business is safe and sanitary. Educate your employees about the differences between cleaning and sanitizing and pay extra attention to frequently touched surfaces like door handles, table tops, and condiments. Talk to your staff about the importance of hand washing and make sure your hand washing sinks are stocked with plenty of soap and paper towels. Show your customers that safety and cleanliness are important to you by keeping hand sanitizer in plain site at your entrance and checkout stations. Protect your staff and guests by utilizing sneeze guards and cashier shields to prevent the spread of airborne germs. 8. Shut Down Unnecessary Equipment and Lighting You don't need to keep all your cooking equipment running when you have a simplified menu. Consider limiting your usage to equipment with multiple functions, like combi ovens. If your restaurant is open for takeout and delivery services only, turn off the lights in areas of your business that aren't being used. 9. Cross-Train Employees When you have a smaller workforce and attendance is unpredictable, you can cope by cross-training your employees to perform multiple tasks. Cooks and dishwashers can be trained to take phone orders while servers can be trained to operate a deep fryer. With a pared-down menu and only the simplest cooking equipment in use, your entire staff can pitch in to prepare meals. 10. Make a Plan for Reducing Food Waste If the coronavirus crisis has caused your sales to drop off, you may be stuck with more food than you need. Establish a food waste plan that helps you to re-purpose ingredients and maximize your current stock. Try to use up your perishable items as quickly as possible and adjust your inventory requirements to line up with your new simplified takeout menu. In order to weather the storm of an unplanned crisis, you must take action to adapt your business as quickly as possible. Consider implementing the steps we've outlined to preserve your sales and maintain continuity. [ ](/article/128/food-safety-guidelines.html) Food Safety Guidelines Food safety guidelines are put in place to keep customers safe and prevent the risk of a foodborne illness outbreak. Any operation that serves food should establish protocols that meet the legal requirements for safe food handling. In this guide, we'll outline the most important aspects of food safety to help you build an effective program for your business and pass your next health inspection. Click below to learn about important food safety programs: Personal Hygiene Proper Food Handling Cleaning and Sanitizing Pest Control Purchase from Approved Suppliers Food Safety Training Food Safety Guidelines for Restaurants We'll cover the most important aspects of a successful food safety program so you can prevent a foodborne illness outbreak and keep your guests safe. 1. Personal Hygiene Poor hygiene is one of the most common causes of foodborne illness, but an outbreak can be prevented by establishing policies and following up with your staff regularly. Keep the following factors in mind when you create a hygiene program: Handwashing Washing hands takes mere minutes, and it's a crucial step in preventing the spread of germs that cause foodborne illness. A foodservice handler who forgets to wash their hands one time could potentially contaminate food. That's why it's important to install handwashing sinks in proper locations and keep them stocked with plenty of hand soap and paper towels. Train your staff on the correct way to wash their hands and post reminders at each hand sink. Hygiene Practices Personal cleanliness plays a major role in food safety. Soiled uniforms, aprons, and even uncovered hair can become a source of contamination. A good hygiene policy should cover the following practices: Hair Restraints - Food handlers should wear clean hats or hair restraints (including beard restraints) Clean Work Uniforms - All uniforms and aprons should be laundered. Soiled uniforms and aprons should be stored away from food prep areas. Jewelry - Jewelry should be removed before handling food because it can harbor germs or accidentally fall into food. A plain wedding band is acceptable. Eating and Drinking - Employees should never eat or drink near food and food prep areas. Beverages should be placed in a cup secured with a lid and straw. Staff members should handle the beverage carefully and keep it away from food, utensils, and equipment. Staff Illnesses Any time an employee becomes ill, it poses a safety risk for your guests and staff. Take the proper precautions with any sickness, but be on the lookout for certain pathogens that are notorious for spreading foodborne illness in foodservice environments. Employees should notify a manager if they have contracted an illness from the following pathogens: Norovirus - very contagious and often spread through hand-to-food contact Shigella spp. - often spread by unwashed hands or contaminated water Nontyphoidal Salmonella - commonly linked to poultry, eggs, meat, and dairy E. coli - commonly linked to undercooked ground beef Hepatitis A - handwashing is the best defense because this pathogen is not destroyed by cooking Salmonella Typhi - commonly linked to ready-to-eat food Handwashing and cooking foods to the correct internal temperature are two of the best defenses against these pathogens. Staff members experiencing vomiting, diarrhea, or jaundice should be excluded from working in your operation until they receive a written release from a doctor. Disposable Glove Use Wearing single-use gloves is an effective precaution but only when done properly. Hands must be washed before putting on gloves, and gloves should be changed at the appropriate times. Post reminders for your staff so they know when to change single-use gloves: After handling raw meat Before touching ready-to-eat food When gloves become dirty or torn Before starting a new task After 4 hours of continuous use Back to Top 2. Proper Food Handling Proper food handling starts when you receive a food shipment and continues until the food is served to your guests. Every step along the way requires strict controls and continuous monitoring. Foods that require special handling are called TCS foods (time-temperature control for safety). These foods provide a more hospitable environment for pathogens to grow, especially at certain temperatures. Throughout all the steps below, TCS food should be kept out of the temperature danger zone, the range from 41 to 135 degrees Fahrenheit. Receiving and Handling Train your kitchen staff to be food-safe at all times throughout receiving, prepping, and cooking. Receiving - Inspect your food shipments carefully and check temperatures. All TCS foods should be received at the right temperature and stored immediately. Frozen foods should be frozen solid on arrival. Ice crystals and water stains on the packaging are signs that the food may have thawed during transport. Reject any foods that do not meet temperature requirements or appear to have been time-temperature abused. Cross Contamination - Germs can be spread by hands, but also by contaminated foods, tools, and equipment. When raw foods like uncooked chicken come into contact with prep surfaces, pathogens can be left behind to contaminate other foods. Prevent cross-contamination by keeping foods separated, using color-coded kitchen tools, and cleaning and sanitizing equipment after use. Cooking Food Correctly - Cooking foods to the correct internal temperatures is an important safeguard against the spread of pathogens. Some pathogens are spread by unwashed hands, and some may already be present in foods like eggs and beef. To destroy these germs, foods need to be cooked to a safe minimum temperature and tested with a clean, reliable thermometer. Holding and Storage Foods should be kept at safe temperatures throughout holding and storage. Food Holding - Food holding is the practice of cooking foods ahead of time and holding them at a certain temperature. A soup that is made in the morning and stored in a soup warmer is being \"hot-held\". If the temperature of the soup falls in the danger zone, pathogens can grow to harmful levels. Any foods that are hot-held or cold-held must be kept at safe temperatures and monitored periodically to make sure they do not enter the temperature danger zone. Proper Cooling - Foods can also enter the temperature danger zone when they are not cooled correctly. If hot dishes are prepared ahead of time and placed into cold storage to be reheated later, they must be cooled using a two-step process. Food must be cooled from 135 degrees Fahrenheit to 70 degrees Fahrenheit within 2 hours. Then cooled from 70 degrees Fahrenheit to 41 degrees Fahrenheit within 4 hours. This prevents the foods from lingering too long in the temperature danger zone. Food Storage - The method you use to store foods affects food safety. Always think first in, first out (FIFO) when putting foods away in storage. Push newer foods to the back of the shelf, and keep the older foods in the front so they get used first. TCS foods should be placed on cold storage shelves in a certain order to prevent liquids from dripping on the foods below and causing a contamination issue. The correct storage order from top-to-bottom is ready-to-eat foods, seafood, whole cuts of beef and pork, ground meat and fish, and whole or ground poultry. Back to Top 3. Cleaning and Sanitizing It's a common misconception that cleaning and sanitizing are the same thing. They are two different methods, but both are crucial steps to maintaining a food-safe kitchen. Cleaning removes dirt and debris from a surface while sanitizing reduces pathogens on a surface. How to Clean and Sanitize Food Contact Surfaces Surfaces that don't come into contact with food only need to be cleaned and rinsed. But food-contact surfaces like prep tables, tools, and equipment must be cleaned and sanitized. Follow these steps to clean and sanitize correctly: Wipe the surface to remove any crumbs or food particles Wash the surface with an approved food-safe cleaning solution Rinse the surface with clean water Sanitize the surface with an approved sanitizing solution mix to the right concentration Let the surface air dry To keep food-contact surfaces free of pathogens, cleaning and sanitizing must be performed at the appropriate times. Train your staff to sanitize surfaces when they complete a task or start prepping a different food. They should also stop and sanitize if they are interrupted in their task and after using the same surface for 4 continuous hours. Cleaning and Sanitizing Equipment Kitchen equipment is more challenging to clean and sanitize than a smooth surface like a prep table because there are moving parts. For the best sanitizing method, refer to the manual for each specific type of equipment. Follow our guidelines below for general equipment sanitizing: Make sure the equipment is powered off and unplugged Disassemble any removable parts Wash all parts by hand or run through the dishwasher Clean any food debris from equipment surfaces Wash the equipment with an approved cleaner, rinse, then sanitize Let parts and equipment air dry before reassembling Dishwashing Guidelines What other items in your restaurant come into contact with food? You'll need to establish a dishwashing program for all the cookware, utensils, and tableware you use daily. Flatware, dinnerware, and glassware can be run through a dishwasher, but larger items like cooking pots and pans must be cleaned and sanitized manually in a three-compartment sink. High Temp Dishwashers - These dishwashers use hot water to clean and sanitize dishes. To be effective at destroying germs, the water in the dishwasher must reach a temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit in the final rinse. Chemical Dishwashers - Unlike a high-temp machine, a chemical dishwasher relies on chemical sanitizers to eliminate pathogens. Three-Compartment Sinks - It's possible to clean and sanitize manually in a three-compartment sink, but only if the steps are performed correctly. Refer to our three-compartment sink guide to learn the best way to use this method. Back to Top 4. Pest Control No one wants to think about pests invading their restaurant. Unfortunately, ongoing prevention is required to keep your business pest-free. Unwanted critters can damage your facility, but the biggest threat from pests is their potential to spread diseases and foodborne illness. To create a successful pest control program for your restaurant, there are three components to keep in mind: deny access, deny food and shelter, and work with a licensed pest control professional. Learn how to enforce these pest control tips below: Deny Access Denying access to pests means preventing them from gaining entry to your building in the first place. Check all food deliveries carefully for potential hitchhikers and reject shipments with any signs of pest activity. Inspect your building to find any openings where pests can enter. Seal off cracks, install door sweeps, and keep windows and vents screened off. Use air curtains above doorways with outdoor access to deter airborne pests from entering. Deny Food and Shelter Remove the temptation that attracts pests to your building. Take out garbage periodically throughout the day, keep trash containers clean, and make sure dumpsters are closed securely. Any spills, crumbs, and food debris should be cleaned up immediately. It's crucial to clean beneath equipment and never leave food attractants out overnight when pests are more active. This includes the dining room and front-of-house! Always clean out crumb-catchers and sweep beneath booths and tables. Work with a Licensed Pest Control Professional If you've tried denying pests entry, food, and shelter but somehow they have found a way in, it's time to call a professional. Don't wait! As soon as you see any signs of a pest infestation, no matter how small, find a licensed pest control technician immediately. Do not attempt to set traps or put out poison yourself. A pest control professional will know exactly what to look for and how to handle each pest in the safest, most effective way. 5. Purchase from Approved Suppliers You can do everything right and follow all the food safety guidelines available, but if the source of your food isn't reputable, you have a big problem on your hands. This is especially true for ready-to-eat foods like produce that don't get the benefit of high-heat cooking to destroy pathogens. Lettuce can become contaminated by agricultural run-off and absorb tainted water into the leaves. This type of contamination can't be removed by washing because the germs are inside the produce. This is why outbreaks from contaminated romaine lettuce have frequently made the headlines. The only way to prevent this type of occurrence is to buy produce (and all other foods) from an approved supplier. So what exactly is an approved supplier, and how do you find one? Here are some tips: Never buy from roadside vendors, farmer's markets, or local farmers unless they are approved commercial suppliers. Choose a commercial supplier that meets the requirements of local, state, and federal laws. A reputable supplier should be able to provide inspection reports that cover all practices from receiving to staff training. Be especially picky when choosing suppliers of TCS foods. Even with a supplier you trust, you should still inspect every shipment carefully and reject anything suspicious. Back to Top 6. Training and Monitoring Once you've outlined a food safety program, you'll need to establish standard operating procedures to support your goals. Strict monitoring is required and your staff will need continuous training to uphold the SOPs you've created. Standard Operating Procedures First of all, what is an SOP? A standard operating procedure (SOP) is a fancy term for a written rule or guideline. Putting a procedure in writing is a way to hold your staff accountable for following the policies of your food safety program. SOPs also provide instructions that your team can follow even when a manager isn't present, which helps make your kitchen more efficient. When writing SOPs, keep the following things in mind: Who will perform the task What supplies are needed to perform the task Where will the task be performed When should the task be performed How will the task be performed Training Once you have established all SOPs in writing, you can begin to train your staff. Your efforts will be more successful if you think of training as an ongoing necessity, not a one-time obligation. New team members need to go through a training program when they are hired, and veteran employees always benefit from a refresher course. As you create a training module, utilize different methods like training videos, written instructions, demos, and role-playing exercises. Place visual aids like posters throughout your kitchen as helpful reminders. Monitoring The only way to be sure that your SOPs are being followed is to establish monitoring practices and quality control. Temperature checking is one of the most important examples of a monitoring procedure. Keep a written record that shows the date and time of the temp check, the temperature of the food, and the initials of the employee performing the check. The team member should also indicate if any corrective actions were needed. Monitoring can also be as simple as watching your team members or appointing someone else to observe that SOPs are being followed. If you see a team member fail to wash their hands at the appropriate time, it's an opportunity to re-train that employee. Sometimes corrective actions may need to be taken if food safety is at risk. Make sure that you consistently monitor your food safety program to ensure its success. There is a lot to cover with food safety, and one of the best ways to keep your team members educated is to require food handlers certification for all back-of-house employees. At least one certified team member should be on staff at all times. Follow our guidelines for general food safety, but refer to the requirements of your local regulatory authority to ensure compliance. [ ](/blog/1706/what-fruits-and-vegetables-are-in-season-in-your-region.html) Seasonal Fruits and Vegetables in Your Region When are pears in season? What are some examples of fall fruits? With so many fruits and vegetables being imported from other states and countries, it can be hard to know what fruits are in season around your restaurant, cafe, or bar. Modern consumers will pay more for local and organic fresh vegetables and fruits. You can take advantage of this restaurant trend and boost your profits by famililiarizing yourself with your region's seasonal produce cycles If your establishment doesn't have its own culinary garden, it likely obtains produce to use in foods and recipes from another source. Whether you operate a restaurant or a juice bar, your establishment stands to benefit from using in-season produce in recipes. Although non-local and out-of-season produce gets the job done, many people prefer the various benefits that come with eating seasonally, shifting the focus of restaurants towards locally grown, in-season food. Shop All Fruits and Vegetables Use this link to jump to our interactive seasonal produce chart: Seasonal Produce Calendar Eating Seasonally There are many benefits to eating in-season produce, both for your own health and for the environment's sake. Lovers of fruits and vegetables will likely get much more out of eating produce that is in season than they would from eating frozen produce. Here are just a few of the benefits of eating in-season vegetables and fruits. More Nutrition - On average, seasonal fruits and vegetables contain many more nutrients than their frozen, out-of-season counterparts. The process of preserving and protecting fruits and vegetables for long-term storage can sap produce of their nutritional value, meaning in-season produce will almost always be packed with more nutrients. Better Taste - In addition to being more nutritious, in-season fruits and vegetables are often thought of as better tasting than out-of-season produce. Farmers that look to mass-produce fruits and vegetables prioritize shelf-life over taste, allowing the produce to be stored for long periods and survive being shipped across the country. As a result, you'll often find that locally grown in-season vegetables have much more flavor. Lower Costs - In-season produce is often much cheaper due to its abundant supply. On the other hand, out-of-season produce isn't as plentiful, resulting in higher prices. Additionally, extra costs need to be added to out-of-season produce to cover aspects such as transportation and preservation, further inflating prices. Due to this, eating in-season produce is not only good for your health, but it's great for your wallet. Reduced Carbon Footprint - Consuming in-season vegetables and fruit is a great way to reduce your carbon footprint and have a positive impact on the environment. Out-of-season produce typically requires hundreds of miles of transportation, which results in the burning of many fossil fuels and emissions entering the atmosphere. If you eat local in-season produce, your food doesn't have to travel as far to reach you, greatly cutting back on emissions. Decreased Pesticide Consumption - Out-of-season produce is usually filled with a variety of pesticides and preservatives to maintain freshness and quality throughout the food's entire journey. Although properly cleaning out-of-season fruits and vegetables can remove some chemicals, there may be some remaining. However, in-season vegetables and fruits don't require as much preservation through chemicals, meaning eating in-season produce will greatly reduce the number of pesticides you consume. What Produce Is in Season? Depending on what time of the year it is and what region of the United States you are located in, different produce will be in season. For example, spring produce in the Northeast consists of foods such as mushrooms, rhubarb, and cherries, while spring produce in the Southwest includes corn, avocados, and strawberries. Learning what fruits and vegetables are in season in your region is important if you're looking to use fresh ingredients and create the best dishes possible.
