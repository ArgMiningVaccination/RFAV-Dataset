Liver and Gallbladder Health Gallbladder \"cleanses\" or \"flushes\" are marketed as natural ways to get rid of gallbladder sludge or gallstones, which form when bile substances, like cholesterol, harden. These \"gallstone flushes,\" often advertised online, may include oil and lemon juice, Epsom salts, juices, apple cider vinegar (ACV), or supplements. Although lifestyle changes, including a healthy diet, can help prevent gallstones, there is a lack of scientific evidence that gallbladder cleanses or flushes are effective. Some may even pose health risks. This article will cover the potential risks associated with gallbladder cleanses and offer natural approaches to support gallbladder health. Natalia Gdovskaia / Getty Images Gallbladder Cleanse: Potentially Safe Detoxes and cleanses are advertised as ways to rid the body of toxins, lose weight, or promote health. Gallbladder cleanses claim to remove gallbladder sludge or build-up in the gallbladder that can cause gallstones or gallbladder attacks. However, the body has natural processes and mechanisms to eliminate toxins. Advertised cleanses may include diets, regimens, and supplements, but these approaches often lack data supporting their efficacy. In some cases, they can be unsafe. What Is Gallbladder Sludge? Gallbladder sludge comprises cholesterol monohydrate crystals, calcium bilirubinate granules, and other calcium salts. The buildup results from bile sitting in the gallbladder for too long and often occurs in pregnant people or those who have experienced rapid weight loss. Often, individuals seek nutritional supplements, herbal medications, or \"flushes\" to treat gallstones. Popular gallstone flushes include the following: Olive oil cleanses: This method proposes fasting for 12 hours, then ingesting 4 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice every 15 minutes for eight cycles. According to anecdotal data, this cleanse causes diarrhea and abdominal pain, followed by the passing of gallstones.Juice cleanse: One proposed cleanse requires refraining from food except for apple and vegetable juice until 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. and then drinking olive oil and lemon juice every 15 minutes until a total of 8 ounces of olive oil is ingested. In both these cleanses, olive oil may provide a laxative effect. However, there is no evidence that this leads to the passing of gallstones. Apple cider vinegar cleanses: Apple cider vinegar is believed to soften gallstones. Although there are limited studies to support its effect on gallstones, ACV has proven to have beneficial effects on fat levels. One meta-analysis of nine studies on ACV and fat levels found that 15 milliliters (mL) of ACV a day lowered total cholesterol levels by stimulating the release of bile acid. Despite the popularity of these cleanses, there's little research to suggest their effectiveness in \"cleansing\" the gallbladder. People following gallstone cleanse are likely to get their information from the Internet. One study evaluating online content regarding gallbladder disease found that 56% of videos on YouTube were misleading. The \"gallstone flush,\" using the olive oil and lemon juice cleanse, is one of the most popular treatment methods discussed on YouTube. Despite their popularity, such cleanses lack scientific evidence that such cleanses can treat gallstones. Potentially Unsafe Gallbladder Cleanses Extreme cleanses can pose a risk to your overall health. In one case study, a man drank Epsom salts dissolved in lukewarm water for 15 days to flush out gallstones. The overuse of Epsom salts has potential adverse health effects, including: DiarrheaKidney injuryIrregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)Liver injury Use supplements that promise to eliminate gallstones with caution. Many dietary supplements contain ingredients with strong effects that may interact with an existing medical condition or medication. Dietary supplements are not as tightly regulated as medications in the United States. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn't approve them for safety or effectiveness before being sold to the public. Additionally, individuals with health conditions, such as diabetes, should follow a healthcare provider-recommended eating pattern. Many cleanses require fasting and limiting food intake, which can be hazardous for people managing certain health conditions. Discuss any changes, including cleanses or detoxes, with a healthcare provider before adjusting your eating patterns. Does Any Gallbladder Cleanse Work the Quickest? The evidence supporting gallbladder cleanses is lacking. Long-term lifestyle changes, such as regular physical activity and a healthy diet, can help prevent and reduce your risk of gallstones. Dietary habits that support your gallbladder health include: Eating more fiber from foods such as fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grainsLimiting refined carbohydrates and sugar Eating more healthy fats while limiting unhealthy fats Besides Cleanses, What Supports Liver and Gallbladder Health? Gallstones are common and affect 10%-15% of the U.S. population. There are ways to support liver and gallbladder health. Rapid weight loss can increase the risk of developing gallstones. Both going for long periods without eating and losing weight too quickly cause the liver to release extra cholesterol into the bile. Additionally, quick weight loss can stop the gallbladder from emptying. Losing and regaining weight (weight cycling) can increase the risk of gallstones. To prevent gallstones, healthcare providers recommend long-term changes, including: Eating more fiberConsuming less refined carbohydratesReducing sugar intakeEating more healthy fats Maintaining a healthy weight Avoiding very low-calorie diets that lead to rapid weight lossAvoiding weight cyclingGetting regular physical activity Gallstones May Be Asymptomatic Gallstones can be asymptomatic (without symptoms). However, the following symptoms can be signs of a gallstone attack requiring immediate medical attention:PainCrampsNausea and vomiting Many people seek complementary and integrative approaches to treating gallstones. Although more scientific evidence is needed, supplements to treat gallstones may include: Vitamin C may decrease the risk of gallstones in some individuals. Vitamin E is associated with a lower risk of gallstones in older adults, according to one study. Herbs like milk thistle, dandelion root, artichoke, turmeric, celandine, and Oregon grape are known to stimulate bile flow and reduce cholesterol content in bile. Such herbs have been suggested for treating gallbladder inflammation, but evidence from randomized controlled trials is limited. Gallbladder Trigger Foods Certain foods may increase the risk of gallbladder sludge and gallstones, including:Fried foodsFatty foods, especially saturated fatWhole milk dairy products Sugary foods and refined carbohydrates Summary There is little evidence to support the use of gallbladder cleanses or flushes. Some flushes may have adverse health effects. Individuals experiencing pain, nausea, vomiting, or cramping due to gallstones should see a healthcare provider immediately for proper treatment. Healthy lifestyle changes, including physical activity and a healthy eating pattern, can reduce the risk of developing gallstones. 18 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
