Type 2 diabetes is caused when the body does not produce sufficient insulin or cells are resistant to insulin. Insulin is the hormone that facilitates the uptake of glucose by cells. With low levels of the hormone or when resistant occurs, glucose levels in the blood shoot up resulting in diabetes. Diabetes is usually treated with insulin pills or even injections when required as well as other medications, but if blood glucose levels can be controlled naturally, medication can be avoided. Diet and lifestyle modifications are the best way to control blood sugar and can lead to a healthy and productive life.

Vegetables are an excellent source of fiber and help to keep blood sugar stable. Stick to non-starchy vegetables like spinach, cauliflower, broccoli, beets, French beans, and so on. Eating raw vegetable salads keeps you feeling full for longer and prevents sugar crashes which lead to sugar cravings.
