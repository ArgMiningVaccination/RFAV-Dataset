A history of any immediate allergic reaction to any other vaccine or injectable therapy (i.e. intramuscular, intravenous, or subcutaneous vaccines or therapies) is considered as a precaution but not a contraindication to vaccination. For such persons, a risk assessment should be conducted to determine the type and severity of reaction and the reliability of the information. Such individuals may still receive vaccination, but they should be counseled about the risks of developing a severe allergic reaction, and the risks should be weighed against the benefits of vaccination. Such persons should be observed for 30 minutes after vaccination in health care settings where anaphylaxis can be immediately treated. Food, contact, or seasonal allergies are not considered reasons for precaution. The vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex, and there is no contraindication or precaution to vaccination for persons with a latex allergy. In addition, mRNA vaccines do not contain eggs or gelatin, and there is no contraindication or precaution to vaccination for persons with allergies to these substances. People with a family history of allergies or anaphylaxis can be vaccinated. "}
