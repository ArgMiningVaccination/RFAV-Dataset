Q: what's first, now that you're cEo of Ahs?A: my first job is learning the landscape. i need to connect with the front line. when i think about what a cEo should be doing, my primary job should be to eliminate any barriers front-line staff may have or feel. i also need to have a relationship with the community at large; to say to albertans: 'if you have issues or concerns, let us know. t ell us and we're going to do our best to meet your needs and expectations.' Q: what type of changes are you envisioning?A: i'll be looking at how we maintain quality of care and maintain appropriate wait times. how do we make sure we're serving the right person, at the right time, doing the right thing? what kinds of structures do staff need to help them move through that? Q: many would say there have been incidences of political interference in the past when it comes to your position. how do you plan to handle the politics of Alberta? A: politics and health care go together. we elect our political leaders, give them tax dollars and tell them they need to spend it in the areas important to us. health care has always been, and will always be, one of the most important areas to canadians. as long as we're funded by tax dollars, you as a taxpayer will have your say through the politician. when we see an increase in the politicization of decisions, it's because there is a loss of confidence. my job is to bring confidence to the position and to the organization, and to earn the confidence of albertans. if we have that kind of a relationship with the people of alberta and with the staff of ahs and with the physicians, i think we'll be on the right path. n KAMINSKI Photo by Michelle Ratz |l o C a l l e a d e r s PAGE 2 over the course of a day, your hands come in contact with a lot of surfaces. there's an important habit such busy hands should never go without, and that's hand-washing. hand hygiene is the single, most-effective way to prevent the spread of communicable diseases and infections at work, at home and at play. washing your hands often and well is a habit that needs to be taught and practised. Even in this age of technology, hand washing is our best defence against disease. when should we be washing our hands? at the beginning of the day and after coming home from school or work. before making, serving, or eating food. after using the washroom. after handling garbage. after touching anything that might be a source of germs, like wiping your nose, coughing into your hand, or playing in the playground. what is the best way to wash?Using soap and warm water, wash your hands thoroughly and often, rubbing your soaped hands together for at least 20 seconds. don't forget to wash palms, between the fingers, backs of hands, thumbs, wrists, and fingertips and nails, too. You should rinse under running water and then dry your hands thoroughly. alcohol-based hand rub or sanitizer can also be helpful if hands are not visibly soiled. as the weather grows warmer and thoughts turn toward summer activities with friends and family, make sure to pack proper hand-washing habits with you. please keep hand hygiene in mind now and throughout the year; talk about it with your family and friends and lead by example. this simple task can have far-reaching impacts to your health and well-being. nstUdENt giv Es iNstrUctor aN a-pl Us - a Nd aN awardl o C a l l e a d e r s PAGE 2 DR. evan lun Dall keRR y bales GivE us A hAnd with hEAlth cArE There are plenty of health care options available.

basic and comprehensive - typically provide services once or twice a week, for about six hours per day. basic adult day programs provide basic health care, recreation and socialization to seniors who require support, and respite services for caregivers. seniors with complex health needs can be served in comprehensive adult day programs, which offer medical monitoring and treatment, medication assistance, rehabilitation, transportation and in-home personal care. \"we're really proud of the work we've done in the community. seniors involved the program come in several days a week and join other seniors in the community to do activities, exercise, socialize and events, and just have a lot of fun,\" says barb Noad, agecare's marketing and communications manager. \"one of the things we see when seniors are living at home is that sometimes they can get a feeling of isolation being on their own and this is a way for them to connect with their peers.\" cheryl knight, Executive director of seniors health for ahs, says adult day programs are an integral part of ahs' seniors strategy. \"by getting seniors out of their homes once or twice a week, we're helping them stay in their homes longer and providing caregivers with a needed break to ensure they can stay well while continuing in their caregiving role,\" knight says. as an added bonus, seniors in the adult day programs are monitored by health professionals who may be able to identify and treat medical issues before they become serious - potentially so serious that seniors would be unable to remain at home. philo's daughter, Janice, certainly appreciates the break the program gives her, as well as the peace of mind. \"for us as a family it's been a great program because it allows us to not have to worry about mom for two days a week, wondering what she's doing or that she's not interacting with people. it's really relieved stress for us as caregivers,\" Janice says. to see if you or a loved one could benefit from an adult day program in central Zone, please contact 1.877.341.2131. nStory by James Stevenson and Amber Goulard | Calgarian Noreen Philo enjoys the social activities she gets by attending an adult day program.adUlt da Y programs arE ExpaNdiNgMore than 500 new spaces to be added for seniors \" thE maiN thiNg is wE ENJoY sEEiNg Each othEr aNd coNvErsiNg -

more than five to be precise - vera lacey has been giving back to others. a lifetime member of the ladies auxiliary, lacey has been a volunteer at the lacombe hospital and care centre since 1961, giving her time and talents to a variety of roles, and creating a legacy that epitomizes what it means to volunteer. \"she's amazing,\" says leanne brusegard, alberta health services (ahs) volunteer resources co-ordinator in lacombe. \"v era is so dedicated and so enthusiastic about what she does every day she's here.\" choosing to volunteer at the hospital was never really a question, says lacey. \"almost everyone goes to the hospital at one point or another, so i think it's a great place to volunteer and to help others,\" she says. \"You never know when you might need help yourself, so giving back is important.\" in 53 years of volunteering, lacey has seen her share of change, and held her share of volunteer positions. when she first began, lacey distributed visiting cards to visitors coming to see patients. at the time, only two visitors were allowed in to see a patient at a time. others would have to wait until a visitor left and they could be giving a visiting card. when she wasn't greeting visitors, lacey and other auxiliary members would make all the hospital bedsheets and pillowcases, along with birthing socks for new mothers. the ladies would bring in portable sewing machines - and lunch - and stitch the day away. \"we would organize celebrations with the nurses from overseas who didn't have family here so they weren't alone,\" lacey recalls. \"i've been part of celebration teas for birthdays and holidays, i've worked bake sales and helped make cards and tray favours of patients and residents. i've also helped at fundraising casinos and at flu clinics - basically doing anything i can to help out.\" lacey was also the baby box co-ordinator, keeping it stocked with knitted items for newborns and making sure there was always wool on hand for the volunteer knitters. \"i had to make sure there were newborn hats, because every baby got one.\" when the long-term care wing was opened, she co-ordinated volunteers to fill various roles, and over the years has served with the ladies auxiliary at not only the local and regional level, but provincially as well. lacey was also the group's president for a time. Now she oversees the workers in the t uck shop, which offers refreshments for purchase. lacey is not only one of the longest service volunteers in lacombe, but one of the longest serving in the central Zone, says brusegard. \"we've so fortunate to have v era. she's such an important part of our team,\" says brusegard. \"she shares her knowledge and experience with not only myself, but with our other volunteers and that is so beneficial.\" and while she may not be volunteering the same hours she was over a half-century ago, lacey still volunteers \"as often as i'm needed.\" \"i enjoy it,\" she says. \"if people can volunteer, they should. You're able to help others and make a difference, and that's good for you, too.\" last year, volunteers - including community groups and auxiliaries - contributed more than 194,000 hours to facilities in the central Zone in a variety of positions. for more information on ahs volunteer opportunities, visit www.albertahealthservices.ca/5721.asp. n vEra's vEr Y grEat at hElpiNg oUt \" YoU NEvEr kNow whEN YoU might NEEd hElp YoUrsElf , so giviNg back is importaNt - Vera lacey, who has volunteered at the lacombe Hospital and Care Centre for more than five decades Vera lacey, above, volunteers selling goods in the Tuck Shop in the lacombe Hospital and Care Centre.visit Us oNliNE hEAlth AdvisoriEs get the latest, up-to-date health advisories for your area on the alberta health services website. find out about water quality issues, illness outbreaks, and matters of public health. v isit www.albertahealthservices.ca under \"News and Events.\" thE biG burn take a virtual trip to the tanning salon, not to tan, but to learn about the dangers of artificial tanning, including skin cancer, eye damage, skin aging and addiction. visit www.thebigburn.ca. sEx GErms sexually transmitted infections can have lasting effects on your health and fertility. get the facts, talk to your partner, and spread the word about protecting yourself and getting tested. v isit www.sexgerms.com. whA t's on your mEd list? if you take medications, you play a role in your health care when it comes to medication safety. keep an up-to-date list of all the medications you take and carry it with you. go to www.albertahealthservices.ca/9515. asp. it lists medication resources, as well as questions to ask your doctor about your medications. follow your zone at Ahs_centralZone: can't think of anything to eat? here are some ideas for quick, well-balanced and nutritious meals: http://goo.gl/BvWc74. free health workshops w eight w ise and better choices, better health are coming to #Lacombe. learn more: http://goo.gl/rv9apG #healthychoices. wondering about washing dishes, doing laundry or making coffee during a boil-water order? v isit http://goo.gl/ijf7wG. free ahs sessions in #Eckville focus on improving #eating habits to take better control of your diet. call 1.877.314.6997. twitt Er Bein g Super { } To Issac, being healthy means... www.albertahealthservices.ca/yourvoice #yourvoiceWhat does health mean to you?

Robotics on the brain calgary neurosurgeon dr. garnette sutherland has spent his career breaking new ground in neurosurgery. his first \"world first\" was a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) system for operating rooms. it provides surgeons with 3-d images during an operation. he followed that with another milestone: the neuroarm, the world's first mri-compatible surgical robot for both microsurgery and image-guided biopsy. surgeons control the neuroarm from a workstation, guiding its movements via images on a screen. because it can move in smaller increments than the human hand, neuroarm is the ideal tool for performing delicate surgery inside the brain. 4. 10. 5.from heart attacks to colds, genetics to food science, researchers in Alberta are discovering new treatments and developing new technologies to improve the health of Albertans and people around the world. Take a look at 10 groundbreaking innovations developed in our province. Story by Connie Bryson | For more innovations, visit applemag.ca Groundbreaking drug for hep B the first oral medicine to treat chronic hepatitis b infection was developed by dr. lorne tyrrell at the University of alberta. lamivudine is a groundbreaking drug for patients with this chronic viral infection - about 300 to 350 million people worldwide. these people cannot clear the virus from their body; they are at high risk of serious liver damage, as well as death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. lamivudine stops the virus from replicating, which minimizes liver damage. albErta: hotbEd of iNNovatioNs Keeping a steady beat cardiologist dr. anne gillis is an international leader in the use of devices like pacemakers to treat heart rhythm disorders. Under her leadership, calgary's cardiac arrhythmia service became the first centre outside the U.s. to evaluate remote monitoring of patients with implantable defibrillators. her research has led to refinements in pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, improving the quality of life for countless heart patients. 2.Food safety first in 2008, deli meats contaminated with the listeria bacteria led to 22 deaths in canada. thanks to research by three University of alberta scientists - drs. lynn mcmullen, michael stiles and John vederas - there's a life-saving food additive that kills this deadly bacteria without any chemicals. their micocin technology is now used by food- packaging companies to ensure the safety of food products.6. 8.Getting a good night's sleep sleep apnea is a life-threatening condition that interrupts breathing during sleep. the University of calgary's dr. John remmers was the first to demonstrate that the condition is due to a narrowing of part of the throat. he developed a device to keep the airway open during sleep: the cpap (continuous positive airway pressure) device. the cpap essentially eliminates sleep apnea and dramatically improves sleep quality. 9.Dressing for success with his invention of the acticoat technology, dr. robert burrell revolutionized wound care and helped save the lives and limbs of thousands of patients around the world. w orking as a biomedical engineer at alberta's w estaim t echnologies inc., burrell developed tiny silver nanocrystals that kill microbes and stop inflammation. acticoat dressings are used worldwide to prevent life-threatening infections and promote healing in burns, ulcers and other wounds. Rules change for heart transplants heart transplants in babies are different from those in adults, thanks to research by cardiologist dr. lori w est. she discovered that infants can receive a heart from a donor with an incompatible blood type; in adults, donor and recipient blood types must match. because infant immune systems can adapt to a mismatched donor, this widens the pool of potential organs and decreases wait times. Creating a lab in a box an alberta company is turning the notion of a lab test on its head. instead of a lab that requires floor space and equipment, aquila diagnostics systems inc. has developed a device the size of a toaster that can do all kinds of molecular tests - determine whether a patient is resistant to cancer drugs, identify a strain of malaria, pinpoint infectious disease in a herd of cattle, and more. the science behind the technology comes from the work of University of alberta cancer researcher dr. linda pilarski. the device has the potential to replace millions of dollars of equipment in a conventional lab with something that is much less expensive and can be used anywhere.Gene-mapping workhorse a tool developed at the University of alberta in the 1990s became the workhorse of the human genome project - an international research effort to map all of our genes, which paves the way for new understanding of genetic factors in disease. developed by analytical chemists drs. Norman dovichi and Jianzhong Zhang, the instrument analyzed dNa 10 times faster than earlier technology. Nothing to sneeze at one of canada's most popular over-the-counter cold and flu medicines was developed in alberta. cold-fx came out of research at the University of alberta on the active ingredients in traditional herbal medicine. it's derived from the roots of the ginseng plant, one of the most valued medicinal plants in the world.often, a visit to the emergency department is accompanied by fear and confusion for children. but the red deer regional hospital centre emergency department (Ed) has this covered. thanks to support from the red deer regional health foundation, kids visiting the Ed get a little coping kit full of comfort items during their visit - for example, a stuffed animal to cuddle. \"we give each child visiting emergency a kit to help distract and relax them,\" says Nova bais, Ed registered nurse at the hospital. \"the kits include items to help take the focus off whatever procedure or test a child has to undergo and hopefully start building a rapport with them and mom or dad.\" colour-coded for gender and age up to 12 years old, about 150 kits a month are given out. Each kit contains about five items, which help the child deal with the situation. for example, items like party favours, books, squeeze balls and play dough are in the kits to help re-direct the child's focus from the situation to the object in their hand. \"deep breathing is really important to help ease pain and keep a child from fidgeting too much, so we give out bubble blowers or pinwheels to encourage this,\" explains bais. \"we may have to administer a variety of tests and procedures, like drawing blood, starting intravenous drips, changing dressings or setting broken bones. \"the kits really help to keep children busy and brings everyone together in conversation, including mom and dad. this helps kids relax and normalizes the situation - and it helps change perception from something scary to a more personalized visit.\" the coping kits have been used in the Ed since 2008 and the foundation is helping provide them through community donations, along with a $3,000 donation from the red deer college Unit secretary program. Each kit also contains an information card for parents on how to manage their child's pain and provide comfort. and finally, an evaluation sheet is included to gather feedback on the value of the kits and how positively the kids receive them. John donald, chair of the red deer regional health foundation, is happy to see community support in making emergency visits less scary for their littlest citizens. \"we sometimes forget how confusing or fearful a visit to the emergency department can be,\" says donald. \"it's comforting to know these little guys aren't forgotten and i'm glad to support such an important program.\" for more information, visit www.rdrh foundation.com. no u r p a r t n e r s PAGE 7 kits comfort ailiNg kids Story by Kerri Robins | Photo courtesy Red Deer Regional Health Foundation Make a difference in your community.
