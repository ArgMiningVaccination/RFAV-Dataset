Its complex network of cells, organs, proteins, and tissues enable it to defend the body from bacteria, viruses, parasites, and more. Immunity refers to the body's ability to prevent the invasion of pathogens which are the foreign disease-causing substances, such as bacteria and viruses. When we are exposed to these pathogens, the antigens attached to their surface stimulate an immune response in the body. An immune response is our body's defense system to fight against antigens and protect the body. There are several types of immunity. This includes This is a general protection that a person is born with which is activated immediately when a pathogen enters the body. This includes physical barriers (skin, body hair), defense mechanisms (saliva, gastric acid), and general immune responses (inflammation). This is the body's capacity to resist pathogens by \"borrowing\" antibodies. The most common form of passive immunity is that which an infant receives from its mother during the last one to two months of pregnancy. During this time, the antibodies are transported across the placenta from mother to the baby. This is a type of immunity that develops from immunological memory. Once the body is exposed to a specific antigen, it develops antibodies against it and if next time the same antigen invades then the body already has antibodies to fight it off. Acquired immunity can occur from exposure to an infection, wherein a person gets a disease and develops immunity as a result. Acquired immunity also occurs from vaccination wherein the vaccine mimics a particular disease. Several factors like stress, age, body composition or our lifestyle can affect our immune system which in turn can affect our immunity. The immune system is influenced by the sleep wake cycles. While we are sleeping we have decreased levels of stress hormone cortisol which can suppress the immune system. Getting adequate amount of rest every day is important in order to minimize the stress levels. Also, it can help increase signals that activate the immune system. When we're stressed, the body produces stress hormone corticosteroid or cortisol which decreases the body's ability to fight against infections making us more susceptible. Too much of stress can also lead to binge-eating on unhealthy snacks or consumption of alcohol which can lead to nutritional deficiencies and weaken our immunity. Immune system's capacity declines we grow older, especially above 70 years of age. This is due to decrease in the production & functioning of T-cells due to degeneration of the thymus gland in the body. Following a healthy diet and regular physical activity can result in a better immune function. Eating a balanced diet on a regular basis provides proper nourishment to the body and also prevents any deficiencies which may hinder the immune response. Exercising regularly also supports the immune system by increasing the number of fighter cells in the body. Certain medications for autoimmune disorders, cancer, HIV or disorders with chronic inflammation like asthma, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis etc can limit the immune response and weaken the body's ability to fight against infections. Too much or too little body fat can lead to suppression of the immune system. This is because excess weight gain can put you at the risk of developing health issues conditions like type 2 diabetes, hypertension & heart disease which can lead to a decrease in the body's ability to fight against infections due to a weak immune response. Cleanliness and following basic hygiene in simple daily habits is crucial as it helps in minimizing the chances of infections. When your immune system doesn't work the way it should, it is called an immune system disorder. This includes: A high functioning immune system is the key to staying healthy.

Engaging in regular, moderate exercise may reduce inflammation and help your immune cells regenerate regularly. Daily exercising releases endorphins which help to reduce the effects of cortisol hormone which is releases due to stress. Added sugars contribute significantly to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, all of which can suppress your immune system. Lowering your sugar intake may decrease inflammation and your risk of these conditions. Nicotine and alcohol are two of the leading causes of severe ailments and can even result in organ failure and/or death in extreme cases. But the good thing is that the body can still bounce if these habits are either quit or done in complete moderation.
