These are the recommendations: Global update on poliomyelitis eradication and poliovirus containment Global progress on poliomyelitis eradication, and updates on research activities to maximize the impact of eradication and long -term risk management in the post -eradication era. 1. CAG expressed their concern on the continued use of mOPV2 for VDPV2 events and outbreaks which has now been shown to cause the emergence of other VDPV2 especially in areas with suboptimal vaccine coverage. The CAG recommends that more conserved approach be given by the mOPV2 Advisory Group when making decisions for its deployment. When approved to be deployed, it is also recommended by CAG, that the documentation to the country, including the EPI fo cal point, NPCC or equivalent, NAC and the NCC include the guidance for the removal, handling and disposal of unused mOPV2. Global progress on containment implementation and issues or decisions relevant to CAG from rec ently concluded meetings (e.g., 18th GCC, 2nd meeting between GCC -CWG and NACs, etc) 1. The CAG commends the CWG on the critical work of the review of CCS application and noted that as facilities are not in full compliance with GAPII I yet, there will be numerous issues where the acceptability of alternative measures being put in place will require some guidance. The CAG, in its TORs, has been mandated to perform this function and is ready to assist as needed. The Fourth Meeting of the CAG will be an opportuni ty to determine and roll- out the operational aspects of this collaboration. This would also entail a coordinated effort from both the CAG and CWG secretariat. Secondary (population immunity) and tertiary (facility location and environmental controls) safeguards requirements in GAPIII Tertiary safeguards (definition, purpose, intent and ownership). Water, sanitation and hygiene controls to support GAPIII tertiary safeguards implementation 1. The CAG commends the secretariat for reaching out to the WSH unit at WHO and urges the secretariat to continue to collaborate with WSH to develop clear guidance on the acceptable alternative measures of compliance with tertiary safeguards, including clear definitions, expectations and standar dized documentation/evidence expected from NACs for this requirement in the certification application process. Although likely to be challenging to implement from a containment perspective, the secretariat is urged to continue collaboration with the WSH un it in considering piloting the implementation of the WHO Sanitation safety planning in some PEF- hosting countries to determine its feasibility and appropriateness, 2. Considering the purpose of secondary (population immunity) and tertiary safeguards (facility and environment controls) which is to minimize the consequences of a release of poliovirus, the possibility of an alternative approach i.e., the use of a risk -based approach rather than a prescriptive approach that takes into consideration the basic (R 0) or effective (R) reproductive rate of poliovirus in an area which depends on factors such as population density and movements, sanitation and hygiene conditions (population, environment, sewage systems and treatment), population immunity, susceptible per sons, etc) should also be explored. Page 7 of 47 3. Although not limited to this issue alone, there is a need to develop clear risk -based guidance, dialogues or discussions between NACs and PEFs on the potential failures of primary containment (hazard e.g., facility -associated release of poliovirus through untreated effluent, risk e.g., exposure to community, likely consequences e.g., re -establishment of transmission and expected responses ). The guidance should include recommendations to mitigate risk that provide barriers to limit the consequences of the release (e.g., population immunity or secondary safeguards) or those that limit the re- establishment of WPV transmission (facility location and associated environmental controls or tertiary safeguards). The guidance may also include clear concise, one- page descriptions of the safeguard and its components that can be used both as reference and communication tool (see Annex 4 for an example). Implementing the revised secondary safeguard requirements 1. CAG has noted the conc erns raised and will consider options for requesting the SAGE Polio Working Group to consider additional flexibility in assessment criteria for secondary safeguards. 2. Similarly, t he possibility of an alternative approach i.e., the use of a risk -based appro ach rather than a prescriptive approach that takes into consideration the basic (R 0) or effective (R) reproductive rate of poliovirus in an area which depends on factors such as population density and movements, sanitation and hygiene conditions (populatio n, environment, sewage systems and treatment), population immunity, susceptible persons, etc) should also be explored. Issue associated with the 'Guidance to minimize risks for facilities collecting, handling or storing materials potentially infectious fo r polioviruses' Harmonizing containment requirements for all poliovirus potentially infectious materials 1. The PIM guidance should not be modified at this stage, but further evidence should be sought on the challenges faced by non -polio laboratories plan ning to retain WPV/VDPV PIM or from their national containment focal points including NACs on the number of potential facilities that would fall under this category. Issues associated with the implementation of facility physical requirements in GAPIII Alternative measures for walk -through exit shower 1. CAG considered the need for controlled exit from the containment perimeter via a walk -through exit shower during the First CAG TC on Showers (25 January 2018) and recommended not to further change the recommendations from the said TC 1 until more information and evidence was made available. In 1 Subelement 12.3.1 (g) of Annex 2 and 3 of GAPIII: Controlled exit from the containment perimeter is via a walk -through exit shower. Showering out is mandatory except for facilities employing closed systems demonstrating validated primary containment. Such systems may include contained lines for use in vaccine production and/or facilities employing fully functional Class III BSCs or similar isolators. For such facilities, showering out is required as a precautionary measure, in the event of an uncontrolled breach of the primary containment equipment, during the period when further assessment of the effectiveness of showerin g is being undertaken. Additional recommendations: For other facilities, the requirement for mandatory showering should be left to the discretion of the National Authority, after review of a risk assessment submitted by the PEF. Risk mitigation measures will be proposed by the PEF and approved by the National Authority for the interim period of at least two years during which evidence for -or-against -mandatory showering out will be generated. The CAG urged the secretariat to commission a study to collect inf ormation on the use, effectiveness and risks associated with showering, including in facilities where showering is currently being used. The CAG will undertake further discussion on showers when the secretariat has collected the information necessary to ma ke an evidence- based recommendation or has shown that it is not feasible to collect such information. Page 8 of 47 line with this, the compliance with routine showering -out is left up to the discretion of the NACs following the submission of a detailed risk assessment with risk mitigation steps by the PEF for consideration and approval by the NAC. 2. CAG acknowledges the value of the proposed concept note 'Concept and design of evidence- based efficacy study of showering as protective measure to prevent facility associated release of poliovirus' and urges the secretariat to facilitate the submission of a proposal with funding and other requirements for CAG's review as soon as possible. Effluent decontamination 1. CAG recommends that the requirement for facilities handling WPV2 and/or O PV2/Sabin2 in Phase II as well as OPV/Sabin poliovirus materials in Phase III to follow the requirements for effluent decontamination as applicable for final containment of all WPV in Phase III be raised at the next CAG meeting. Poliovirus -dedicated facility 1. CAG's previous recommendation on the issue of non -dedicated poliovirus facilities is not changed2. However, CAG urges the secretariat to reach out to the submitting NAC to gather additional information on this request in time for the next CAG meeting . Dedicated ventilation system 1. CAG recognises that use of supply -side HEPA filters directly on the containment barrier in the absence of interconnections (supply connections to other spaces or return exhaust from other spaces) between the supply -side HE PA filter and the exhaust -side, if correctly maintained and routinely tested, are functionally equivalent to providing a dedicated heating, ventilation and air -conditioning (HVAC) system. While this meets the intent of being dedicated, the other requiremen ts must also be in place e.g., airflow is controlled to maintain supply -to-exhaust unidirectional flow, with all passageway for distribution or extraction of air ('ductwork') sealable for gaseous decontamination, has an exhaust -side HEPA filter and supply -side, backflow prevention e.g., damper and has detectors to monitor the unidirectional airflow , Novel poliovirus strains and innovation in polio vaccine production S-19 - Poliovirus strains \u00b1 N8S in protein 2A 1. Sufficient data has been provided to con clude the series of S19 -poliovirus strains (S19 with capsid region, P1 of wild -type and Sabin vaccine strain polioviruses of all serotypes) and the parallel series of viruses with the substitution of an asparagine by a serine at amino acid 18 in the non -structural protein 2A to allow better growth in Vero cells could be considered for use, outside of the containment requirements of Annex 2 or Annex 3 of GAPIII, as applicable for IPV production, rat neutralization IPV 2 Subelement 12.3.1 (c) of Annex 2 and 3 as it appears in the current version of GAPIII is recommended to remain as is i.e., 'Poliovirus facilities are either poliovirus dedicated or used on a campaign basis with documented effective decontamination procedures between periods of work with agents other than poliovirus'. However, to facilitate its implementation, the use of non -dedicated facilities (e.g. QC laboratories) may be permissible under a CP/ICC during poliovirus type 2 containment phase of GAPIII in association with CCS. In such instances, risk assessments must be provided to demonstrate that the risk of breach of containment, cross -contamination, un authorized access to materials and other factors have been fully evaluated and addressed. All non -poliovirus related practices and personnel within the containment perimeter shall also adhere to all GAPIII requirements and be included in the scope of GAPIII audits and certification activities. Page 9 of 47 potency assays, human serum neutralization test for poliovirus antibody determination and potency testing for immunoglobulin (human) lot control and release. nOPV2 1. The production of nOPV2 and quality control using the candidate vaccine strains (S2/cre5/S15domV/rec1/hifi3 and S2/S15domV/CpG40) may occur outside the containment requirements of GAPIII but should always be in line with prevailing biorisk management institutional practices, national legislations, international standards, etc. CAG may review this decision on receipt of data on virus transmission and environmental behaviour from clinical trials currently underway. While the handling of stool samples from nOPV2 vaccine recipients is not subject to the containment requirements of GAPIII, the implementation of some form of institutional, national or international biorisk management standard or good laboratory practices is appropriate. Neuro -attenuated recombinant poliovirus ; live internal of human rhinovirus type 2 (PVSRIPO ) 1. CAG approves the use of PVSRIPO in Phase II clinical trials but requests more information be provided to CAG on the occupational risk associated with exposure o f operators during the production phase of PVSRIPO and the mitigation and public health safeguards put in place to protect production workers and the wider community. CAG's mandate and collaboration Applicable CAG recommendations that constitute amendments/revision of GAPIII, endorsement and publication and CAG's mandate of GA PIII 1. CAG welcomes the endorsement of the Polio SAGE Working Group of the transfer of the oversight function for issues related to containment and containment documents e.g., GAPIII, GAPIII -CCS, PIM guidance, etc from Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (S AGE) on immunization to CAG. In line with that, CAG recommends that the Secretariat coordinates a detailed decision review meeting of CAG recommendations, implications of such recommendations on other requirements and to undertake the revision process of G APIII taking into consideration all applicable recommendations and to coordinate a detailed review of the draft revised GAPIII by CAG to ensure consistency of approach to all safeguards as soon as possible. The CAG also welcomes a period of public consultation for the revised GAPIII. Other Issues CAG Membership 1. On 14 December 2018, CAG member Dr Bernard FANGET informed the CAG Chair, members and secretariat his intention to resign as a member of CAG - Dr Fanget's contribution to the CAG is gratefully acknowledged. CAG Secretariat 1. The CAG took the opportunity to welcome Dr Daphne MOFFETT as the incoming Team Lead , Poliovirus Containment. This follows Dr Jacqueline CARUANA -FOURNIER who is retiring soon after many years of service. Fourth Meeting of the Containment Advisory Group 1. The CAG agreed that the Fourth Meeting of the Containment Advisory Group should take place in the next six months (mid -2019)Page 10 of 47 Note for the Record Background The Containment Advisory Group (CAG) met for the third time on 13-14 December 2018 at the Starling Hotel, Geneva, Switzerland. The meeting was attended by the following : CAG members: Professor David HEYMANN (Chair), Professor George E GRIFFIN (also CAG -ESG member) Dr Stephen MCADAM (also FANGET. Unable to attend: Mr Neil GODDEN Invited participants : Session 3: Dr Bruce GORDON and Dr Kate MEDLICOTT from the Department of Public Health, Environment al and Social Determinants of Health, WHO Headquarters, Session 5: Dr Tjeerd KIMMAN , Wageningen Bioveterinary Research Institute, Netherlands (by phone), and Session 6: Dr Andrew MACADAM , National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC). Representatives of other containment supporting groups: Dr Arlene KING , Containment Working Group of the Global Commission for the Certification of the Eradication of Poliomyelitis (GCC -CWG ) Unable to attend: Professor GCC and Dr Jeffrey PARTRIDGE , Co-Chair, Containment Management Group (CMG) The agenda and list of participants in indicated in Annex 1 and 2. Session 1: Introd uction Context, objectives and expected outcomes of the meeting The time since the certification of the eradication of wild -type poliovirus serotype 2 (WPV2) and the global synchronized switch from trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) to bivalent polio vaccine (bOPV) in April 2016, increase the importance of the implementation of inventory, destruction, preparation -for and containment - of PV2 activities as a matter of urgency . The process of designation and certification of facilities retaining polioviruses post -eradication is the r esponsibility of National Authorities for Certification (NACs) in collaboration with the Global Certification Commission for the Eradication of Poliomyelitis (GCC). Applications from facilities to be recognized as suitable candidates to become poliovirus -essential facilities (PEFs) are now being submitted by NACs to the Containment Working Group (CWG) of the GCC for endorsement. In line with the terms of reference of CAG3, several technical questions on the requirements or acceptab le alternative measures of compliance with the requirements in the Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment ( GAPIII) have been received by CAG from NACs , facilities retaining polioviruses and other containment supporting groups for guid ance. Face- to-face meetings of the CAG provide the opportunity for CAG members to review and discuss these questions and provide recommendations . As such the Third Meeting of the CAG had the following objectives: 1. Provide updates to CAG members on poliomyelitis eradication and poliovirus containment 2. Discuss and provide recommendations on the implementation of the following issues: 3 Terms of Reference of the Containment Advisory Group (CAG).

Session 2: Global update on poliomyelitis eradication and poliovirus contain ment Global progress on poliomyelitis eradication, and updates on research activities to maximize the impact of eradication and long -term risk management in the post -eradication era Roland SUTTER, Special Adviser to the Director of Polio Eradication, WHO WPV sero type 1 continues to be widespread in Pakistan and Afghanistan with an increase in the number of cases reported till date over the same period in 2017. The number of WPV1 environmental isolates from these two countries also continues to be reported . There is ongoing virus circulation in three separate transmission zones, with frequent re- introduction of the virus into areas temporarily cleared. Community - based vaccination has been expanded in southern Pakistan, and supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) are continuing in the major transmission zones but ensuring high quality immunization activities in these areas remains a challenge. It is o f concern that access to susceptible populations, particularly in Afghanistan is decreasing, with more than one million children now inaccessible to immunization services. VDPV2 outbreaks have been reported from Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Niger, and Somalia while a VDPV1 outbreak has been reported from Papua New Guinea, and VDPV3 reported in Somalia. There is growing concern over the use of monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2) used in response to VDPV2 outbreaks or events , as evidence indicate that mOPV2 use can lead to the emergence of VDPV2 in under -vaccinated populations. The main activities in poliovirus research and product development, which are key components in the acceleration of eradication and to provide options and contingencies should they be needed was outlined . A high priority of the programme is the development of 'safer' polio vaccines that are hyper -attenuated and genetically stable and could be used in place of the current mOPV 2. Two novel OPV2 (nOPV2) candidate vaccines have been developed and subjected to p hase I clinical trials under containment conditions and currently two phase 2 trials are being conducted in open populations . Other safe poliovirus strains have also been developed to replace the existing use of live poliovirus es for laboratory testing and vaccine quality control 4. 4 See also: Criteria for the evaluation of improved 'safety' of novel poliovirus strains to determine the containment requirements for their storage and handling and Report of the Teleconference of the Containment Advisory Group on nOPV2 candidate vaccines and S19 - poliovirus -reports/containment -advisory -group/ Page 12 of To mitigate the impact of IPV supply shortages , the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has recommended the use of fractional doses of IPV5. Studies have shown that, in terms of seroconver sion and antibody titres raised, two doses of intradermal IPV (1/5th of a dose) are more immunogenic than a single intramuscular IPV dose (full dose). Development of suitable devices for the delivery of intradermal doses of polio vaccine is also continuing . Global progress on containment implementation and issues or decisions relevant to CAG from recently concluded meetings (e.g., 18th GCC, 2nd meeting between GCC -CWG and NACs, etc) Daphne MOFFETT, Technical Adviser - Poliovirus Containment, WHO The World Health Assembly (WHA) resolution 71.16 (2018)6 adopted by all WHO Member States aims to accelerate progress in poliovirus containment and provides a timeline for the completion of national inventories of poliovirus materials and for the certification of f acilities retaining poliovirus materials as described in the Containment Certification Scheme (CCS). There are currently 79 facilities in 27 countries designated for the continuation of critical functions requiring the retention of needed PV2 materials. Of these 27 countries, only 24 have established N ACs and only seven applications from such facilities to be recognised as suitable candidates to become PEFs [i.e., Certificate of Participation (CP) ] have been received by the CWG. Guidance to minimize risks for facilities collecting, handling or storing materials potentially infectious for polioviruses (PIM Guidance ) was published in April 2018 along with reporting forms and other resources 7. Major challenges in the implementation of containment include meeting the GCC deadline to complete PV2 inventories one year after the publication of the PIM guidance i.e., April 2019, updating national inventories to include WPV1 and WPV3 materials and the establishment of a verification mechanism for the data collectio n process and validation of data from the inventory, destruction and preparation for the containment of poliovirus activities carried by countries8. WHO and partners, namely CDC are currently supporting the implementation of the PIM guidance in countries. Support activities include training of national poliovirus containment focal point s on the implementation of the PIM guidance, deployment of consultants to work together with the national poliovirus containment focal points to update their inventories to include poliovirus PIM materials and WPV1 and WPV3 infectious materials, development of global reporting forms, regional reporting formats and other resources. Other challenges include meeting the containment certification timelines of establishment of NACs by end -2018 and the submission of CP applications from facilities retaining polioviruses to their NACs by end -2019 as described in resolution WHA71.16. A study is underway to assess the cost implications to facilities and their governments in achieving activities and full implementation of GAPIIII and the associated CCS activities over a five- year period i.e., achieving certification for full compliance with GAPIII requirement [Certificate of Containment (CC)]. This study does not take into consideration the cost associated with maintaining the requirements nor the CCS activity cost associated with the conduct of a full scope audit every three years.

Projected costs for NACs in the implementation to certification activities can range from a few hundreds of thousands to several millions USD for a full certification cycle. Full details of the study will be made availab le sometime in the future. Session 3: Secondary (population immunity) and tertiary (facility location and environmental controls) safeguards requirements in GAPIII Issue: Tertiary safeguards (definition, purpose, intent and ownership) Sanitation and associated environmental controls to support GAPIII tertiary safeguards implementation Harpal SINGH, Technical Officer - Poliovirus Containment, WHO Bruce GORDON, Coordinator and Kate MEDLICOTT, Technical Officer, Public Health, Environment and Social Det erminants (HQ/CED/PHE), WHO Relevant GAPIII section (or other reference, as appropriate) GAPIII: Strategy, Table 1, Phase Implementation, Annex 1 (Definition), Sublement 12.3.1 of Annex 2 Other reference: CCS (Definition) and CAG TC4 report on tertiary safeguards Background of issue raised : Following a request for CAG guidance from the CWG on alternative measure of compliance with tertiary safeguards in GAPIII of a CP -applicant facility, a CAG TC4 was held in August 2018 (report from CAG TC4 is pending publication due to issues brought forward to this CAG3 meeting). Definition of t ertiary safeguard of facility location and environmental controls as described in GAPIII or GAPIII -CCS (left) and the proposed alternative measures of compliance (right) The sanitation and hygiene conditions (good personal, domestic and environmental hygiene standards and closed sewage systems with secondary or greater effluent treatment) that minimize the risk of re- establishing the circulation of highly transmissible wild poliovirus in the event of reintroduction. The country hosting the poliovirus -essential facility is responsible for the implementation of the tertiary safeguards, a prerequisite for the containment certification of facilities retaining wild poliovirus in Phase III. Area surrounding the facility has no government entity -owned sewage system. The government has no plans to do so soon Facility has its own 'open' sewage system with tertiary effluent treatment performed on campus Inactivated effluents from it s PEF will be conveyed in a 'closed' piped sewage system to its effluent treatment plant, undergo up to tertiary effluent treatment on campus before being discharged (Figure 1) If compliant, the responsibility for implementation of tertiary safeguards of f acility location will be transferred from the country to the facility Page 14 of 47 Figure 1: GAPIII tertiary safeguards of facility location requires the siting of facilities in areas with low transmission potential (R 0) for WPV i.e., in areas with closed sew age systems with a minimum of secondary treatment of effluents (A) and alternative measure of compliance with this requirement based on type and ownership of the sewage system (B ) (A) (B) * Sewage treatment levels: 1 \u00b0 (physical - settlement of su spended solids); 2 \u00b0 (biological - aerobic e.g., aeration tanks or anaerobic) and 3 \u00b0 (advanced - various types exist depending on requirements for receiving water e.g., UV, filter membranes) treatment levels. All treatment levels may include some part of the treatment process occuring in areas exposed to air e.g., aerated grit chamber, aeration tanks, aerators, etc. A recommendation from CAG TC4 was for the secretariat to explore with the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WSH) Unit at WHO to provide clarity on the present definition, purpose and intent of this requirement for deliberation at this meeting. The intent of tertiary safeguards was to require inactivation of effluent on-site (as part of facility -based primary safeguards), followed by the transfer of inactivated effluent through some form of 'closed' or 'piped' system to a government entity -owned public or community sewage treatment plant with secondary or greater effluent treatment i.e., in the event of failure of primary safeguards, untreated e ffluent from the facility would not be released into the local environment but would have to undergo sewage treatment prior to its release. There has been little attempt to engage WSH or public health engineers to provide clear definitions of the terms use d in GAPIII, which has resulted in some amb iguity resulting in challenges to providing clear guidance on risk assessment criteria and risk mitigation requirements. An overview of the WHO water, sanitation and hygiene strategy 2018 -2025 9 which sets out WHO directions within the context of SDG 6 (' Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all'), the WHO Guidelines on Sanitation and Health10 which provide s a framework for health -protecting sanitation (policy , governance, use of sanitation technologies, risk -based management , etc) and the WHO Sanitation safety planning : Manual for safe use and disposal of wastewater, greywater and excreta11 which is a risk based management tool that provides a risk -based approach to identify and m anage health risk along the sanitation chain usually performed in collaboration with multiple sector stakeholders ( health, utilities, private sector, environment , agriculture, etc). Options for future collaboration were discussed, including the training of a small number of facilities retaining polioviruses , NACs , staff sewage operators and relevant sectors in sanitation safety planning and in the piloting and auditing of safety plans . 9 WHO water, sanit ation and Available at: https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/274273/WHO -CED-PHE-WSH -18.03 -eng.pdf?ua=1 10 Available at: https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/guidelines -on-sanitation -and-health/ en/ 11 WHO Sanitation safety planning: Manual for safe use and disposal of wastewater, greywater and excreta. Available at: Closed ( 'piped ') sewers Effluent treatment plant Facility Campus Page 15 of 47 Summary of CAG discussions and conclusions Assessing sanitation effectiveness around a facility using the sanitation safet y planning tool, is highly labour intensive, but is possible. It would identify risks to the surrounding community and allow the development, implementation and monitor ing of appropriate control measures. This approach may be necessary as some of the requirements for tertiary safeguards as described in GAPIII which will be difficult to meet in some PEF - hosting countries. In addition, the use of the terms 'o nsite' and 'offsite' treatment is more consistent w ith engineering terms than 'closed' or 'open' sewage systems and in many cases 'onsite ( 'facility ') treatment may even perform better than offsite (government) treatment due to better management responsibility and oversight. CAG r ecommendation s 1. The CAG commends the secretariat for reaching out to the WSH units at WHO and urges the secretariat to continue to collaborate with WSH to develop clear guidance on the acceptable alternative measures of compliance with t ertiary safeguards, including clear definit ions, expectations and standardized documentation /evidence expected from NACs for this requirement in the certification application process. Although likely to be challenging to implement from a containment perspective, t he secretariat is urged to continue collaboration with the WSH unit in considering piloting the implementation of the WHO Sanitation safety planning in some PEF -hosting countries to determine its feasibility and appropriateness . 2. Considering the purpose of secondary (population immunity) and tertiary safeguards (facility and environment controls) is to minimize the consequences of a release of poliovirus, the possibility of an alternative approach i.e., the use of a risk -based approach rather than a prescriptive approach that takes into co nsideration the basic (R 0) or effective (R) reproductive rate of poliovirus in an area which depends on factors such as population density and movements, sanitation and hygiene conditions (population, environment, sewage systems and treatment), population immunity, susceptible persons, etc) should also be explored. 3. Although not limited to this issue alone, t here is a need to develop clear risk -based guidance , dialogues or discussions between NACs and PEFs on the potential failures of primary containment (hazard e.g., facility -associated release of poliovirus through untreated effluent, risk e.g., exposure to community, likely consequences e.g., re -establishment of transmission and expected responses. The guidance should include recommendations to mitigate risk that provide barriers to limit the consequences of the release (e.g., population immunity or secondary safeguards) or those that limit the re- establishment of WPV transmission (facility location and associated environmental controls or tertiary safegu ards). The guidance may also include clear concise, one -page descriptions of the safeguard and its components that can be used both as reference and communication tool (see Annex 4 for an example).

Available at: http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/272782/WER9323.pdf?ua=1 Page 16 of 47 Background of issue raised: To align the GAPIII and SAGE recommendations on IPV immunization schedules, SAGE at its meeting in April 2018 reviewed and endorsed the proposal to align the recommendations of the future IPV schedule for countries hosting -PEFs and SAGE recommendations on IPV immunization schedules . SAGE in April 2018 recommended : 'Countries with PEFs and currently using a single d ose of IPV are recommended to adjust their IPV schedule, coverage targets and geographical scope as soon as possible and no later than at the time of all OPV cessation, to: 1. Implement a routine immunization schedule with a minimum of 2 IPV doses (full or fr actional, standalone or in combination vaccines), with the first dose administered at 4 months and second dose at an interval of at least 4 months after the first dose. 2. Maintain high population immunity with 90% of IPV2 coverage in infants in the area surrounding the PEF defined as within a 100km commutable distance from the PEF. Maintain the GVAP target coverage (90% national coverage and 80% in every district or equivalent administrative unit with all vaccines in national programmes, unless otherwise recommended) beyond the immediate zone of 100 km from the PEF. 3. Have an outbreak plan specifying response to containment breach and conduct outbreak simulation exercises ' Summary of CAG discussions and conclusions Issues associated with this revised requirement is presented in the table below. In the event of breach in poliovirus containment, populations at risk include those at risk of exposure from an infected PEF worker (e.g., family members, community, etc) , those at risk of exposure to contaminated effluent released into the local environment (e.g., community, sewage operators, etc) and those who may be exposed following the shedding of poliovirus from an infected indiv idual into the local environment . At present, the IPV2 indicator disaggregated by age i.e., infants and the availability of coverage data of all administrative area level 2 within 100 km of the PEF is not routinely collected. The recommendation of mainta ining 90% coverage within 100 km of the PEF lacks supporting evidence and has now shown to be impractical in some instances. Appropriate alternatives to the 100 km criterion should be investigated, including active mapping of PEF workers and members of th e surrounding community, and systematic environmental and sewage monitoring programmes. With regard to the risk of transmission in a population that can be mitigated by immunization , additional guidance is needed on assessing and documenting coverage to d emonstrate that 90% threshold has been achieved. Coverage data will be required at district level (second administrative level) which can aid in the identif ication of at-risk sub -populations and be demonstrably heterogeneous. Differences in the inherent risk of transmission in different locations and circumstances makes it very difficult to develop a single standard that is equivalent for all populations. Concerns have been expressed over the quality and extent of data available and the need to validate a nd document the quality of information provided relative to the criteria. Different estimation methods are known to prod uce coverage estimates for sub -national populations that differ significantly from the national administrative data and there should be some guidance on how to validate these estimates. There may be a role for the collection and analysis of trend data. Page 17 of 47 Issues associated w ith the implementation of the revised secondary safeguard requirement Issues associated with IPV2 admin2 ('distr ict') coverage data13. 1. Data availability None of the countries -hosting PEFs reported admin2 coverage data for the second dose of IPV (IPV2). IPV2 is not routinely collected 2. Data accuracy If prox y or closest fit indicators are r eported , these are collected using the 'administrative method' which are always prone to errors 3. Age-disaggregated data Coverage data for infants is not available Other issues 4. Cross -border collaboration when geographical extent (100 km) includes p art of another country Responsibi lity to maintain population immunity requirements (IPV doses and coverage) when the 100 km extends into another country i.e., PEF- or non -PEF hosting country. Current p olio immunization policy after global OPV withdrawal (2 -doses IPV in EPI) is applicable for a minimum of 10 years only (for countries not hosting PEFs) and as long as mandated by GAPIII (for countries hosting PEFs) (Figure 2)14. 5. Management of admin2 area ( to consider part or entire admin2) when geographical extent (100 km) includes only a par t of an admin2 area Total area that falls within the 100 km commutable distance surrounding the PEF is almost always lesser than the total area of all admin2 areas that the 100 km extends into i.e., is there is a need to include the entire admin2 even if o nly a part of it falls within the 100 km commuting distance (Figure 3). 6. Interim recommendations for countries -hosting PEFs before full implementation of secondary safeguards (no later than bOPV cessation) to support the implementation of CCS A prerequis ite to the CCS is the demonstration of compliance with secondary safeguards in GAPIII i.e., a certificate of participation can only be awarded to facilities in countries that have demonstrated compliance with the required secondary and tertiary safeguards described in GAPIII. Although countries are expected to begin implementing these revised requirements as soon as feasible, SAGE recommendation provides a different timeline for countries to achieve full implementation of this prerequisite as described in t he CCS i.e., 'secondary safeguard is a pre-requisite to begin the CCS ' to 'during the time of bOPV cessation '. 13 Subnational immunization coverage data reported through the WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Form on Immunization.

The extension of the commuting distance of 100 km into only parts of a districts e.g., Districts 1, 2 and 3 implies the requirement for continous resources to maintain population immunity in the se entire district. Way forward 1. CAG has noted the concerns raised and will consider options for requesting the SAGE Polio Working Group to con sider additional flexibility in assessment criteria for secondary safeguards. 2. The possibility of an alternative approach i.e., the use of a risk -based approach rather than a prescriptive approach that takes into consideration the basic (R 0) or effective ( R) reproductive rate of poliovirus in an area which depends on factors such as population density and movements, sanitation and hygiene conditions (population, environment, sewage systems and treatment), population immunity, susceptible person s, etc should also be explored by the Secretariat. Session 4: Issue associated with the 'Guidance to minimize risks for facilities collecting, handling or storing materials potentially infectious for polioviruses ' Issue : Harmonizing containment requirements for all poliovirus potentially infectious materials (WPV/VDPV and Sabin PIM) Harpal SINGH, Technical Officer - Poliovirus Containment, WHO Relevant GAPIII section (or other reference, as appropriate) GAPIII: Annex 1 (Definition) Other reference: Guidance to mi nimize risks for facilities collecting, handling or storing materials potentially infectious for polioviruses (PIM Guidance) Summary of issues raised In its current version , GAPIII requires all materials potentially infectious for polioviruses (PIM) to be handled according to conditions described in Annex 2 (WPV /VDPV ) or Annex 3 ( Sabin/ OPV) PIM guidance does subject Sabin/ OPV PIM to Annex 3 of GAPIII but rather that a risk determination be conducted based on both the sample ty pe and nature of the work to be performed , and s pecific mitigation measures taken to minimize the risk of handling and storing such material. The PIM g uidance continues to require WPV /VDPV PIM be subjected to Annex 2 of GAPIII. A submission has been receiv ed requesting that the requirements for WPV /VDPV PIM be subjected to a risk determination process and the containment Page 19 of 47 requirements for handling and storing WPV PIM also be in line with the risk mitigation approach by risk stratification as was done for Sabin PIM as per PIM Guidance (Figure 4). Figure 4: Handling of poliovirus materials as described in GAPIII and the PIM Guidance Summary of CAG discussions and conclusions Laboratories operating in accordance with recommended biosafety standards and gu idelines (e.g., WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual, 3rd Edition; CDC/NIH Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, 5th Edition) are expected to provide effective protection to both public health and environment. It is also of concern that many non-poliovirus laboratories remain unaware of GAPIII or that the containment requirements apply to them. The last WPV2 case was reported in 1999 and there are probably only a number of laboratories housing historical collections who will always remain at a risk of release. T here are potentially a larger number of laboratories housing potentially infect ious materials, WPV1 and WPV3 i.e., samples that fall under Annex 1 (Definitions) of GAPIII that were collected at a time and place where WPV/VDPV1 or WPV3/V DPV3 was in circulation and yet are at risk but unaware of that risk. Concerns have been raised that the number of facilities handling WPV/VDPV PIM might be too many - the requirement for them to become PEFs might be too much of a burden for the country -hosting them. By definitions used in GAPIII, the hand ling and storage of WPV and VDPV infect ious and potentially infectious materials must be in line with Annex 2 of GAPIII. The current PIM g uidance is now being implemented and should not be modified withou t further strong evidence that modification is required. Further details should be sought from the submitting NAC to determine the estimated number of facilities that would be handling WPV/VDPV PIM and that would require them to become PEFs. CAG recommen dation The PIM g uidance should not be modified at this stage, but further evidence should be sought on the challenges faced by non -polio laboratories planning to retain WPV /VDPV PIM or from their national containment focal points including NACs on the num ber of potential facilities that would fall under this category.

The acceptability of alternative measures of compliance showering -out especially during the period until evidence for or against showering is being generated is left up to the NACs after review of a risk assessment submitted by PEFs . A submission was subsequently received from a NAC requesting CAG to consider the proposal of allowing either the use of a shower upon egress, or removal of an ou ter layer of PPE as an alternative. Showering out of many containment level 3 (CL3) facilities is only required in the event of a spill or contamination event. Summary of CAG discussions and conclusions The current interpretation of the First CAG TC on S howers is that the compliance with routine showering - out is left up to the discretion of the NAC. If routine showering -out is not to be implemented by the PEF , the PEF will have to provide a detailed risk assessment with risk mitigation steps for consideration and approval by the N AC. Further evidence will be collected through a study (see also next issue) regarding the need for showering -out and how these will be interpreted. The proposed study will include a risk assessment study to evaluate showering as a stand -alone or part of a regime of protective measures to prevent facility - associated release of poliovirus . CAG recommendation CAG considered the need for c ontrolled exit from the containment perimeter via a walk -through exit shower during the First C AG TC on Showers (25 January 2018) and r ecommended not to further change the recommendations from the said TC 16 until more information and evidence was made available. In line with 15 Report of the Teleconference of t he Containment Advisory Group (CAG TC1) of Annex 2 and 3 of GAPIII: Controlled exit from the containment perimeter is via a walk -through exit shower. Showering out is mandatory except for facilities employing closed systems demonstrating validated primary containment. Such systems may include contained lines for use in vaccine production and/or facilities employing fully functional Class III BSCs or similar isolators. F or such facilities, showering out is required as a precautionary measure, in the event of an uncontrolled breach of the primary containment equipment, during the period when further assessment of the effectiveness of showering is being undertaken. Additio nal recommendations: For other facilities, the requirement for mandatory showering should be left to the discretion of the National Authority, after review of a risk assessment submitted by the PEF. Risk mitigation measures will be proposed by the PEF and approved by the National Authority for the interim period of at least two years during which evidence for -or-against -mandatory showering out will be generated. Page 21 of 47 this, the compliance with routine showering -out is left up to the discretion of the NACs following the submission of a detailed risk assessment with risk mitigation steps by the PEF for consideration and approval by the NAC. Concept and design of evidence- based efficacy study of showering as protective measure to prevent facility associated release of poliovirus Tjeerd KIMMAN, Wageningen Bioveterinary Research Institute, Netherlands Relevant (or other reference, as appropriate) GAPIII: Subelement 12.3.1 of Annex 2 and 3 Other reference: CAG TC1 report on showers Summary of issues raised The CAG discussed in depth the GAPIII requirement of subelement 12.3.1 (g) of Annex 2 and 3 at the First CAG TC (CAG TC1) on Showers on 25 January 2018 and urged the secretariat to commission a study on the use, effectiveness and risks associated with showering for an evidence- based recommendation to be made or has shown that it is not feasible to collect such information. Upon request from the Secretariat, the Wageningen Bioveterinary Research Institute in the Netherlands submitted the document 'Concept and design of evidence- based efficacy study of showering as protective measure to prevent facility -associated release of poliovirus'. The proposed project will be composed of three work streams: 1. literature search 2. experimental wor k to generate quantitative data 3. risk assessment study to evaluate showering as a stand -alone or part of a regime of protective measures to prevent facility -associated release of poliovirus Summary of CAG discussions and conclusions With respect to the literature search, contributions from CAG members with experience and expertise in this are area of work would be welcome. Suggestions to include the aerosolization potential of showering in the experimental design was also provided. Although p ractical aspects of the experimental design have not yet been finalised, the proposed scope will include showering -out as an integrated component and a standalone component of protective measures to prevent facility -associated release of poliovirus . The development of a brief proposal which would detail these points is underway and would be submitted to CAG for review. CAG recommendation CAG acknowledges the value of the proposed concept note ' Concept and design of evidence- based efficacy study of showering as protective measure to prevent facility associated release of poliovirus ' and urges the secretariat to facilitate the submission of a proposal with funding and other requirements for CAG's review as soon as possible. The CAG urged the secretariat to commission a study to collect information on the use, effectiv eness and risks associated with showering, including in facilities where showering is currently being used. The CAG will undertake further discussion on showers when the secretariat has collected the information necessary to make an evidence- based recommen dation or has shown that it is not feasible to collect such information. Page 22 of 47 Effluent decontamination Harpal SINGH, T echnical Officer - Poliovirus Containment, WHO Relevant GAPIII section (or other reference, as appropriate) GAPIII: Subelement 12.3.1 of Annex 2 and 3 Other reference: CAG2 report Summary of issues raised At the Second Meeting of the CAG17, CAG recom mended the inclusion of a new requirement on effluent decontamination : 'Facilities handling WPV2 and/or OPV2/Sabin2 in Phase II as well as OPV/Sabin poliovirus materials in Phase III need to follow the requirements for effluent decontamination as applicable for final containment of all WPV in Phase III i.e., effluent decontamination is required in Phase II (PV2 containment phase) and Phase III (Final containment of all PV) of GAPIII. The current interpretation of this requirement is all facilities will requ ire decontamination of effluent and in most cases, it would be an effluent decontamination system (EDS). For those facilities that continue handling WPV and VDPV viruses and materials post -eradication (or in the containment of all poliovirus phase of GAPII I), the EDS must be dedicated to the PEF alone. In line with this, the proposed amendments to Table 1 of GAPIII recommended by CAG at the Second Meeting of the CAG are: Poliovirus type 2 containment period Final poliovirus containment period All type 2 polioviruses All OPV/Sabin polioviruses All wild Polioviruses 1\u00b0 safeguards: Prevent infection & release of contaminated materials Dedicated effluent treatment plant No3 No3 Yes 4 3 Untreated release into a closed sewage system with secondary effl uent treatment in the facility location (all waste from facilities, potentially containing live poliovirus, should be inactivated prior to release through adequate and validated inactivation procedures. In facilities without a dedicated effluent treatment plant, this would normally be done by applying heat or chemicals as part of a validated treatment process. Under no circumstances should raw poliovirus containing effluents be discharged to drains, unless the effluent treatment plant has been designed and validated to handle such effluents, effectively acting as part of the primary containment system) 4 Facility effluent treatment before release into a closed sewage system with secondary or greater effluent treatment in the facility location. EDS are used to treat large amounts of biologically contaminated liquid effluents from containment facilities i.e., large scale production plants, animal holding facilities and research laboratories. Biologically contaminated effluents originate typically from sinks, showers, autoclave chambers and floor drains. The EDS when used must ensure inactivation of all viable micro -organisms including survival structures (e.g., spores) and in that respect the process must be validated by microbial challenge testing 18. 17 Second meeting of the Containment Advisory Group, 28 -30 November 2017, Geneva, Switzerland.

Available at: https://www.biosafety.be/sites/default/files/2012_effluentdeconsystems_sb b_2505_58.pdf Page 23 of 47 However , this recommendation is not an amendment to an existing GAPIII requirement but is considered an additional requirement. There have been calls for GAPIII amendments or revision to be subjected to a period of public consultation prior to finalization and pu blication . Summary of CAG discussions and conclusions CAG members expressed the need for a more systematic approach to making recommendations that includes a review of primary, secondary and tertiary safeguards to provide clear guidance to NACs on assess ment of facility -associated risk of release of polioviruses of P EFs and the C WG with technical guidance on assessing submissions from NACs following review of documentation submitted by PEFs. CAG recommendation CAG recommends that the requirement for f acilities handling WPV2 and/or OPV2/Sabin2 in Phase II as well as OPV/Sabin poliovirus materials in Phase III to follow the requirements for effluent decontamination as applicable for final containment of all WPV in Phase III be raised at the next CAG meeti ng. Poliovirus -dedicated facilities Harpal SINGH, Technical Officer - Poliovirus Containment, WHO Relevant GAPIII section (or other reference, as appropriate) GAPIII: Subelement 12.3.1 of Annex 2 and 3 Other reference: CAG1 and CAG2 report Summary of issues raised GAPIII requires that polio virus materials be handled in a polio virus -dedicated facility but makes no distinction between facilities handling high titre or volumes (e.g. , vaccine production facilities) and those handling low titre or volum es (e.g. diagnostic, research and QA/QC laboratories). A request has been received that the requirement be dependent on the scale and use of poliovirus materials and to recognize the distinction between laboratory scale (diagnostic, QC/QA) work and product ion scale risk mitigation i.e., a t laboratory scale, where all materials, equipment and waste are treated as though they contain poliovirus and are all subject to GAPIII requirements , a dedicated facility may not be required. Summary of CAG discussions and conclusions To facilitate the implementation of this requirement, CAG previously recommended 19,20 that t he use of non - dedicated facilities (e.g. QC laboratories) may be permissible under a CP/ICC during Phase II of GAPIII in association with CCS. In such instances, risk assessments must be provided to demonstrate that the risk of breach of containment, cross -contamination, unauthorized access to materials and other factors have been fully evaluated and addressed. All non -poliovirus related practices and p ersonnel within the containment perimeter shall also adhere to all GAPIII requirements and be included in the scope of GAPIII audits and certification activities . This submission requests that an extension of this requirement is made to include diagnostic laboratories. However, relaxation of this requirements would extend to any laboratory (e.g., research, academic, etc) in which while titre and volume of materials are considered lower, the number of manipulations are considered 19 First meeting of the Containment Advisory Group, 19-20 June 2017, Geneva, Switzerland.

Further explanation from the submitting NAC is therefore needed to understand the exact nature of the request. CAG recommendation CAG's previous recommendation on th e issue of non -dedicated poliovirus facilities is not changed 21. However, CAG u rges the secretariat to reach out to the submitting NAC to gather additional information on this request in time for the next CAG meeting. Dedicated ventilation systems Harpal SINGH, Technical Officer - Poliovirus Containment, WHO Relevant GAPIII sectio n (or other reference, as appropriate) GAPIII: Subelement 12.3.1 of Annex 2 and 3 Other reference: CAG2 report Summary of issues raised According to GAPIII 22, ventilation systems must be dedicated to the area defining the containment perimeter and sho uld not be shared or serve areas that are not dedicated to the work with polioviruses. The dedicated ventilation system includes all supply and exhaust side systems including those serving primary containment devices e.g., biosafety cabinets, isolators and local exhaust system, where appropriate. In other words, there are no interconnected parts between the supply and exhaust -side system i.e., not interconnected with any other exhaust or return and does not extend beyond the containment perimeter. The CAG previously commented that a facility that works with polioviruses must have its own dedicated air - handling fans, and these cannot be shared with spaces not dedicated to poliovirus work, even if ductwork , exhaust -side HEPA filters or oth er backflow protect ion devices are provided. However, a supply -side terminal HEPA filters placed at the containment barrier meet s the intent of this requirement from a performance perspective i.e., no interconnections from supply to exhaust (Figure 4A). A request has been submitted on the use of supply -side terminal HEPA filter s that are placed directly on the containment barrier which effectively work to isolate the ventilation system , ensur ing no facility -associated poliovirus release occurs by ductwork or ventilation s ystem . 21 Subelement 12.3.1 (c) of Annex 2 and 3 as it appears in the current version of GAPIII is recommended to remain as is i.e., 'Poliovirus facilities are either poliovirus dedicated or used on a campaign basis with documented effective decontamination procedures between periods of work with agents other than poliovirus'. However, to facilitate its implementation, the use of non -dedicated facilities (e.g. QC laboratories) may be permissible under a CP/ICC during poliovirus type 2 containment phase of GAPIII in association with CCS. In such instances, risk assessments must be provided to demonstrate that the risk of breach of cont ainment, cross -contamination, unauthorized access to materials and other factors have been fully evaluated and addressed. All non -poliovirus related practices and personnel within the containment perimeter shall also adhere to all GAPIII requirements and b e included in the scope of GAPIII audits and certification activities. 22 Subelement 12.3.1 (h) of Annex 2 and 3 of GAPIII 'the controlled air system maintains directional airflow via a dedicated ventilation system with ductwork sealable for gaseous decont amination, HEPA filtration on exhaust, backflow protection on supply, and monitors/alarms to ensure directional airflow can be readily validated' Page 25 of 47 Summary of CAG discussions and conclusions The absence of any interconnections to other laboratory suites or spaces between the supply side and exhaust side of the ventilation system of the containment perimeter is defined as being 'poliovirus dedicated'. In addition, t he airflow is controlled to maintain supply -to-exhaust unidirectional flow , with all passageway for distribution or extraction of air ('ductwork') sealable for gaseous decontamination, has an exhaust -side HEPA filter and supply -side, backflow prevention e.g., damper and has detectors to monitor the unidirectional airflow. The placement of a s upply -side terminal HEPA filter on the containment barrier would functionally isolate the ventilation system thus still making it functionally equivalent to a PEF- dedicated ventilation system and is acceptable (Figure 5). Concerns were raised, however, over the risks associated with HEPA filter failure, r equirement for routine maintenance, testing and validation of these filters. A risk assessm ent should be made for HEPA filter failure, both on the supply - and exhaust -side. Figure 5 : Functional and validated backdraft protection provided by a supply side - and exhaust side -HEPA filter s that may also provide biocontainment protectio n (A), shared supply air system with d edicated exhaust air system - terminal HEPA filter housings effectively isolating the ventilation system (B) and supply terminal HEPA filters on the containment barrier provides a second level of protection against normal operations conducted biological safety cabinet with exhaust -side HEPA filter provided by ( *) e.g., Class II, Type B2 Biosafety Cabinet . In all three examples, the supply -side HEPA filter is placed on the containment barrier. These examples are consider ed equivalent to the Subelement 12.3.1 (h) of Annex 2 and 3 of GAPIII mentioned above. (Graphics courtesy of Mr Kenneth Ugwu, CAG Member) A C B Page 26 of 47 CAG recommendation CAG recognises that use of su pply-side HEPA filters directly on the containment barrier in the absence of interconnections (supply connections to other spaces or return exhaust from other spaces) between the supply-side HEPA filter and the exhaust -side, if correctly maintained and routinely tested, are functionally equivalent to providing a dedicat ed heating, ventilation and air -conditioning (HVAC) system . While this meets the intent of being dedicated, the other requirements must also be in place e.g., airflow is controlled to maintain supply -to-exhaust unidirectional flow, with all passageway for distribution or extraction of air ('ductwork') sealable for gaseous decontamination, has an exhaust -side HEPA filter and supply -side, backflow prevention e.g., damper and has detectors to monitor unidirectional airflow .

These highly attenuated, genetically stable viruses have been developed as alternatives to the use of live viruses in laboratory testing and fo r IPV production. V iruses based on S19 were initially constructed to includ e the N18S substitution (substitution of asparagine by serine at amino acid no. 18 of protein 2A ) that allow s better growth in Vero cells , but this substitution is not necessary for growth in other common cell lines . Thus, strains without the N18S substitution have also been produced. The CAG previously concluded that the S19 -poliovirus type 2 strain can be use outside of GAPII I containment23 based on the 'c riteria for the evaluation of improved 'safety' of novel poliovirus strains to determine the containment requirements for their storage and handling ' as developed by CAG24. A request was submitted to extend this recommendation, subject to review of available data, to all Wild - and Sabin vaccine virus - serotypes 1 to 3, with or without the N18S substitution (Table below and Figure 6 ) for IPV production, rat neutralization IPV potency assays, human serum neutralization test for poliovirus antibody determination and potency testing for immunoglobulin (human) lot control and release. 23 Teleconference of the Containment Advisory Group (CAG TC3) on nOPV2 candidate vaccines and S19 - poliovirus type 2 strains, 7 June 2018.

The level of replicative fitness (considered a proxy for infectiousness) is important for the novel oral polio vaccines' candidate strains (S2/cre5/S15domV/rec1/hifi3 and S2/S15domV/CpG40) but at present data generated will need to be reviewed as it becomes available. There is relatively little information yet available on transmissibility of the vaccine viruses - a proxy of which is 'duration and amount of shedding ' and the behaviour of these novel vaccine viruses in the environment . The CAG previously concluded that the h andling of nOPV2 candidate vaccines can occur outside the containment requirements of GAPIII for clinical trials, stockpile and for outbreak response25. Two clinical 25 Teleconference of the Containment Advisory Group (CAG TC3) on nOPV2 candidate vaccines and S19 - poliovirus type 2 strains, 7 June 2018. Available at: http://polioeradication.org/wp - content/uploads/2017/08/CAG -TC3-20180630 -EN.pdf and Addendum to the Report of the Teleconference of the Containment Advisory Group (CAG TC3) on nOPV2 candidate vaccines and S19 - poliovirus type 2 Page 28 of 47 phase II trials are currently underway involving adolescents and adults and children and infants under deliberate release procedure. A related request was received by the ESG to determine the containment requirements for the p roduction of nOPV2 and for quality control testing using the candidate vaccines' strains (S2/cre5/S15domV/rec1/hifi3 and S2/S15domV/CpG40) (Figure 7). A related request was received for guidance on the containment requirements when handling stool samples taken from nOPV2 vaccine recipients during the ongoing phase II clinical trials. Figure 7 : nOPV2 Candidate 1 or S2/cre5/S15domV/rec1/hifi3 (A) and nOPV2 Candidate2 or S2/S15domV/CpG40 (B), both of which are based on a series of modifications that have been made to a Sabin vaccine virus serotype 2 PVSRIPO is a type 1 live- attenuated (Sabin) poliovirus vaccine containing an internal ribosomal rhinovirus IRES c himeras i.e., PVSRIPO is under investigation for use in cancer immunotherapy in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. A request for guidance from CAG is sought on the containment requirement of PVSRIPO to be evaluated for use in a multi- institutional phase- 2 clinical trial against GBM . Clinical trials in children with recurrent high- grade malignant glioma; adults with nonresectable malignant melanoma; and triple- negative breast cancer are currently open, with multiple new trials in preparation. In most of thes e trials, it is assumed that trial subjects will be provided strains, 14 December 2018.

Summary of CAG discussions and conclusions Once validated and readily made av ailable, t he S19 strain is seen as one strategy to reduce the number of facilities intending to become PEFs e.g., PEFs performing only serology work or QC requiring the use of live poliovirus may substitute the use of live virus with S -19 strains. The S -19 strains have been demonstrated to be highly attenuated, genetically stable and immunogenic in animal models. There is no evidence that the S19- poliovirus serotypes 1 or 3 type 1 and 3 strains, with or without the N18S substitution, pose any greater risk than S19 - poliovirus serotype 2 which have met the criteria for handling outside the containment requirements of GAPIII. Efforts should now be made to complete the validation of the use of these strains in assays otherwise requiring the use of live virus, to increase the availability of these strains so as to encourage its use over live virus . A seed -lot system for distribution of these strains are currently proposed, with deep -sequencing of seed -strains used to validate stocks and monitor for potential genetic reversion. Clinical trials with nOPV 2 strains have already taken place and trials ou tside of containment were already planned before CAG was requested for guidan ce. Similarly, there was little if any discussions with CAG on the containment requirements to produce nOPV2 that is ongoing in one vaccine producer. The CAG would like to commend the parties submitting this request for the thorough, detailed, complete and evidence -based responses using the submission template. Data on attenuation, genetic stability and shedding have been provide that indicate the risks to persons other than patients receiving treatment with PVSRIPO are very low. However, little information was provided on the current and future production aspects of PVSRIPO and concerns that might be to p roduction workers. Additional discussion on t he prevention of coinfection and potential recombination would be welcomed. CAG recommendation s Sufficient data has been provided to conclude the series of S19 -poliovirus strains (S19 with cap sid region, P1 of wild -type and Sabin vaccine strain polioviruses of all serotypes) and the parallel series of viruses with the substitution of an asparagine by a serine at amino acid 18 in the non -structural protein 2A to allow better growth in Vero cells (Table below) could be considered for use, outside of the containment requirements of Annex 2 or Annex 3 of GAPIII, as applicable for IPV production, rat neutralization IPV potency assays, human serum neutralization test for poliovirus antibody determinat ion and potency testing for immunoglobulin (human) lot control and release. The production of nOPV2 and quality control using the candidate vaccine strains (S2/cre5/S15domV/rec1/hifi3 and S2/S15domV/CpG40) may occur outside the containment requirements of GAPIII but should always be in line with prevailing biorisk management institutional practices, national legislations, international standards, etc. CAG may review this decision on receipt of data on virus transmission and environmental behaviour from cli nical trials currently underway. While t he handling o f stool samples from nOP V2 vaccine recipients is not subject to the containment requirements of GAPIII, the implementation of some form of institutional, national or international biorisk management stan dard or good laboratory practices is appropriate. CAG approves the use of PVSRIPO in Phase II clinical trials but requests more information on the risk associated with production and the mitigation and public health safeguards put in place to protect prod uction workers and the wider community. Page 30 of 47 Session 7: CAG's mandate and collaboration Issue: Applicable CAG recommendations that constitute amendments/revision of GAPIII, endorsement and publication and CAG's mandate of GAPIII Daphne MOFFETT, Technical A dviser - Poliovirus Containment, WHO Harpal SINGH, Technical Officer - Poliovirus Containment, WHO The list of applicable CAG recommendations that constitute amendments to GAPIII also makes the revision process of GAPIII timely. The oversight body for iss ues related to containment and containment documents e.g., GAPIII, GAPIII- CCS, PIM guidance, etc has been the function of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunization. The CAG, established in early 2017 , is better placed to perform this r ole since it functions as an advisory body to the D irector -General of WHO to make recommendations on technical issues related to the implementation of GAPIII and other issues related to containment. In October 2018, the Polio SAGE Working Group endorsed the transfer of this function to CAG thus providing CAG with the mandate on all issues associated with GAPIII (amendments, revision, endorsement, etc). CAG recommendation: CAG recommends that the Secretariat coordinates a detailed decision review meeting of CAG recommendations, implications of such recommendations on other requirements and to undertakes the revision process of GAPIII taking into consideration all applicable recommendations and to coordinate a detailed review of the draft revised GAPIII by CAG to ensure consistency of approach to all safeguards as soon as possible. The CAG also welcomes a period of public consultation for the revised GAPIII. Other Issues CAG Membership On 14 December 2018, CAG member Dr Bernard FANGET informed the CAG Ch air, members and secretariat his intention to resign as a member of CAG - Dr Fanget's contribution to the CAG is gratefully acknowledged. CAG Secretariat The CAG took the opportunity to welcome Dr Daphne MOFFETT as the incoming Team Lead for the Poliovir us Containment. This follows Dr Jacqueline CARUANA -FOURNIER who is retiring in a few weeks from the organization after many years of service. Dr Moffett has over 20 years of public health experience and holds the rank of Captain in the United States Publi c Health Service (USPHS). Prior to joining WHO, she was the CDC Central Asia Regional Director with leadership and oversight of CDC programs in Kazakhstan Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. Dr Moffett is approachable, friendly and most especially she spends time listening.
