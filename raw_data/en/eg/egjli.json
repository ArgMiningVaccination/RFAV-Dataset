GENERIC NAME: HAEMOPHILUS B/HEPATITIS B | [Storage](#Storage) [USES: This medication is used in infants to help prevent infection from a certain bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae type b) and the ] [hepatitis B](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_b/article.htm) virus. Haemophilus influenzae b bacteria can cause a serious, sometimes fatal brain infection ( [meningitis](https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalitis_and_meningitis/{1}.htm)) and lung infection ( [pneumonia](https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm)). [Hepatitis B](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_b_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm) infection cause serious problems persistent [hepatitis B](https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/hepatitis_b_picture/picture.htm) infection, [cirrhosis](https://www.medicinenet.com/cirrhosis/article.htm), and [liver cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_cancer_hepatocellular_carcinoma/article.htm). Protecting against these infections can prevent these problems.This [vaccine](https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm) contains killed Haemophilus bacteria and a man-made piece of the [hepatitis](https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_hepatitis/article.htm) B virus. It does not contain live virus, so your infant cannot get either of these infections from the vaccine. This vaccine causes the body to make immune defensive substances (antibodies) that can protect you from these infections.This vaccine is recommended for all infants 6 weeks to 15 months old who are born to mothers who do not have current [hepatitis](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) B infection.This vaccine is not for use in adults. [HOW TO USE: Read the Vaccine Information Statement available from your health care provider before receiving the vaccine. If you have any questions, consult your health care provider.This vaccine is usually given by injection into a muscle by a health care professional.A series of 3 injections is usually used when the infant is aged 2 months, 4 months, and 12 to 15 months. Your doctor will give you a vaccination schedule, which must be followed closely for best effectiveness. If your infant has an infection with ] [fever](https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm) at the time a vaccination is scheduled, your doctor may choose to delay the injection until he/she is better.If your infant is exposed to hepatitis B at birth, a different vaccine and other treatments should be used. Consult your doctor for more information.

If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your infant's doctor or pharmacist promptly.Infrequently, temporary symptoms such as [fainting](https://www.medicinenet.com/fainting/article.htm)/ [dizziness](https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm)/ [lightheadedness](https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm), vision changes, numbness/tingling, or [seizure](https://www.medicinenet.com/seizure/article.htm)-like movements have happened after vaccine injections. Tell your health care provider right away if your child has any of these symptoms soon after receiving an injection. Sitting or lying down may relieve symptoms.Remember that your child's doctor has prescribed this medication because he or she has judged that the benefit to your infant is greater than the risk of side effects.

Learn about types, symptoms, and treatment. - Pneumonia Pneumonia is inflammation of the lungs caused by fungi, bacteria, or viruses. Symptoms and signs include cough, fever, shortness of breath, and chills. Antibiotics treat pneumonia, and the choice of the antibiotic depends upon the cause of the infection. - Bile Duct Cancer (Cholangiocarcinoma) Bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) is a rare type of cancer that arises from cells that line the drainage system from the liver and gallbladder to the intestine. Symptoms and signs of bile duct cancer include jaundice, itching, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Physical examination, specialized blood tests, and imaging tests may be used to diagnose bile duct cancer. Treatment for bile duct cancer may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and photodynamic therapy. Bile duct cancer typically has a poor prognosis. Preventing liver damage may decrease the risk of developing bile duct cancer. - Is Hepatitis B Contagious? Hepatitis B is a type of liver infection. Hepatitis B is spread through person-to-person contact or through personal items like razors, toothbrushes, etc. Symptoms of hepatitis B include fever, yellowish skin (jaundice), dark urine, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. There is no drug to cure hepatitis B; however, there is a hepatitis B vaccine available. - Hepatitis B (HBV, Hep B) The hepatitis B virus (HBV, hep B) is a unique, coated DNA virus belonging to the Hepadnaviridae family of viruses. The course of the virus is determined primarily by the age at which the infection is acquired and the interaction between the virus and the body's immune system. Successful treatment is associated with a reduction in liver injury and fibrosis (scarring), a decreased likelihood of developing cirrhosis and its complications, including liver cancer, and a prolonged survival. - What Does it Mean If You Have Urobilinogen in Your Urine? Urobilinogen is a substance that is produced when bilirubin, a waste product produced by the breakdown of red blood cells, is processed in the liver and released into the intestine. Excess urobilinogen in urine may indicate liver diseases, such as viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver damage. It is caused by drugs, toxic substances, or conditions associated with increased red blood cell destruction (hemolytic anemia). In a person with low urine urobilinogen and/or signs of liver dysfunction, it can be indicative of hepatic or biliary obstruction. - Hepatitis Vaccines for Hepatitis B and C Hepatitis is a family of viruses that infect the liver. There are vaccines for hepatitis A and B infections, but not for hepatitis C.
