Our approach to health care Case management The case management program seeks to empower UnitedHealthcare Community Plan members enrolled in Medicaid, care providers and our community partners to improve care coordination and elevate outcomes. Targeting UnitedHealthcare Community Plan members with chronic complex conditions who often use health care, the program helps address their needs holistically. Case management examines medical, behavioral and social/environmental concerns to help members get the right care from the right care provider in the right place and at the right time. The program provides interventions to members with complex medical, behavioral, social, pharmacy and specialty needs, resulting in better quality of life, improved access to health care and reduced expenses. Case management provides a case management team to help increase member engagement, offer resources to fill gaps in care and develop personalized health goals using evidence-based clinical guidelines. This approach is essential to improving the health and well-being of the individuals, families and communities UnitedHealthcare Community Plan serves. Case management provides: Market-specific case management encompassing medical, behavioral and social care. An extended care team including primary care provider (PCP), pharmacist, medical and behavioral director, and peer specialist. Options that engage members, connecting them to needed resources, care and services. Individualized and multidisciplinary care plans. Assistance with appointments with PCP and coordinating appointments. Education and support with complex conditions. Tools for helping members engage with providers, such as appointment reminders and help with transportation. Foundation to build trust and relationships with hard- to-engage members. The case management program goals are to: Lower avoidable admissions and unnecessary emergency room (ER) visits, measured outcomes by inpatient (IP) admission and ER rates. Improve access to PCP and other needed services, measured by number of PCP visit rates within identified time frames. Identify and discuss behavioral health (BH) needs, measured by number of BH care provider visits within identified time frames. Improve access to pharmacy. Identify and remove social and environmental barriers to care. Improve health outcomes, measured by improved Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS\u00ae) and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Star Ratings metrics. Empower the member to manage their complex/ chronic illness or problem and care transitions. Improve coordination of care through dedicated staff resources and to meet unique needs. Engage community care and care provider networks to help ensure access to affordable care and the appropriate use of services.Chapter 1: Introduction 6 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Nebraska v65.11.2022 \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcareTo refer your patient who is a UnitedHealthcare Community Plan member to Case Management, call Member Services at 800-641-1902, TTY 711. You may also call Provider Services at 866-331-2243. Compliance The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates National Provider Identifier (NPI) usage in all standard transactions (claims, eligibility, remittance advice, claims status request/response, and authorization request/response) for all health care providers who handle business electronically. You must have and use the NPI number registered with DHHS (billing and rendering) to be reimbursed for services provided to UnitedHealthcare Community Plan members. Each claim must include the billing and rendering NPI number, along with other fields such as billing taxonomy code and the office nine digit zip code registered with DHHS. Because the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services uses the above data, it is important that this data combination is the same data combination used in the provider registration process for a DHHS Provider Identification Number. Cultural resources To help you meet membership needs, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan has developed a Cultural Competency Program. Linguistic and cultural barriers can negatively affect access to health care participation. You must support UnitedHealthcare Community Plan's Cultural Competency Program. For Cultural Competency training visit UHCprovider.com > Resources > Resource Library > Patient Health and Safety > Cultural Competency . UnitedHealthcare Community Plan offers the following support services: Materials for limited English-speaking members: We provide simplified materials for members with limited English proficiency and who speak languages other than English or Spanish. We also provide materials for visually impaired members. For more information, go to uhc.com/legal/ nondiscrimination-and-language-assistance- notices .Cultural competency is at the heart of serving our members, their special health needs and their unique circumstances. Cultural sensitivity plays a vital part in realizing our goal of supporting member recovery and resiliency in ways that are meaningful and appropriate for individuals in their communities and relevant to their unique cultural experiences. Our philosophy to help ensure culturally competent care providers emphasizes a \"whole member\" approach, taking into account the member's environment, background and culture. We are also committed to disability competency in which individuals and systems provide services effectively to people with various physical and behavioral disabilities. This includes modifications of a treatment facility, treatment environment and access. We believe care delivery includes respecting the worth of each individual and preservation of their personal dignity. These considerations include: Compliance with American Disabilities Act (ADA) indicated through policies and procedures Mobility and accessibility, including wheelchair ramps and entrance access Accessible medical equipment and services adapted to member needs and disability (i.e., adjustable examination table) Community resources and assistance, including transportation If you find you are unable to assist a member's access needs, including counseling or referral services, contact Provider Service Center at 866-331-2243 , so we can refer the member to a network care provider who is able to make the necessary accommodations for member care. Evidence-based clinical review criteria and guidelines UnitedHealthcare Community Plan uses InterQual (We previously used MCG Care Guidelines.) for medical care determinations.Chapter 1: Introduction 7 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Nebraska v65.11.2022 \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcareProvider Portal EDIPrior Authorization and Notification Direct Connect Policies and Protocols 1Use self-service to verify eligibility and claims, request prior authorization, provide notifications and access Document Library.

Timeliness standards for notifying members of test results After receiving results, notify members within: Urgent: 24 hours Non-urgent: 10 business days Requirements for PCP and specialists serving in PCP role Specialists include internal medicine, pediatrics, or obstetrician/gynecology PCPs are an important partner in the delivery of care, and Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) members may seek services from any participating care provider. The Nebraska DHHS program requires members be assigned to PCPs. We encourage members to develop a relationship with a PCP who can maintain all their medical records and provide overall medical management. These relationships help coordinate care and provide the member a \"medical home.\" The PCP plays a vital role as a case manager in the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan system by improving health care delivery in four critical areas: access, coordination, continuity and prevention. As such, the PCP manages initial and basic care to members, makes recommendations for specialty and ancillary care, and coordinates all primary care services delivered to our members. The PCP must provide 24 hours a day, seven days a week coverage and backup coverage when they are not available. Medical doctors (MDs), doctors of osteopathy (DOs), nurse practitioners (NPs)* and physician assistants (PAs)* from any of the following practice areas can be PCPs: General practice Internal medicine Family practice Pediatrics Obstetrics/gynecology *NPs may enroll with the state as solo providers, but PAs cannot; they must be part of a group practice. For services provided by a NP or PA, submit the claim under the NP or PA and not the supervising care provider. Services for durable medical equipment (DME), home health, and physical, occupational or speech therapies, all require an M.D. or DO be the ordering care provider type. Nebraska DHHS states PAs and NPs cannot be the ordering care provider for these types of services. Members may change their assigned PCP by contacting Member Services at 800-641-1902 any time during the month. Customer Service is available 7 a.m. - 7 p.m. Central Time or 6 a.m. - 6 p.m. Mountain Time, Monday through Friday. We ask members who don't select a PCP during enrollment to select one. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan may auto-assign a PCP to complete the enrollment process. Females have direct access (without a referral or authorization) to any OB/GYNs, midwives, PAs, or NPs for women's health care services and any non-women's health care issues discovered and treated in the course Chapter 2: Care Provider Standards and Policies 22 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Nebraska v65.11.2022 \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcareof receiving women's health care services. This includes access to ancillary services ordered by women's health care providers (lab, radiology, etc.) in the same way these services would be ordered by a PCP. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan works with members and care providers to help ensure all members understand, support, and benefit from the primary care case management system. The coverage will include availability of 24 hours a day, seven days a week. During non-office hours, access by telephone to a live voice (i.e., an answering service, care provider on-call, hospital switchboard, PCP's nurse triage) will immediately page an on-call medical professional so referrals can be made for non-emergency services. Recorded messages are not acceptable. Consult with other appropriate health care professionals to develop individualized treatment plans for UnitedHealthcare Community Plan members with special health care needs. Use lists supplied by the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan identifying members who appear to be due preventive health procedures or testing. Submit all accurately coded claims or encounters timely. Provide all well baby/well-child services. Coordinate each UnitedHealthcare Community Plan member's overall course of care.

UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will assign members to the closest and appropriate PCP. Depending on the member's age, medical condition and location, the choice of PCP may cover a variety of practice areas, such as family practice, general practice, internal medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics.

Member assignment Assignment to UnitedHealthcare Community Plan Nebraska DHHS MLTC assigns eligible members to UnitedHealthcare Community Plan daily. We manage the member's care on the date the member is enrolled until the member is disenrolled from UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Nebraska DHHS MLTC makes disenrollment decisions, not UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Disenrollment usually takes effect at month's end, but at times may occur mid-month. At enrollment time, each member receives a welcome packet that includes a copy of the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan Member Handbook. The handbook explains the member's health care rights, responsibilities and member ID card through UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Download a copy of the Member Handbook online at UHCcommunityplan.com/ne . Go to Plan Details, then Member Resources, View Available Resource. Immediate enrollment changes Immediate enrollment into managed care means the responsible payer for members, including newborns, may change from Fee for Service (FFS) to Medicaid Managed Care during hospitalization. To avoid delays in claims processing and payment, have the payer assignment of newborns checked daily.Get eligibility information by calling Provider Services , the NMES line at 800-642-6092 (toll free) or 402-471-9580 (Lincoln area), or by visiting the Nebraska DHHS eligibility page at dhhs.ne.gov > DHHS Divisions > Medicaid & Long-Term Care > Client Eligibility Verification . Unborn enrollment changes Encourage your members to notify ACCESSNebraska when they know they are expecting. ACCESSNebraska notifies managed care organizations (MCOs) daily of an unborn when Nebraska Medicaid learns a woman associated with the MCO is expecting. The MCO or you may use the online change report through the ACCESSNebraska website to report the baby's birth. With that information, ACCESSNebraska verifies the birth through the mother. The MCO and/or the care provider's information is taken as a lead. To help speed up the process, the mother should notify ACCESSNebraska when the baby is born. Members may call ACCESSNebraska at 855-632-7633 (toll free), 402-473-7000 (Lincoln area) or 402-595-1178 (Omaha area). Newborns may get UnitedHealthcare Community Plan- covered health services beginning on their date of birth. Check eligibility daily until the mother has enrolled her baby in a managed care plan. PCP selection Although unborn children cannot be enrolled with an MCO until birth, ask your members to select and contact a PCP for their baby prior to delivery. This will help avoid the delays and confusion that can occur with deferred PCP selections. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan Members can go to myuhc.com/ communityplan to look up a care provider.Chapter 3: Care Provider Office Procedures and Member Benefits 27 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Nebraska v65.11.2022 \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcare599 CHIP enrollment Unborn children of pregnant women otherwise ineligible for Medicaid may be covered under 599 Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

After the member has received emergency care, the hospital must seek approval within one hour for pre- approval for more care to make sure the member remains stable. If the hospital needs to appeal the decision or does not receive a decision within one hour and/or they need to speak with a peer (medical director), call 800-955-7615. The treating care provider may continue with care until the health plan's medical care provider is reached, or when one of these guidelines is met: 1. A plan care provider with privileges at the treating hospital takes over the member's care. 2. A plan care provider takes over the member's care by sending them to another place of service. 3. An MCO representative and the treating care provider reach an agreement about the member's care. 4. The member is released. Depending on the need, the member may be treated in the ER, in an inpatient hospital room, or in another setting. This is called Post Stabilization Services. Members do not Chapter 4: Medical Management 47 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Nebraska v65.11.2022 \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcareChapter 4: Medical Management pay for these services.

Medicaid does not consider ultrasounds medically necessary if they are done only to determine the fetal sex or provide parents with a photograph of the fetus. We allow the first three obstetrical ultrasounds per pregnancy. The fourth and subsequent obstetrical ultrasound procedure will only be allowed for identified high-risk members. High-risk member claims must include the corresponding diagnosis code.

The hospital provides enrollment support by providing required birth data during admission. Home care and all prior authorization services The discharge planner ordering home care should call Provider Services to arrange for home care. Hysterectomies Hysterectomies cannot be reimbursed if performed for sterilization. Members who get hysterectomies for medical reasons must be told, orally and in writing, they will no longer be able to have children. All hysterectomy claims (surgeon, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist, hospital) must be accompanied by a consent form. The member should sign and date the form stating she was told before the surgery that the procedure will result in permanent sterility. Find the form on the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services at dhhs.ne. gov/ . See \"Sterilization Consent Form\" section on next page for more information. Exception: Nebraska DHHS MLTC does not require informed consent if: 1. As the care provider performing the hysterectomy, you certify in writing the member was sterile before the procedure. You must also state the cause of the sterility. 2. You certify, in writing, the hysterectomy was performed under a life-threatening emergency in which prior acknowledgment was not possible. Include a description of the emergency. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan requires, along with your claim, a copy of the signed medical assistance hysterectomy statement. Mail the claim and documentation to claims administration identified on the Chapter 4: Medical Management 52 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Nebraska v65.11.2022 \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcareChapter 4: Medical Management back of the member's ID card. Reimbursement is made upon completion of documentation requirements and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan review. The member may not be billed if consent forms are not submitted. Pregnancy termination services Pregnancy termination services are not covered, except in cases to preserve the woman's life. In this case, follow the Nebraska DHHS MLTC consent procedures for abortion. Allowable pregnancy termination services do not require a referral from the member's primary care provider. Members must use the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan care provider network. Use the following policy and procedures to qualify for reimbursement by the Nebraska DHHS MLTC. If a pregnancy termination is needed to preserve the woman's life, you must request prior authorization from the Medicaid Division before performing the pregnancy termination. If prior authorization is approved using the Nebraska DHHS MLTC guidelines, reimbursement will be made upon documentation submission reflecting Nebraska DHHS MLTC procedure approval. Requests must be sent in writing to: Department of Health & Human Services Medicaid Division P.O. Box 95026 Lincoln, NE 68509-5026 Fax: 402-471-9092 Sterilization and hysterectomy procedures Reimbursement for sterilization procedures are based on the member's documented request. This policy helps ensure UnitedHealthcare Community Plan members thinking about sterilization are fully aware of the details and alternatives. It also gives them time to consider their decision. In addition, the State Medical Assistance Program must have documented evidence that all the sterilization requirements have been met before making a payment. The member must sign the Medical Assistance Consent Form at least 30 days, but not more than 180 days, before the procedure. The member must be at least 21 years old when they sign the form. The member must not be mentally incompetent or live in a facility treating mental disorders. The member may agree to sterilization at the time of premature delivery or emergency abdominal surgery if at least 72 hours have passed since signing the consent form. However, in the case of premature delivery, they must have signed the form at least 30 days before the expected delivery date. If the requirements are not met for both sterilization procedures and hysterectomies, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan cannot pay the care provider, anesthetist or hospital. Sterilization informed consent A member has only given informed consent if the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Medical Assistance Consent Form for sterilization is properly filled out. Other consent forms do not replace the Medical Assistance Consent Form. Be sure the member fully understands the sterilization procedure and has been told of other family planning options. Informed consent may not be obtained while the member is in labor, seeking an abortion, or under the influence of alcohol or other substances that affect awareness. Sterilization consent form Use the consent form for sterilization: Complete all applicable sections of the form. Complete all applicable sections of the consent form before submitting it with the billing form. The Nebraska Medical Assistance Program cannot pay for sterilization procedures until all applicable items on the consent form are completed, accurate and follow sterilization regulation requirements. Your statement section should be completed after the procedure, along with your signature and the date. This may be the same date of the sterilization or a date afterward. If you sign and date the consent form before performing the sterilization, the form is invalid. The state's definition of \"shortly before\" is not more than 30 days before the procedure. Explain the procedure to the member within that time frame. However, do not sign and date the form until after you perform the procedure. You may also find the form on the Nebraska DHHS website at dhhs.ne.gov/ .Chapter 4: Medical Management 53 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Nebraska v65.11.2022 \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcareChapter 4: Medical Management Have three copies of the consent form: 1.

Emergency prescriptions Provide a 72-hour emergency supply of a prescribed drug when a medication is needed without delay and prior authorization (PA) is not available. This applies to all drugs requiring a PA, either because they are non- preferred drugs on the Preferred Drug List, or because they are subject to clinical edits. Dispense 72-hour emergency supply any time a PA cannot be resolved within 24 hours for a medication on the formulary appropriate for the member's medical condition. If the prescribing care provider cannot be reached or is unable to request a PA, the pharmacy should submit an emergency 72-hour prescription. A pharmacy can dispense a product packaged in a fixed and unbreakable dosage form (e.g., an albuterol inhaler) as an emergency supply. You will receive a response by telephone or other telecommunication device within 24 hours of a PA request. Medication Therapy Management program Our Medication Therapy Management (MTM) program helps assist members in understanding and providing education about their medications and ways to improve their compliance with prescribed medication regimens.

You must prescribe Medicaid members drugs listed on the PDL. We may not cover brand-name drugs not on the PDL if an equally effective generic drug is available and is less costly unless prior authorization is followed. If a member requires a non-preferred medication, call the Pharmacy Prior Authorization at 800-310-6826 , fax a Pharmacy Prior Notification Request form to 866- 940-7328 , or use the online Prior Authorization and Notification tool on the Provider Portal.Chapter 4: Medical Management 55 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Nebraska v65.11.2022 \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcareChapter 4: Medical Management We provide you PDL updates before the changes go into effect. Change summaries are posted on UHCprovider. com. Find the PDL and Pharmacy Prior Notification Request form at UHCprovider.com/priorauth . We also provide coverage for additional drugs not found on the PDL. You may access the list of covered drugs from our website at UHCprovider.com/NEcommunityplan > Pharmacy Resources and Physician Administered Drugs . Prior authorization Some drugs on the state-approved formulary and PDL may require prior authorization. Medications can be dispensed as an emergency 72-hour supply when drug therapy must start before prior authorization is secured and the prescriber cannot be reached. The rules apply to non-preferred PDL drugs and to those affected by a clinical prior authorization edit. Pharmacists receiving drug prescriptions requiring prior authorization should work with the prescribing care provider if the prescription can be changed to a preferred alternative medication. If a preferred alternative is not appropriate, the care provider should then contact the UnitedHealthcare Pharmacy Department at 800-310-6826 with questions about the prior authorization process. The preferred drugs and those requiring prior authorization will be designated in the list of drugs at UHCprovider.com/NEcommunityplan > Pharmacy Resources and Physician Administered Drugs . To request pharmacy prior authorization, call Pharmacy Prior Authorization at 800-310-6826 . You may also fax your authorization request to 866-940-7328 . We provide notification for prior authorization requests within 24 hours of request receipt. Quantity limits UnitedHealthcare Community Plan has medication quantity limits. The following describes the quantity limitation types: Prescriptions for monthly quantities greater than the indicated limit require a prior authorization request. Quantity limits based on efficient medication dosing (also known as dose optimization). -The Efficient Medication Dosing Program focuses on consolidating medication dosage to the most efficient daily quantity to increase therapy adherence and also promote the efficient use of health care dollars. -Program limits are based on FDA approval for dosing and the availability of the total daily dose in the least amount of tablets or capsules daily. Quantity limits in the prescription claims processing system will limit dispensing to consolidate dosing. -The Pharmacy Claims Processing System will prompt the pharmacist to request a new prescription order from the care provider. Per state regulations, certain quantity limits apply to mental health drugs. Adjustments to the Quantity Limitations program drug list will be made as needed and care providers notified accordingly. We recognize a number of patient-specific variables must be taken into account when drug therapy is prescribed, and therefore overrides will be available through the medical exception (prior authorization) process. For more information about drug-specific quantity limits go to UHCprovider.com/ NEcommunityplan > Pharmacy Resources and Physician Administered Drugs or call the UnitedHealthcare Pharmacy Department at 800-310-6826 .

We will not pay claims if a member uses another pharmacy without prior authorization. We notify members and care providers about our Restricted Services Program information. Restrictions do not apply to emergency services. Members can change care providers with cause.

Prevent or treat a condition that threatens to cause or worsen a handicap, physical deformity, or malfunction; there is no other equally effective, more conservative or substantially less costly treatment available to the member. Not experimental treatments. Determination process Benefit coverage for health services is determined by the member specific benefit plan document, such as a Certificate of Coverage, Schedule of Benefits, or Summary Plan Description, and applicable laws. You may freely communicate with members about their treatment, regardless of benefit coverage limitations.Evidence-based clinical guidelines UnitedHealthcare Community Plan uses evidence- based clinical guidelines to guide our quality and health management programs.

Monitor the referred member's progress and help ensure they are returned to your care as soon as appropriate. We require prior authorization of all out of-network referrals. The nurse reviews the request for medical necessity and/or service. If the case does not meet criteria, the nurse routes the case to the medical director for review and determination. Out-of-network referrals are approved for, but not limited to, the following: Continuity of care issues Necessary services are not available within network UnitedHealthcare Community Plan monitors out-of- network referrals on an individual basis. Care provider or geographical location trends are reported to Network Management to assess root causes for action planning.

Services provided to members not enrolled on the date(s) of service. Second opinion benefit If a UnitedHealthcare Community Plan member asks for a second opinion about a treatment or procedure, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will cover that cost. Scheduling the appointment for the second opinion should follow the access standards established by the Nebraska DHHS MLTC. These access standards are defined in Chapter 2. The care provider giving the second opinion must not be affiliated with the attending care provider. Criteria: The member's PCP refers the member to an in-network care provider for a second opinion. Providers will forward a copy of all relevant records to the second opinion care provider before the appointment. The care provider giving the second opinion will then forward their report to the member's PCP and treating care provider, if different. The member may help the PCP select the care provider. If an in-network provider is not available, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will arrange for a consultation with a non-participating provider. The participating provider should contact UnitedHealthcare Community Plan at 800-641-1902 . Once the second opinion has been given, the member and the PCP discuss information from both evaluations. If follow-up care is recommended, the member meets with the PCP before receiving treatment.Serious reportable events and reportable adverse incidents Consistent with the Affordable Care Act administered through the CMS, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will implement the Provider Preventable Conditions initiative requirements, which include: 1.

UnitedHealthcare Community Plan pays its in-network PCPs and specialists on a fee-for-service basis. We also pay in-network hospitals and other types of care providers in the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan network on a fee-for-service basis. The plan's UM staff works with care providers to help ensure members receive the most appropriate care in the place best suited for the needed services. Our staff encourages appropriate use and discourages underuse. The UM staff does not receive incentives for UM decisions. UM appeals UM appeals are considered medically necessary appeals. They contest UnitedHealthcare Community Plan's UM decisions. They include such things as UnitedHealthcare Community Plan's admission, extension of stay, level of care, or other health care services determination. They do not include benefit appeals, which are appeals for non-covered services. Any member, their designee, or care provider who is dissatisfied with a UnitedHealthcare Community Plan UM decision may file a UM appeal. See Appeals in Chapter 12 for more details. 62 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Nebraska v65.11.2022 \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcare Chapter 5: Early, Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT)/Prevention The Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit provides comprehensive and preventive health care services for children younger than age 21 who are enrolled in Medicaid.

After this time, the member may request a network pharmacy change for a good cause reason as long as both the member and the health plan agree. The member's appeal rights are outlined in the notification letter and the Member Handbook. The member will remain in the program until they show a pattern of using services appropriately. Provisions allow a one-time emergency supply for medications available at a pharmacy other than the member's pharmacy.

While the Act's core goals were to maintain insurance coverage for workers and fight health care fraud and abuse, its Administrative Simplification provisions have had the greatest impact on how the health care industry works. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan is a \"covered entity\" under these regulations. So are all health care providers who conduct business electronically. Transactions and code sets If you conduct business electronically, submit claims using the standard formats adopted under HIPAA. Otherwise, submit claims using a clearinghouse. Unique identifier HIPAA also requires unique identifiers for employers, health care providers, health plans and individuals for use in standard transactions. National Provider Identifier The NPI is your standard unique identifier. It is a 10-digit number with no embedded intelligence that covered entities must accept and use in standard transactions. While HIPAA only requires you to use the NPI in electronic transactions, many state agencies require it on fee-for-service claims and on encounter submissions. For this reason, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan requires the NPI on paper transactions. The NPI number is issued by the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES). Share it with all affected trading partners, such as care providers to whom you refer patients, billing companies and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan.Chapter 10: Quality Management (QM) Program and Compliance Information 83 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Nebraska v65.11.2022 \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcarePrivacy of individually identifiable health information The privacy regulations limit how health plans, pharmacies, hospitals and other covered entities can use members' medical information. The regulations protect medical records and other identifiable health information. This includes electronic, paper or spoken data. They enhance consumers' rights by giving them access to their health information and controlling its inappropriate use. They also improve health care delivery by extending the privacy efforts of states and health systems to a national level. Security Covered entities must meet basic security measures: Help ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all electronic protected health information (PHI) the covered entity creates, Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats, uses or disclosures of information not permitted or required under the Privacy Regulations, and Help ensure compliance with the security regulations by the covered entity's staff. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan expects you to comply with all HIPAA regulations. Find additional information on HIPAA regulations at cms.hhs.gov . Ethics and integrity UnitedHealthcare Community Plan is dedicated to conducting business honestly and ethically with you, members, suppliers and government officials and agencies. Making sound decisions as we interact with you, other health care providers, regulators and others is necessary for our continued success and that of our business associates. It's also the right thing to do.Compliance program As a segment of UnitedHealth Group, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan is governed by the UnitedHealth Group Ethics and Integrity program. The UnitedHealthcare Community Plan Compliance program incorporates the required seven elements of a compliance program as outlined by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines: Oversight of the Ethics and Integrity program. Development and implementation of ethical standards and business conduct policies. Creating awareness of the standards and policies by educating employees. Assessing compliance by monitoring and auditing. Responding to allegations of violations. Enforcing policies and disciplining confirmed misconduct or serious neglect of duty. Reporting mechanisms for workers to alert management and/or the Ethics and Integrity program staff to violations of law, regulations, policies and procedures, or contractual obligations. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan has compliance officers for each health plan. In addition, each health plan has a compliance committee consisting of senior managers from key organizational areas. The committee provides program direction and oversight. Reporting and auditing Report any unethical, unlawful or inappropriate activity by a UnitedHealthcare Community Plan employee to a UnitedHealthcare Community Plan senior manager or directly to the Compliance Office. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan's Special Investigations Unit (SIU) is an important part of the Compliance program. The SIU focuses on prevention, detection and investigation of potentially fraudulent and abusive acts committed by care providers and members. This department oversees coordination of anti-fraud activities. To facilitate the reporting process of questionable incidents involving members or care providers, call our Fraud, Waste and Abuse line at 866-242-7727 or go to uhc.com/fraud .Chapter 10: Quality Management (QM) Program and Compliance Information 84 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Nebraska v65.11.2022 \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcarePlease refer to the Fraud, Waste and Abuse section of this manual for additional details about the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan Fraud, Waste and Abuse program. An important aspect of the Compliance program is assessing high-risk areas of UnitedHealthcare Community Plan operations and implementing reviews to help ensure compliance with law, regulations and policies/contracts. When informed of potentially inappropriate or fraudulent practices within the plan or by you, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will conduct an investigation. You must cooperate with the company and government authorities. This means giving access to pertinent records (as required by your applicable Provider Agreement and this manual) as well as access to office staff. If we establish activity in violation of law or regulation, we will advise appropriate governmental authorities. If you become the subject of a government inquiry or investigation, or a government agency requests documents relating to your operations (other than a routine request for documentation), you must provide UnitedHealthcare Community Plan with the details. You must also reveal what triggered the inquiry. Extrapolation audits of corporate-wide billing UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will work with the state of Nebraska to perform \"individual and corporate extrapolation audits.\" This may affect all programs supported by dual funds (state and federal funding) as well as state-funded programs, as requested by the Nebraska DHHS. Record retention, reviews and audits You must maintain an adequate record-keeping system for recording services, charges, dates and all other commonly accepted information for services rendered to our members. Records must be kept for at least 10 years from the close of the Nebraska program agreement between the state and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan or another period as required by law. If records are under review, they must be retained until the audit is complete. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan and its affiliated entities (including OptumHealth) will request and obtain prior approval from you for the records under review or inspection. You agree to refund the state any overpayment disclosed by any such audit.If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action involving the records has been started before the 10-year period ends, you agree to keep the records until one year after the resolution of all issues that come from it. The state may also perform financial, performance and other special audits on such records during business hours throughout your Provider Agreement. To help ensure members receive quality services, you must also comply with requests for on-site reviews conducted by the state. During these reviews, the state will address your capability to meet Nebraska program standards. You must cooperate with the state or any of its authorized representatives, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Office of Inspector General, or any other agency prior-approved by the state, at any time during your Provider Agreement. These entities may, at all reasonable times, enter your premises. You agree to allow access to and the right to audit, monitor and examine any relevant books, documents, papers and records to otherwise evaluate (including periodic information systems testing) your performance and charges. We will perform reviews and audits without delaying your work. If you refuse to allow access, this will constitute a breach of your Provider Agreement. Delegating and subcontracting If you delegate or subcontract any function, the delegate or subcontractor must include all requirements of your applicable Provider Agreement and this manual. Office site quality UnitedHealthcare Community Plan and affiliates monitor complaints for quality of care and service (QOC) concerning participating care providers and facilities. Complaints about you or your site are recorded and investigated. We conduct appropriate follow- up to assure that members receive care in a safe, clean and accessible environment.

General billing guidelines We only consider reimbursing claims if you met billing and coverage requirements. Submitting a prior authorization does not guarantee we will pay you. Payment depends on the member's coverage on the date(s) of service, medical necessity, plan rules about limitations and exclusions, and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan policies. We don't reimburse excessive, inappropriate or non-covered charges. To comply with applicable standards, policies and law, we may adjust previous payments for services and audit claims. We may seek reimbursement for overpayments or offset future payments as allowed by law.Claims payment requirements UnitedHealthcare Community Plan must pay care providers interest at an annualized rate of 12%, calculated daily for the full period that a payable clean claim remains unpaid beyond 60 days from receipt by UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Interest owed to the care provider must be paid the same day that the claim is adjudicated, and reported on the encounter submission to MLTC or its designee. Modifier codes Use the appropriate modifier codes on your claim form. The modifier must be used based on the date of service. Member ID card for billing The member ID card has both the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan member ID and the state Document Control Number (DCN). UnitedHealthcare Community Plan prefers you bill with the member ID. Acceptable claim forms UnitedHealthcare Community Plan only processes claims submitted on 1500 and UB-04 claim forms. Use the CMS 1500 form for ancillary services, ambulatory surgery centers, urgent care centers and hospital services. Use the UB-04 form for hospital inpatient and outpatient services, dialysis services, skilled nursing homes inpatient services, long-term care facilities, hospice services and other care providers. Clean claims and submission requirements Complete a CMS 1500 or UB-04 form whether you submit an electronic or a paper claim.

We will reject electronic claim submissions and deny paper claims that do not have a matching rendering and billing provider NPI combination.

Because the Nebraska DHHS uses this data, it's important for your claim data to match the data used in your DHHS Provider Identification Number registration process.

Identify other services by the CPT/HCPCS and modifiers. Capitated services Capitation is a payment arrangement for health care providers. If you have a capitation agreement with us, we pay you a set amount for each member assigned to you per period. We pay you whether that person seeks care. In most instances, the capitated care provider is either a medical group or an Independent Practice Association (IPA). In a few instances, however, the capitated care provider may be an ancillary provider or hospital. We use the term \"medical group/IPA\" interchangeably with the term \"capitated care providers.\" Capitation payment arrangements apply to participating physicians, health care providers, facilities and ancillary providers who are capitated for certain UnitedHealthcare Community Plan products. This applies to all benefit plans for members: 1. Who have been assigned to or who have chosen a care provider who receives a capitation payment from UnitedHealthcare Community Plan for such member, and 2. Who are covered under an applicable benefit plan insured by or receiving administrative services from UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Additionally, capitated care providers may be subject to any or all delegated activities. Capitated care providers should refer to their Delegation Grids within their participation agreements to determine which delegated activities the capitated providers are performing on behalf of UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. For capitated services, include all services related to an inpatient stay on the UB-04 when a member is admitted to the hospital, they received emergency room treatment, observation or other outpatient hospital services. We deny claims submitted with service dates that don't match the itemization and medical records. This is a billing error denial.Subrogation and coordination of benefit Our benefits contracts are subject to subrogation and coordination of benefits (COB) rules: Subrogation: We may recover benefits paid for a member's treatment when a third party causes the injury or illness. COB: We coordinate benefits based on the member's benefit contract and applicable regulations. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan is the payer of last resort. Other coverage should be billed as the primary carrier. When billing UnitedHealthcare Community Plan, submit the primary payer's Explanation of Benefits or remittance advice with the claim. Hospital and clinic method of billing professional services Hospital and clinics must bill for professional services bill on a CMS 1500. The servicing provider's name is placed in box 31, and the servicing provider's group NPI number is placed in box 33a. Global days Global days include the billable period involving pre- operative visits, the procedure itself, and post-operative visits in which the care provider performs all necessary services. The visits must be performed by the same care provider or another care provider reporting the same TIN in either an inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital, ambulatory surgical center (ASC), or physician's office. For reimbursement, we follow CMS guidelines and the National Physician Fee Schedule (NPFS) Relative Value File to determine global days values. To learn more about billing for global days and their values, read our global days policy on UHCprovider.com > Resources > Health Plans, Policies, Protocols and Guides > For Community Plans > Reimbursement Policies for Community Plan > Global Days Policy, Professional - Reimbursement Policy - UnitedHealthcare Community Plan . Chapter 11: Billing and Submission 91 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Nebraska v65.11.2022 \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcareCorrect Coding Initiative (CCI) UnitedHealthcare Community Plan performs coding edit procedures based on the Correct Coding Initiative (CCI) and other nationally recognized sources. Comprehensive and component codes Comprehensive and component code combination edits apply when a code pair(s) appears to be related. These edits can be further broken down to explain the bundling rationale. Some of the most common causes for denials in this category are: Separate procedures: Only report these codes when performed independently: Most extensive procedures: You can perform some procedures with different complexities. Only report the most extensive service. With/without services: Don't report combinations where one code includes and the other excludes certain services. Medical practice standards: Services part of a larger procedure are bundled. Laboratory panels: Don't report individual components of panels or multichannel tests separately. Sequential procedures: Only report the procedure that achieves the expected result. Mutually exclusive codes Mutually exclusive code edits apply to procedures that are unlikely or impossible to perform at the same time, on the same member, by the same care provider. CCI guidelines are available in hard copy, on CD ROM, and in software packages from your CPT and ICD CM code vendor, many specialty organizations, and the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Technical Information Service.Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments Submit your laboratory claims with the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments (CLIA) number. In box 23 of the CMS 1500 claim form, enter the 10-digit CLIA certification number for laboratory services billed by an entity performing CLIA-covered procedures. Note: Block 23 can only contain one condition. Additional conditions should be reported on a separate CMS 1500 claim form. If you bill electronically, report the CLIA number in Loop 2300 or 2400, REF/X4,02. For more information about the CLIA number, contact the CMS CLIA Central Office at 410-786-3531 or go to the cms.gov . Billing multiple units When billing multiple units: If the same procedure is repeated on the same date of service, enter the procedure code once with the appropriate number of units. The total bill charge is the unit charge multiplied by the number of units. Billing guidelines for obstetrical services Follow this reporting procedure when submitting obstetrical delivery claims. Otherwise, we will deny the claim: If billing for both delivery and prenatal care, use the date of delivery. Use one unit with the appropriate charge in the charge column. The beginning date of service is equal to the initial prenatal visit and the ending date of service is equal to the last prenatal visit prior to delivery. Nebraska allows billing antepartum care with one visit on a separate line. Use CPT Evaluation and Management codes (99201-99215*) or OB visits (59425-59426) to report prenatal visits. -Only use CPT Evaluation and Management (E/M) codes 99201-99215 when three or less prenatal visits are performed.Chapter 11: Billing and Submission 92 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Nebraska v65.11.2022 and 59618. Ambulance claims (emergency) Ambulance claims must include the point of origin, destination address, city, state, and ZIP. The accident state must be listed in box 10 and ambulance claims must not bill diagnosis code 799.99. National Drug Code (NDC) Claims must include: National Drug Code (NDC) and unit of measurement for the drug billed. HCPCS/CPT code and units of service for the drug billed. Actual metric decimal quantity administered. Submit the NDC on all claims with procedure codes for care provider-administered drugs in outpatient clinical settings. The claims must show the NDC that appears on the product. Enter the identifier N4, the 11-digit NDC code, unit/basis of measurement qualified, and metric decimal quantity administered. Include HCPCS/CPT codes. In field 24A shaded area of the CMS 1500 claim form, enter the N4 NDC qualifier in the first two positions, followed by the 11-digit NDC (no dashes or spaces), and then a space and the NDC units of measure qualified, followed by the NDC quantity. All should be left-justified in the pink shaded area above the date of service. The billed units in column G (days or units) should reflect the HCPCS units and not the NDC units. Do not base billing on the NDC units. Billing based on the NDC units may result in underpayment. Medical necessity UnitedHealthcare Community Plan only pays for medically necessary services. See Chapter 4 for more information about medical necessity.

For paper claims Submit a screen shot from your accounting software that shows when you submitted the claim. The screen shot must show the correct: Member name. Date of service. Claim date submission (within the timely filing period). Timely filing Timely filing issues may occur if members give the wrong insurance information when you treat them. This results in receiving: A denial/rejection letter from another carrier. Another carrier's explanation of benefits. A letter from another insurance carrier or employer group saying that the member either has no coverage or had their coverage terminated before the date of service. All of the above must include documentation the claim is for the correct member and the correct date of service. A submission report alone is not considered proof of timely filing for electronic claims. They must be accompanied by an acceptance report. The date on the other carrier's payment correspondence starts the timely filing period for submission to UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. To be timely, you must receive the claim within the timely filing period from the date on the other carrier's correspondence. If we receive the claim after the timely filing period, it will not meet the criteria. Timely filing limits can vary based on state requirements and contracts. If you don't know your timely filing limit, refer to your Provider Agreement. Balance billing Do not balance bill members if: The charge amount and the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan fee schedule differ. We deny a claim for late submission, unauthorized service or as not medically necessary. A claim is pending review by UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. You are able to balance bill the member for non-covered services if the member provides written consent prior to getting the service. If you have questions, please contact your provider advocate. If you don't know who your provider advocate is, email CentralPRteam@uhc. com . A provider advocate will get back to you. Third-party resources UnitedHealthcare Community Plan is, by law, the payer of last resort for eligible members.

Refer to your Agreement for third party claim submission deadlines. Once you bill the other carrier and receive an EOB, the claim may then be submitted to UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Please attach a copy of the EOB to the submitted claim. The EOB must be complete to understand the paid amount or denial reason. Medicare crossover claims You are required to enter Medicare information at both the claim and line level. When entering Medicare information at the claim level, please help ensure the amount entered is the sum of the amounts entered at the line level.94 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Nebraska v65.11.2022 \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcare Chapter 12: Claim Reconsiderations, Appeals and Grievances APPEALS AND GRIEVANCES STANDARD DEFINITIONS AND PROCESS REQUIREMENTS Situation DefinitionWho May Submit?Submission AddressOnline Form For Fax Or MailCare Provider Contact InformationCare Provider Website For Online SubmissionsCare Provider Filing TimeframeUnitedHealthcare Community Plan Response Timeframe Care Provider Claim ResubmissionCreating a new claim.

These definitions and process requirements are subject to modification by state contract or regulations. States may impose more stringent requirements. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan and its in-network care providers may agree to more stringent requirements within care provider contracts than described in the standard process. Denial Your claim may be denied for administrative or medical necessity reasons. An Administrative denial is when we didn't get notification before the service, or the notification came in too late. Denial for medical necessity means the level of care billed wasn't approved as medically necessary. If a claim is denied for these reasons, you may be able to request a claim reconsideration or file an appeal. Other top reasons for denial include: Duplicate claim - This is one of the most common reasons for denial. It means resubmitting the same claim information. This can reset the clock on the time it takes to pay a claim. Duplicate Denials - To reduce receiving duplicate denials, submit one claim with all billed services for one member, one date of service when rendered by same care provider. If you bill for multiple dates of service, please ensure all billable services are listed for the dates of service. The exception to these guidelines applies when the service(s) include: Different procedure codes Different modifiers Different NDC numbers Different place of service (POS) Billing by care provider of different specialty All services billed on a UB-04 form need to be listed on one claim form. Claim lacks information. Basic information is missing, such as a person's date of birth; or information incorrect, such as spelling of a name. You can resubmit this type of claim with the correct information. Eligibility expired. Most practices verify coverage beforehand to avoid issues, but sometimes that doesn't happen. One of the most common claim denials involving verification is when a patient's health insurance coverage has expired and the patient and practice were unaware. Also, in a lot of cases, practices may check eligibility when an appointment is made, but between the appointment being made and the actual visit, coverage can be dropped. We recommend an eligibility check again once the patient has arrived. Claim not covered by UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Another claim denial you can avoid is when procedures are not covered by us. You can easily avoid this problem by using real-time verification. Time limit expired. This is when you don't send the claim in time. Claim correction What is it? You may need to update information on a claim you've already submitted. A corrected claim replaces a previously processed or denied claim submitted in error. When to use: Submit a corrected claim to fix or void one that has already processed. How to use: Use the claims reconsideration application on the Provider Portal. To access the portal, sign in to UHCprovider.com using your One Healthcare ID. You may also submit the claim by mail with a claim reconsideration request form. Allow up to 30 business days to receive payment for initial claims and 30 business days to receive a response to adjustment requests. Mailing address: UnitedHealthcare Community Plan P.O. Box 5240 Kingston, NY 12402-5240 Additional Information: When correcting or submitting late charges on 837 institutional claims, use bill type xx7: Replacement of Prior Claim. Do not submit corrected or additional information charges using bill type xx5: Late Charge Claim. To void a claim, use bill type xx8.Chapter 12: Claim Reconsiderations, Appeals and Grievances 97 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Nebraska v65.11.2022 \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcareResubmitting a claim What is it? When you resubmit a claim, you create a new claim in place of a rejected one. A rejected claim has not been processed due to problems detected before processing. When to use it: Resubmit the claim if it was rejected. Since rejected claims have not been processed yet, there is no appeal - the claim needs to be corrected through resubmission. You have up to 12 months from the date of service to submit a clean claim. Common Reasons for Rejected Claims: Some of the common causes of claim rejections happen due to: Errors in member demographic data - name, age, date of birth, sex or address. Errors in care provider data. Wrong member insurance ID. No referring care provider ID or NPI number. How to use: To resubmit the claim, follow the same submission instructions as a new claim. To mail your resubmission, provide all claim information with a cover letter to: UnitedHealthcare Community Plan Provider Claim Disputes P.O. Box 31365 Salt Lake City, UT 84131-0365 Warning! If your claim was denied and you resubmit it, you will receive a duplicate claim denial. A denied claim has been through claim processing and we determined it cannot be paid. You may submit a corrected claim by submitting the corrected claim information or appealing the decision. See Claim Correction and Reconsideration sections of this chapter for more information or learn about denial versus rejection at therabill.zendesk.com . Claim reconsideration (step one of dispute) What is it? Claim issues include overpayment, underpayment, denial, or an original or corrected claim determination you do not agree with. A claim reconsideration request is the quickest way to address your concern about whether the claim was paid correctly. When you send a reconsideration, please send additional support information. When to use: Reconsiderations can be done repeatedly, but should include new information each time. Submit a claim reconsideration when you think a claim has not been properly processed. For administrative denials: In your reconsideration request, please ask for a medical necessity review and include all relevant medical records. For medical necessity denials: In your request, please include any additional clinical information that may not have been reviewed with your original claim. Show how specific information in the medical record supports the medical necessity of the level of care performed - for example, inpatient instead of observation. How to use: If you disagree with a claim determination, submit a claim reconsideration request electronically, by phone or mail: Electronically: Use the Claim Reconsideration application on the Provider Portal. Include electronic attachments. You may also check your status using the Provider Portal. Phone: Call Provider Services at 866-331-2243 or use the number on the back of the member's ID card.

Box 31365 Salt Lake City, UT 84131 This form is available at UHCprovider.com/claims . Tips for successful claims resolution To help process claim reconsiderations: Do not let claim issues grow or go unresolved. Call Provider Services if you can't verify a claim is on file. Chapter 12: Claim Reconsiderations, Appeals and Grievances 98 | UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Nebraska v65.11.2022 \u00a9 2023 UnitedHealthcare Do not resubmit validated claims on file unless submitting a corrected claim. File adjustment requests and claims disputes within contractual time requirements. If you must exceed the maximum daily frequency for a procedure, submit the medical records justifying medical necessity. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan is the payer of last resort. This means you must bill and get an EOB from other insurance or source of health care coverage before billing UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. When submitting adjustment requests, provide the same information required for a clean claim. Explain the dispute, what should have been paid and why. Refer to your contract for submission deadlines concerning third-party claims. Once you have billed the other carrier and received an EOB, submit the claim to UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Attach a copy of the EOB to the submitted claim. The EOB must be complete to understand the paid amount or the denial reason. Valid proof of timely filing documentation (reconsideration) What is it? Valid proof of timely filing a claim includes: A denial or rejection letter from another insurance carrier. Another insurance carrier's explanation of benefits. Letter from another insurance carrier or employer group indicating: -Coverage termination prior to the date of service of the claim -No coverage for the member on the date of service of the claim The date on the other carrier's payment correspondence starts the timely filing period for submission to UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. To be considered timely, the claim must be received by UnitedHealthcare Community Plan within the timely filing period from the date on the other carrier's correspondence. If the claim is received after the timely filing period, it will not meet timely filing criteria. A submission report is not proof of timely filing for electronic claims. It must be accompanied by an acceptance report. Timely filing denials are often upheld due to incomplete or wrong documentation submitted with a reconsideration request. You may also receive a timely filing denial when you do not submit a claim on time. How to use: Submit a reconsideration request electronically, by phone or mail with the following information: Electronic claims: Include the EDI acceptance report stating we received your claim. Mail reconsiderations: Submit a screen shot from your accounting software that shows the date you submitted the claim. The screen shot must show: -Correct member name. -Correct date of service. -Claim submission date. Additional Information: Timely filing limits can vary based on state requirements and contracts. If you do not know your timely filing limit, refer to your Provider Agreement. Overpayment What is it? An overpayment happens when we overpay a claim. How to use: If you or UnitedHealthcare Community Plan finds an overpaid claim, send us the overpayment within the time specified in your contract.
