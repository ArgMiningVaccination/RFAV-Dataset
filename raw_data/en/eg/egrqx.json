He studied Kinesiology at San Jose State University before starting his studies at Palmer Chiropractic College - West and graduated in 2010 with a Doctorate of Chiropractic. Dr. Herb and his family relocated to Round Rock, Texas, in 2018. They live and work in Round Rock and love the golf community they now call home.

Dr. Herb leverages almost a decade of experience working with powerlifters, runners, martial artists, and even a roller derby team. A Message from Dr. Herb Thank you for visiting our website and considering us when choosing a provider. I know there are many different avenues, and sometimes it's hard to know which one to choose. The best I can do is provide you with my perspective and approach to treating my patients. I believe in treating the person as a whole rather than a collection of symptoms, and my goal as a chiropractor is the help you get back to doing the things you need to do so you can live your healthy, energetic, and pain-free life. Your health and well-being are vital to me, and I look forward to helping you towards a healthier, pain-free life. Sincerely, Dr. Herb "}
