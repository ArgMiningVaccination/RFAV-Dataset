I taught myself how to make soap, facial oils and body scrubs with only a few natural ingredients. I did obtain that massage practitioner license. In 2010 I found myself with a job as my chiropractor's assistant, and for seven years I grew to love watching people get better and reach their health goals. I wanted a bigger part in that journey, so I became a chiropractor. With the certainty that I could do more in a society where the medical paradigm rules, yet primary care is less and less effective, I began a functional medicine diplomate program to be a chiropractic internist. Having already joined forces with patients during my full time Morro Bay chiropractic practice to tackle their health mysteries, the idea was born (here at my home on the Nipomo mesa) to expand my practice and serve the south county communities. Mesa Natural Health Chiropractic will be taking over Watson Chiropractic and Wellness Center in the next few months, and I will be in Morro Bay only. I look forward to seeing you there! My passion is to address the whole person, and in turn watch them thrive. "}
