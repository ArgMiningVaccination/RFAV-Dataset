What is the p urpose of this manual? This document \"INVESTIGATOR MANUAL (HRP -103)\" is designed to guide you through policies and procedures related to the conduct of Human Research that are specific to this institution . General information regarding Human Research protections and relevant federal regulations and guidance is incorporated into the required human protections training. For additional information s ee below: \"What training does my staff and I need in order to conduct Human Research?\" Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 5 of 61 Definitions Although some terms are defined in this document, a comprehensive set of definitions relevant for Human Research can be found in SOP: Definitions (HRP -001). Please refer to that SOP for additional information about terms used in this document. What is Human Research? An algorithm to assist with understanding whether or not an activity is Human Research, can be found in the \" WORKSHEET: Human Research Determination (HRP-310) ,\" located in the IRB Policies & Procedures section of the IRB W eb site. Use this document for guidance as to whether an activity meets either the DHHS or FDA definition of Human Research, keeping in mind that the IRB makes the ultim ate determination in all cases as to whether an activity constitutes Human Research subject to IRB oversight. Additional guidance is provided in the SOP: Activities that Require IRB Review (HRP -093). You are responsible for not conduct ing Human Research wi thout prior IRB review and approval or obtaining a Not -Human Subjects or exemption determination from the IRB Office. If you have questions about whether an activity is Human Research, contact the IRB Office who will provide assistance. A written determin ation will be provided when the request is submitted through the electronic system . Determinations are not issued through emails or phone calls. What is the Human Research Protection Program? HRP -101 - HUMAN RESEARCH PROTECTION PROGRAM PLAN describes this institution's overall plan to protect subjects in Human Research. The mission of the Human Research Protection Program. The ethical principles that the institution follows governing the conduct of Human Research. The applicable laws that gov ern Human Research. When the institution becomes \"engaged in Human Research\" and when someone is acting as an agent of the institution conducting Human Research. The types of Human Research that may not be conducted. The roles and responsibilities of individuals within the institution. Who may be a principal investigator for human Research ? Every research study requires a Principal Investigator (PI). This person takes full responsibility for the conduct of the study including the e ligibility and training of the research staff. All individuals who serve in the role of a principal investigator on funded research must be employed by Texas A&M. Below is a list of who may and may not serve as PI. Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 6 of 61 Eligible to be a P rincipal Investigator With Permission of Dean or Department Head on Case by Case Basis Not Eligible to be a P rincipal Investigator Tenure -track faculty (full, associate, and assistant professors) Non -tenure -track faculty (full, associate, and assistant professors) Instructors Librarians Faculty Equivalent Research Scientists Lecturers Adjuncts Visiting faculty Visiting scholars Retired faculty Senior Research Fellow Senior Staff Undergraduate students Graduate Students Residents Post -Doctoral Fellows Research Assistants Research Associates Research Coordinators Please note that the TAMU IRB recognizes only one P rincipal Investigator for each study. The Principal Investigator is ultimately responsible for the conduct of the entire study and all study team members. Additional investigators must have other titles such as Co- Investigator. Student researchers must include an individual from the first column above ( Eligible to be a P rincipal Inves tigator ) as the Principal Investigator of their projects. Al though, a student may carry -out many of the protocol related functions as a 'protocol director' , the Principal Investigator retains responsibility for the overall conduct of the research. What training do researchers need to conduct Human Research? This section describes the training requirements imposed by the HRPP . You may have additional training imposed by other institutional policies, sponsors or funding agencies. All members of the research team involved in the design, conduct or reporting of the research must complete training. Members of the research team who have not completed human research protections training may not take part in research that involve s human subjects.

Investigator NUMBER DATE PAGE , 2022 8 of 61 TAMU Train Traq can be accessed at https://apps7.system.tamus.edu/TrainTraq/web/default.aspx For each new submission received, the IRB Office will verify that training requirements have been met. If they have not been met, the IRB Office will notify you of the deficiency and will not process the submission until all training requirements have been met or after removing individuals who have not met requirement s from your research team as appropriate. What financ ial interests do researchers need to disclose conduct Human Research? All individuals involved in the design, conduct, or reporting of research , are required to di sclose financial interests in accordance with System Regulation 15.01.03 and University Rule 15.01.03. M1. Investigators involved in human subjects research can find additional details in \"SOP: Management of Financial Conflicts of Interests (HRP -055).\" What other approvals are required before initiating Human Research? In addition to securing IRB approval for Human Research you may need to secure other institution al approvals. Below are examples where other approvals are relevant; however, this list is not all inclusive. The IRB Office may ask you to obtain other approvals not listed below on a case -by-case bas is depending on the specifics of your research. Bio-Safety approval is required when your protocol also involves activities with biohazards (blood, tissue, cell lines, recombinant DNA or RNA, select agents or toxins). Contact the Bio safety Office for additional information at ibc@tamu.edu . Export Controls laws and regulations may apply to research where controlled information and items are provided to anyone outside of the United States or to foreign persons and entities in the United States including transactions with sanctioned countries, persons or enti ties. Contact the Export Controls Office for more information at exportcontrols@tamu.edu. Animal Welfare Program/ IACUC approval is required when you r protocol also involves the use of animals or animal tissues and fluids. Contact the Animal Welfare Office for additional information at animalcompliance@tamu.edu . Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FE RPA ) requirements apply to any research involving TAMU students, their information, or student records. The Office of the Registrar will be notified to verify FERPA compliance. Contact ferpa@tamu.edu for additional informatio n. Privacy Officer review may be required when research involves identifiable information regulated by HIPAA, GDPR or other privacy laws. For more information contact the Privacy Officer at privacy@tamu.edu . Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 9 of 61 Research Administration review may be required when the research involves external collaborators or when a data use agreement (DUA) , material transfer agreement (MTA) , memorandum of understanding (MOU ) or other agreements is need ed. Contact negotiations@tamu.edu for additional information. Site Specific Authorizations are required when your research involves any organization or entity that is not part of Texas A&M University . This includes public schools or other educational settings , private clinics, hospitals, nursing homes, government agencies o r any other outside business or field site . Written approval from the organization 's authorized individual is required. In certain cases, contracts or other agreements may be required. Site Specific Authorization templates are available on the IRB website. How do I submit new Human Research to the IRB? Access the URL https://iris.tamu.edu Log into the electronic system using your NetID or UIN/ SSO login and password. From the 'Study Assistant' menu click 'Add a New Study'. Then select 'IRB Application' (Human Subjects) from the 'New Study Application' list. Complete each section of the online IRB Application, as needed. Click 'Save and Continue to the Next Section' after each page is complete. Upload the consent form to the 'Informed Consent' page , as applicable. Upload all other supporting document s to the 'Study Documents' page, as applicable. The number of additional documents required depends upon the specifics of your research. Copies of grants or c ontracts are always required for funded research. Below is the list of documents often required to support your application: investigator or multi-site protocols grants or contracts recruitment materials, data collection instruments including surveys, interview scripts, questionnaires , diaries consents, assents and H IPAA Authorizations site specific authorizations, drug or device information evidence of international ethics review After all information is entered the process is not complete until you 'Signoff and Submit' the application. All key personnel entered into the 'Additional Investigators' page must be selected for 'Sign - Off', also. Your Department Head is also required to sign -off on your application. The \"Sign- off\" page includes Investigator Attestation and disclosure of financial and non -financial conflict of interest s. If you need help, contact the IRB coordinator assigned to your department. This information is posted on the IRB website at My IRB Contact - Division of Research (tamu.edu) . Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 10 of 61 How do I request to rely on an External IRB ? TAMU investigators may rely upon the IRB of another organization when they receive a federal award that requires the use of a single IRB or at the request of the sponsor. In all other cases, t he HRPP reserves the right to determine on an individual stu dy basis whether or not to accept an External IRB review. The HRPP will evaluate the external IRB and the circumstances of each request. The TAMU investigator is required to submit a request through the IRB's electronic system to facilitate the administrative evaluation of the external IRB p roject. Complete the truncated application and attach all protocols, consent documents and other requested supplements . Ensure your scope of work is clearly described the application. Know t hat a reliance agreement between the institutions involved is required. The TAMU HRPP must acknowledge the request to use an external IRB p rior to the conduct of any research activities by TAMU personnel regardless of any External IRB approval. Texas A&M U niversity remain s responsible for the oversight of the conduct of the research. External IRB studies are subject to TAMU post approval monitoring activities. How do I request that the TAMU IRB serve as the IRB of record for my collaborative or multi -site research study? Consult your designated HRPP/ IRB coordinator, first. The HRPP will determine whether or not there are adequate resources to perform the functions of a single IRB related to your study. If the TAMU IRB accepts the role of a single IRB for your study, complete the regular IRB application and attach all applicable documents . After the primary study has received TAMU IRB approval, performance sites can be added. Each site must provide local context requirements and demonstrate that all personnel are adequately trained and qualified for their designated roles. A reliance agreement between each institution and the TAMU IRB is required. The lead PI for a multi- site study must be ready to accept additional responsibilities for overall stud y compliance and study -wide communications. Plans for use of a single IRB on a funded study should be thought out and budgeted during proposal. Central IRBs may be suggested as an alternative to using the TAMU IRB when single IRB is required for multi- site research. How do I write an Investigator Protocol? The IRB website has specific protocol templates for you to select depending upon the type of resea rch you are proposing, social and behavioral, biomedical or retrospective data or specimen review. Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 11 of 61 Use the template as a starting point for drafting a new investigator p rotocol and reference the instructions in italic text for the information the IRB looks for when reviewing research . Here are some key points to remember when developing a n Investigator Protocol : The italicized bullet points in the protocol templates serve as guid ance to investigators when developing a n Investigator Protocol for submission to the IRB. All italicized comments are meant to be deleted prior to submission. When writing a n Investigator Protocol , always keep an electronic copy. You will need to modify this copy when making changes to the Investigator Protocol . Note that, depending on the nature of your research, certain sections of the template may not be applicable to your Investigator Protocol . Indicate this as appropriate. You may not involve any indiv iduals who are members of the following populations as subjects in your research unless you indicate this in your inclusion criteria as the inclusion of subjects in these populations has regulatory implications. o Adults unable to provide legally effective c onsent o Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers) o Pregnant women o Prisoners If you are conducting community -based participatory research, you may contact the IRB Office for information about: o Research studies using a community -based p articipatory research design o Use of community advisory boards o Use of participant advocates o Partnerships with community -based organizations How do I create consent or assent documents? Use the Consent/Assent document templates posted on the IRB website to create consent/assent documents. Each different template contains information that is generally relevant for each type of research in each of these categories, social and behavioral, biomedical or simple survey research. You may ultimately need to edit sections to fit the type of research proposed. Note that although you may edit the forms to fit your research all consent documents must contain all of the required elements of informed consent and all appropriate additional elements in accordance with regulations and policies. Review the \"Long Form of Consent Documentation\" section in the IRB's WORKSHEET: Criteria for Approval (HRP -314) to ensure that these elements are addressed. Choose the appropriate signature block page or pages from the three different signature block templates: (1) adults capable of providing consent; (2) adults unable to provide consent; (3) assent of children. Delete the signatur e blocks that are not applicable to your research. We recommend that you note the version of your consent document in the lower left corner to ensure that you use the most recent version approved by the IRB. The IRB Office will also watermark consent documents in the lower right corner with IRB approval da tes. You may only use the latest stamped Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 12 of 61 version of the consent approved by the IRB. Once a new version of the consent is approved, all other versions become invalid and may not be used. Do I need to obtain informed consent in order to screen, recruit, or determine the eligibility of prospective subjects? The 2018 Common Rule allows an IRB to approve a research proposal in which an investigator will obtain information or biospecimens for the purpose of screening, recruiting, or determining the eligibility o f prospective subjects without the informed consent of the prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, if either of the following conditions are met: (1) The investigator will obtain information through oral or written communic ation with the prospective subject or legally authorized representative, OR (2) The investigator will obtain identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens by accessing records or stored identifiable biospecimens. The research protocol should include information about how potential subjects will be identified and recruited in order for the IRB to be able to determine whether informed consent for these activities is required. Note that accessing medical records or any other records subject to HIPPA regulations to determine a prospective subject's eligibility for a study will require a HIPAA authorization or a waiver when appropriate. What are the different regulatory classifications that research activities may fall under? The HRPP/IRB will review your submission with the goal of classifying it in the least restrictive category permissible. Activities may fall under one of the following four regulatory classifications: Not \"Human Research\": Activities must meet the institutional definition of \" Human R esearch\" to fall under IRB oversight. Activities that do not meet this definition of \"Human Research\" are not subject to IRB oversight or review. See SOP: Activities that require IRB Review (HRP -093) for additional guidance. Contact the IRB Office in case s activity is Human Research. If you have questions about whether an activity is Human Research, contact the IRB Office who will provide assistance. A written determination will be provided when the request is submitted through the electronic system . Determinations cannot be issued through emails or phone calls. Please note that a 'Not Human Research Determination\" is not an IRB approval. Exempt: Certain categories of minimal risk Human Research may be exempt from regulation but require IRB review. It is the responsibility of the HRPP , not the investigator, to determine Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 13 of 61 whether Human Research is exempt from IRB review. Review the \" WORKSHEET: Exemption (HRP -312) \" for reference on the categories of research that may be exempt. Some exempt research may require Limited IRB review to determine if there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and the confidentiality of data. Review Using the Expedited Procedure: Certain categories of non- exempt minimal risk Human Research may qualify for review using the expedited procedure, meaning that the project may be approved by a single designated IRB reviewer, rather than the convened board. Review the \"WORKSHEET: Eligibility for Review Using the Expedited Proced ure (HRP -313)\" for reference on the categories of research that may be reviewed using the expedited procedure. R eview by the Convened IRB: Non -Exempt Human Research that does not qualify for review using the expedited procedure must be reviewed by the convened IRB. What are the decisions the IRB can make when reviewing proposed research ? The IRB may approve research, require modifications to the research to secure approval, defer research, or disapprove research: Approval: Made when all criteria for approval are met. See \"How does the IRB decide whether to approve Human Research?\" below. M odifications Required to Secure Approval: Made when IRB members requ ire specific modifications to the research before approval can be finalized. D eferred : Made when the IRB determines that the board is unable to approve research and the IRB suggests modifications th at might make the research approvable. When making this motion, the IRB describes its reasons for this decision, describes modifications that might make the research approvable, and gives the investigator an opportunity to res pond to the IRB with the changes or meet with the IRB about the research. D isapproval: Made when the IRB determines that it is unable to approve research and the IRB cannot d escribe modifications th at might make the research approvable. When making this motion, the IRB describes its reasons for this decision and gives the investigator an opportunity to respond to the IRB in person or in writing. How does the IRB decide whether to approve Human Research ? The criteria for IRB approval can be found in the \"WORKSHEET: Exemption (HRP -312)\" for exempt Human Research and the \"WORKSHEET: Criteria for Approval (HRP -314)\" for non -exempt Human Research . The latter worksheet references other checklists that might be relevant. All checklists and worksheets can be found on the IRB Web site. Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 14 of 61 These checklists are used for initial review, continuing review, and review of modifications to previously approved Human Research . You are encouraged to use the checklists to write your Investigator Protocol in a way that addresses the criteria for approval. What will ha ppen after IRB review? The IRB will provide you with a written decision indicating that the IRB has approved the Human Research , requires modifications to secure approval, deferred the research or has disapproved the Human Research . If the IRB has approved the Human Research : The Human Research may commenc e once all other required TAMU compliance approvals have been met. IRB approval is usually good for a limited period of time which is noted in the IRB approval letter. I f the IRB requires modifications to secure approval and you accept the modifications: Make the requested modifications and submit them to the IRB. If all requested modifications are made, the IRB will issue a final approval. Research cannot commence until this final approval is received. If you do not accept the required modifications, write up your response and submit it to the IRB for additional review. I f the IRB defers the Human Research: The IRB will provide a statement of the reasons for deferral and suggestions to make the study approvable and give you an opportunity to respond in writing. In most cases if the IRB's reasons for the deferral are addressed with changes to the protocol , the Human Research can be approved . I f the IRB disapproves the Human Research : The IRB will provide a statement of the reasons for disapproval and give you an opportunity to respond in writing. In all cases, you have the right to address any concerns about your review to the IRB. Please contact the IRB staff to set up a meeting . What are my obligations as an investigator after IRB approval? 1) Do not start Human Research activities until you have the final IRB approval letter. 2) Do not start Human Research activities until you have obtained all other required compliance and institutional approvals. 3) Ensure that there are adequate resources to carry out the research safely. This includes, but is not limited to, sufficient investigator time, appropriately qualified research team members , equipment, and space. Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 15 of 61 4) Ensure that Research Staff are qualified (e.g., including but not limited to appropriate training, education, expertise, credentials, protocol requirements and, when relevant, privileges) to perform procedures and duties assigned to them during the study. 5) Update the IRB application with any changes to the list of study personnel. 6) Personally conduct or supervise the Human Research. Recognize that the investigator is accountable for the failures of any study team membe r. a. Conduct the Hu man Research in accordance with the relevant current protocol as approved by the IRB, and in accordance with applicable federal regulations and local laws. b. When required by the IRB ensure that consent or permission is obtained in accordance with the releva nt current protocol as approved by the IRB. c. Do not deviate or modify the research without prior IRB review and approval unless necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to subjects. d. Protect the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects involved in th e research. 7) Submit to the IRB: a. Proposed modifications as described in this manual. (See \" How do I submit a modification? \") b. A continuing review application or administrative check -in withing the time frame provided in the approval letter. (See \" How do I submit continuing review? \") NOTE: Any study that remains in an EXPIRED state beyond 30 days and the PI has not submitted a continuing review as required is subject to administrative closure. c. A study closure/completion application when the Human Research is closed. (See \" How Do I Close Out a Study? \") d. Any PI planning to leave the institution should submit a study closure or if appropriate transfer the study to another investigator. Studies that have not been transferred prior to the PI departure are subject to administrative closure. 8) Complete the Report of New Information (RNI) within five business days for any of the following items . (Reference HRP -029 for additional information). a) Information that indicates a new or increased risk, or a new safety issue. For example: i) New information (e.g., an interim analysis, safety monitoring report, publication in the literature, sponsor report, or investigator finding) that indicates an increase in the frequency or magnitude of a previously known risk or uncovers a new risk. ii) An investigator brochure, package insert, or device labeling is revised to indicate an increase in the frequency or magnitude of a previously known risk, or describe a new risk iii) Withdrawal, restriction, or modification of a marketed approval of a drug, device, or biologic used in a research protocol iv) Protocol deviation/violation that harmed subjects or others or that indicates subjects or others might be at increased risk of harm v) Complaint of a subject that indicates subjects or others might be at increased risk of harm or at risk of a new harm vi) Any changes significantly affecting the conduct of the research b) Harm experienced by a subject or other individual, which in the opinion of the investigator are unexpected and probably related to the research procedures. Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 16 of 61 i) A harm is \"unexpected\" when its specificity or severity are inconsistent with risk information previously reviewed and approved by the IRB in terms of nature, severity, frequency, and characteristics of the study population. ii) A harm is \"probably related\" to t he research procedures if in the opinion of the investigator, the research procedures more likely than not caused the harm. NOTE: Individual Adverse Events that do not meet the criteria for Unanticipated Problems do not require submission to the IRB. Conti nue to report adverse events to any sponsor as required. c) Non -compliance with the federal regulations governing human research or with the requirements or determinations of the IRB, or an allegation of such non -compliance. d) Audit, inspection, or inquiry by a federal agency and any resulting reports (e.g. FDA Form 483.) e) Written reports of study monitors. f) Failure to follow the protocol due to the action or inaction of the investigator or research staff. g) Breach of confidentiality. h) Change to the protocol taken w ithout prior IRB review to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to a subject. i) Incarceration of a subject in a study not approved by the IRB to involve prisoners. j) Complaint of a subject that cannot be resolved by the research team. k) Premature suspension or termination of the protocol by the sponsor, investigator, or institution. l) Unanticipated adverse device effect (any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device tha t relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects). 9) Submit an updated disclosure of financial interests within thirty days of discovering or acquiring (e.g., through purchase, marriage, or inheritance) a new financial interest. 10) Do not accept or provi de payments to professionals in exchange for referrals of potential subjects (\"finder's fees.\") 11) Do not accept payments designed to accelerate recruitment that were tied to the rate or timing of enrollment (\"bonus payments.\") 12) See additional requirements of various federal agencies in Appendix A. These represent additional requirements and do no override the baseline requirements of this section. 13) If the study is a clinical trial and supported by a federal agency that follows th e Common Rule, one IRB-approved version of a consent form that has been used to enroll participants must be posted on a public federal website designated for posting such consent forms. The form must be posted after recruitment closes, and no later than 60 days after the last study visit. Please contact the study sponsor with any questions.

How do I submit a modification? Log into the electronic system using your NetID or UIN/SSO login and password. Complete the Modification/Amendment form in the electronic IRB system . Update the protocol and consent Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 19 of 61 as needed and attach all applicable documents. H ave the PI sign -off and submit the form. Maintain electronic copies of all information submitted to the IRB in case revisions are required. Please note that the proposed changes cannot be implemented until IRB approval has been granted. The research may continue but only as previously approved until the proposed modifications are approved by the IRB . How do I submit continuing review or administrative check -in? Log into the electronic system using your NetID or UIN/SSO login and password. Complete the Continuing Review form in the electronic IRB system and attach all requested documents. Have the PI sign-off and submit the form . Maintain electronic copies of all information submitted to the IRB in case revisions are required. If the continuing review i nvolves modifications to previously approved research, submit those modifications as a separate request for modification following the steps in 'How do I submit a modification ?'. If the continuing review application is not received by the date requested in the approval letter, you will be restricted from submitting new Human Research applications until the co ntinuing review or administrative check -in application has been received . If the approval of Human Research expires all Human Research procedures related to the protocol under review must cease, including recruitment, advertisement, screening, enrollment, consent, interventions, interactions, and collection or analysis of private identifiable information. Continuing Human Research proced ures is a violation of institutional policy . NOTE: Any study that remains in an EXPIRED state beyond 30 days and the PI has not submitted a continuing review as required is subject to administrative closure. How do I close out a study? If the research is closed to enrollment and all research -related interventions or interactions with participants have been completed and collection of identifiable private data (as described in the IRB-approved protocol) are finished, the study may be closed with the IRB . Alternatively, if the study was never initiated and the Investigators no longer have plans to pursue this project then the study should be closed with the IRB. Log into the electronic system using your NetID or UIN/SSO login and password. Complete the stud y closure f orm in the electronic IRB system and attach any requested documents. Have the PI sign-off and submit the form . Maintain electronic copies of all information submitted to the IRB in case additional information is required. Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 20 of 61 Any PI planning to lea ve the institution should submit a study closure or if appropriate transfer the study to another investigator. Studies that have not been transferred prior to the PI departure are subject to administrative closure. How long do I keep records? Maintain y our Human Research records, including signed and dated consent documents for at least three years after completion of the research. Maintain signed and dated HIPAA authorizations and consent documents that include HIPAA authorizations for at least six years after completion of the research. If your Human Research is sponsored , the time- frame for keeping the records may be in the contract. Be sure to contact the sponsor before disposing of Human Research records. What is an appropriate recruitment method? The following methods of recruiting subjects at TAMU are generally acceptable: Advertisements, flyers, information sheets, notices, TAMU email, internet postings and/or social media. Referrals may come from outside professionals that were provided general information letters or through snowball sampling methods for minimal risk social and behavioral research. You must include a description of your recruitment methods in the application, or in the protocol, you upload in to the electronic system. The IRB must approve the recruitment plan and the text of the recruitment materials. All approved recruitment materials will be stamped electronically with the IRB ID Number and the Approval Date by the HRPP staff and available for download from the electronic system . These IRB - stamped documents must be used for recruitment. For recruitm ent materials that are distributed to potential participants through electronic means for which you cannot feasibly use the stamped document, the study's IRB ID number and IRB approval date must be included in the following format: TAMU IRB#20XX -XXXX Appro ved: XX/XX/XXXX. See HRP -094 - SOP - Subjects Selection Recruitment and Payments for additional information. How do I obtain informed consent from participants? You must describe your process for obtaining informed consent from participants in your stud y protocol. The process you employ for obtaining informed consent will depend on the research setting and your participant population. The consent process is distinct from the consent document . When written documentation of consent is a requirement for IRB approval, a participant or their Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) must sign a consent document, but only after you have led participants through your approved consent process. See HRP-090 - SOP - Informed Consent Process for Research and sections 5, 6 and 7 of HRP -314 - WORKSHEET - Criteria for Approval for elements to include in your consent process. Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 21 of 61 Do research participants have to sign a consent document? On all non -exempt research a participant or their Legally Authorized Representative must sign a consent document if the IRB has not waived the requirement to obtain written documentation of informed consent. Signed consent includes a signature in an electronic format. An electronic signature means an electronic symbol or process attached to or logically associated with the record or form and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record or form . Include information about consent documentation in your study protocol. The IR B reviews the entire consent process and determines whether the process is adequate for obtaining and documenting informed consent. The IRB may waive the requirement to obtain written documentation of informed consent if certain conditions are met: The research must be no more that minimal risk; the procedures do not normally require written consent when research is not involved; the subject's signature would be the only record linking the subject to the consent document; and principal risk would be a b reach of confidentiality if signed; See the SOP: Written Documentation of Consent (HRP -091) and CHECKLIST: Waiver of Written Documentation of Consent (HRP -411) for the criteria the IRB uses to determine whether a waiver of written documentation of consent is acceptable. How do I document consent or assent? Use the signature block pages approved by the IRB. There are three different signature pages. Please select the one appropriate for your research: adults capable of providing consent, adults unable to provide consent and for parents to sign when enrolling their child in research. Complete all items, including dates and optional elements. See the SOP: Written Documentation of Consent (HRP -091) Any plans to document consent using an electronic format must be clearly described in your study protocol . Provide a copy of any web -based or electronic signature page to the IRB for approval. You must also keep a copy of each signed consent document with your study records and provide a copy of the consent document to the participant or their LAR. How do I obtain a waiver or alteration of informed consent? The IRB may waive the requirement for you to obtain informed consent from participants or to alter the consent process if certain conditions are met: the research is not FDA regulated; Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 22 of 61 the research does not involve non -viable neonates or newborn dried bl ood spots; the research is no more than minimal risk; the research will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of participants; the research could practicably not be carried out without the waiver; and when appropriate the subject will be provided with pertinent information after participation; See CHECKLIST: Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process (HRP -410) for the criteria the IRB uses to determine whether a waiver or alteration is acceptable. Include information in your protocol that will help the IRB make a determination. You must obtain informed consent prior to interacting or intervening with participants or using participants' private identifiable information for research purposes if the IRB has not waived or altered the consent process. What is an Unanticipated Problem? Unanticipated problems , in general, include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 1. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are desc ribed in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; 2. is related or possibly related to the research (this means that it is mo re likely than not, the incident, experience, or outcome was caused by the procedures involved in the research); and 3. suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm ) than was previously known or recognized. There are other types of incidents, experiences, and outcomes that occur during the conduct of human subjects research that represent unanticipated problems but are not considered adverse events. For example, som e unanticipated problems involve social or economic harm instead of the physical or psychological harm associated with adverse events. In other cases, unanticipated problems place subjects or others at increased risk of harm, but no harm occurs. See flow chart below. Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 23 of 61 Unanticipated Problem Flow Chart Ask all three questions An adverse event occurs in one or more subjects 3. Does the adverse event suggest that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm than was previously known or recognized? NOTE: If the adverse event is serious, the answer is always YES . Report the adverse event as an unanticipated problem 1. Is the adverse event unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency? 2. Is the adverse event related or possibly related to participation in the research? The adverse event is not an unanticipated problem. Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 24 of 61 Should I obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality for my research? Certificate s of Confidentiality (CoC) protect the privacy of research participants by prohibiting disclosure of identifiable, sensitive research information to anyone not connected to the research except when the participant consents or in a few other specific situations. The CoC will protect information from forced or compelled disclosure, e.g., to op pose a subpoena. Sensitive information includes but is not limited to information relating to sexual attitudes, preferences, or practices; the use of alcohol, drugs, or other addictive products, illegal conduct; or information if released, might be damaging to an individual's financial standing, employability, or reputation within the community or might lead to social stigmatization or discrimination; information pertaining to an individual's psychological well- being or mental health; and genetic information or tissue samples. Investigators and institutions have responsibilities associated with the CoC, including: 1) informing participants about the CoC, 2) not releasing participants identifiable, sensitive information except under limited circumstances, 3) upholding the CoC protections, and 4) informing investigators and institutions receiving a copy of protected information about the CoC protections. Since 2017, NIH -funded research meeting specific criteria are automatically deemed to have a Certificate of Confidentiality. Eligibility for an NIH -issued CoC may depend on the type of funding that is supporting the research. Issuance of a CoC for research that is not funded by NIH is at the discretion of NIH. More information on obtaining a CoC can be found at: Certificates of Confidentiality (CoC) | grants.nih.gov What additional requirements apply to International Research? International research conducted by the Texas A&M University investigators falls under the university's purview and guidelin es. Local cultural and religious norms should be considered as well as adherence to ethical standards and safeguards to protect the rights and welfare of the participants in foreign countries. Research projects conducted outside of the United States are to be reviewed and approved by the foreign country's equivalent of an IRB, as applicable . When there is no equivalent board or gr oup, investigators are expected to consult local experts or community leaders about the research and obtain their cooperation and support . Any cultural norms that differ from the university's guidelines and policies should be identified in the study applic ation. All international approvals must be in writing. If any non- English subjects are going to be recruited, please complete a Certificate of Translation form verifying accurate translation of applicable study documents. (See next section). Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 25 of 61 The Office o f Human Research Protections (OHRP) publishes the International Compilation of Human Research Standards | HHS.gov . The compilation is a listing of over 1000 standards on human subjects protections in 131 countries. OHRP also provides the Listing of Social- B ehavioral Research Standards | HHS.gov w hich is a summary of 27 social- behavioral research standards from around the world. Note: Please be aware of any Export Control laws that apply to your project involving a foreign country. Contact the Export Controls Office a t exportcontrols@tamu.edu for additional information . When is a Certificate of Translation Required for Consents or other Study Documents written in another Language? The IRB may approve enroll ment of participants unable to speak English provided that you have the resources to communicate effectively with the participants during recruitment, while obtaining consent, and for the duration of the research. Describe your resources and enrollment plans in detail in the IRB application. If you expect to enroll more than one non -English speaking subject in the United States or in a foreign country, you are expected to translate the approved English version of the consent into the appropriate language. A Certificate of Translation from a qualified interpreter is required to verify that the translation of the consent, survey or other documents are accurate. Those who translate the material are to provide a brief description of their qualifications, skills or experience f or serving in the role and sign the certificate of translation form. Please see the translation certificate template on the HRPP website: http://rcb.tamu.edu/humansubjects/forms/templates A professional translation service is required when the translated materials are for use in a clinical trial or other study that is greater than minimal risk. To reduce translation costs when using a professional translation service, it is recommended that you first obtain your IRB approval of the English -Language consent document. After you receive approval, have the consent document translated and submit to the IRB as an amendment to the study. How do I obtain Institutional Certification for submission of genomic data to an NIH -designated data repository? You may be required to submit genomic data to an NIH- designated data repository as a condition of your federal award. In those cases, the Institutional Official or designee must certify that your genom ic data sharing plan is acceptable. The IRB Office verifies for the Institutional Official or designee that your genomic data sharing plan meets the criteria for submission to an NIH -designated data repository. The IRB staff will notify you when the verification process is complete. Contact the IRB staff for additional instructions on how to submit that plan for verification. Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 26 of 61 How do I conduct research using genetic information? The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits discrimination in health coverage and employment based on genetic information. If you conduct research using genetic information, you are responsible for becoming familiar with the provisions of the law, both to implement measures to protect that information from inappropriate disclosures and to inform potential research participants about their rights under the law. Your consent document should contain the recommended GINA language. Th e Biomedical Template Consent Document (HRP -592)\" has sample language for you to include for participants. Additional information is available at: Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act Guidance (2009) | HHS.gov Does my funded project qualify for a 'Delayed Onset Determination'? There are some limited circumstances described by federal regulations (45 CFR 46.118) in wh ich IRB approval or exempt status is not required before an award is made by the sponsoring agency, because definitive plans for human subjects involvement cannot be described in the grant application. This is referred to as delayed onset human research. In the case of delayed onset human research, the principal investigator must submit an application to the IRB through the electronic system stating that the plans for human subjects are not fully developed and will occur during a future period of time. The explanation should contain as much detail as possible and indicate the portions of the grant that confirm the need for development of activities prior to the involvement of human subjects. Examples of developmental activities that are appropriate for a delayed onset determination include: o Procedures or questionnaires under development or other novel research instruments; o Completion of animal studies; o Purification of compounds; o Development of a device, assay or diagnostic test Delayed Onset Human Research status is not a type of IRB approval. Delayed Onset Human Research Status is not a substitute for IRB approval. No human subjects activities can occur until any proposed Human Subjects Research activity has been granted exempt status, or complete IRB appro val. Determinations are not issued through emails, phone calls or other means outside of a valid application through the electronic system. . Activities that are prohibited under a 'Delayed Onset Determination' include but are not limited to the following: o Advertising for possible subjects, or any other method of recruiting or soliciting interest in the research; o Pre-screening of records to identify possible subjects; Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 27 of 61 o Pilot studies, pre -tests, focus groups or surveys involving human research, no matter how few individuals participate. A Delayed Onset Human Research determination is not a mechanism for delaying an IRB application, nor to satisfy urgent federal agency r equirements for IRB approval prior to awarding the funds, when human subjects research activities are planned and can be described sufficiently in an IRB application. The funding agency may reject a delayed onset determination if they believe the project i s sufficiently developed and requires full IRB approval. The preparation of the IRB application and fulfillment of other compliance requirements almost never qualifies as \"significant pre -human subjects development activities\". If the grant has not been awarded but the research team has been informed that it is likely to receive the award (e.g., Just -in-Time, JIT, notification or any other indications that that funding is likely), the research team must have the IRB application ready for submission. The application must contain complete and accurate information to determine that all the criteria for approval or an exemption are met. Refer to WORKSHEET: Criteria for Approval (HRP -314) or WORKSHEET: Exemption (HRP -312). This includ es a complete copy of the grant and grant number as well as other relevant documents such as the protocol, consents, instruments, and any other data collection forms. When all requirements are satisfied, t he IRB will issue an Approval of Research or an Exe mption Determination letter. Do I need IRB review for TAMU classroom- based research projects conducted by students? TAMU recognizes that some student projects are conducted to fulfill course requirements and to teach students research methods. If these cl assroom activities are conducted by the students and not designed to produce new knowledge or to be generalizable or presented outside of the class, the IRB will not require review and approval. Please note that IRB templates and consent documents may not be used for research that will not be reviewed and approved by the IRB. Please contact the IRB staff if you have any questions. There are some student research projects that will require IRB review if they involve human subjects: Doctoral dissertations; fu nded research; research conducted through collaborations external to TAMU, Master's theses, and honors theses. All of these must be reviewed and approved by the IRB before students may begin their research. Research conducted by faculty, using students an d/or student data, does require IRB review and approval prior to implementation. (See next section). Do I need IRB review for TAMU classroom- based research projects conducted by faculty? Educational activities conducted by faculty or instructors in the classroom or with students and the intent is to generalize the information outside of the classroom or publish, will require submission to the IRB for review and approval. This includes both prospective and retrospective research conducted by Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 28 of 61 faculty or inst ructors using student records, interviews, surveys or other student data. IRB submission for review and approval is required prior to implementation of the research activities. Please note that research involving TAMU students or their data will also require the Registrar's approval. When is written parental permission required for research with minors in an educational setting? If your research requires accessing information from a student's records then FERPA requires that a consent for disclosure of educ ation records be signed and dated by the parent or eligible student. The consent should specify the records that may be disclosed, state the purpose of the disclosure, and identify the organization or other parties to whom the disclosure may be made 34 CFR \u00a7 99.30. There are other times when written consent may be required by the IRB, depending upon the research procedures and the degree of risk. What else do I need to know when conducting research with minors in an educational setting? The PPRA amendment u nder FERPA requires that schools give notification to parents and students about the administration of a survey, analysis, or evaluation of students when one or more of the following eight protected areas are involved: 1. political affiliations or beliefs of the student or the student's parent; 2. mental or psychological problems of the student or the student's family; 3. sex behavior or attitudes; 4. illegal, anti- social, self- incriminating, or demeaning behavior; 5. critical appraisals of other individuals with whom respondents have close family relationships; 6. legally recognized privileged or analogous relationships, such as those of lawyers, physicians, and ministers; 7. religious practices, affiliations, or beliefs of the student or student's parent; or 8. income (other than that required by law to determine eligibility for participation in a program or for receiving financial assistance under such program). The parent of a student has the right, upon request, to inspect a survey created by a third party before the survey is administered or distributed to the students. The IRB will verify that the site specific authorization from the school(s) includes the required FERPA/PPRA language to ensure appropriate notice is given t o the parents. Templates for Site Specific Authorizations are posted on the IRB website. What is Community Based Participatory Research? Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 29 of 61 Community -Based Participatory Research is a collaborative approach to research that involves the community partners in the research design and all aspects of the research process. CBPR begins with a research topic of importance to the community and aims to improve the quality of life of community members. Simply recruiting participants from the community is not CBPR. Do I need an FDA Investigational New Drug (IND) Application for research with drugs, biologics, dietary supplements or other products? Research involving drugs, biologics, dietary supplements, or other test articles including investigations of conventional foods studied for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of a disease will require additional regulatory oversight and involves knowledge of specific FDA regulations: Investigational New Drug Application (21 CFR Part 312) . The principal investigator must clarify for the IRB whether or not there is an FDA issued IND number for the use of a test article in human research that meets the definition of a drug as defined in the Federal Food Drug & Cosmetic Act section 201(g)(1). Appropriate documentation from the FDA, sponsor or investigator holding the IND should be included in the IRB application. The FDA regulates a product based upon the product's intended use. Drugs are defined as articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or animals . If the principal intent of the investigational use of the test article is to develop information about the products safety or efficacy, the submission of an IND is required unless all the conditions for an IND Exemption set forth in 21 CFR 312.2(b) are met (See FDA guidance: Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) \u2014 Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conduct ed Without an IND (fda.gov) ): The drug product is lawfully marketed in the United States. The investigation is not intended to be reported to FDA as a well- controlled study in support of a new indication and there is no intent to use it to support any other significant change in the labeling of the drug. In the case of a prescription drug, the investigation is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the drug. The investigation does not involve a route of administration, dose, patient population, or other factor that significantly increases the risk (or decreas es the acceptability of the risk) associated with the use of the drug product (21 CFR 312.2(b)(1)(iii)). If a dietary supplement or food product will be used in research designed to provide information on a health claim regardless of how readily available the product is for consumer use, the IRB will require the investigator or the sponsor to contact the FDA Review Division responsible for the r elevant therapeutic area of the proposed trial. In some cases, the FDA staff may request that the sponsor or investigator submit a summary of their proposed investigation in writing for FDA review before providing advice about whether or not an IND is requ ired. Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 30 of 61 A biological product is a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, protein (except any chemically synthesized polypeptide), or analogous product, or arsphenamine or derivative of arsphenamine (or any other trivalent organic arsenic compound). The biological product is subject to this requirement when the proposed research is for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings. Information on how to file an IND Application can be found on the FDA website: https://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/howdrugsaredevelopedandapproved/ap prov alapplications/investigationalnewdrugindapplication/default.htm When can research that requires and IND begin? Although, the IND goes into effect 30 days after the FDA has received the application (unless the FDA notifies the sponsor/investigator that the investigation is subject to clinical hold) the investigator may not begin the research, including recruiting, obtaining consent, and screening participants, until written verification of the IND is provided to the IRB and a formal IRB approval letter h as been issued. Please contact the IRB office for help if you are planning to conduct human research that involves drugs, biologics, dietary supplements or other products that may require an IND. See WORKSHEET: Drugs (HRP - 306). Do I need a n FDA IDE for use of an Investigational or Approved Device on Humans? All clinical evaluations of investigational devices, (investigational use also includes clinical evaluation of certain modifications or new intended uses of legally marketed devices) unless exempt, must have an approved IDE before the study is initiated. Clinical evaluation of devices that have not been cleared for marketing in the United States requires: an investigational plan approved by an institutional review board (IRB). If the study involves a significant risk device, the IDE must also be approved by FDA; informed consent from all patients; labeling stating that the device is for investigational use only; monitoring of the study and; required records and reports The IDE regulations (21 CFR 812) describe three types of device studies: significant risk (SR), nonsignificant risk (NSR), and exempt studies. SR device studies must have an IDE application approved by FDA and have IRB approval before they proceed, and the y must follow all of the IDE requirements. NSR device studies must follow the abbreviated IDE requirements at 21 CFR 812.2(b), including informed consent and IRB review, and do not require submission of an IDE application to FDA. The sponsor (or investigat or if acting as the sponsor) is responsible for making the initial risk determination, SR or NSR, and presenting it to the IRB. If the sponsor has determined that a device study is NSR, the IRB must review the sponsor's determination. If the IRB disagrees with the sponsor's NSR Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 31 of 61 assessment and decides the study is SR, the IRB must inform the clinical investigator and, where appropriate, the sponsor. The IRB should also document its SR/NSR determination in the IRB meeting minutes. Based on the information pr ovided, FDA will determine if a device study is SR, NSR, or exempt from the IDE requirements found in 21 CFR Part 812. If FDA makes the SR, NSR, or exempt determination for a study, the FDA's determination is final. Use WORKSHEET: Devices (HRP -307) and CHE CKLIST: Non - Significant Risk Device (HRP -418) for additional guidance. When should I register my research with ClinicalTrials.gov? Studies must be registered with ClinicalTrials.gov if: 1. they involve drugs, devices, or biologics that are regulated by the F ood and Drug Administration (FDA), OR 2. they are federally funded and meet the definition of a clinical trial, OR 3. there is a plan to publish the results in a medical journal AND the study meets the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) definition of a clinical trial ClinicalTrials.gov is the result of a federal law requiring that clinical trials be registered to improve public access to information about clinical research, promote public trust in research, and inform future research. In some cases, registration is also required for journal publication. The responsible party for an applicable clinical trial (ACT) must register the trial and submit results informatio n. The responsible party is the person who sponsors, or initiates, the trial. If this is a TAMU investigator, the term 'Sponsor -investigator' identifies this role in the record. To register a study, investigators must use the Protocol Registration and Resu lts System (PRS) Login to ClinicalTrials.gov PRS - ClinicalTrials.gov . T o get started, investigators should contact a PRS administrator by emailing irb@tamu.edu to have an account created for them. Food and Drug Administration Registration Requirements The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires registration with ClinicalTrials.gov for all applicable clinical trials ( ACTs) that were initiated after 9/27/2007, or were initiated before 9/27/2007, but were ongoing as of 12/26/2007. Applicable clinical trials generally include interventional studies (with one or more arms) of FDA - regulated drugs, biological products, or devices that meet one of the following conditions: The trial has one or more sites in the United States The trial is conducted under an FDA in vestigational new drug application (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE) The trial involves a drug, biologic, or device that is manufactured in the United States or its territories and is exported for research Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 32 of 61 Registration is not required for small trials to determine the feasibility of a device or to test prototype devices where the primary outcome measure relates to feasibility, and not to health outcomes. ClinicalTrials.gov FDAAA Office of Human Research Protections Requirements The Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP) requires that each clinical trial conducted or supported by a Federal Department or agency, one IRB -approved informe d consent form used to enroll subjects must be posted by the awardee conducting the trials on a publicly available Federal Web site (i.e. Clinicaltrials.gov ) that will be established as a repository for such informed consent forms. Additionally, the informed consent form must be posted on the Federal Web site after the clinical trail is closed to recruitment, and no later than 60 days after the last study visit by any subject, as required by the protocol. National Institutes of Health Registration Requir ements Effective January 18, 2017, National Institutes of Health (NIH) requires registration at ClinicalTrials.gov for all clinical trials (bio -medical or behavioral interventions) funded wholly or partially by NIH. How can I use or disclose Protected Health Information (PHI) for Research and Comply with the Privacy Rule? The Privacy Rule describes the ways in which covered entities can use or disclose PHI, including for research purposes. In general, the Rule allows covered entities to use and disclose PHI for research if authorized to do so by the subject in accordance with the Privacy Rule. In addition, in certain circumstances, the Rule permits covered entities to use and disclose PHI without Authorization for certain types of research activities. For example, PHI can be used or disclosed for research if a covered entity obtains documentation that an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Privacy Board has waived the requirement for Authorization or allowed an alteration. The Rule also allows a covered entity to enter into a Data Use Agreement for sharing a Limited Data Set. There are also separate provisions for how PHI can be used or disclosed for activities preparatory to research and for research on decedents' information. Please see The Texas A&M University System guidance for conducting research with PHI OGC- Guidance - on-Conducting- Research -with -PHI-OGC-7- TAMU Pri vacy Officer at privacy@tamu.edu for more information. How do I get additional information and answers to questions? This document and the polic ies and procedures for the Human Research Protection Program are available on the HRPP Web Site at Toolkit - Division of Research (tamu.edu) .

When a subject decides to withdraw from a clinical trial, the investigator conducting the clinical trial should ask the subject to clarify whether the subject wishes to withdraw from all components of the trial or only from the primary interventional component of the trial. If the latter, research activities involving other components of the clinical trial, such as follow -up data collection activities, for which the subject previously gave consent may continue. The investigator should explain to the subject who wishes to withdraw the importance of obtaining follow -up safety data about the subject. 2 http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/subjectwithdrawal.html Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 34 of 61 2. Investigators are allowed to retain and analyze already co llected data relating to any subject who chooses to withdraw from a research study or whose participation is terminated by an investigator without regard to the subject's consent, provided such analysis falls within the scope of the analysis described in t he IRB -approved protocol. This is the case even if that data includes identifiable private information about the subject. 3. For research not subject to regulation and review by FDA, investigators, in consultation with the funding agency, can choose to honor a research subject's request that the investigator destroy the subject's data or that the investigator exclude the subject's data from any analysis. 4. When seeking the informed consent of subjects, investigators should explain whether already collected data about the subjects will be retained and analyzed even if the subjects choose to withdraw from the research. 5. When research is covered by a certificate of confidentiality, researchers: a. May not disclose or provide, in any Federal, State, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding, the name of such individual or any such information, document, or biospecimen that contains identifiable, sensitive information about the individual and that was created or compiled for purposes of the research, unless such disclosure or use is made with the consent of the individual to whom the information, document, or biospecimen pertains; or b. May not disclose or provide to any other person not connected with the research the name of such an individua l or any information, document, or biospecimen that contains identifiable, sensitive information about such an individual and that was created or compiled for purposes of the research. c. May disclose information only when: i. Required by Federal, State, or lo cal laws (e.g., as required by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or state laws requiring the reporting of communicable diseases to State and local health departments), excluding instances of disclosure in any Federal, State, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding. ii. Necessary for the medical treatment of the individual to whom the information, document, or biospecimen pertains and made with the consent of such individual; iii. Made with the consent of the individual to whom the information, document, or biospecimen pertains; or iv. Made for the purposes of other scientific research that is in compliance with applicable Federal regulations governing the protection of human participants in research. d. Researchers must inform participants of the protections and limitations of certificates of confidentiality (see language in HRP -502 - TEMPLATE CONSENT DOCUMENT ). i. For studies that were previously issued a Certificate and notified participants of the protections provided by that Certificate, NIH does not expect participants to Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 35 of 61 be notified that the protections afforded by the Certificate have changed, although IRBs may determine whether it is appropriate to inform participants. ii. If part of the study cohort was recruited prior to issuance of the Certificate, but are no longer activity participating in the study, NIH does not expect participants consented prior to the change in authority, or prior to the issuance of a Certificate, to be notified that the protectio ns afforded by the Certificate have changed, or that participants who were previously consented to be re - contacted to be informed of the Certificate, although the IRB may determine whether it is appropriate to inform participants. e. Researchers conducting re search covered by a certificate of confidentiality, even if the research is not federally funded, must ensure that if identifiable, sensitive information is provided to other researchers or organizations, the other researcher or organization must comply wi th applicable requirements when research is covered by a certificate of confidentiality. Appendix A -2 . . . . . Additional Requirements for FDA -Regulated Research 1. When a subject withdraws from a study:3 a. The data collected on the subject to the point of withdrawal remains part of the study database and may not be removed. b. An investigator may ask a subject who is withdrawing whether the subject wishes to provide continued follow -up and further data collection subsequent to their withdrawal from the interventional portion of the study. Under this circumstance, the discussion with the subject would distinguish between study -related interventions and continued 3 http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126489.pdf Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 36 of 61 follow -up of associated clinical outcome information, such as medical course or laborato ry results obtained through non -invasive chart review, and address the maintenance of privacy and confidentiality of the subject's information. c. If a subject withdraws from the interventional portion of the study, but agrees to continued follow -up of associ ated clinical outcome information as described in the previous bullet, the investigator must obtain the subject's informed consent for this limited participation in the study (assuming such a situation was not described in the original informed consent form). IRB approval of informed consent documents is required. d. If a subject withdraws from the interventional portion of a study and does not consent to continued follow -up of associated clinical outcome information, the investigator must not access for purpo ses related to the study the subject's medical record or other confidential records requiring the subject's consent. e.

Single IRB Studies 1. That National Institutes of Health expects that all sites participating in multi- site studies involving non -exempt human subjects research funded by the NIH will use a single Institutional Review Board (sIRB) to conduct the ethical review required by the Department of Health and Human Services regulations for the Protection of Human Sub jects at 45 CFR Part 46. a. This policy applies to the domestic sites of NIH -funded multi -site studies where each site will conduct the same protocol involving non -exempt human subjects research, whether supported through grants, cooperative agreements, contr acts, or the NIH Intramural Research Program. It does not apply to career development, research training or fellowship awards. b. This policy applies to domestic awardees and participating domestic sites. Foreign sites participating in NIH -funded, multi -site studies will not be expected to follow this policy. c. Exceptions to the NIH policy will be made where review by the proposed sIRB would be prohibited by a federal, tribal, or state law, regulation, or policy. Requests for exceptions that are not based on a legal, regulatory, or policy requirement will be considered if there is a compelling justification for the exception. The NIH will determine whether to grant an exception following an assessment of the need. 2. The Office for Human Research Protections exp ects that all sites located in the United States participating in cooperative research must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States. The reviewing IRB will be identified by the Federal depa rtment or agency supporting or conducting the research or proposed by the lead institution subject to the acceptance of the Federal department or agency supporting the research. The following research is not subject to this provision: a. Cooperative research for which more than single IRB review is required by law (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe); or b. Research for which any Federal department or agency supporting or co nducting the research determines and documents that the use of a single IRB is not appropriate for the particular context. c. For research not subject to paragraph (b) of this section, an institution participating in a cooperative project may enter into a joi nt review arrangement, rely on the review of another IRB, or make similar arrangements for avoiding duplication of effort. Consultation with the TAMU HRPP is required prior to entering into any arrangement. Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , . . . . .

Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , . . Emergency/Disaster Preparedness Considerations for Investigators Conducting Human Research Investigators conducting human research should be aware of the following additional considerations associated with managing Human Research during an emergency/disaster scenario (e.g., extreme weather events, natural disasters, man -made disasters, infectiou s disease pandemics, etc.) related to investigators' ongoing interactions with research subjects and the institutional review board (IRB) in such cases. During Emergency/Disaster Scenarios: Deciding Whether a Study -Specific Risk Mitigation Plan for Ongoi ng Research Is Needed In general, investigators should develop a study -specific emergency/disaster risk mitigation plan for their research unless one of the following is true: Research does not involve in -person interaction with research subjects. Researc h can be conducted as written while adhering to additional institution -level and HRPP -level guidance and requirements regarding the emergency/disaster event. The research is externally sponsored, and the sponsor has developed a protocol -specific risk mitigation plan for the research. The research has been voluntarily placed on hold for recruitment and all research procedures (except for necessary follow -up procedures to be done consistently with additional institution- level and H RPP-level guidance and requirements regarding the emergency/disaster event). Tools and Resources for Developing Study-Specific Emergency/Disaster Risk Mitigation Plans for Ongoing Research Review \"HRP -108 - FLOWCHART - Study -Specific Emergency -Disaster Ris k Mitigation Planning\" and \"HRP -351 WORKSHEET - Protocol -Specific Emergency -Disaster Risk Mitigation Plan\" for general guidance on developing study -specific risk mitigation plans. Voluntary Holds on Human Research Activities Investigators may voluntarily elect to place all recruitment, enrollment and research procedures on temporary hold during emergency/disaster scenarios if doing so will better ensure the safety of research subjects and would not create any additional risks to the safety and welfare o f research subjects. Such voluntary holds on research activity do not require IRB notification or review. Submitting Study -Specific Emergency/Disaster Risk Mitigation Plans for IRB Review Investigator Manual NUMBER DATE PAGE HRP -103 September 16 , 2022 61 of 61 If immediate modification of the research is necessary to eliminat e an apparent immediate hazard to a subject, take action and notify the IRB within five business days following the standard pathway to submit reportable new information. For all other study modifications made to ensure the ongoing safety of research sub jects during emergency/disaster scenarios, submit a study amendment and all relevant new or modified study materials to the IRB prior to imple mentation . Other Reportable New Information Considerations During Emergency/ Disaster Scenarios The IRB's list of reportable events includes two items for which additional clarification and guidance may be helpful during emergency/disaster scenarios: \"Failure to follow the protocol due to the action or inaction of the investigator or research staff.\" Emphasis on ac tion or inaction of the investigator or research staff has been added because this requirement does not include action or inaction of the research subject. For example, study teams may notice an increase in the number of subjects who do not arrive for sche duled research visits under emergency/disaster circumstances . Failure of a research participant to appear for a scheduled research visit is not noncompliance due to action or inaction by the investigator or research staff, and therefore does not require re porting to the IRB. \"Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to a subject.\" During emergency/disaster scenarios, there will be cases where there is sufficient time to receive IRB approval of any prop osed modifications to previously approved research, and in such cases, investigators should follow standard IRB procedures for submitting modifications. However, there may be other cases where investigators conducting research with procedures that impact the health and wellbeing of participants must make more immediate changes to the protocol or investigational plan to minimize or eliminate immediate hazards or to protect the life and well -being of research participants. Such changes may be implemented with out IRB approval, but are required to be reported to the IRB within five business days afterward in accordance with IRB policies and procedures for submitting reportable new information. These procedures are generally related to protocols involving medical treatments or interventions. "}
