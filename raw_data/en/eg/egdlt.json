Lawsuits originally filed in 2018 and 2019 against CVS and Walgreens [WBA](https://www.forbes.com/companies/walgreens) [PPA](https://www.forbes.com/investment-funds/ppa/) [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/walmart-cvs-face-trial-for-putting-sham-homeopathic-products-next-to-real-meds/). Lower courts dismissed the lawsuits, but now the District's highest court has unanimously decided to allow the trials to move forward. While some customers may read \"homeopathy\" as synonymous with \"natural,\" the term has a specific technical meaning. Homeopathy is based on an alternative interpretation of chemistry that is seen as inconsistent with contemporary science. Homeopathic practitioners believe that certain ingredients that would cause illness in healthy people, when extremely diluted in water, imbue the water with the ability to fight that illness. The current scientific consensus is that pills containing substances that have been so diluted have no active ingredient, thus no mechanism of action. Skeptic and debunker James Randi would frequently demonstrate the inefficacy of homeopathic remedies by downing an entire bottle of homeopathic sleep aids on-stage during speeches, as he discussed in a YouTube video embedded in a 2011 [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2011/02/08/133569580/homeopathic-medicine-overdosers-survive-unscathed) article. The stunt inspired a yearly event by UK skeptic group 10:23 Campaign where members would megadose homeopathic sleep aids \u2014 sometimes at one million times the recommended dose \u2014 to demonstrate that they had no effect. In an online discussion about the revived lawsuits [last week on RetailWire](https://retailwire.com/discussion/will-a-lawsuit-leave-cvs-and-walgreens-feeling-sick-over-homeopathic-remedies/), some of the experts on the RetailWire BrainTrust saw the onus on retailers to make sure customers know what they are getting with homeopathy. \"Retailers who sell medical products to their customers have a responsibility to protect their customers from products that are misleading at best and dangerous at worst,\" wrote [Gary Sankary](https://retailwire.com/author/gary-sankary/), retail strategy at Esri. \"Homeopathy falls into that category. These 'drugs' are only legal when their dilution shows no ill (or any) effects on patients. If these stores insist on carrying homeopathic remedies, they belong with vitamins and dietary supplements, not with the other drugs. Why not put cigarettes next to asthma medications? There was an alternative view at one time, that smoking helps relax the lungs.\" \"I believe that if you sell a product you have a responsibility to consumers to ensure that product is safe and will deliver the results the manufacturer says it will deliver,\" wrote [Georganne Bender](https://retailwire.com/author/georganne-bender/), principal at Kizer & Bender Speaking. \"Reasonable or not, retailers are responsible for the products they sell just as much as a plumber or doctor is expected to be accountable for the quality of their services,\" wrote [DeeAnn Campbell](https://retailwire.com/author/deann-campbell/), chief strategy officer at Hoobil8. \"In this day and age of digital signage, new store formats and websites it shouldn't be hard to advise, warn or inform customers when they are using non-traditional products.\" [Stephen Needel](https://retailwire.com/author/stephen-needel/), managing partner at Advanced Simulations, pointed out that pharmacies may well have a business incentive to pull homeopathic products all together. \"Retailers run the risk of damaging their reputation when selling products that are 'bad' - whether 'bad' means ineffective, visually or gustatorily unappealing, deceptive, etc.,\" wrote Dr. Needel. \"While I'm a caveat emptor believer, there's a limit, and when health is on the line, these products are over that limit.\" The regulatory gray era governing homeopathic remedies in the U.S. has occasionally had serious ramifications for customer safety. For instance in 2009, cold remedy Zicam was marketed as homeopathic despite containing a significant amount of zinc, according to a [Quad City Herald](https://www.qcherald.com/columnists/consumers-assume-homeopathic-products-are-%E2%80%98natural%E2%80%99-and-cannot-be-harmful-not-always-case) article on the debacle. While in a true homeopathic remedy the zinc would have been diluted near or past the point of non-existence, the amount of zinc in Zicam was concentrated enough to cause permanent anosmia (loss of smell) in some customers, leading to a U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) intervention. In 2019 the FDA issued draft [guidance](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-drug-class/homeopathic-products) for an enforcement approach to homeopathic products. No homeopathic products have been approved by the FDA. For retail expert [Gene Detroyer](https://retailwire.com/author/gene-detroyer/), the FDA's slow movement on this was the crux of the issue. \"Homeopathy (and supplements) are the Wild West of drugs,\" wrote Mr. Detroyer. \"The FDA does not regulate them and only reacts after a problem occurs. If our regulating body does not set the standard, how will the retailer know if the specific products are effective or dangerous?\" And that, for one BrainTrust member, opened up a whole other can of worms. \"It doesn't matter if homeopathic medicine works or not (my own opinion is 'sometimes'),\" wrote [Paula Rosenblum](https://retailwire.com/author/paula-rosenblum/), co-founder of RSR Research. \"What does matter is that it's a different universe than traditional pharma. One might ask why it's okay for them to carry vitamins as well \u2014 after all, inflated claims are made about them all "}
