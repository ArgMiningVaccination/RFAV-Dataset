Since nearly every diffuser uses a heat source to break down the components of essential oils, some residue will remain. Once that residue builds up, the unit can overheat or even stop functioning properly. This means you need to clean it regularly. [I've tried many different types of diffusers through the years](https://www.insider.com/guides/home/best-essential-oil-diffusers) and right now my favorite is the [Vitruvi Essential Oil Diffuser](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biip_051620_how-to-clean-oil-diffuser-20&h=df5ce4d3891c007cd6fcdd773c4c013bf1b255d687409d17d3e0141949d7928d&postID=61b8efc8f2a36b1ac9f42e5d&postSlug=guides%2Fhome%2Fhow-to-clean-essential-oil-diffuser&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB01MYXNJES%2Fref%3Das_li_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26tag%3Dbiip_051620_how-to-clean-oil-diffuser-20%26camp%3D1789%26creative%3D9325%26linkCode%3Das2%26creativeASIN%3DB01MYXNJES%26linkId%3D3b726aa96cdba7d5ccb48d66672e95fb&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false). But no matter what style or dispersing method I've used, I've taken time to read the manual for directions on disassembling the unit and how to clean it. If you have lost the manual, most companies offer information online or by calling customer service. As a cleaning expert and consultant to several small appliance manufacturers, I recommend thoroughly cleaning a unit each time you change scents and at least once a month to remove dust and oil residue. If you use it daily, bi-monthly cleaning is even better. Cleaning the ultrasonic plate or chip, which breaks down the oil into base molecules and causes water vibrations to disperse ultra-fine mist into the air, is the most important. Failure to clean that component can result in low diffusion or even cause your diffuser to stop functioning. Steps to routinely clean an essential oil diffuser These are the steps I use each week to clean my essential oil diffuser. It takes only five minutes or so and keeps the mist flowing smoothly. - Make sure the diffuser is unplugged from the power outlet. - Empty any water and oil mixture that remains in the diffuser reservoir. - Dampen a [microfiber cloth](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biip_051620_how-to-clean-oil-diffuser-20&h=5603977349bfffdd216d57413d24b37e3577566623cf353e720ff51f3d620fd4&postID=61b8efc8f2a36b1ac9f42e5d&postSlug=guides%2Fhome%2Fhow-to-clean-essential-oil-diffuser&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB007FDU05A%2Fref%3Das_li_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26tag%3Dbiipf_052620_how-to-clean-ceramic-cookware-20%26camp%3D1789%26creative%3D9325%26linkCode%3Das2%26creativeASIN%3DB007FDU05A%26linkId%3Ddd9e27dae8c3b8b2607e12781ac1ab61&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false)and place a small dot of a plant-based dishwashing liquid like [Home Made Simple](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biip_051620_how-to-clean-oil-diffuser-20&h=efbee5408046d56ddd2c4b4abf3d7738a515a66825e9a7d9fe75dd693e7bd236&postID=61b8efc8f2a36b1ac9f42e5d&postSlug=guides%2Fhome%2Fhow-to-clean-essential-oil-diffuser&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07Q2HCVTH%2Fref%3Das_li_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26tag%3Dbiip_051620_how-to-clean-oil-diffuser-20%26camp%3D1789%26creative%3D9325%26linkCode%3Das2%26creativeASIN%3DB07Q2HCVTH%26linkId%3D79f44cc37646a51038de169b2836e6d7&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false)on the cloth. - Wipe out the water reservoir with the soapy cloth.
