SARS -CoV-2 transmission in a Georgia school district \u2014 United States, December 2020 -January 2021. Clinical Infectious Diseases. 04.17.2021. https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance -article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab332/6232104 pdf in-person detailed assessm ents of in -school SARS -CoV-2 transmission in multiple contexts are needed to inform mitigation measures and improve safety. 2. In the Atlanta school district under study mitigation measures included: mandatory masking, social distancing where possible, thr ee sided desk plexiglass protection, increased classroom ventilation, increased personal and facility cleaning, and symptom screening. 3. Rigorous case and contact definitions were devised and public health personnel performed investigations to determine d emographics, symptoms, and contacts. 4. Investigators offered PCR testing, symptom assessment, demographic characterization, and limited whole genome sequencing at the C DC during the study period: December 2020 - January 2021. Findings: 1. 86 index cases were analyzed: staff, 33 (38.4%); students, 53 (61.6%); 1,119 contacts were identified including 112 staff and 1,007 students with a median age of 14 years (IQR 5 -19 years). 2. 688 contacts were tested for SARS -CoV-2: negative tests, 620 (91 .3%) including 70 staff contacts (89.7%) , 550 student contacts (90.4%); positive tests, 68 staff contacts (10.3%), 60 student contacts (9.8%). 3. Secondary attack rate (SAR) was 8.7%: highest or 23.8% in indoor sports settings (basketball, wrestling, cheer leading); 18.2% among staff interactions (lunch, meetings); and 9.5% within elementary school classrooms. 4. SAR was higher for staff index cases (13.1%, 9.0 -17.2) compared with student index cases (5.8%, 3.6 -8.0), driven by the elementary school setting w here staff index cases had an SAR of 15.0% (10.2 -19.8) compared with student index cases (2.7%, 0.7-5.3). 5. Based on epidemiologic evidence and WGS, 14 clusters were identified . This study recognizes the important role staff have in acquiring and transmit ting SARS -CoV-2 and confirms the role close contact indoor sports has in transmission. Other References: Fischer CB. Mask adherence and rate of COVID -19 across the United States. PLOS One. 04.14.2021. Mask adherence and rate of COVID -19 across the United States (plos.org) pdf Premise/Methods: 1. Masking is a standard mitigation measure to prevent the spread of SARS -CoV-2, but the standard has been met with variable political and social a cceptance in the United States. 2. Although efficacy studies on masking have been performed, the impact of variable masking adherence in the United States has not been studied. 3. For all 50 states and D.C., data on mask wearing and COVID -19 cases, were abstracted from publicly available sources by month for April - September, 2020. 4. This study classified a state and D.C. as having a high case rate in a given month if a 2 -week rate was >200 cases per 100,000 people, per CDC classifications of highest r isk of transmission. Results: 1. States with mask adherence by >75% of the population was associated with lower COVID -19 rates in the subsequent month. 2. Importantly, the study shows that mask wearing adherence, regardless of mask wearing policy, may curb the spread of COVID -19 infections. FIGURE. Proportion of states with high COVID -19 rates among those in the low and high mask adherence quartiles in the preceding months. April 21st, 2021 : #79 Perl SH. SARS -CoV-2-Spec ific Antibodies in Breast Milk a fter COVID HCW are a priority in receiving a vaccine for SARS -CoV-2: some of these individuals were pregnant at the time of vaccination. 2. This is a prospective cohort study of a convenience sample of breastfeeding women (either exclusive or partial) belonging to vaccine -target groups who chose to be vaccinated in Israel. 3. Breast milk samples were collected before administration of the vaccine and then once weekly for 6 weeks starting at week 2 after the first dose. 4. Samples were assessed for IgG and IgA levels against SARS -CoV-2 and a demographic and clinical questionnaire provided to enrollees. Findings: 1. 84 women provided 504 breast milk sam ples. 2. IgA breast milk antibodies were significantly elevated at 2 weeks with 86.1% of samples positive at week 4. 3. IgG breast milk antibodies were low early but by week 4, 91.7% of samples were positive. 4. Although paired breast milk/serum samples we re not obtained and neutralizing capability not assessed, this study suggests robust secretion of maternal antibodies into breast milk following vaccination. FDA News Release: Coronavirus (COVID -19) Update: FDA alone, is no longer supported by the FDA EUA as therapy for COVDID -19. 2. Data from the CDC national genomic surveillance program show an increased frequency of SARS -CoV-2 variants that are expected to be resistant to bamlanivimab administered alone. 3. Alternative monoclonal antibody therapies remain available under EUA, including REGEN -COV an d bamlanivimab/etesevimab administered together. 4. EUA for monoclonal antibody combinations are for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID -19 in adults and pediatric patients ( > 12 years of age and at least 40 kg) with positive SARS -CoV-2 testing and are at high risk for progressing to severe disease.

Urgent and routine referrals to the UK National Health System have increased 100% over the past year. 2. The true scale of the issue and its drivers are unclear but contributing factors include: social isolation, diminished physic al activity, food insecurity, and loss of person -to-person social and clinical contact . 3. Public health messages have emphasiz ed the dangers posed by excess weight in exacerbating the ris k of worse outcomes of COVID -19 and may aggravate and/or stigmatize eating behaviors . 4. Loss of school days limits recognition of mental health disorders and return to school can create anxiety that could exacerbate the risk of eating disorders. 5. A well -funded multidisciplinary approach to eating disorders is necessary as their increase is not likely to subside after the pandemic resolves.
