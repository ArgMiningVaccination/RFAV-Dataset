We've got eight of our favorite cleansers that will help your skin stay balanced, plus we'll tell you how to choose one that's perfect for your skin type and budget. To be gentle on the skin, pH cleansers have an acidic range that is close to the skin's own. They are safe for use on the skin and remove impurities including dirt, debris, dead skin cells, and excess oils without disrupting the acid mantle or leaving a sticky residue. How does it work? Maintaining a healthy acid mantle is essential for avoiding irritation and inflammation and keeping your complexion smooth and bright since the acid mantle is the invisible protective layer that shields our skin from germs and other dangerous chemicals. Using soap and plain water may create large changes in skin's acidity, perhaps causing harm to this barrier function; consequently, pH balancing cleansers are helpful for preventing this problem. If you choose a product, make sure it doesn't include any scents, silicones, sodium sulfate, or colors since they may all cause skin irritation when used often. Below, we rounded up some of the best cleansers on the market to help you with all of your skincare needs. [1.
