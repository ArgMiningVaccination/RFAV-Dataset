DOI: 10.1086/651466Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 3, June 2010 317 Deleuze and the Anthropology of Becoming by Joa o Biehl and Peter Locke Philosopher Gilles Deleuze emphasizes the primacy of desire over power and the openness and flux of social elds. In this article, we place our ethnographic projects among the urban poor in Braziland Bosnia-Herzegovina in dialogue with Deleuze's cartographic approach to subjectivity and hisreflections on control and the transformative potential of becoming . As people scavenge for resources and care, they must deal with the encroachment of psychiatric diagnostics and treatments in brokenpublic institutions and in altered forms of common sense. By reading our cases in light of Deleuze'sideas, we uphold the rights of microanalysis, bringing into view the immanent elds that people, inall their ambiguity, invent and live by. Such elds of action and signicance\u2014leaking out on allsides\u2014are mediated by power and knowledge, but they are also animated by claims to basic rightsand desires. In making public a nuanced understanding of these elds\u2014always at risk of disap-pearing\u2014anthropologists still allow for larger structural and institutional processes to become visibleand their true effect known. This eldwork/philosophical dialogue highlights the limits of psychiatricmodels of symptoms and human agency and supplements applications of concepts such as biopolitics,structural violence, and social suffering in anthropology. Continually adjusting itself to the reality ofcontemporary lives and worlds, the anthropological venture has the potential of art: to invokeneglected human potentials and to expand the limits of understanding and imagination\u2014a peopleyet to come. The ultimate aim of literature is to set free, in the delirium,this creation of a health or this invention of a people, thatis, a possibility of life. (Deleuze 1997:4) An Empirical Lantern The late Gilles Deleuze was particularly concerned with the idea of becoming : those individual and collective struggles to come to terms with events and intolerable conditions and toshake loose, to whatever degree possible, from determinantsand denitions\u2014\"to grow both young and old [in 1995:170; 2001). In becoming, as Deleuze sawit, one can achieve an ultimate existential stage in which lifeis simply immanent and open to new relations\u2014camara-derie\u2014and trajectories. Becoming is not a part of history, hewrote: \"History amounts only to the set of preconditions,however recent, that one leaves behind in order to 'become,'that is, to create something new\" (Deleuze 1995:171). In the urban-poor settings in which we work\u2014in Brazil Joao Biehl is Professor of Anthropology at Princeton University (116 Aaron Burr Hall, Princeton, New Jersey 08544-1011, U.S.A.[jbiehl@princeton.edu]). Peter Locke is a Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton University's Center for Health and Wellbeing (WoodrowWilson School, Wallace Hall, Princeton University, Princeton, NewJersey 08544-1013, U.S.A.). This paper was submitted 11 IX 08 andaccepted 11 II 09.and Bosnia-Herzegovina\u2014people are at the mercy of volatile economies and pay a high physical and subjective price to get by day-to-day. As people scavenge for resources and care, they must deal with the encroachment of psychiatric diagnostics and treatments in broken public institutions and in altered forms of common sense. We nd Deleuze's reflections pro- vocative and helpful as we address lives in contexts of clinical and political-economic crisis. In the eld, the unexpected happens every day, and new causalities come into play. We are drawn to human efforts to exceed and escape forms of knowledge and power and to express desires that might be world altering. How can anthropological methods and con- cepts incorporate evidence of these kinds of becoming? What would a Deleuze-inspired ethnography accomplish that others might not? And how could such work challenge dominantmodes of medical and political intervention? It is time toattribute to the people we study the kinds of complexities we acknowledge in ourselves, and to bring these complexities into the forms of knowledge we produce and circulate. We have no grand philosophical aspirations and do not wish to reduce Deleuze's enormously complicated venture into a theoretical system or set of practices to be appliednormatively to anthropology. In this article, we limit ourselvesto thinking through his insights on the relationships betweenpower, desire, and sublimation and his cartographic approachto social elds and the unconscious (see Massumi 2002; Stew-318 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 3, June 2010 art 2007). These insights help us to better grasp what is at stake for individuals and interpersonal relations in the contextof new rational-technical interventions. Exploring the utilityof Deleuze's ideas in light of the ethnographic realities westudy\u2014mental illness, poverty, and the aftermath of war\u2014can highlight the limits of psychiatric models of symptomsand human agency (Biehl, Good, and Kleinman 2007;DelVecchio Good et al. 2008; Jenkins and Barrett 2004). Itcan also provide a helpful supplement to prevailing appli-cations of Michel Foucault's concepts of biopower and gov-ernmentality (Bourgois 1995; Farmer 2001; Scheper-Hughes1992). We are concerned with human matters that dominantepistemologies and interventions do not routinely concep-tualize or account for. In emphasizing the powers and potentials of desire (both creative and destructive), the ways in which social elds cease-lessly leak and transform (power and knowledge notwith-standing), and the in-between, plastic, and ever-unnishednature of alife, Deleuze lends himself to inspiring ethno- graphic efforts to illuminate the dynamism of the everydayand the literality and singularity of human becomings.Through close attention to people moving through brokeninstitutions and infrastructures in the making and with carefulobservation always complicating the a priori assumptions ofuniversalizing theory, ethnographic work can make public theconstellations through which life chances are foreclosed and highlight the ways desires can break open alternative path-ways. For in learning to know people, with care and an \"em-pirical lantern\" (Hirschman 1998:88), we have a responsibilityto think of life in terms of both limits and crossroads\u2014wherenew intersections of technology, interpersonal relations, de-sire, and imagination can sometimes, against all odds, propelunexpected futures. This is not to give up on explanation or the careful dis- cernment of relations of causality and afnity in social andmedical phenomena. The question, rather, lies in our recep-tivity to others, in what kinds of evidence we assemble anduse\u2014the voices to which we listen and the experiences weaccount for\u2014and in how we craft our explanations: whetherour analytics remain attuned to the intricacy, openness, andunpredictability of individual and collective lives. Just as med-ical know-how, international political dynamics, and socialrealities change, so too are people's lives (biological and po-litical) in flux. An openness to the surprising and the deployment of cat- egories that are important in human experience can makeour science more realistic and, we hope, better. As economistAlbert O. Hirschman, an ethnographer at heart, writes, \"I liketo understand how things happen, how change actually takesplace\" (Hirschman 1998:67). People's everyday struggles andinterpersonal dynamics exceed experimental and statisticalapproaches and demand in-depth listening and long-termengagement. Anthropologists demarcate uncharted social ter- ritories and track people moving through them. The mapswe produce allow the navigators\u2014the interpreters\u2014to con-sider these territories and their life force (their capacities andpossibilities as much as their foreclosures). In our reflections we draw from Biehl's work with Catarina Moraes, a young woman abandoned by her family and left todie in an asylum called Vita in the southern Brazilian city ofPorto Alegre (Biehl 2005). Largely incapacitated and said to bemad, Catarina spent her days in Vita assembling words in whatshe called \"my dictionary.\" She wrote, \"The characters in thisnotebook turn and un-turn. This is my world after all.\" Ca-tarina's puzzling language required intense listening, bracketingdiagnostics, and an open reading. Since rst encountering her,Biehl thought of her not in terms of mental illness but as anabandoned person who was claiming experience on her ownterms. Catarina knew what had made her a void in the socialsphere\u2014\"I am like this because of life\"\u2014and she organizedthis knowledge for herself and her anthropologist, thus bringingthe public into Vita. \"I give you what is missing.\" Her ex-family, she claimed, thought of her as a failed medication reg-imen. The family was dependent on this explanation to excuseitself from her abandonment. In Catarina's words, \"T o wantmy body as a medication, my body.\" Her condition spoke ofthe pharmaceuticalization of mental health care in Brazil; inhis ethnographic work, Biehl charts the social side effects thatcome with the unregulated encroachment of new medical tech-nologies in urban-poor settings. Catarina's life tells a larger story about shifting human values and the fate of social bonds in today's dominant modeof subjectication at the service of science and capitalism. Shesuggests that these days, one can become a medico-scienticthing and an ex-human at the convenience of others. In the merciless interface of capitalist and scientic discourses, weare all a new kind of proletariat\u2014hyperindividualized psy-chobiologies doomed to consume diagnostics and treatments(for ourselves and for others) as we seek fast success in econ-omies without empathy (Martin 2007). But Catarina foughtthe disconnections that psychiatric drugs introduced in herlife\u2014between body and spirit, between her and the peopleshe knew, in common sense\u2014and clung to her desires. Sheworked through the many layers of (mis)treatment that nowcomposed her body, knowing all too well that \"my desire isof no value.\" Catarina wrote to sublimate not only her own desires for reconnection and recognition but also the social forces\u2014fa-milial, medico-scientic, economic\u2014aligned against her. Whileintegrating drug experience into a new self-perception and lit-erary work (the drug AKINETON is literally part of the newname Catarina gives herself in the dictionary: CATKINE), shekept seeking camaraderie and another chance at life. Biehl dis-cusses Catarina's creative capacity in dialogue with Deleuze'sidea of \"a delicate and incomplete health that stems from effortsto carve out life chances from things too big, strong and suf-focating\" (Deleuze 1997:3). Her \"minor literature\" grounds anBiehl and Locke The Anthropology of Becoming 319 ethnographic ethics and gives us a sense of becoming that dominant health models would render impossible. We also draw from Locke's recent eldwork in postwar Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina (hereafter, following the stan-dard local abbreviation, BiH), to highlight the utility of De-leuze's suggestion that one should write for the benet of a\"missing people\" (Deleuze 1997:4). Sarajevo with Years of trauma-oriented psycho-social projects have made psychiatric diagnostics\u2014collectivedepression and post-traumatic stress\u2014integral to commonsense in BiH. Such clinical-sounding assessments have theeffect of emphasizing damage over possibility, determinationover flight, painting the city primarily in terms of its wounds(which are indeed deep and bleed still) while disregarding thehopes and desires\u2014and resistances to neoliberal economicforms\u2014that pain also communicates. Just as psychiatry silences Catarina's struggle to understand and reclaim her experience, in BiH the psychologization of war's aftermath \"vitiate[s] the moral and political meaning of subjective complaints and protests\" (Biehl, Good, and Klein-man 2007:3). In this way each of our cases takes up a struggle(individual and collective, respectively) to navigate public andprivate imperatives remade by intersecting scientic and eco-nomic rationalities. In each case a void is engineered in theplace of older modes of self-assessment\u2014which neverthelessand by swerving paths continue to thrive. The strict application of a Foucauldian theoretical sensi- bility\u2014seeking out, for example, the ways hysterical, fear-mongering nationalist politics, neoliberal market reforms andconcomitant corruption, and years of humanitarian servicesand international supervision have newly \"normalized\" sub-jectivity and social relations\u2014would miss the anxious uncer-tainty and open-endedness that inflects life in Sarajevo. Bothanguish and vitality simmer beneath the city's shell-scarred\u2014but slowly brightening, rejuvenating\u2014surfaces, and Deleuzeis helpful in nding an analytics that can illuminate the in-terdependence of these twin intensities: the ways symptomsmay index not only darknesses and dominations past andpresent but also the minor voices of a \"missing people\" thatspeak within alternate \"universes of reference,\" capable, per-haps, of one day propelling more social transfor-mations in BiH (Deleuze 1997:64). Sarajevo's \"missing people\" is composed of layers, each with its own force of intertwined grief and aspiration. Herethe wartime dead (thousands of whom remain literally miss-ing) continue to inhabit political claims and tightly held griev-ances (Wagner 2008). Here, who one was before the war (whatone believed and whom one loved) no longer has value amidnew economies and forms of governance\u2014but persists, allthe same, in hopes and frustrations. And here, lived experi-ence continually escapes the social categories\u2014competingethnic and/or victim identities\u2014that dominate the publicsphere (Bougarel, Helms, and Duijzings 2007). In such a con-text\u2014and many others\u2014of routinized urgency and crisis, thehuman sciences are challenged to respect and incorporate,without reduction, the angst, uncertainty, and the passion for the possible that life holds through and beyond technicalassessments. Perhaps this task is what ethnography does best. Moving in the Direction of the Incomplete We read Deleuze together with our ethnographic cases in order to reassert the symbiotic relationship between close em-pirical engagement with people (through eldwork) and the-oretical innovation in anthropology. We are not advocatinganother philosophical scheme to be conrmed by the gureswe bring out of the eld. As John Borneman and AbdellahHammoudi remind us, the \"tendency for anthropologists todeploy their work only as illustrative cases for philosophicaltrends or concepts threatens to make anthropology into asterile intellectual exercise\" (Borneman and Hammoudi 2009:17). The point is well taken. In their relentless drive to the-orize, anthropologists run the danger of caricaturing complexrealities, neglecting key realms of experience, and missinglived ironies and singularities that might complicate and en-rich analytics. People are missing, in multiple senses; Deleuze,we want to suggest, opens up paths to allowing them theirdue value and force within the core of anthropological work. Long-term engagement with people is a vital antidote to what Hirschman identies as \"compulsive and mindless the-orizing.\" The quick theoretical x has taken its place in ourculture alongside the quick technical x. For Hirschman, asfor us, people come rst. This respect for people, this attentionto how political discourses are manufactured and to the sheermateriality of life's necessities, makes a great deal of differencein the kind of knowledge we produce. Throughout this article,we are concerned with the conceptual fecundity of people'spractical knowledge. All too readily disqualied by both schol-ars and policy makers, this knowledge may well yield new orcounter theories of human agency, for example, as well asnew approaches to politics and more effective policy solutions.As Hirschman writes, \"In all these matters I would suggest alittle more reverence for life, a little less straitjacketing of thefuture, a little more allowance for the unexpected\u2014and a littleless wishful thinking\" (Hirschman 1971:338). In a recent interview assessing anthropology's intellectual health, George Marcus worries that since Writing Culture (Clifford and Marcus 1986), his path-breaking theoretical in-tervention with James Clifford and others, the discipline hasbeen \"suspended\": \"There are no new ideas and none on thehorizon\" (Marcus 2008:3). Marcus looks to the anthropologyof science and to science studies, which have indeed beeninnovative, as possible inspirations; this eld, however, oftengives a privileged place to the ofcial makers of expertise,technology, and policy. Marcus acknowledges that since the1980s, anthropologists have played a useful role in studyingemerging global political economies, but he does not thinkthat this has been enough for \"anthropologists to stimulatethemselves intellectually\" (Marcus 2008:2-3). Investment in320 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 3, June 2010 public anthropology, in Marcus's view, is a \"symptom\" of a \"weak center\" and disciplinary disorganization rather than anindicator of professional vitality and theoretical innovationin its own right (Marcus 2008:1). For Marcus, \"what's left to do\" while anthropology awaits the renewal or transformation of the \"ideas that move andstimulate it . . . is to follow events, to engage ethnographicallywith history unfolding in the present, or to anticipate what isemerging\" (Marcus 2008:3). Marcus seems to designate the corework of anthropology as a remainder: a matter of record build-ing and knowledge accumulation that (at least) can occupy usproductively as we await the development of a new guidingtheory or paradigm to \"motivate\" our research (Marcus 2008:3). It seems to us, however, that anthropology has (and hasalways had) a theoretical productivity as it explores how peoplenavigate contemporary political, economic, and technologicalcongurations and that it is stronger for the multiplicity ofphilosophical ideas it engages in any given period. Certainly to carry out our analyses, we need models, types, theories\u2014abstractions of various kinds. But the kinds of par-adigms we search for, the ways in which we assemble them,and the authority we ascribe to them also make a great dealof difference. What if we broadened our sense of what countsas theoretical innovation and left aside, even if for a moment,the need for central discursive engines\u2014the modus operandithat shaped much of anthropology in the twentieth century?Epistemological breakthroughs do not belong only to analysts.The cumulative experiences of \"the unpredictability of the po-litical and social effects of technological inventions\" (Canguil-heim 1998:318)\u2014borne by people navigating contemporaryentanglements of power and knowledge\u2014are also epistemo-logical breaks that demand anthropological recognition. Simplyengaging with the complexity people's lives projects\u2014in of our theo-retical apparatuses. What would it mean for our research meth-odologies and ways of writing to consistently embrace thisunnishedness, seeking ways to analyze the general, the struc-tural, and the processual while maintaining an acute awarenessof the inevitable incompleteness of our theories? New and useful ideas do not have to look like overarching paradigms nor do we have to attribute to them uncondi-tional authority. Recent anthropology is rich with productive,people-centered explorations of the present and the past. AnnL. Stoler, for example, has broadened Foucault's approach todiscipline and power/knowledge by highlighting questions ofrace and desire in colonial practices (Stoler 1995; see alsoBoon 1982). In her recent book Along the Archival Grain , she draws from Deleuze's emphasis on desire over power to ex-plore a \"symptomatic space\" in the craft of colonial 2009:7; see Biehl and Moran-Thomas 2009).Attending to specic people, situations, and events\u2014\"minorhistories\"\u2014in the administrative bodies of the Dutch EastIndies, Stoler brings into view affects and spaces of uncertaintywithin hegemonic discourses and their attempted applica-tions. Through and beyond domination, we are faced with the matrices through which ethics and care (or disregard)were constituted in real time. Efforts in public anthropology have expanded our sense of where innovation comes from and what it is good for. PaulFarmer (2001, 2003, 2008) and colleagues at Partners inHealth, for example, have used anthropological approachesinnovatively to critique economic and public health ortho-doxies and establish new standards of care and interventionfor poverty-stricken AIDS patients. While expanding realmsof feasibility in medicine and policy, their work also raisesthorny questions about the ethics and rationale of prioritizingAIDS over other afflictions of poverty and the long-term im-plications of subsuming human rights under the banner ofimmediate medical rights. Adriana Petryna (2002) has chartedpeople's common struggle in Ukraine to provide evidencethat their illnesses are linked to the Chernobyl nuclear disasterand thereby become eligible for welfare and care in a newdemocratic state form. By exploring connections that makelegal and medical forms newly personal, Petryna's concept ofbiological citizenship helps to elucidate shifting state-market structures and the modes of survival and political belongingthat they make available. And Anna Tsing exhibits an inspiringinventiveness in her book Friction (Tsing 2004) as she tries, through ethnographic and textual experimentation, to crafta grounded analytics of the global and a voice that is at onceanthropological and political. Ethnographic realities are never fully reducible to the books and theories we bring to the eld. What does it take for the\"life in things\"\u2014the minor voices, missing peoples, \"ill-formed\" and tentative \"collective enunciations\" that seem toDeleuze to carry so much potentially transformative vitality\u2014to acquire a social force and to attain recognition and politicalcurrency? What role can anthropology play in this process, andhow can we write in a way that unleashes something of thisvitality instead of containing it, reducing it, simplifying it? Inwhat follows, we attempt to begin to explore these questionsand the implications for ethnographic research and writing ofa handful of Deleuze's ideas. \"T o write is certainly not to imposea form (of expression) on the matter of lived experience,\" saysDeleuze. \"Literature rather moves in the direction of the ill-formed or the incomplete\" (Deleuze 1997:1). We are more interested in writing fora certain vision of anthropology and the anthropologist's relationship to peoplethan against a set of simplied foils. This is one of the reasonsthat we work through two ethnographic cases. Where Biehl'swork with Catarina focuses on the literary force of an indi-vidual life, Locke's discussion of postwar Sarajevo takes updenitions, diagnoses, and marginal experiences of collectiv-ities, and in this way we attempt to provide complementaryangles from which to think with Deleuze's ideas about be-coming. Individual biography is replete with collective in-flections and implications, just as collective categories andalternative solidarities can come through only in the under-standing of individual lives and stories; thus, actual peopleBiehl and Locke The Anthropology of Becoming 321 and their lives, words, and affects\u2014their subjectivities\u2014are at the core of both of our cases, both explicitly and betweenthe lines. There is an improvisatory quality to our collaboration as we shift between individual narrators and a unied voice. Inboth of our cases, we hope to convey the messiness of thesocial world and the real struggles in which our informantsand their kin are involved. In the eld and at each juncture,a new valence of meaning is added, a new incident illuminateseach of the lives in play. In addition to indicating the insti-tutional and clinical processes that bear on our interlocutors,we try to evoke the non- or semi-institutional and temporaryspaces in which life chances are also shaped, turbulent affectsare borne and shared, and difcult circumstances are imbuedwith partial meanings. Details reveal nuanced fabrics of sin-gularities and the institutional, political-economic, and sci-entic logics that keep problematic situations from improv-ing. The ethnographic ethos of ambivalence, ambiguity, andopenness inflects our own subjectivities in the way we try toportray our main characters: as living people on the page,with their own mediated subjectivities, whose actions are con-tingent without being inevitable, caught in a constricted andintolerable universe of choices that remains the only sourcefrom which they can craft alternatives. Human Body? I (Biehl) rst met Catarina in March 1997, and I saw heragain when I returned to Vita in January 2000. Vita had beenfounded in 1987 as a rehabilitation center for drug addictsand alcoholics. Soon its mission was enlarged. An increasingnumber of people who had been cut off from social life wereleft there by relatives, neighbors, hospitals, and the police.Vita's team then opened an inrmary where the abandoned,like Catarina, waited with death. Catarina was in her mid- thirties and her health had deteriorated considerably. Seatedin a wheelchair, she insisted that she suffered from \"rheu-matism.\" Catarina seemed dazed and spoke with great dif-culty. But she was adamant: \"I speak my mind. I have nogates in my mouth.\" Although her external functions were almost dead, she re- tained a puzzling life within her body. Her \"dictionary\" wasa sea of words, references to all kinds of illness, places androles she no longer inhabited, and people she once knew andlived for. \"Documents, reality, tiresomeness, truth, saliva, vo-racious, consumer, saving, economics, Catarina, spirit, pills,marriage, cancer, Catholic church, separation of bodies, di-vision of the state, the couple's children.\" Her seemingly dis-aggregated words were in many ways an extension of theabject gure she had become in family life, in medicine, inBrazil. \"Medical records, ready to go to heaven,\" she wrote. \"Dollars, Real, Brazil is bankrupted, I am not to be blamed, without a future. Things out of justice. Human body?\" Some 50 million Brazilians (more than a quarter of the population) live far below the poverty line; 25 million peopleare considered indigent. Although Vita was in many ways a microcosm of such misery, it was distinctive in some respects.A number of its residents came from working and middle- class families and once had been workers with their own households. Others had once lived in medical or state insti-tutions from which they had been evicted, thrown into thestreets, or sent to Vita. As I learned by engaging health ofcialsand human rights activists, despite appearing to be a no- man's-land cut adrift, Vita was in fact entangled with several public institutions in its history and maintenance. Porto Ale-gre contained more than two hundred such institutions, mostof which were euphemistically called \"geriatric houses.\" Some70% of them operated as underground businesses. These pre- carious places housed the unwanted in exchange for their welfare pensions; a good number of them also received statefunds or philanthropic donations and were used as platformsfor clientelistic politics. Work with Catarina helped to break down totalizing frames of thought that made the reality of Vita and other zones of abandonment more assumed than analyzed, that is, a common sense that ultimately left no one accountable for the abandoned. These are some of the things Catarina told me during our conversations in early 2000: \"Maybe my family still remem- bers me, but they don't miss me. . . . My ex-husband sent me to the psychiatric hospital. . . . The doctors said that they wanted to heal me, but how could they if they did not know the illness? . . . My sister-in-law went to the health post to get the medication for me. . . . Why is it only me who has to be medicated? . . . My brothers want to see production, progress. They brought me here. . . . They say that it is better to place us here so that we don't have to be left alone, athome, in solitude . . . that there are more people like us here. And all of us together, we form a society, a society of bodies.\" Caregivers at Vita told me that Catarina was louca (mad) and fora da casinha (out of her mind, or literally, \"out of her little home\"). They gave her tranquilizers and said that they knew nothing about her life outside of Vita. As for her grow- ing paralysis, they reasoned, \"It must have been from giving birth.\" I was fascinated by what she said and by the prolif- eration of writing. Her words did not seem otherworldly to me nor did I think they were a direct reflection of Vita's power over her or a reaction against it. They carried the force of literality. \"Even if it is a tragedy? A tragedy generated in life?\" Those were Catarina's words when I asked her for the details of her story one day. \"I remember it all. My ex-husband and I lived together and we had the children. We lived as a man and a woman. I worked in the shoe factory, but he said that I didn'tneed to work. He worked in the city hall. He used to drinka bit after work when he played billiards in a bar. I had nothingagainst that. One day, however, we had a silly ght becausehe thought that I should be complaining about his habits andI wasn't. That ght led to nothing. Afterwards, he pickedanother topic to ght about. Finally, one day he said that he322 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 3, June 2010 had gotten another woman and moved in with her. Her name was Rosa. What could I do?\" I remembered the phrase \"the separation of bodies\" in Ca- tarina's dictionary, and it seemed to me that her pathology resided in that split and in the struggles to reestablish other social ties. In Vita, out of that lived fragmentation, the family was remembered. \"I behaved like a woman. Since I was a house- wife, I did all my duties, like any other woman. I cooked, and I did the laundry. My ex-husband and his family got suspicious of me because sometimes I left the house and attended to other callings. They were not in agreement with what I thought. My ex-husband thought that I had a nightmare in my head. Hewanted to take that out of me, to make me a normal person. They wanted to lock me in the hospital. I escaped so as not to go to the hospital. I hid myself; I went far. But the police and my ex-husband found me. They took my children.\" She was constantly recalling the events that led to her aban- donment. \"When my thoughts agreed with my ex-husband and his family, everything was ne. But when I disagreed with them, I was mad. It was like a side of me had to be forgotten.The side of wisdom. They wouldn't dialogue, and the science of the illness was forgotten. Science is our consciousness, heavy at times, burdened by a knot that you cannot untie. \"After my ex-husband left me, he came back to the house and told me he needed me. He threw me onto the bed saying,'I will eat you now.' I told him that that was the last time . . . I did not feel pleasure though. I only felt desire. Desire to be talked to, to be gently talked to.\" In abandonment, Catarina recalled sex. There was no love, simply a male body enjoying itself. No more social links, nomore speaking beings. Out of the world of the living, her desire was for language, the desire to be talked to . I reminded Catarina that she had once told me that the worst part of Vita was thenighttime, when she was left alone with her desire. She kept silent for a while, and then made it clear that seduction was not at stake in our conversation: \"I am not asking a nger from you.\" She was not asking me for sex, she meant. Catarina looked exhausted, though she claimednot to be tired. At any rate, it seemed that she had broughtthe conversation to a fecund point, and I also felt like I couldno longer listen. No countertransference, no sexual attraction, I thought, but enough of all these things. The anthropologist is not immune. I promised to return the next day to continue and suggested that she begin to write again. But my resistance did not deter her from recalling her earliest memory, and I marveled at the power of what I heard\u2014an image that in its simplicity appeared to concentrate the entire psyche. I remember something that happened when I was three years old. I was at home with my brother Altamir. We were verypoor. We were living in a little house in the plantation. Thena big animal came into the house\u2014it was a black lion. Theanimal rubbed itself against my body. I ran and hugged mybrother. Mother had gone to get water from the well. That'swhen I became afraid. Fear of the animal. When mother came back, I told her what had happened. But she said thatthere was no fear, that there was no animal. Mother said nothing. This could have been incest, sexual abuse, a rst psychotic episode, the memory of maternal and paternal abandonment, or simply a play of shadows and imagination\u2014we will never know. The image of the house, wrote Gaston Bachelard, \"would appear to have become the topography of our intimate being. A house constitutes a body of images that give mankind proofs or illusions of stability\" (Bachelard 1994:xxxvi). In this earliest of Catarina's recollections, nothing is protecting the I. It is in Vita that she recalled the animal so close to the I. Thisstory speaks to her abandonment as an animal as well as tothe work the animal performs in human life. In this last sense, the animal is not a negation of the human, I thought\u2014it isa gure through which Catarina learned to produce affect and which marks her singularity. When I told her it was time for me to leave, Catarina replied, \"Y ou are the one who marks time.\" The Primacy of Desire over Power Catarina's puzzling trajectories and desires required a different analytical approach. It was not enough to deconstruct her classication as mad or her connement in institutions of control. Claiming language and agency, she was not reducible to \"bare life\" (Agamben 1998), and her knowledge revealed complicated realities and the noninstitutionalized spaces in which life chances crystallized. Deleuze, who did not share Foucault's condence in the determining force of power arrangements, is helpful here. In a 1976 article called \"Desire and Pleasure,\" Deleuze reviewed Foucault's then recently published The History of Sexuality (Foucault 1990 [1976]). In that book, Foucault took a new step with regard to his earlier work in Discipline and Punish (Foucault 1975): now power arrangements were no longer simply normalizing, they were constituents of sexuality. But \"I emphasize the primacy of desire over power,\" wrote De- leuze. \"Desire comes rst and seems to be the element of a micro-analysis\" (Deleuze 2006:126). Attentive to historical preconditions and singular efforts of becoming, Deleuze said that he pursued \"lines of flight.\" For him \"all organizations, all the systems Michel calls biopower, in effect reterritorialize the body\" (Deleuze 2006:131). But a social eld, rst and foremost, \"leaks out on all sides\" (De-leuze 2006:127). In an interview with Paul Rabinow in themid-1980s, Deleuze once again emphasized that he and Fou-cault did not have the same conception of society. \"For me,\"he said, \"society is something that is constantly escaping inevery direction. . . . It flows monetarily, it flows ideologically.It is really made of lines of flight. So much so that the problemBiehl and Locke The Anthropology of Becoming 323 for a society is how to stop it from flowing. For me, the powers come later\" (Deleuze 2006:280). According to Deleuze, desire\u2014via the inventions, escapes, and sublimations it motivates\u2014is constantly undoing, or atleast opening up, forms of subjectivity and territorializationsof power. Even the concept of assemblage , taken up not long ago by Ong and Collier (2005) to name emergent global con-gurations (e.g., \"technoscience, circuits of licit and illicitexchange, systems of administration or governance, and re-gimes of ethics or values\" [Ong and Guattari For Deleuze and Guattari, assemblages shifting among \"segments\"\u2014institutions,powers, desires\u2014that constantly, simultaneouslyconstruct, entrench, and disaggregate their own constraintsand oppressions. Thus, an assemblage, they wrote, is \"a con-cretization of power, of desire, of territoriality or reterrito-rialization, regulated by the abstraction of a transcendentallaw. But we must declare as well that an assemblage has pointsof deterritorialization; or that it always has a line of escapeby which it . . . makes the segments . . . liberatesdesire from all its concretizations in order to dissolve them\"(Deleuze and Guattari 1986:86). This emphasis on desire and the ways\u2014humble, marginal, minor\u2014that it cracks through apparently rigid social eldsand serves as the engine of becoming gures centrally inDeleuze's divergences from both Foucault and Freud. In De-leuze's view, Freud and his disciples offer a philosophy of top-down penetration of depths, of memory and memorialization,one that digs through the past for the core, dening truthsof a person's being encapsulated in childhood mother-fatheroedipal dynamics. This is an archaeological conception of psy- choanalysis, according to Deleuze. His use of this term alsoinvokes his critique of Foucault, whose archaeology of thesubject traces the ways in which he or she is constituted andconned by, for example, the categories of expert discoursesin again what might crudely be sketched as a vertical or top-down movement. Freud and Foucault each dene the subjectby his or her dependencies and determinations\u2014by past trau-mas and unconscious complexes on the one hand and byentangled regimes of power and knowledge on the other. In the essay \"What Children Say,\" Deleuze revisits Freud's seminal case study of Little Hans (Freud 1959) to develop\"cartography\" as an alternative analytics to Freud's oedipalarchaeology. The objects of cartography, what the analystmaps, are milieus \u2014worlds at once social, symbolic, and ma- terial, infused with the \"affects\" and \"intensities\" of their ownsubjectivities\u2014and trajectories \u2014or the journeys people take through milieus to pursue needs, desires, and curiosities orto simply try to nd room to breathe beneath social con-straints. \"The trajectory merges not only with the subjectivityof those who travel through a milieu, but also with the sub-jectivity of the milieu itself, insofar as it is reflected in thosewho travel through it\" (Deleuze 1997:61).For Deleuze, the analytic challenge is to illuminate desire and possibility, not (only) determination by the mother-father or any other force. Against the causality of origins and the weight of memory, our analyses must reveal mobilization and flight into indeterminate futures. \"From one map to the next,\" Deleuze suggests, \"it is not a matter of searching for an origin, but of evaluating displacements . Every map is a redistribution of impasses and breakthroughs, of thresholds and enclosures, which necessarily go from bottom to top\" (Deleuze 1997:61). In other words, it is \"no longer an unconscious of commem-oration but one of mobilization\" (Deleuze 1997:61). Dening the subject in terms of the archaeology of his/her dependencies may be less revealing than mapping out his/her movements through space, time, and social elds\u2014people's lines of flight, their escapes, as well as their blocked passages,moments when the libido is stuck or pushed backward. Done right, hints Deleuze, such maps can show the Dionysian force of the libido as it breaks down forms and constraints by investing the indenite , which, he urges, \"lacks nothing\": \"It is the determination of a becoming, its characteristic power, the power of an impersonal that is not a generality but a singularity at its highest point\" space for possibil- ity,what could be , as a crucial dimension of what is or what was. It brings crossroads\u2014places where other choices mightbe made, other paths taken\u2014out of the shadow of deter-ministic analytics. It brings alternatives within closer reach.Ethnography, at its best, strives for the same achievements,and Deleuze's approach has obvious potential to inform andinspire new partnerships and methods. As Michael M. J. Fischer argues, subjectivities are now silences, fears, terror machineries, pleasure princi-ples, illusions, fantasies, displacements, and secondary revi-sions, mixed with reason, rationalizations, and paralogics\u2014all of which have powerful sociopolitical dimensions and ef-fects\" (Fischer 2007:442). In Fischer's view, we need to attendto more than the \"enunciative function\" of the subject: sub-jectivity does not merely speak as resistance, nor is it simplyspoken (or silenced) by power. It continually forms and re-turns in the complex play of bodily, linguistic, political, andpsychological dimensions of human experience, within andagainst new infrastructures, value systems, and the transform-ing afflictions and injustices of today. The anthropology of present workings of subjectivities\u2014 as individuals struggle to articulate desire, pain, and knowl-edge in novel constellations\u2014can help us chart paths acrosslarger structures and forces of repetition, technologies at play,and \"the slippery slopes of unforeseeable consequences ofaction\" (Fischer 2007:426). It can help us account for people,experiences, and voices that remain unaddressed and raisecalls for new ethics and politics. Ethnography matters.324 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 3, June 2010 The Psychiatric Aura of Reality Catarina's speech and writing captured what her world had turned into\u2014a messy world lled with knots that she couldnot untie, although she desperately wanted to because \"if wedon't study it, the illness in the body worsens.\" Her wordsspoke of real struggles, the ordinary world from which shehad been banished and of multiple therapeutic itineraries thatbecame the life of her mind. An immense parceling out ofthe specic ways communities, families, and personal livesare assembled and valued and how they are embedded inlarger entrepreneurial processes and institutional rearrange-ments comes with the on-the-ground study of a single Other.But Catarina was not simply trying to make sense of theseprocesses and rearrangements and nd a place for herself inhistory. By going through all the components and singularitiesof events, she was resuming her place in them as in a be-coming. She crafted a line of flight: \"T o make peace with time,the hours, minutes, and seconds, with the clock and the cal-endar, to be well with all, but mainly with the pen.\" Writing helped her to draw out the best of herself and to make it all endurable: \"From the letters I form words, andfrom the words I form sentences, and from the sentences Iform a story.\" Catarina created a new letter character thatresembled a K, and with it new names for herself such as CATAKINA, CATKINA, CATIEKI, and CATKINE. She ex-plained, \" Kis open on both sides. If I wouldn't open the character, my head would explode.\" In other words: \"Oneneeds to preserve oneself. I also know that pleasure in life isvery important, the body of the Other. I think that peoplefear their bodies. . . . I have desire, I have desire.\" As Catarinarethought the literal realities that led to her exclusion, shedemanded one more chance in life. And there was alwayssomething in the way she moved things from one register tothe other\u2014past life, Vita, and desire\u2014that eluded anthro-pological understanding. This movement was her own lan-guage of abandonment. From 2000 to 2003, I took numerous trips to southern Brazil to work with Catarina, sometimes for weeks, sometimesfor months. I studied all 21 volumes of the dictionary shewas composing and discussed the words and associations withher. In her recollections and writing, I found clues to the people, sites, and interactions that constituted her life. As an anthropologist, I was challenged to reconstruct the world of her words, so to speak. I wanted to directly address the vari- ous circuits in which her intractability gained form, circuits that seemed independent of both laws and norms\u2014the \"in- betweenness\" through which social life and ethics are empir- ically worked out. With Catarina's consent, I retrieved herrecords from psychiatric hospitals and local branches of theuniversal health care system. On a detective-like journey, Iwas also able to locate her family members in the nearby cityof Novo Hamburgo. Everything she had told me about thefamilial and medical pathways that led her into Vita matchedwith the information I found in the archives and in the eld\u2014a eld that was not given but that became manifest through returns, diligence, and care. Catarina was born in 1966 and grew up in a very poor place, in the western region of the state of Rio Grande doSul. After nishing fourth grade, she was taken out of schooland became the housekeeper as her youngest siblings aidedtheir mother in agricultural work. The father had abandonedthe family. In the mid-1980s, two of her brothers migratedand found jobs in the booming shoe industry in Novo Ham-burgo. At the age of 18, Catarina married Nilson Moraes, anda year later she gave birth to her rst child. Shady deals,persistent bad harvests, and indebtedness to local vendorsforced Nilson and Catarina to sell the land they inherited totake care of Catarina's ailing mother, and in the mid-1980s,the young couple decided to migrate and join her brothersin the shoe industry. In the coming years, she had two morechildren. As her illness progressed and her marriage disin-tegrated, her eldest two children went to her husband's family,and her youngest daughter was given up for adoption. Catarina had become too much of a burden for her family, a history tangled by the complications of disease, poverty, andfear, and she was frequently hospitalized and overmedicatedwith powerful antipsychotics. Y et, exploring her medical rec-ords, I uncovered something unknown. Catarina actually suf-fered from a rare neurodegenerative disorder\u2014Machado Jo-seph Disease\u2014that caused her to lose her ability to walk and,over time, shut her down almost entirely (Jardim et al. 2001).It was an illness that had afflicted Catarina's mother, and, asin her case, presented itself after childbirth. Reaching thisdiagnosis took me through a maze of medical hoops, and asthe picture of her illness became clearer, I took her to ageneticist and neurologist who nally made the correct di-agnosis and provided the best possible care. All these materials, experiences, and ideas found their way into my book Vita (Biehl 2005) alongside an institutional analysis of why and how zones of social abandonment pro-liferate in contemporary urban spaces. In many ways, Catarinawas caught in a period of political and cultural transition\u2014politicians were operationalizing a state reform to make Brazilviable in an \"inescapable\" economic globalization by allowingalternative partnerships with civil society to maximize thepublic interest within the state (Biehl 2007; Cardoso 1998).InVita, I show how such large-scale change and redistribution of resources, power, and responsibility take place locally.Overburdened families and individuals are suffused with thematerials, patterns, and paradoxes of these processes, whichby and large they are left to negotiate alone. In this context,the family is increasingly the medical agent of the state (pro-viding and at times triaging care), and medication has becomea tool for such deliberate action. Free drug distribution is a central component of Brazil's universal health care system, a democratic gain of the late1980s. Increasing calls for the decentralization of services andthe individualization of treatment, exemplied by the mentalhealth movement, coincided with dramatic cuts in fundingBiehl and Locke The Anthropology of Becoming 325 for health care infrastructure and with the proliferation of pharmaceutical treatments. Data from the government's da-tabase for health resource use between the years 1995 and2005 show that the country's psychiatric reform was accom-panied by a signicant fall in the percentage of resourcesdedicated to psychiatric care (Andreoli et al. 2007). In 1995,for example, psychiatric hospital admissions accounted for95.5% of the mental health budget, down to 49.3% in 2005.Meanwhile, there has been a dramatic increase in resourceallocation for community services and for medications. Med- ication provision rose from 0.1% in 1995 to 15.5% in 2005\u2014a 155-fold increase in the national budget. Second-generationantipsychotic drugs were responsible for 75% of the expensesfor medications in this period. Interestingly, the rise in med-ication allocation was followed by a relative decrease in thenumber of psychiatrists hired\u2014psychologists and social work-ers have been hired at three times and twice, respectively, therates of psychiatrists from 1995 to 2005. In engaging with this new regime of public health and in allocating their own overstretched and meager resources, fam-ilies become proxy psychiatrists . Illness breaks intimate house- hold relations with a deadly force. Families can dispose oftheir unwanted and unproductive members, sometimes with-out sanction, on the basis of individuals' noncompliance withtheir treatment regimens. Psychopharmaceuticals are centralto the story of how personal lives are recast in this particularmoment of socioeconomic change and of how people createlife chances vis-a `-vis what is bureaucratically and medically available to them (Petryna, Lakoff, and Kleinman 2006). Suchpossibilities and the foreclosures of certain forms of humanlife run parallel with market exploitation, gender domination,and a managerial-style state that is increasingly distant fromthe people it governs. The fabric of this domestic activity ofvaluing and deciding which life is worth living remains largelyunexamined, not only in everyday life but also in the literatureof transforming economies, states, and civil societies in thecontexts of democratization and social inequality. As thisstudy unfolded, I was challenged to devise ways to approachthis unconsidered infrastructure of decision making that op-erates, in Catarina's own words, \"out of justice\"\u2014that is,outside the bounds of the judiciary and the public ministry\u2014and that is close to home. \"I know because I passed throughit. I learned the truth and I try to divulge what reality is.\" Ethnography thus makes visible the intermingling of col- loquial practices and relations, institutional histories, and dis-cursive structures that\u2014in categories of madness, pharma-ceuticals, migrant households, and disintegrating services\u2014have bounded normalcy and displaced Catarina onto the reg-ister of social death, where her condition appears to havebeen \"self-generated.\" Throughout this chain of events, sheknows that the \"to kill\" is being conjugated\u2014\"dead alive,dead outside, alive inside\"\u2014and in relation to her, the an-thropologist charts and reflects on what makes this not onlypossible but ordinary. This is also, then, a story of the meth-odological, ethical, and conceptual limits of anthropology asit goes into the eld and tries to verify the sources of a life excluded from family and society and to capture the densityof a locality without leaving the individual person and hersubjectivity behind. To Live Is Expensive As I listened to and excavated what had made Catarina's voice\"posthumous,\" a life force\u2014often gaining form in the gureof the animal and related to libido, treatments, and belong-ing\u2014emerged to rework thoughts and ideas of the personand of the value of social ties. While trying to speak, Catarinawas overwhelmed by the chemical alterations of drugs, layersand layers of chemical compounds that other people used towork on her and drug side effects that were her body andidentity now. T o speak the unspeakable, she resorted to met-aphors and to writing. In the following dictionary entry, forexample, she tries to break open the reader's blindness andbrings a Greek tragic gure and her three brothers and threechildren together with her renamed self and the always-inadequate clinical register: \"Look at Catarina without blind-ness, pray, prayer, Jocastka, there is no tonic for CATKINE,there is no doctor for any one, Altamir, Ademar, Armando,Anderson, Alessandra, Ana.\" Marked by paradoxes and impossibilities, she continues, \"I need to change my blood with a tonic. Medication from thepharmacy costs money, to live is expensive.\" Medical sciencewas indeed part and parcel of Catarina's existence\u2014the truths,half-truths, and misunderstandings that brought her to diein Vita and on which she subsisted. \"Pharmacy, laboratory,marriage, identity, army, rheumatism, complication of labor,loss of physical equilibrium, total loss of control, govern,goalkeeper, evil eye, spasm, nerves. . . . In the United States,not here in Brazil, there is a cure, for half of the disease.\" In writing, as in speech, Catarina often refers to her con- dition as \"rheumatism.\" In the following inscription, for ex-ample, she depicts rheumatism as a mangling of the threadspeople tinker with: \"People think that they have the right toput their hands in the mangled threads and to mess with it.Rheumatism. They use my name for good and for evil. Theyuse it because of the rheumatism.\" A possible reading is thather rheumatism ties various life threads together. It is anuntidy knot, a real matter that makes social exchange possible.It gives the body its stature and it is the conduit of a morality.Catarina's bodily affection, not her name, is exchanged in thatworld: \"What I was in the past does not matter.\" Catarinadisappears and a religious image stands in her is of no value.\" Catarina knows that there is a rationality and a bureaucracy to symptom management: \"Chronic spasm, rheumatism,must be stamped, registered.\" All of this happens in a dem-ocratic context, \"vote by vote.\" We must consider side by sidethe acute pain Catarina described and the authoritative story326 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 3, June 2010 she became in medicine and in common sense\u2014as being mad and ultimately of no value. The antipsychotic drugs Haldoland Neozine are also words in Catarina's dictionary. In afragment, she deantly writes that her pain reveals the ex-perimental ways science is embodied: \"The dance of science.Pain broadcasts sick science, the sick study. Brain, illness.Buscopan, Haldol, Neozine. Invoked spirit.\" An individual history of science is being written here. Ca- tarina's lived experience and ailments are the pathos of acertain science, a science that is itself sick. The goods of psy-chiatric science, such as Haldol and Neozine, have becomeas ordinary as Buscopan (hyoscine, an over-the-counter an-tispasmodic medication) and have become a part of familialpractices. As Catarina's experience shows, the use of suchdrugs produces mental and physical effects apart from thoserelated to her illness. In Catarina's thinking and writing, global pharmaceuticals are not simply taken as new material for old patterns of self-fashioning. These universally disseminated goods are entan-gled in and act as vectors for new mechanisms of sociomedicaland subjective control that have a deadly force. Seen fromthe perspective of Vita, the illnesses Catarina experienced werethe outcome of events and practices that altered the personshe had learned to become. Words such as Haldol and Neo- zine are literally her. The drug name Akineton (biperiden) is reflected in one of the new names Catarina gave herself:CATKINE. Abandoned in Vita to die, Catarina has ties topharmakons. Her desire, she writes, is now a pharmaceuticalthing with no human exchange value: \"Catarina cries andwants to leave. Desire, watered, prayed, wept. T earful feeling,fearful, diabolic, betrayed. My desire is of no value. Desire ispharmaceutical. It is not good for the circus.\" Literature and Health Catarina also writes to remain alive, I thought. In thedictionary, she constantly places her new names in relationto those of others she meets in Vita, such as Clo \u00b4 vis, Luis Carlos, or people she knew in the past, such as Valmir. Shecreatively redirects disciplinary clinical elements into a liter-ary-therapeutic line of flight and contact. I nd Deleuze's insights on literature and health quite help- ful in reflecting on Catarina's work of sublimation and thevalues it creates in Vita. Deleuze says that writing is \"a ques-tion of becoming, always incomplete, always in the midst ofbeing formed, and goes beyond the matter of any livable orlived experience. It is a process, that is, a passage of Life thattraverses both the livable and the lived\" (Deleuze 1997:1). Hethinks of language as a system that can be disturbed, attacked,and reconstructed\u2014the very gate through which limits of allkinds are crossed and the energy of the \"delirium\" unleashed(Deleuze 1997:1; see also Deleuze 2001; Didion 2006). The \"delirium\" suggests alternative visions of existence and of a future that clinical denitions tend to foreclose. Languagein its clinical state has already attained a form, says Deleuze:\"We don't write with our neuroses. Neuroses or psychoses are not passages of life, but states into which we fall whenthe process is interrupted, blocked, or plugged up. Illness isnot a process but a stopping of the process\" (Deleuze 1997:3). The radical work of literature, however, moves away from\"truths\" and \"forms\" (because truth is a form in itself) andtoward intermediate, processual stages that could even bevirtual. Writing is inseparable from becoming, repeats De-leuze, and becoming \"always has an element of flight thatescapes its own formalization\" (Deleuze 1997:1). T o becomeis not to attain a form through imitation, identication, ormimesis but rather to nd a zone of proximity where onecan no longer be distinguished from a man, a woman, or ananimal\u2014\"neither imprecise, nor general, but unforeseen andnonpreexistent, singularized out of a population rather thandetermined in a form\" (Deleuze 1997:1). In Deleuze's words,one can institute such zone of indifferentiation with anything\"on the condition that one creates the literary means for doingso\" (Deleuze 1997:2). While I tried to restore context and meaning to her lived experience of abandonment, Catarina was herself producing,in her dictionary, a theory of the abandoned subject and hersubjectivity that was ethnographically grounded. Consider thisstanza: Catarina is subjected T o be a nation in povertyPorto AlegreWithout an heirEnoughIe n d In her verse, Catarina places the individual and the collec- tive in the same space of analysis, just as the country and thecity also collide in Vita. Subjection has to do with having nomoney and with being part of a nation gone awry. The subjectis a body left in Vita without ties to the life she generatedwith the man who, as she states, now \"rules the city\" fromwhich she is banished. With nothing to leave behind and noone to leave it to, there remains Catarina's subjectivity\u2014themedium through which a collectivity is ordered in terms oflack and in which she nds a way to disentangle herself fromall the mess the world has become. In her writing, she facesthe concrete limits of what a human being can bear, and shemakes polysemy out of those limits\u2014\"I, who am where I go,am who am so.\" One of the guiding principles of Deleuze's philosophy is the link between the real and the imaginary as always coex-isting, always complementary. They are like two juxtaposableor superimposable parts of a single trajectory, two faces thatceaselessly interchange with one another, \"a mobile mirror. . . bearing witness until the end to a new vision whose passageit remained open to\" (Deleuze 1997:63). In set of intertwinedroutes. \"I am a free woman, to fly, bionic woman, separated.. . . When men throw me into the air, I am already far away.\"Biehl and Locke The Anthropology of Becoming 327 These trajectories are inseparable from her efforts of becom- ing. \"I will leave the door of the cage open. Y ou can flywherever you want to.\" Actualized by literature, this mobile mirror reveals beneath apparent persons the power of an impersonal, says Deleuze,\"which is not a generality but singularity at the highest point:a man, a woman, a beast, a child. . . . It is not the rst twopersons that function as the condition for literary enunciation;literature begins only when a third person is born in us thatstrips us of the power to say 'I'\" (Deleuze 1997:3). shiftto the indenite\u2014from Itoa\u2014leads to the existen- tial stage in which life is simply \"immanent,\" a transcendentaleld where man and woman and other men and women/animals/landscapes can achieve the web of variable relationsand situated connectedness called \"camaraderie.\" \"There, in Novo Hamburgo it is Catarina. Here it is CAT- KINE,\" she told me when I asked her why she invented thisname. \"I will be called this now. For I don't want to be a toolfor men to use, for men to cut. A tool is innocent. Y ou dig,you cut, you do whatever you want with it. . . . It doesn'tknow if it hurts or doesn't. But the man who uses it to cutthe other knows what he is doing.\" She continued with themost forceful words: \"I don't want to be a tool. BecauseCatarina is not the name of a person . . . truly not. It is thename of a tool, of an object. A person is an Other.\" Psychopharmaceuticals had mediated Catarina's expulsion from the world of exchanges (as if she were ignorant of thelanguage she spoke) and were now the thing through whichshe recounted bodily fragmentation and withering. This waswhat she was left with: \"enjoyment enjoying itself\" ( se goza gozo), as she wrote in the dictionary. \"Pleasure and desire are not sold, cannot be bought. But have choice.\" The oppor-tunity to \"restart\" and a human choice were all she wanted.This was what Catarina afrmed in her love stories in Vita.\"I dated a man who volunteered as a security guard here,\"she told me. \"He bought me a ring and a bracelet, shampoo,many things. We met at night and had sex in the bathroom.But people were trying to separate us. Vera began to say thathe was her boyfriend, too. So I gave him the ring back. Herefused to take it back. I said, 'I will not throw this into thegarbage,' so I put it in my suitcase. After we split, he hadother women here . . . But as far as I am concerned, I wasnot his prey. I didn't fall to him. I wanted it. I have desire,I have desire. I am with Clo \u00b4 vis now.\" Catarina refused to depict herself as a victim. Her body experienced, along with hunger, spasms, and pain, uncon-trollable desires, an overflow unthinkable in terms of commonsense. While exposing Vita as a place of total annihilation,she also spoke of the vitality of sexuality and afrmed agency.She spoke openly of having sex \"in the bathroom and in thepharmacy\" with Clo \u00b4 vis, a man who after passing through the rehabilitation areas became the inrmary's \"nurse.\" For her,desire and pleasure were gratifying, \"a gift that one feels.\"During sex, she said, \"I don't lose my head, and I don't letmy partner lose his head. If it is good for me, I want to makeit good for him, too.\" She was, in her own words, \"a true fondle the aggressive lust, and manias. Sci-entic decadence, kiss, electricity, wet, mouth kiss, dry kiss,kiss in the neck, to start from zero, it is always time, tobegin again, for me it is time to convert, this restart a home, a family, thespirit of love, the spirit of God, the spirit becomes fleshinside. Catarina remarked that other people might be curious about her words, but she added that their meaning was ul-timately part of her living: \"There is so much signication, you will notnd in the book. It is only in my memory that I have thesignication. And this is for me to untie.\" Catarina refusedto be merely an object of understanding for others, yet shechallenges us to inquire into the benets that can come fromanthropological knowledge making, especially in the ways carecan be redirected. \"Nobody will decipher the words for me.With the pen, only I can do it. . . . In the ink, I decipher.. . . I am writing for myself to understand, but, of course, ifyou all understand I will be very content.\" And she anticipatedan exit from Vita. It was as difcult as it was important tosustain this anticipation: to nd ways to support Catarina'ssearch for ties to people and the world and her demand forcontinuity, or at least its possibility. To Write for This People Who Are Missing Where Biehl's work with Catarina probes the signicance of Deleuze's thought in understanding individual subjectivity\u2014the force and meaning of a life in its entanglements withtransforming congurations of knowledges, economies, andforms of care\u2014Locke's research in Sarajevo explores Deleuze'sinsights for understanding collective becomings. In BiH, whatis held in common\u2014who one cares for, identies with, sup-ports, or is supported by in the course of the fraught momentsand activities of a postwar everyday\u2014does not always cor-respond to ofcial divisions and categories, that is, ethnore-ligious divisions (Croat, Serb, Bosniak) and competing victimidentications (veteran, widow, camp survivor, rape victim,displaced person, returnee). The collective is an open spaceof ambivalence and contestation where there is room for ten-tative bonds and shared frustrations to cross entrenchedboundaries and mark out new ones. Although the specicities are, of course, different in crucial ways, Locke's Bosnian interlocutors\u2014like Catarina in Vita\u2014negotiate an evolving interface of psychiatric and neoliberaleconomic rationalities. In BiH, as Locke argues in the follow-ing section, clinical diagnoses applied to whole populationsmask the actual political, economic, and social discontents be-328 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 3, June 2010 hind their shared \"symptoms.\" Sustained ethnographic en- gagement can help to produce a counterinterpretation that, bytaking seriously local desires and struggles at becoming, evokesthe potential for alternative solidarities and political life in theregion\u2014\"a people to come\" (Deleuze 1997:4). BiH a Dozen Years after the War On a hot summer morning in July of 2007, I (Locke) take a taxi to Sarajevo's Kos evo Hospital to visit Dr. Senadin Lju- bovic \u00b4. Dr. Ljubovic \u00b4, a psychiatrist with decades of experience, has since the war worked with traumatized ex-soldiers andrape victims. On my way into his ofce, I pass a gaunt, ex-pressionless woman on her way out. Dr. Ljubovic \u00b4 tells me, without prompting, in the course of our conversation, thatshe is from Srebrenica; she spent months in a Serb rape camp;and much of her family was killed in the July 1995 massacre.She has no job, no friends, and no family in Sarajevo. Shereceives only meager assistance from the government. She isabout to be evicted from her apartment. Dr. Ljubovic \u00b4, calm and resigned in his white coat, folds his hands in his lap and looks at me: what, he asks, can a psy-chiatrist do for someone like her? Her problems are social\u2014the extreme violence of the early 1990s shattered her networksof support, and in a city still resentful of \"villagers\" and ref-ugees, she has found little in the way of new human warmthand connection. And her problems are economic\u201412 yearsafter the war, the Bosnian economy remains a wreck, andthere are few prospects for (formal) employment or furthereducation. The trauma of her terrible losses and violations isthere, of course\u2014in a crippled capacity to trust, to connect,and to hope. But Dr. Ljubovic \u00b4\u2014one of Sarajevo's staggeringly few mental health professionals\u2014hardly has the time andresources to address this particularly bitter facet of her pre-dicament. He can only prescribe medication, offer a few wordsof advice, and let her go, admitting the next client in line. A few months earlier, I am sitting at the long table in the common area of the ofces of Wings of Hope, a local psy-chosocial support NGO focused on services for children andteenagers. Three mothers wait in a cloud of cigarette smoke,while elsewhere in the ofce staff members work with theirkids. They are angry and frustrated. Their husbands are gone(lost in the war or for other reasons) or unemployed; theirchildren struggle in school; and the government does nothing,or next to nothing, to help them. Neighbors and friends aretoo preoccupied with their own daily struggles to take muchinterest. NGOs such as Wings of Hope\u2014themselves extremelylimited in capacity because of \"donor fatigue\" and the de-clining interest of the international community\u2014ll in wherethey can in the absence of services the government should beproviding. \"Politicians do not care about us,\" they say. \"Theyjust use their positions to get rich. . . . My husband died inthe war and I live off his soldier's pension. But it is notenough! And there are no jobs for me.\" As they exchangebitter complaints, the mothers begin remembering togetherwhat the system was like before the war, when material se- curity, employment, and health care were all (ostensibly) guar-anteed by the state. \"Everything was better before. The warwas for nothing.\" They are grateful for the assistance theynd at Wings but resent that it is their only apparent option.Anger at politicians and despair over their current circum-stances dominate the mood. Dr. Ljubovic \u00b4 and the mothers at Wings of Hope both in- dicate, to some extent, the failure of governance (both localand international) and an absence of services and assistance;they express a general sense of social dysfunction, stagnancy,and disconnection, a vacuum of meaning and solidarity. Iron-ically, despite bloated, redundant layers of bureaucracy thatsuck up an estimated 70% of BiH's yearly GDP , governmenthere feels less like a weight (much less a positive force con-straining lives or constructing subjectivities) than a lack\u2014of care, support, and opportunity. Local politics\u2014dominated byzero-sum, angry, fear-inducing debates between ethnic na-tionalists on both sides\u2014transpire in a bubble of compulsiverepetition disconnected from concrete socioeconomic prob-lems. People feel left to fend for themselves in the course oftheir daily struggles. What care and opportunities they canobtain generally require personal or political connections orsubstantial bribery: students pay to pass exams, graduates payto be employed, a patient needing stitches slips the nurse alittle extra to receive local anesthetic. And with the steadywithdrawal of international aid projects, leaving local NGOsto scramble for meager resources, the limited services pro-vided by civil society (including those addressing mentalhealth) can only scratch the surface of actual need. Therapeutic Governance The war in BiH (population roughly 4 million) saw approx- imately 100,000 dead and at least 1 million displaced. Bosnia'sinfrastructure, economy, and civic institutions remain deeplycompromised. The Dayton Accords, which ended hostilitiesin 1995, brought to BiH an enormous international apparatusof governance, monitoring, peacekeeping, and humanitarianaid\u2014a kind of \"migrant sovereignty,\" to borrow anthropol-ogist of Kosovo Mariella Pandol's apt terminology (Pandol2003). Renewed warfare has been held at bay, but otherwiseprogress has been spotty and tful, with frustration buildingsteadily over the years. Local nationalist politicians, who havea stake in maintaining fear and insecurity in the electorate,frequently stymie the efforts of international authorities tostimulate political reform. It does not help that the Daytonconstitution entrenches the role of divisive ethnic identi-cations in the political process. In 2008, over 14 years afterthe end of the war, BiH remains in essence an internationalprotectorate, and the \"High Representative\" (who jointly rep-resents the UN and EU, and whose mandate was originallyintended to last only 1 year) retains, though rarely exercises,the capacity to exercise near-absolute political authority. Ineconomic domains, international organizations' neoliberalBiehl and Locke The Anthropology of Becoming 329 market ideology and \"structural adjustment\" policies have led to by-now-familiar outcomes\u2014corrupt privatization, the auc-tioning off of once-public assets, and the dismantling of socialwelfare services (see Donais 2005). \"It was international intervention in former Yugoslavia,\" argues political scientist Vanessa Pupavac, of the Borrowing this nal phrase from Philip Rieff's (2006[1966]) study of the steady integration of Freudian thoughtinto everyday \"modern\" culture, Pupavac argues that over thecourse of the 1990s, international policy in postcrisis situa-tions created a form of power she calls \"therapeutic gover-nance.\" Humanitarian organizations in the Balkans con-ducted psychosocial projects\u2014by some accounts, thousandswere implemented in the region during and just after the war,costing millions of dollars (Pupavac 2003:163; Summereld1999:1452)\u2014targeting the trauma and mental health of warsurvivors. The psychosocial approach emphasizes the link be-tween trauma and repeating cycles of violence; individuals areseen as essentially psychologically vulnerable (rather than re-silient) and war survivors as damaged and therefore in dangerof repeating the atrocities that they had witnessed or to whichthey had been subjected. According to Pupavac, this set ofassumptions in part justies the continuing supervision ofBiH by foreign overseers. Contemporary therapeutic gover-nance assumes that postwar citizens can be trusted with nei-ther their political rights nor their own emotional well being.Symbolic justice is emphasized, while \"substantive social jus- tice\" is all but ignored (Pupavac 2004:392). As my eldwork began, I expected to watch this congu- ration\u2014the \"triumph of the therapeutic\" in postwar reme-diation efforts\u2014play out in the fabric of everyday life in Sa-rajevo. However (as my opening anecdotes indicate), I quicklydiscovered that the structural effect of international psycho- social projects in BiH\u2014notwithstanding all the millions ofaid dollars spent\u2014has been extremely narrow. Various inter-national programs\u2014the once-ubiquitous seminars, work-shops, trainings, and conferences on themes such as conflictresolution, nonviolence, communication skills, and, of course,trauma\u2014did shift the way a number of local civil societyworkers understood the psychological effect of war, and acommunity mental health center reform project led by aSwedish task force and supported by the World Health Or-ganization and other agencies retrained many local mentalhealth professionals and social workers accustomed to a moreclassical prewar system of psychiatric wards and asylums forthe severely mentally ill (Lagerkvist et al. 2003). But mostpeople do not tend to see some form of psychotherapy as apossible remedy for their woes. Even if they did, mental healthcare services in BiH, and public knowledge about them, arevery limited (the community mental health care reform pro-cess notwithstanding). In what follows, however, I will show that while strong mental health care infrastructures and treatment-seeking cul-tures have not taken root in any sustainable manner in BiH,psychological language has in some way colored local com- mon sense, confounding the way people understand the coun-try's social-structural and political-economic problems. In-terpretation of the features of life in contemporary BiH takesplace almost exclusively on a clinical register through which Bosnian voices seem to emit only signs of lives blocked bycollective illness. Deleuze asks us \"to have done with judg-ment,\" which \"prevents the emergence of any new mode ofexistence\" (Deleuze 1997:135). We can listen to Bosnian liveson a literary rather than clinical register through which we may hear, between the lines, an incipient becoming, a \"col-lective enunciation\" that points to possible alternatives forsocial solidarity and mobilization (Deleuze 1986:18). I amafter an agency that, paradoxically, pulses in a language ofdespair and refusal, of anger and abiding, a syntax of mourn-ful waiting. How can such an anthropology inform and con-tribute to transformations in concepts and practices, bothinternational and local, of postwar politics andhumanitarianism? Diagnosing a City What remains from the short-lived postwar flurry of psy-chosocial work? In Sarajevo I found a handful of small Bos-nian-run NGOs, the staff of which more often than not weretrained by or at least had important encounters with inter-national mental health professionals during and just after thewar. These NGOs try to adapt their sense of Western mentalhealth science to what they perceive to be local problems andneeds, often creating a disjuncture between mission state-ments (couched in psychological terminology) and actualpractices (which look more like social work and communitybuilding). Beneciaries are often seeking material assistanceas much as (or signicantly more than) some form of emo-tional support; NGO workers regularly told me stories ofpeople appearing at psychosocial activities to ask for moneyor materials to rebuild damaged homes or to buy food for afew days. (There is a microhistory here of the kind of valuesand expectations that linger as philosophies and infrastruc-tures of governance transform: this is the sort of assistance,apparently, that citizens would have expected of their prewarcommunist government.) At Wings of Hope, what is billed as \"psychodetraumati- zation\" for children has evolved into academic tutoring foryoung people struggling in school, assistance in transitionsfrom education to work, and pragmatic problem solving,counseling, and general support for families. On balance theefforts of Wings staff counteract the effect of contemporarysocioeconomic pressures more than that of extreme wartimeexperiences. Y et staff members do talk in psychosocial terms,attributing poor grades to \"transgenerational trauma,\" andchildren are usually selected for the program based on achecklist of \"traumatic indicators\" developed for Wings sev-eral years ago by a psychologist from Sarajevo University.Maja, the director, persistently tells me that Sarajevo is in the330 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 3, June 2010 grip of \"collective depression\" and \"mass trauma\"\u2014although when I interview staff members, they are less certain aboutsuch blanket diagnoses. If ideas about trauma only looselyguide NGO activities, they nevertheless seem to inflect, todiffering degrees, the explanations people at Wings give aboutwhat they are doing. There is something here akin to the processes of medical- ization\u2014the tendency to obscure the social etiology of af-fliction and reduce it to a biological reality amenable to med-ical intervention\u2014frequently identied and critiqued 1992; Y oung 1995).Y et without the presence of an effective or powerful medicalinfrastructure, this form of objectication escapes along otherlines: diagnostics move from the private clinical encounterand come to operate, fluidly and ambivalently, in domesticand public spheres and collectively constructed narrativesabout postwar life. People do not simply become the diag-nostic categories applied to them\u2014they inhabit them togreater or lesser degrees, refuse them, redene and redeploythem, or ignore them entirely (Lock 2003). 1As Ian Hacking acknowledged in his essay on how new kinds of people can be\"made up\" by medical diagnostics, \"My concern is philosoph-ical and abstract . . . and [I] reflect too little on the ordinarydynamics of human interaction\" (Hacking 1999:162). The legacy of \"therapeutic governance\" and psychosocial intervention in BiH is mixed in many senses. In the samebreath Sarajevans can talk about psychiatric trauma as thesource of socioeconomic challenges\u2014when people are de-pressed, they lack the kind of individual initiative required tomake capitalism work, the story goes\u2014and then reverse theformula, pointing to economic problems as the true traumaticexperience. A few days after the capture of Radovan Karadz ic\u00b4 (in late July 2008), I took a taxi to Sarajevo's central busstation. The driver asked what I was doing in Sarajevo. \"I'mmost interested in trauma and grief,\" I told him. He replied,\"That is very difcult. What you are looking for is hidden.\"He explained that everything, at rst glance, looks relatively\"normal\" in Sarajevo; people socialize, work, spend time incafes with their friends, study at the university, take buses tothe Adriatic coast in July. Under the surface, though, \" nesto nije u redu \"\u2014something is not right. People are \"explosive\" and \"temperamental,\" flying into a rage at the little irritationsof daily life, in a way that they were not before the war. But 1. Similarly Margaret Lock, in reviewing the literature on medicali- zation across disciplines, concludes with a call for an understanding ofthe process as less deterministic and more open-ended and context de-pendent: \"Medicalization, understood as enforced surveillance, is mis-leading. So too is an argument that emphasizes the social constructionof disease at the expense of recognizing the very real, debilitating con-dition of individuals who seek out medical help. Rather, an investigationof the forms taken by political economies, technological complexes, andthe values embedded in biomedical discourse and practice and in popularknowledge about the body, health, and illness that situate various statesand conditions as residing within the purview of medicine better indicatesthe complexity at work\" (Lock 2003:123).\"war trauma\" is not aise: nema posla , said the driver\u2014 There are no jobs . He began to recite a familiar litany of social ills: unemployment, cor- ruption, poor social services, a country seemingly emptied of compassion and solidarity. \"This is not a normal society. Thisis not what I fought for.\" He had been in the militias defendingSarajevo during the siege. In 2003 Slobodan Loga, a psychiatrist at Sarajevo University, told a reporter for Britain's Daily Telegraph that everyone in Sarajevo had posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and I heardhim make similar pronouncements at two separate Sarajevoconferences during my eldwork in 2007. In the Telegraph ar- ticle (cited also by Pupavac [2004:392] and tellingly entitled \"The War Is Over but Sarajevans Cannot Find the Peace They Seek\"), he rattled off the symptoms gripping the city: \"violentmood swings, excitability, flashbacks, nightmares, emotionalnumbness, depression, anxiety attacks and trying to nd some- one else to blame\" (Eager 2003). Suicide has gone up by 40%, he said; \"PTSD is part of our lives\" (Eager 2003). One of Loga's colleagues, a psychiatrist who has worked extensively with war veterans, similarly suggested to me in an interview that \"trauma here is so widespread that it is banal.\" S ejla, a psychiatrist- told me that \"you can't talk about men- tal health for people who suffered during the war. They have no mental health. They are just human animals surviving day- to-day with these horrible memories.\" As our interview continued, however, S ejla left the war behind and designated the transition to capitalism\u2014and the \"passive\" way Bosnians have responded to it\u2014as the true catastrophe. \"Some of those who managed well during warjust broke to pieces at the end. Lots of psychiatrists gured out, what turned out to be an even more challenging expe- rience was the shift from socialism to some sort of capitalism. That proved to be an even bigger source of stress than the war.\" As a matter of fact, she went on, people often say they preferred life during the siege to life under the new postwar economy. \"Life then was more straightforward\u2014just stay alive, day-to-day.\" Moreover Sarajevans were connected by a shared sense of struggle, of persecution by a common enemy, and, in S ejla's words, \"took better care of each other.\" She meant that they expressed sympathy and solidarity in com- mon suffering and shared supplies and survival strategies.Getting by in postwar Sarajevo, and getting along with others,feels to many people like a different, lonelier, and more point- less kind of struggle. They always knew the war had to end, someday, even as it dragged on well past expectations. But an end to poisoned postwar politics and the infuriating in-equalities of the new economy is hard to perceive. Seen from S ejla's perspective, Sarajevans are longing for lost collectivities and solidarities\u2014not only those of prewarYugoslavia but of the wartime itself. The social ties that theydesire are not addressed in contemporary Bosnian politics.People recall connections anchored less by ethnicity than byBiehl and Locke The Anthropology of Becoming 331 a shared, against-the-odds will to live (Biehl 2007) and to preserve a familiar humanity amidst dire circumstances. The Subjectivity of a Milieu Sarajevo produces contradictory impressions. As the taxidriver noted, on the surface things and people seem normalnow, but underneath something feels wrong. Similarly, a BBCreporter stationed in Sarajevo for years recently told a New York Times travel reporter that \"there's a lot of pain just under the surface\u2014a lot of pain\" (Solomon 2006). The city landscape itself is largely gray, shrapnel- scarred, bullet-holed Austro-Hungarian and communist-erafacades under perpetual restoration\u2014leading the Times writer to remark wryly that \"the predominant color of Sarajevo isspackle\" (Solomon 2006)\u2014but it is punctuated by gleamingnew modern structures, such as the recently rebuilt Councilof Ministers building or the striking Avaz \"twist\" tower, nowthe highest building in the Balkans. Reminders of grief, warrelated and everyday, are so omnipresent that they often blendunnoticed into the scenery: underfoot, the \"Sarajevo roses,\"mortar-impact craters lled in with red paint; and on and bus stop shelters, death notices ( smrtovnice ), posted both at the time of passing and at repeating intervals in sub-sequent years, printed on standard A4 paper, with pictures ofthe deceased and short poems or expressions of loss\u2014\"be-loved father, brother, and friend: death does not end our love,nor time our sadness.\" Standards of hospitality are high, and greetings between friends on the street are enthusiastic. Popular nightspots llwith energy and young people dressed to the nines. But thereis often an undercurrent of anger to street scenes. Peoplecomplain about the inconsiderateness of others, recalling bet-ter manners and more gentle dispositions before the war, andthey seem to have very low patience for daily irritations andrudenesses. Drivers are extremely aggressive and take no heedof pedestrians. T empers everywhere seem short, a constantprovocation: people get angry about how other people's angermakes them rude and thoughtless. Arguments explode on hot,crowded trams over whether to open a window (most Bos-nians are afraid of illnesses induced by exposure to drafts).In February 2008, three teenagers stabbed a fourth to deathon a tram for looking at them the wrong way, promptingthousands of Sarajevans to take to the streets in a rare displayof coordinated outrage against city ofcials (in this case fordoing too little about juvenile delinquency). Maja and S ejla's anger drives them to action, and they are upset with people whose anger leads to apparent immobilityor self-indulgence. S ejla railed about the \"inertia\" of her fellow Sarajevans\u2014many unemployed, spending their time in cafe \u00b4s complaining and venting their own anger about the state ofthings in their world. S ejla mimicked their attitude: \"The world should help us, give us this, no one is taking care. . . .[I] say no, cut the crap, go and clean the street and do what-ever, just move your butt, you can't just sit back and wait.. . . This whole inertia . . . it was always there, it's just that now it [has] emerged as the mode of living.\" Sejla designated \"people who lived in Tito's time\" as the most guilty of this kind of passive inertia. In light of the manyhardships and horrors of the intervening years, many peoplein Sarajevo\u2014especially, of course, those of middle and ad-vanced age\u2014articulate longings for prewar life under com-munism (Locke 2008). This is a phenomenon known (affec-tionately or dismissively, depending on who is speaking) as\"Yugo-nostalgia.\" The complaints of older generations thusemerge in part from the values and dreams of Tito-era Yu-goslavia, when neighborliness, tolerance, \"brotherhood andunity,\" and a strong welfare state were, for many, upheld asthe key ideals guiding both individual and collective striving.Loga, after diagnosing all of Sarajevo with PTSD, pinned theblame not on war trauma but on \"economic and social prob-lems\" (Eager 2003). His further comments are revealing: \"Wehad a good life before the war,\" he said. \"Why can't we goback to that? Our communism wasn't like Russia or Hungary.I don't mind democracy but this privatization is just a maa.I don't know why the international community wants us tobe in this mess\" (Eager 2003). Tito's stated ideals were ever imperfectly achieved (see Ramet Zlatko strategy\" and a one-time World Bank em-ployee, complained a few years ago that Bosnians \"expect tolive like they used to before the war\u2014going abroad, buyingItalian clothes. But it wasn't real; the economy was fundedby Tito's foreign borrowing, and they won't believe that\"(Eager 2003). But whether or not the prewar economy restedon a \"real\" base\u2014a foreign debt of nearly $20 billion by theearly 1980s (Donais 2005:6) and other systemic problemssurely suggests that it did not\u2014the values, ethics, and ex-pectations of the time were notillusions; the fact that many Bosnians still hold to them in private and are again invokingthem as they struggle to make sense of their dismal milieuindicates the potential for alternative political hopes and sub-jectivities that run counter to the visions of both local andinternational elites. Many, such as Zlatko Hurtic \u00b4 and S ejla as well as Western policy makers heavily enculturated into ideologies of individ-ual initiative and capitalist risk taking, condemn these Yu-goslav yearnings as another kind of pathology of memoryparallel to (or part of the complex of) mass PTSD. It all addsup to a grand dismissal, a refusal to listen to the content ofwhat Sarajevans have to say. In this view, Bosnians\u2014renderedpassive, entitled, and dependent by decades of socialism andhumanitarian \"handouts\" and traumatized by the violent dis-integration of Yugoslav-era dreams\u2014are unable to accepttheir losses It a clinical-sounding \"a huge dependencysyndrome\" (UNDP 2007:22)\u2014blaming social problems onthe accumulated individual psychological injuries of the past50 years of Balkan history. It empties Sarajevo's \"affects andintensities\"\u2014what Deleuze might call its subjectivity as a mi-332 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 3, June 2010 lieu, the set of trajectories, landscapes, and socialities that comprise its own tortured becoming as a community\u2014ofcontent, meaning, and context. It sucks out the specicity ofthe complaints and frustrations of its inhabitants by callingthem indicators of a universal psychiatric disorder. The Interpretation of Symptoms We need a critical approach that takes seriously the lives ofSarajevans on their own terms, a way to halt the clinical impulseto reduce listening to diagnosis. But the kind of theory readilyavailable in the current anthropological toolkit\u2014Foucault-inspired \"biopolitical\" approaches, for example, focusing onrationalities and discourses, technologies of power and subjectmaking, or overly determinist neo-Marxist frameworks such as\"structural violence\"\u2014takes me only so far in the face of theethnographic reality of Sarajevo. This is a painfully indeter-minate social eld, a place fully in the grip of neither old nornew, characterized less by entrenched logics of meaning andsubject making than by liminality. My interlocutors navigateboth the continuing force and legacy of a shattered world andthepartial unfolding of new powers and knowledges. There is space between Yugoslav past and neoliberal future, betweenwreckage and new order, for creative survival, for desire andgrief together to suggest alternate futures. Inertia and waiting,anger and nostalgia, may, situated in this space, carry a meaningother than collective illness (Fischer 2009). 2 Deleuze's distinction between language in a clinical state and language as literature suggests intriguing possibilities for listen-ing. That is, the stories I hear could be signs of illness orstagnation orpassages of life, depending on my presuppositions and methods. What possibilities does seeing the language ofrefusal, of waiting, of nostalgia as a \"collective depression\" fore-close, both for analyst and interlocutor? If I posit that in thisrefusal there is an agency, in this \"Yugo-nostalgia\" an alternativefuture, in this waiting a becoming , will my listening bring some- thing else to my ears\u2014a nascent \"life in things,\" as Deleuzewould \"necessary detours\" of syntax(Deleuze 1997:2)? Catarina's life, as Biehl argues above, illus-trates how high the stakes can be for these two modes of lis-tening. While the psychiatrists by and large hear madness inCatarina's words and thus proceed with a clinical process ofdiagnosis and psychopharmaceutical treatment that contributesto her social and physical death, Biehl takes her words andwhat she writes in the dictionary literally and in so doing hears what the clinicians are deaf to\u2014her ongoing, wrenching strug-gle to become , to exceed and escape her diagnoses, to develop relations of desire and care with others. 2. In her work on trauma and testimony, Veena Das (2007) produc- tively elaborates on how we sense, perceive, and acknowledge the other,pointing to an ethical stance of receptivity not reducible to any particularmethodology. On the creative potentials of trauma and memory, see alsoAntze and Lambek (1996), Avelar (1999), Benjamin (1986), Caruth(1996), Das et al. (2001), Edkins (2004), Richard (2004), Sebald (2003),and Winter and Sivan (1999).Deleuze articulates a key divergence with psychoanalysis\u2014 worth underlining here\u2014in the way he approaches symp-toms. Quoting Guattari, he suggests that \"lapses, parapraxesand symptoms are like birds that strike their beaks againstthe window. It is not a question of interpreting them [in aFreudian framework]. It is a question instead of identifyingtheir trajectory to see if they can serve as indicators of newuniverses of reference capable of acquiring a consistency suf-cient for turning a situation upside down\" (Deleuze 1997:63). In other words, according to Deleuze the symptom isnot (necessarily) the indicator of a pathological determinationby a memorializing unconscious, but, as in Guattari's haunt-ing image, a bird beating its beak against the window; it is apotentiality for becoming, for breaking free of forms, for sub- limating the violence of forces both everyday and world his-torical. This potential for sublimation needs social (even po-litical) recognition. In Deleuze's vision, symptoms express adesire or life force trapped and twisted at an impasse, awaitinga chance to break through. Sarajevans are not just waiting for \"someone to come x their lives.\" They have much more specic expectations. Theywait for politics to improve, to grow out of nationalist fear-mongering and deadlock to again provide the kind of socialprotections and safety nets they recall from the communistera. They wait for people to become kinder, warmer, moreneighborly again, the way they were before the war shatteredtrust. They wait for new industries to provide jobs and aneconomic base. They wait in Sarajevo's abundant cafe \u00b4s, end- lessly drinking coffee with friends and complaining about thegovernment, about the impotency of Bosnia's foreign super-visors, and about unemployment. They wait for war criminalsto be brought to justice. Their waiting is something other than a passive depression: it is a holding pattern, an abiding of intolerable present cir-cumstances, a new kind of day-to-day survival that, in itssimultaneous despair and determination, echoes the remark-able ways Sarajevans survived the siege\u2014when they waitedover three brutal years for foreign intervention (see Mac ek 2009). It connects them in an unnamed, unrecognized col-lectivity, a \"tissue of shifting relations\" woven by the sharedexperience of a loaded temporality, a meantime \u2014between de- struction and renewal\u2014of grieving and anger and anticipa-tion. And it is a kind of politics, a refusal to take on a socialform\u2014capitalism as \"maa privatization,\" government ascorrupt and heartless com-petition, mutual suspicion and carelessness\u2014bearing little re-semblance to the prewar values they continue to hold in re-serve, like the handful of eggs or bit of meat so preciousduring the war, for better days. People are not just the sum of the forces\u2014however over- whelming\u2014constructing and sufcient to accountfor the movements and meanings of their lives. T o trace thetrajectories, the ever-deferred desires and expectations, the\"symptoms\" of Sarajevans, is to map a shared desperation forBiehl and Locke The Anthropology of Becoming 333 flight: anger and inertia evolve from so many failed escapes and disappointed dreams. Where obstacles block passages oflife, some trajectories dead-end: the war veteran, unable tond steady employment after 10 years, nally only repeats adaily path between home and a neighborhood bar; the uni-versity student, unable to afford the cost of passing grades,takes the same exams over and over into his late twenties,caught in a limbo of extended adolescence. But just as often\u2014more often\u2014people curve around impasses or push throughanyway, carving out small life chances against the odds. A Sarajevo Becoming Le\u00b4vi-Strauss suggested that bricolage , the kind of thinking char- acteristic of the \"untamed mind,\" works via a swerve fromdened and conventional paths: \"a ball rebounding, a dog stray-ing or a horse swerving from its direct course\" (Le \u00b4vi-Strauss 1966:16). Maja, the current director of Wings of Hope, hasmade a life out of this sort of swerve, consistently nding escaperoutes, breathing room beneath the burdens of wartime andpostwar BiH. We can consider Maja's life as both a singularityand an index of larger social processes. She survived the siegesof both Mostar and Sarajevo, working where and when shecould to support humanitarian efforts. Coming from an eth-nically mixed background, as so many Bosnians do, and com-pelled to choose a \"Croat\" identity as the war broke out, shenow picks none of the ofcial choices on offer\u2014Croat, Bosniak(Muslim), or Serb\u2014and is one of a minority in BiH to choosea civic Bosnian identity. Director of a psychosocial organization,she is herself neither psychologist nor psychiatrist; she studiesphilosophy and sociology (and before the war studied me-chanical engineering and economics). She subscribes to notions of collective depression and PTSD and considers the young people who come to Wings to haveinherited the trauma of their parents. Y et in her work she pushesagainst persistent feelings of futility, militantly communicatinga sense of power and possibility to her clients. She recalls astaff meeting when in discussions of one young client, a psy-chologist mentioned trying to help him to accept school andschoolwork as a \"necessary evil.\" Maja objected: they shouldtry to teach him to see school, in all its boringness, irritations,and childhood terrors, as a place of possibility, a tool, a steppingstone toward whatever future he might want to imagine forhimself. She sometimes considers herself more effective thanpsychologists in helping the children who come to Wings be-cause, as she tells them, she is a \"professional friend\" and nota therapist. She tutors them in math and takes a consistent,active interest in the details of their day-to-day lives. For a weekeach January she and her colleagues lead about 20 children\u2014those most discouraged, most without hope, most in need ofsomething, anything, positive in their lives\u2014to a snowboardingcamp in the mountains above Sarajevo where, in learning tomaster an extremely difcult sport, they develop a greater senseof possibility and condence. Maja's apartment building in Grbavica (a neighborhood ofSarajevo occupied by Serb forces during the siege) is, she insists, unusual. Many others with whom I speak here deplorethe state of their relations with their neighbors: the gardensaround the big concrete block apartment buildings are re-duced to mud; no one speaks to each other in the corridors;one resident blocks the ramp built for the handicapped warveteran on the ground floor with his car. One day one ofMaja's neighbors started to plant flowers along the walkwayleading up to the main entrance of her building. The otherresidents soon joined; and now, sustained by the spontaneousgardener and Maja's own directness and eagerness for con-nection, Maja claims that every family in the building\u2014andthey include Bosnians of all backgrounds\u2014takes an active,consistent, compassionate interest in the lives of the others. Maja is just as\u2014if not more\u2014angry, disappointed, and dis- couraged as any other Sarajevan. One of the rst things sheever said to me was \"I am always angry.\" Her struggle to pushagainst feelings of overwhelming frustration is obvious, and Ihave seen her explode. She tries to channel\u2014to sublimate\u2014allthat anger into the small, practical forms of social assistanceoffered by Wings, into pep talks and study sessions for teen-agers. Her work and actions\u2014on the scale of what Le \u00b4vi-Strauss would call \"tiny solidarities\" (Le \u00b4vi-Strauss 1983:287), of small hopes and aspirations, of better math grades and prowess insnowboarding\u2014suggest the \"life in things,\" the becoming, thatis intimated by widespread longing for the past, by rejectionand patient surviving or waiting out of things as they are inBosnia. She may speak of BiH in clinical tones, but Maja'strajectory\u2014with its swerves and impasses, outbursts and break-throughs\u2014tells a different story, carries her life beyond theconnes of the diagnoses she proffers. She evokes the possi-bilities of what Deleuze calls \"missing\" or \"minor\" people:buried alternatives, unexpected futures that remain only latent,marginal, sidelined by the mass of dominant patterns and com-pulsive repetition but with the potential, given consistency andcritical mass, to \"turn a situation around.\" Maja's frustrationand short temper are more than symptoms of trauma; they arethe flip side of a set of positive aspirations and values\u2014ever-thwarted but never-extinguished desires for a different world,the parameters of \"a people to come still ensconced in itsbetrayals and repudiations\" (Deleuze 1997:4). Maja's agency radiates across social and institutional do- mains and through kinship ties. Maja has a young cousinnamed Milan, born in September 1992\u2014just after the warhad begun\u2014in the town of Prijedor in northwestern Bosnia,now part of the Republika Srpska (RS). I met him for therst time at the annual snowboarding camp on Mount Igman(a former Olympic ski slope just above Sarajevo) in earlyJanuary 2007. Maja brings Milan down from Prijedor everyyear and pays his way at the camp. Milan has a very difcult life, though you would not know it from his charismatic and positive demeanor. Milan's motheris Catholic and his father is a Serb who fought for the RSduring the war. Milan's maternal grandmother helped takecare of him for a while, but she died when he was eight; now334 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 3, June 2010 he is left with his parents. His mother is considered mildly mentally retarded and makes very little money as a seamstressfor a company in nearby Banja Luka. His father is an alcoholic.Maja's mother sends Milan money regularly: the cash goesdirectly to him, and not to his parents, whom Maja does nottrust to manage it. Milan's misshapen nose is the result ofhaving been hit by a car while crossing a street. Milan hasalways been uninsured, and no one in his family could affordthe operation to repair the broken bones. Maja is saving upfor that and to pay for the braces Milan needs to straightenout his jumbled mouthful of teeth. The only way Milan canget independent health insurance at his age is by droppingout of school and registering at the unemployment bureau,and Maja will not allow this. Milan takes care of himself and his parents. He cooks and cleans the family flat in Prijedor. After school each day Milangoes from apartment to apartment in his neighborhood offeringto do small errands or chores; he earns more in a day this waythan his father does through his meager veteran's pension.Milan has amazing survival skills, but he is not a great student.He is naturally curious about how things work, but Maja isthe only one in his life who takes the time to engage him andto encourage his interests, mostly over the phone. Milan does not seem to harbor any resentment about his circumstances. At the snowboarding camp he is unfailinglysunny and keeps an eye out for his friends. He told me that\"everything will be ne,\" in the face of so much evidence tothe contrary in his family's experience. In this Milan is re-markable, but there are other ways in which he is not unusualat all. Many of the young people I met in Sarajevo told storiesof their own about having taken on adult responsibilities alltoo early, about having had to become the grown-ups in familiesmired in hardship, depression, and alcoholism. It is Milan'soptimism that is rare. I wonder whether it will last, and how much it depends on his exchange with Maja. Most of my youngSarajevo friends have become cynical and hopeless about theirprospects in BiH and just want to leave the country. Memory and Mobilization There was no money to repair Milan's facial appearance; ina way, he embodied the constraints of postwar householdeconomies. Y et as a gure in Maja's own economy and re-direction of therapeutic governance, he remained orientedtoward future possibilities. Milan had no direct experience ofany other world than the war and postwar society into whichhe was born, and he made the best he could of it. Parentsand grandparents that I interviewed at Wings, on the otherhand, regularly resorted to the past to account for and evaluatetheir present. \"Yugo-nostalgia,\" as I came to understand it over time, is something other than a pathological burden, a symptom ofdepression or of mass PTSD. Here memory is not (just) aboutobsessive commemoration of, or unnished mourning for, alost era. Older generations perform acts of remembering thatare as much about the present\u2014and the future\u2014as the past. These acts of memory play a role in mobilizations for alternativetrajectories. The invocation of Yugoslav-era dreams and valuesby my informants in Sarajevo\u2014whether or not the past towhich they refer actually existed in the shape in which theycurrently cast it\u2014participates in the construction of alternativepostwar solidarities, \"minor peoples\" on the margins of BiHsociety. Wings of Hope, though extremely limited in capacity and, like its beneciaries, often forced to survive month to monthby patching together short-term sources of funding, tries toweave social relationships on different terms than those thatprevail in Bosnia generally. Their work implicitly draws onYugoslav-era political ideals to renegotiate the terms of soli-darity and the common good: the community they strive foris not one of individual entrepreneurship and pulling-up ofbootstraps, nor one of strict ethnic segregation, nor of clien-telism and corruption, but of institutionalized, free social sup-port that disregards ethnic divisions and social status andattempts, in some small way, to compensate for the state'sabandonment of the vulnerable. Wings is one of the few placesSarajevans can go for help where a bribe or personal con-nection is not required and where assistance comes withoutbeing preceded by months of bewildering bureaucratic ob-stacles. For the staff of Wings and their beneciaries, healingthe wounds of war is in itself sociopolitical rather than simplyindividual, accomplished less through personal therapeuticsand processing of painful memories than through a small-scale, tentative restoration of ties of trust and support. The past acts here not as backward-looking nostalgia but as a critical comparison allowing a reimagining of the possibleand the posing of an alternative ethics of postwar social life.The mothers rst connect with each other around the meetingtable at Wings by exchanging bitter grievances about the lackof social services or any apparent sense of compassion andresponsibility from the government; but then they shift, inthe course of their conversation, to building a shared under-standing\u2014still angry, still bitter, but tinged now with com-mitment and a desire for care\u2014of how things should be , rmly rooted in what they recall of the Yugoslav-era social contractand the feeling of communal life and support that it produced.This is the swerve that happens now and again at Wings,when connections based on an angry sense of victimizationturn into\u2014or at least gesture toward\u2014solidarity based insteadon shared values, aspirations, and morally weighted memoriesof prewar national life and politics. Wings of Hope is a space in which Bosnia's dominant social eld\u2014heavy with despair, isolation, and mistrust\u2014is fleeingitself around the edges, hinting at the possibility of transfor-mation. Small solidarities such as those constructed here,against the odds, defy the prescripting of Bosnians as a dam-aged people rendered incapable of politics and coexistence bytrauma and ethnic hatred. Here memory and despair, preciselythose forces seen to be the instruments of stagnation, areagents of modest (but effective) creativity, connection, andBiehl and Locke The Anthropology of Becoming 335 sublimation, motivating a tentative articulation of how things could be otherwise in BiH. We can nd in Bosnian lives and words a frozen form and call it \"collective depression,\" see their waiting and \"lack ofinitiative\" as a blocked passage of life, see them as \"stuck,\"mired in nostalgia and dysfunctional politics, as so manyobservers do. But in what I have heard, in the seemingly stuckor backward-looking depression and longings for times past,there is a component of flight that escapes this form by stub-bornly alluding to\u2014and (as with Maja and Wings) sometimesliving, in seedling stage\u2014 hope for something different, some- thing beyond nationalism and competing victimhood claims,beyond corrupt, compassionless capitalism, and beyondtrauma, a sociality that reassembles, together with lessonslearned in the crucible of violence, fragments of prewar Bos-nian (or Yugoslav) values. Such a sociality might correspond to a different\u2014and for Bosnians, more legitimate\u2014conguration of governance andeconomic policies, a different relationship to foreign powersand humanitarian organizations, and a different understandingof the effect of trauma and loss (and concomitant processes ofhealing). Careful and open listening, via sustained ethnography,can allow us to hear the voice of this \"people to come,\" thispossibility of another life, always pushing against its limits (seealso Borneman 2002). It can reveal BiH as an assemblage ofplaces, peoples, and desires, of hopes and grievances, situatedat a crossroads of alternative pathways rather than trapped in a dead end of collective psychiatric disorder\u2014or doomed tothe anomie and inequality of unchecked capitalism. Anthropologist Andrew Gilbert and colleagues have called for a \"social historiography of the future\" as a means to betterunderstand the societies of the former Yugoslavia (Gilbert etal. 2008:11). Attention to hope and \"futuricity\" and not justdespair could \"complement historicity,\" as they put it, track-ing \"horizons, the narratives and forms of belonging theyinspire, and their impact on everyday practice in the now\"(Gilbert et al. 2008:11). At stake, broadly speaking, is whetheranthropology can contribute to opening up opportunities forprogressive transformation in forms of care, politics, andeconomy, particularly during or in the wake of crisis, whetherit takes the additional step beyond explaining dark realities to the work of imagining , in collaboration with its interlocutors, concrete ways in which things could be otherwise. A People to Come In their study of Kafka, Deleuze and Guattari suggest that\"the expressions of the solitary researcher tend toward theassemblage of a collective enunciation . . . even if this col-lectivity is no longer or not yet given. There is not a subject;there are only collective assemblages of enunciation , and liter- ature expresses these acts insofar . . . as they exist only asdiabolical powers to come or revolutionary forces to be con-structed\" (Deleuze and Guattari 1986:18). This vision for lit-erature can also inspire eldwork-based anthropology: listen-ing as readers and writers, rather than clinicians, our own sensibility and openness become instrumental in spurring so-cial recognition of the ways ordinary people think throughtheir conditions. Ethnographic details reveal nuanced fabricsof singularities and the worldliness, rather than exceptionality,of people's struggles; they make explicit buried becomingsand alternative futures. Critical voices and lines of flight arethere, in the margins of power and knowledge, and our lis-tening/reading/writing can pull them from the shadows castby contemporary common sense. In the ethnographic casesdiscussed in this article, people struggle to survive and belongthrough and against intersecting psychiatric and neoliberalrationalities that diagnose their projects and desires as formsof nonsense or madness, individual and collective. Anthro-pologists render publicly intelligible the value of what people,amid new rational-technical and political-economic machin-eries, are left to resolve alone. Their own practices of inquiry,their search for symbolic authority, challenge the analyticforms we bring to the eld, forcing us to articulate moreimmediately relevant and experience-near conceptual work.Theory is embattled and unnished on both sides of theconversation. This respect for people, this attention to the manufacturing of clinical and political discourses and to the sheer materialityof life's necessities makes a great deal of difference in theknowledge we produce. Large-scale processes are not abstractmachines overdetermining the whole social eld. Personalactions and social mobilization have a key role in the storieswe tell in this article. Neither can the microarrangements ofindividual and collective existence be solely described in termsof power or rational choice. Both Catarina's writings andpeople's struggles to get by in postwar Sarajevo evince aneveryday life force seeking to break through forms and fore-closures, to dene a kind of subjectivity that is as much aboutswerves and escapes as about determinations. Freud's oedipaltheorizing, contemporary psychiatric common sense, andeven Foucault-inspired anthropological analytics all tend todisregard this life force. Such a disavowal, we believe, hassignicant real-world consequences for ideas and forms ofcare and social intervention (\"a tragedy generated in life,\" asCatarina put it). By reading our cases in dialogue with some of Deleuze's ideas, we uphold the rights of microanalysis, bringing intoview the immanent elds that people, in all their ambiguity,invent and live by. Such elds of action and signicance\u2014leaking out on all sides\u2014are mediated by power and knowl-edge; but they are also animated by claims to basic rights and desires. In making public a nuanced understanding of theseelds\u2014always at risk of disappearing\u2014anthropologists stillallow for larger structural and institutional processes to be-come visible and their true influence known. Far beyond authorizing gross dualisms or master theories, anthropology's unique analytical force lies in recording com-peting rationalities and vital experimentations, in conceptual-izing ne articulations of worlds, differentiated, in flux and336 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 3, June 2010 impending. This is one of the many good things about an- thropology and the knowledge it produces: it is simultaneouslyopen to theories and relentlessly empirical. As anthropologistsface the startling complexity of events and the dynamism oflived experience, the written objects they create can challengethe limits of what can be known and acted on today. We work to understand the macro without reducing or bounding the micro, accounting for the effect of structuralviolence, power, expertise, and the embodiment of sociolog-ical forces while still crediting the against-the-odds opennessand ambiguity of individual lives and interpersonal dynam-ics\u2014upholding, that is, the value of people's drive to sin-gularize out of populations and categories, to take themselvesout of the stream of history and social destiny. In our research, we have seen novel subjectivities and so- ciological phenomena emerge: new relationships outside clin-ical settings to medical technology and discourse, the makingof agency via psychopharmaceuticals and of political sensi-bilities via a recongured language of psychiatric diagnostics.Lines between public and private, between institutions andother more fluid and open-ended social milieus, routinelyblur and transform. Actual political subjects are ambiguousand ambivalent about public institutions. Traversing worldsof danger and scarcity, constrained without being totallyoverdetermined, they create small and fleeting spaces throughand beyond apparatuses of governance and control in whichto perform a kind of life bricolage with the limited choices and materials at hand. From this perspective, social theory and politics appear highly limited and impoverished, restricted in imaginationand out of touch with intricate and shifting realities that carrythe potential to become vital and/or deadly. People bear anunderstanding of their worlds, of the social problems theymust circumvent or transcend, and of the kind of politicsthat would actually serve their aspirations that is unaccountedfor in policy discussions and decisions. This is not a subju-gated knowledge, constituted unidirectionally by power, butsomething personal, bearing traces of singularity not easilyframed or contained. Even when institutionally ignored, itpersists, and could be better attended to in the public sphere.In the meantime, however, interventions of governance andcare\u2014in postwar and resource-poor settings\u2014remain epis-temologically myopic and are not systematically structured towork with people and to incorporate their practical knowledge. The process of communicating and disseminating evidence of becoming to other disciplines, and to public debates moregenerally, can have an effect by revealing the limits of dom-inant or currently operational concepts of justice, social wel-fare, and crisis intervention (among others). Anthropologyretains\u2014and can continue to build on\u2014its capacity to chal-lenge orthodoxies, for example, of human rights: typicallyconceptualized as primarily political, involving only demo-cratic rights to speech and voting, the human rights our in-terlocutors the world over consistently seek\u2014to social, eco-nomic, and medical security\u2014are neglected (Farmer 2008). Orthodoxies of care, social work, and postcrisis remediation:interventions are individualized, biomedical, and psycho-therapeutic or pharmaceutical, ignoring the need to rebuildrelations of trust and social support or even to ensure basicrequirements of health and survival. Our eld cases compela return to the enduring question of what the complicated,empirical grit of ethnographic evidence can and should doto the contemporary nature of politics and policy. How canwe nd ways to bring our material to technocrats, policymakers, and caregivers in a way that truly challenges theirpractices and assumptions? We work to understand people in a different kind of tem- porality\u2014in between, in flux and transition\u2014as they endureand try to escape constraints and articulate new systems ofperception and action. By dwelling in the meantime of indi- vidual lives and social worlds, we strive to produce a knowl-edge that is not obsolete in the moment of its formulation.In this regard the time of anthropological knowing runscounter to that of political and economic rationalities, to thereason of policy and governance, which makes people theobjects of technical xes with specic, temporally limitedstages of progress and evaluation (Greenhouse 1996). Ourknowledge, by contrast, has a tentativeness and an open-endedness that can make it simultaneously historically attunedand untimely (Rabinow 2008), defying historical circum- stances and constraints in the service of becoming, of theunexpected, in defense of \"the right to a nonprojected futureas one of the truly inalienable rights of every person andnation\" (Hirschman 1971:37). This tentativeness, this receptivity to different temporalities, is not always easily borne: with an eye to the possibilities andnoninevitability of people's lives, we must recognize the thresh-olds where liberating flights and creative actions can becomedeadly rather than vital forms of experimentation, opening upnot to new webs of care and empathy but to systematic dis-connection. Becoming is not always heroic. Solidarities formedin reaction to the alienations of capitalism can themselves be-come exclusionary, founded less on expanded empathy thanon shared rage and competitive claims to victimhood; dreamsof the past can turn reactionary; new institutions of care canbe co-opted and twisted into instruments of power, violence,or abandonment; and mobilization for rights can culminate inatomized and highly privatized political subjectivities. In all this,market ideologies and practices may work as a hidden engine,reconguring and relocating social and administrative func-tions, as if behind the scenes\u2014social work shifts from govern-ment to civil society, medication from clinic to family, diagnosisfrom medical practice to the public sphere. How can we pin-point and hold accountable \"the market\"\u2014so impersonal andreied a force? How do we disentangle the agencies and modesof thought of which it is composed? Finally, we suggest that our anthropological engagements challenge us to maintain a sense of where assemblages\u2014com-plicated new congurations of global, political, technical, bi-Biehl and Locke The Anthropology of Becoming 337 ological, and other segments\u2014touch ground, how they take on institutional grip and individual, human valence. It is notenough to simply observe that assemblages exist; we must at-tend, as Deleuze and Guattari originally urged, to the waysthese congurations are constantly constructed, undone andredone by the desires and becomings of actual people\u2014caughtup in the messiness, the desperation and aspiration, of life inidiosyncratic milieus. Nor is ours necessarily a choice betweenprimarily global assemblages (Collier and Ong 2005) and prin-cipally local \"splinters\" of a \"world in pieces\" (Geertz 2000).At the horizon of local dramas, in the course of each event, inthe ups, downs, and arounds of each individual life, we cansee the reflection of larger systems in the making (orunmaking). Grasping subjectivity as becoming\u2014rather than structural dependence\u2014may be the key to anticipating, and therebymaking available for assessment and transformation, the fu-tures and forms of life of emerging communities. Continuallyadjusting itself to the reality of contemporary lives and worlds,the anthropological venture has the potential of art: to invokeneglected human potentials and to expand the limits of un-derstanding and imagination\u2014a people yet to come. \"Thereis no work of art that does not call on a people who doesnot yet exist\" (Deleuze 2006:324). This project includes theactive participation of readers. Thus also at stake is our ca-pacity to generate a \"we,\" an engaged audience and politicalcommunity, that has not previously existed\u2014our craft's po-tential to become a mobilizing force in this world.

They raise vital experimen-tations,\" and the \"literary\" rather than clinical force of in-dividual lives. Microanalysis here means the trajectories ofindividuals through milieus of affect and intensities. Biehl begins in a Porto Alegre asylum amid the socially abandoned, Locke in Sarajevo with the war devastated. Theynd active vitalities of people who must \"scavenge for just Catarina Moraes? Catarina, thanks toher advocate and anthropologist (getting her properly diag-nosed and her writings published) joins other canonic ref-erence gures. She knew what was going on as much as Han-nah Arendt did about the stateless and the vacuity of thosewho speak airily of Man and Being, rather than women andmen. Moraes and Arendt, both Gramscian organic intellec-tuals in this sense, spoke and wrote from their situated ex-periences but shed light on larger hegemonies and injustices. After Moraes one can never again take state statistics or policies at face value. Here is the force of the claim thatmicroanalysis be read as literature rather than clinically, asthe place where the particular Ibecomes an a, oscillating between the enunciatory and grammatical I. As Katkine ar- gues, \"My desire is of no value. Desire is pharmaceutical. Itis not good for the circus.\" She rejects this pharma and statewelfare insistence and the devolution that made her familyher proxy psychiatrist and enabled them to dump her for\"noncompliance.\" Moares morreu (died). She insists life re- sides in \"enjoyment enjoying itself,\" in reigniting desire overand over in statistics bear her out; she clariestheir implications: antipsychotics on the rise, care on the de-cline. She was producing, Biehl says, a theory of the aban-doned subject, her dictionary a cartography of displacements,less concerned with origins than with remobilizations of im-passes and breakthroughs. Similarly in Sarajevo, Loga says, \"I don't mind democracy but this privatization is just a maa. I don't know why theinternational community wants us to be in this mess.\" Psy-chosocial needs assessments and trauma responses by inter-national \"humanitarian relief\" risk seeing people only throughtheir psychological vulnerabilities, in danger of repeatingatrocities suffered, requiring outside supervision and symbolicjustice (\"while 'substantive social justice' is all but ignored\").Dr. Ljubovic, like the Moraes family, has no resources or timeto attend to the crippled capacity to trust, to connect, and tohope and can only prescribe medications. Milan and Majafunction in Locke's search for \"an agency that . . . pulses,\" like Catarina, refusing scripts of collective depression. The idea of literary listening is meant to recognize the alternative enunciative frames that individuals can mobilize.One thinks of Kim Fortun's ennuciative communities unsta-bly \"called forth\" to navigate double binds, contradictory im-338 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 3, June 2010 peratives for survival and thriving. But is \"recording com- peting rationalities and vital experimentations\" sufcient foranthropology's analytic force? Once the anthropologist was a public reference if one wanted to discuss marriage or penal reform, rationality, andworldviews. What happened to the challenges anthropologyonce mounted against Eurocentricities, masculinities, andphilosophies? Why do Foucault and Zizek's opinions on Irancirculate more easily than the opinions of those they writeabout or those who have worked there (unless French orEuropean Union opinion is the topic)? T oday it all too oftenseems the only alternative to the pundit rabble, the economistsworking away on unreliable statistics, the 20-year-old policyformulators, and the politician negotiators are the philoso-phers, even though they generally abandon any pretense tobeing empirically grounded. (If desire is the topos, why De-leuze rather than, say, Clarice Lispector or Helene Cixous?) The \"theoretical quick x\" of names, like at- tributing trademarks to ordinary words\u2014assemblages, fric-tion, equipment, concept work, multisided (attribute and usethem quickly, expiry looms, next arrives)\u2014is a self-defeatingneoliberal game of valuation, hardly an improvement overCold War ideological schools (you evil deconstructionist,postmodernist, bioculturalist, structualist, functionalist). Theproductive Cassandra of anthropology, George Marcus callsthis, as Biehl and Locke quote, awaiting another vision toprovide anthropology's analytic force. Biehl and Locke wantto rescue microanalysis from Marcus's \"in the meantime\"anthropology, working merely on remainders. Philosophers are ne, but as one reads for the ethnography, one reads past the philosophers looking for the Catarinas andMilans and Majas who shine the \"ethnographic lantern\" ofcontexts and situations. We tend to know less Gilles, onlyof \"Deleuze,\" somewhat more of \"Felix\" (Guattari) becauseof his involvement in on-the-ground psychiatric reform ex-periments in France, and much more of all three Catarina,Catkine, Moraes (surname and respect that we accord thenonsituated \"Deleuze\"). Evidence of transformative growth points and cracks within old hegemonic ideologies are often visible rst in \"minor loci\":the anecdote, the vignette, the ethnographic incident, the or-ganic local theorist. These act as pebbles and labyrinths inthe way of theory. V anessa L. FongGraduate School of Education, Harvard University, LarsenHall 401, 14 Appian Way, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138,U.S.A. (vfong@vfong.com). 7 X 09 This article is itself a beautiful example of how ethnography can generate theoretical insights, in this case about the limitsof theories themselves. By conveying the yearnings and agencyof sufferers such as Catarina and Maja, Joa o Biehl and Peter Locke demonstrates the power of ethnography to capture nu-ances of individual subjectivity that go beyond the assump- tions, categorizations, and assertions of anthropological aswell as psychiatric theories. Indeed, they show how the suf-fering of such individuals was exacerbated by efforts of thosearound them to reduce them to theoretical constructs. As-sumptions about collective depression and PTSD obfuscatedthe extent to which suffering in Bosnia was caused by socialand economic disorder and inequalities, and overreliance onpsychiatric diagnoses by Catarina's family and health-careproviders actually contributed to Catarina's misdiagnosis, ne-glect, and eventual death. Such ethnographic examples showthe real harm that can be done to individuals by the reduc-tionism of psychiatric theories, based on scientistic disciplinesthat attempt to reduce the messiness of human experience todiagnoses of illnesses that can be cured with medication andstandardized approaches to psychotherapeutic counseling andthat explain human suffering as failures of patients' compli-ance with treatment regimes. But Biehl and Locke are not just criticizing the scientistic theories frequently targeted by anthropologists; rather, theyare pointing out the limits of all theories, including anthro-pological ones, that attempt to interpret messy human ex-periences as part of broader structures, systems, and dis-courses. Such theories are important for understanding thebig picture of human experience, but they also miss out onthe messy flux and flow of individual subjectivity. Overreli-ance on theoretical constructs of any kind can blind us tothe desires and struggles that the individuals experiencingwhat we write about consider most important and meaning-ful. Ethnography recaptures what is missing and keeps theoryhonest. Ethnography without theory may be solipsistic andnaive, but theory without ethnography is sterile and tunnelvisioned. Drawing on the insights of Gilles Deleuze, Biehl andLocke make a strong argument for the continuing value ofethnography as a means to shed light on the \"individual andcollective struggles to come to terms with events and intol-erable conditions and to shake loose, to whatever degree pos-sible, from determinants and denitions.\" Ethnography has the potential to shed light on what the- ories actually mean as well as on the unruly possibilities thatsuch theories cannot capture. While theories can situate in-dividual subjectivity as part of the big picture, explain howit interacts with broader processes, or predict how it mightchange under different circumstances or in response to certaininterventions, they can also obfuscate, distract, or explainaway \"what really matters\" (Kleinman 2006). Biehl and Lockehave made a powerful argument in favor of the continuingimportance of engagement between theory and the kind ofethnography that can convey the messy dynamics of humanexperience. In so doing, they are insisting on the continuingvitality of the kind of humanistic ethnographic writing evidentin Biehl's ethnographies (Biehl 2005, 2007) and those of pub-lic anthropologists such as Lila Abu-Lughod (2005), RuthBehar (1993, 1996), Tanya Luhrmann (Abu-Lughod 1993;Luhrmann 2000), Catherine Lutz (2001; Lutz and CollinsBiehl and Locke The Anthropology of Becoming 339 1993), and Nancy Scheper-Hughes (1992, 2000). The ability of such public anthropologists to make anthropological in-sights meaningful for nonanthropologists and nonacademicsdemonstrates ethnography's power to transcend boundariesbetween disciplines and between academia and the generalpublic in ways that purely theoretical writing cannot. There is a piercing power to the voices of individuals in such ethnographic work that cannot be reduced to theoretical con-structs. Reading about them reminds us what it means to behuman and thus always in the process of becoming. Theoreticalconstructs are a postmortem, assessing general patterns afterthey have been created. But human experience is always in flux,and human subjectivity is always in the process of remakingitself. At its best, ethnography can open new doors of possibility,awaken theorists to their own blind spots, and convey aspectsof human experience that theoretical constructs often miss. Thiskind of ethnography reminds us that anthropology, like thepeople anthropologists study, is very much alive.

Rather, the point is that such an endeavor,which entails long-term ethnographic work and rigorous the-oretical engagement, reveals hidden complexities and poten-tialities that are at play in lives in contexts of crisis both clinicaland political-economic. T o demonstrate the fecundity of suchan approach, Biehl and Locke place their respective ethno-graphic projects in conversation with Deleuze's philosophyon subjectivity, charting the unexpected enunciations of theirinterlocutors as inhabiting and escaping, albeit in a \"minor\"way, the enunciated effects of their subject positions, also\"minor.\" It is in such enunciations, such words and acts ofbecoming , that the crucial dimension of \"what could be\" opens up. Such a theoretical endeavor already has a respectable lineof predecessors, especially in cultural and literary studies, butit represents a promising expansion for anthropology, partic-ularly as supplement for and challenge to the dominant the-ories of biopower and structural violence. In emphasizing the ways desires can \"break open\" against intolerable conditions, new elds of relation, and politics andmeaning, Biehl and Locke draw on Deleuze and Guattari'sconcept of \"minor literature,\" which is inseparable from be-coming. In what follows, I offer preliminary comments ontheir respective ways of dealing with this concept, with a focuson their shared validation, perhaps even celebration, of thegure of \"the minor.\" My sense is that while minor literatureis rich in conceptual possibilities, its implications for an an-thropology of becoming and for the \"minor\" voices on whichthis project rests need to be made more explicit. We should recall the three characteristics that belong to the concept of\"minor literature\": rst, it involves a \"deterritorializing\" useof a major language; second, it is political because it drawsattention to the conditions that make one language majorand others not; third, it takes on a collective because it em-bodies an emergent sensibility that points to the possibilityof a \"community to come.\" In Biehl's case, language is literal and virtual. By scram- bling representational orthodoxies, Catarina's words, both writ-ten and spoken, expose the potential of any form of languageto become something other . Her \"dictionary\" draws attention to the powerful ways language constitutes life not in the dom-inant sense\u2014that is, in an unyielding way\u2014but in the senseof a writer struggling with the problem of life while alwaysgenerating new meanings and connections that retain the pos-sibility of becoming. \" Kis open on both sides,\" she explains of the new letter character she uses to refer to herself. \"If Iwouldn't open the character, my head would explode.\" Cata-rina's deterritorialization of language articulates the logics ofits unfolding while defying exact classication. Biehl's long-term ethnographic work takes into account the historical forces that summon Catarina's minor literature intoexistence, but he preserves the vitality of her words. \"Her'minor literature' grounds an ethnographic ethics,\" he writes.There is close proximity between the \"minor literature\" ofCatarina, Biehl's ethnography of her, and the story of thecoming to ethics of the ethnographer. At times, the relationbetween Catarina and Biehl seems to traverse the traditionalroles of writer and reader; they seem to enter into a processof mutual becoming, thus embodying Deleuze's sense of une double capture (a double capture). Other times, the separation between the terms seems complete, such as when Catarinaremarks, \"I am writing for myself to understand, but, ofcourse, if you all understand I will be very content.\" I wouldhave liked more discussion of this problematic of individualand mutual becomings and of the shifting movements andstakes of writer and reader, minor and major. It may be usefulhere to consider He \u00b4le`ne Cixous's thoughts on reading (and not writing) as an experience that enables an exit or sortie (departure) of the dominant \"masculine\" order. \"In order toread, we have to get out of the text. . . . At some point, wehave to disengage ourselves from the text as a living ensemble,in order to study its construction, its techniques, and its tex-ture\" (Cixous 1990:3). How might Cixous's concept of de-parture call into question a conception of becoming that isbound up with \"minor\" writing? Locke's appropriation of the concept of \"minor literature\" focuses on its third characteristic: its collective value. He mapsthe small, practical ways Sarajevans \"sublimate\" the politicaland economic dispossession they feel, a process that occursthrough and against the meager social assistance programsthat are available. Maja, a director of a psychosocial organi-zation, subscribes to \"dominant\" notions of collective de-pression and PTSD but also undermines and exceeds these340 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 3, June 2010 categories in her relations with her clients and family. For Locke, Maja's words, relations, and emotions communicatethe \"life force\" of a \"people yet to come.\" I Locke's assessment of the semantic poverty of clin- ical and psychosocial projects and his call that anthropologistslisten for the undercurrents of meaning created by those ap-parently dened by them. That said, I found the descriptionof the collective value of the \"minor literature\" of postwarSarajevo somewhat forced and romantic. This uneasiness isshaped, in part, by feminist and \"minority\" critiques of De-leuze and Guattari's \"dream\" of becoming minor, a dreamthat risks obscuring the real differences between privilegedand oppressed, the desire for reterritorizaliation, and the ques- tion for whom the project of \"becoming minor\" is attributedto. Are the writings of a \"minor people\" ever afforded mean-ing and relevance on their own terms, or must meaning andrelevance be made in relation to their \"major\" counterpart? To end, any concept of \"minor\" within anthropology is bound to raise some difcult questions. While I agree that theconcept of \"minor literature\" may be useful to consider along-side certain anthropological projects, I have some concernsabout its extension into ethnographic ethics, methods, and ex-planation. It is important to question the presuppositions thatunderlie the theoretical concepts one uses. That Biehl and Lockehave initiated this particular interrogation is a welcome con-tribution to an emerging anthropology of becoming. Adam M.

(ageary@email.arizona.edu). 19IX 09 The impetus of this important article by Biehl and Locke is to advocate a way of reading or a mode of listening\u2014anethnographic practice\u2014that is attuned to desire, which theauthors describe as possibility and becoming , following De- leuze. Here, the authors are writing against the gravitationalpull in ethnographic and other modes of attention towardtreating ethnographic subjects as constituted and as revealingtheir constitution in their speech and actions. Rather, theauthors argue, not only are the social formations in whichsubjects nd themselves always incomplete and leaking inevery direction\u2014and to constitute they insist desire over the determinations of power. Whensubjects speak and act, they do more than reveal an experienceas it has been constituted for them; they also speak a desiretoward becoming that departs from that experience. The theoretical and practical project of articulating sub- jectivity in excess of structural determination is hardly new,but what the existence of this article demonstrates is that itis still unnished. My concern is that this article threatens torepeat an unproductive opposition between determinationand agency that has bedeviled the history of that project. I see this danger especially in the rhetorical distance that theauthors take toward the so-called archaeological methods ofsocial and subjective analysis, especially Foucauldian and psy-choanalytic ones. This distance, I understand, is a rhetoricalstrategy meant to yield signicance and value for a Deleuziananthropology, but it effectively brackets the complexity andpotential points of articulation between Deleuzian emphasesand those under development in these other areas of inquiry.Although it is important to point out that Freud set asiderigid inscriptions of psychoanalytic speech into theoreticalconstructions, including the Oedipus, later in his life (Fink2007:88), and Foucault (1990 [1984]) stated explicitly thatsubjectivity was irreducible to relations of knowledge andpower, I wish to emphasize the complexity of contemporaryresearch that is working within or near these theoreticaltraditions and point to some possible points of articulationbetween them and the Deleuzian analytic. In doing so, I hopeto respect what I see as the invitational quality of this article,opening lines of dialogue not only between ethnographersand their subjects but within anthropology and between itand other disciplines. Feminist anthropologist Saba Mahmood (2004) expands on Foucault's late readings of ethical subjectivity in her eth-nography of Islamic women's piety in Egypt to critique theopposition between agency and determination in Westernfeminist theory. Mahmood argues that feminist theory toooften restricts the category of \"agency\" to that which resiststhe structuration of the social and subjective, replaying thetrope of power and freedom that Foucault called the \"re-pressive hypothesis.\" She demonstrates that this understand-ing of agency has produced a deeply flawed and ethnocentricunderstanding of the pursuit of piety by Islamic women inEgypt, treating the pursuit of piety as ideological interpolationrather than as ethical agency in its own right. Articulatingoneself to norms, Mahmood reminds us, is agential and re-quires kinds of work on oneself that need to be understood.There is, then, no necessary conflict among desire, norma-tivity, and becoming. In a complementary but unique line of inquiry situated at the margins of the object-relations school of psychoanalysis,literary theorist Lauren Berlant (2007) has taken up the proj-ect of describing forms of activity and affectivity that fall intoneither the camp of normativity/determination nor that ofsovereignty, desire, resistance, or agency. These include modesof activity and attention that she calls \"lateral agency,\" whichshe argues is not oriented toward life projects or building \"alife\" so much as toward modes of extension, distraction, andgetting by under conditions she describes as \"slow death.\"Lateral agency in this scene, she argues, is a nonsubjectiveform of activity given the terms in which subjectivity is cur-rently described and constrained: not subjection, not desire,and not ethical self-formation. Biehl and Locke demonstrate some appreciation of the prob- lem of opposing desire and determination when they introduceBiehl and Locke The Anthropology of Becoming 341 the caveat at the end of the article that desires are easy enough to marketize and turn toward death and destruction rather thantoward becoming. But this caveat seems more to ward theanalysis from critique than to inform it. The authors write,\"Becoming is not always heroic,\" but they do not provide uswith a careful demonstration of what that might mean. Doingso might require revisions in their account of desire and be-coming. This need not and should not block accounts of desireand becoming, but accounting for these other forms of activityand affectivity does demand awareness of even more complexityto ethnographic subjects (and researchers) than the authors callfor at the opening of their article. Andrew GilbertDepartment of Anthropology, University of Toronto, 19Russell Street, Toronto, Ontario M5S 2S2, Canada (andrew.gilbert@utoronto.ca). 5 X 09 As an anthropologist of postwar Bosnia-Herzegovina, I share Locke and Biehl's sensitivity to the ways in which forms ofanalysis\u2014both ours and our interlocutors'\u2014can foreclose asense of possibility and occlude attention to how people areactually living their lives. Indeed, colleagues and I have arguedthat it is precisely by looking at individual desires and hopesin post-Yugoslav societies that we nd \"forms of possibilityoutlined against (and sometimes in terms of) disappointment,anger and despair,\" and that these possibilities compel us tolook for new ways to capture \"both the entrenched and emer-gent and the ways they are inextricably combined\" (Gilbertet al. 2008:10). It is against this background that I read thisarticle with great curiosity and why, I believe, it ultimatelywrites past those readers interested in the implications ofDeleuze's ideas for a theory of transformation as emergence.Instead, the authors frame and motivate the article in a waythat detracts from this promise. At times, the narrative issidetracked by what we might call a romance of salvage andsalvation and by an argument that risks caricaturing the roleof theory in anthropology. Let me elaborate. In his work with Catarina, Biehl offers compelling evidence of the emergence of a new form of subjectivity at the inter-section of urban poverty, social and state abandonment, andthe pharmaceuticalization of care. His engagement with Ca-tarina and her writing seems a distinctly tting example ofwhat Deleuze would call life continuously in the process of\"becoming.\" But what are we to take from this tale of be-coming? Can we say more about how that which is immanentto Catarina's life emerges from the realm of the potential intothat of a recognizable subject? Instead of theorizing emer-gence, however, we get method, an argument for ethnographyas \"cartography,\" a mapping practice that reveals, in the formof subjectivity that is unique to Catarina's becoming, thelarger forces at work in her life and their effects. This move from theory to method might explain why Biehl does not pursue the implications that a Deleuzian approachto Catarina's life might offer for an understanding of emer- gence. But it does not account for the romantic turn thenarrative takes into a tale of the anthropologist as saviour: someone who took his interlocutor seriously, helped to arrive at a correct diagnosis, and provided her \"the best possiblecare.\" This is anthropology as humanitarian intervention, andit seems to undercut the argument about \"desire over power.\"Even if Catarina's life is irreducible to and exceeds biopolitics or bare life, it is the anthropologist's agency and intervention that appear to matter most in this portrayal. I am also left with some questions about the kind of writing that the authors advocate. The Deleuze-inspired listening that they champion is detailed well, but what would Deleuze- inspired ethnographic writing look like? The article's single example of the radical, liberatory nature of writing that ap-proximates what Deleuze describes is Catarina's, for whomwriting is simultaneously therapeutic, self-constituting, and life creating. Is Catarina's writing the model for ethnography? What would that look like? Or is writing simply a metaphor for the irreducible potential inherent in human action, more inspirational than aspirational? One might say that the advocacy for listening and writing is somewhat reminiscent of salvage anthropology, always on the lookout for \"fleeting spaces\" and elds of action and signicance \"always at risk of disappearing.\" T oward what end? T o make them \"public,\" to \"account for people, expe- riences, and voices that remain unaddressed and raise calls for new ethics and politics.\" Given the vigorous calls for an- thropology to more directly influence public debates, I was hoping for an example of just such a call. The article initially raises the prospect of addressing what \"making public\" mightactually look like: \"What in things' . . . to acquire a social force and to attain recognition and political currency?\" Unfortunately, the question is left un- answered and simply posed again at the article's conclusion: \"How can we nd ways to bring our material to technocrats, policy makers, and caregivers in a way that truly challenges their practices and assumptions?\" These questions could have been taken up within the con- text of theorizing immanence and emergence. Here Locke's case is illuminating. He offers a description of immanent forms of social solidarity that become discernible if we rethink Yugo-nostalgia as something other than a mass pathologicalstate of communist subjects who have not yet come to termswith the End of History. However, these immanent forms appear to remain precisely that\u2014immanent, in potentia .W h a t would signal their emergence, when \"becoming\" might reach a tipping point and \"acquire a social force,\" attain \"recog-nition and political currency,\" or gesture toward an \"unex-pected future\"? What prevents this emergence? There is, inother words, a politics here, and on this point I found thedifferences between Locke and Biehl noteworthy: where Lockelooks to Deleuze-inspired anthropology to locate (immanent)politics, for Biehl its promise lies in how anthropology might342 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 3, June 2010 approximate art. These projects seem distinct\u2014with distinct stakes\u2014and this distinction might be worth exploring further.

(clarahan@jhu.edu). 14 X 09 In different life worlds and against the odds, Catarina, Maja, and Milan search for ways to articulate the actual and the possible. How to take such searches and struggles into account? In this article, Biehl and Locke write \" fora certain vision of anthropology\" in which actual people and their words, lives, and desires are at the core of anthropological inquiry. Here,Deleuze's reflections on becoming provide inspirations, but not recipes, for a people-centered ethnography that illuminates the \"leakiness\" of social elds from the shadows of deterministicanalysis. Given their concerns, it seems most appropriate toconsider the way in which Deleuze's insights articulate with their specic ethnographic contexts. In following their call for a people-centered approach\u2014one that I deeply share\u2014I weave between their ethnographic works and my own in La Pincoya, a low-income neighborhood in Santiago, Chile, to explore onethread, listening, as it critically engages the implications of \"be- coming\" in anthropology. T o begin, I draw inspiration from Michel Foucault's discus- sion of listening in ancient philosophy (Foucault 2005 [1982]). In philosophical ascesis, listening is ambiguous. In its passivity,it is the sense that exposes the soul to the surprises of the outside world ( pathetikos ). But it is also the only sense through which virtue is learned and the logos best received ( logikos ). Listening is not an art ( techkne ): it does not hinge on knowledge. Rather, it combines empeiria (acquired skill) and tribe\u00af(diligent practice) as \"the permanent support\" (a potential) for the in- dividual's bond to truth. This discussion resonates in La Pin- coya, where women ) others' difculties in a context where dignity marks the human from the inhuman. Difculties are kept\"within\" the home, while \"begging\" to neighbors runs the riskof having that beg heard as a whine. But hardships seep out\u2014 for example, through a child's cry from hunger\u2014and are \"caught\" by neighbors in a kind of perceptive net, generating acts of care, an acknowledgement without asking. Exposure tothe unexpected, acquired skill, and diligent practice constitutethis perceptive net and sketch a form of life that subjects at once hold on to and test the limits of. For Biehl, I understand the perceptive net in the anthro- pologist's work with an individual. With Catarina and herdictionary, Biehl is confronted with how to re-create the lifeworlds that failed her. Catarina takes Biehl by surprise, andhe responds with the \"acquired skill\" and \"diligent practice\"to acknowledge an other. What does Biehl do? He piecestogether clues. He returns to her family and the psychiatrichospital. He sees how Catarina was both expulsed by and inhabits marginally a form of life. Here, Deleuze's insights on literature and becoming artic- ulate with Biehl's acknowledgement of Catarina's desire. Ca-tarina writes a becoming. Catkine is actualized through lit-erature, as Catarina shifts to the third-person indenite. Asingularity generates a potential web of new relations in Vita:\"Here it is Catkine.\" From Biehl's writing of a life world thatexpulsed her to new relations actualized through desire, formsof life come into view for the reader against which and inwhich movement is called for. For Locke, I was unsure whether Deleuze's insights on \"collective enunciation\" elucidated or obscured landscapes oflife in Sarajevo, a context informed by humanitarian psycho-social projects and market reform. Locke argues that ratherthan diagnose the city, the ethnographer enacts a literary lis-tening, hearing \"passages of life\" that escape diagnosis. Clearly,there are stakes in how an ethnographer listens. But, how onelistens is crucially tied to an attention to how words are usedin specic contexts. It is tied to the multiplicity of the who of those \"people\" as constituted through their relations. Instead of the smoothness of a collective \"people,\" I prefer the \"rough ground\" of words and relations. Take Milan. Whatconstitutes \"home\" for him? Are meals eaten together? Thedetails of Milan's life world allows us to imagine how he gen-erates other durational registers. It complicates the equation ofan \"[orientation] toward future possibilities\" with \"hope.\" In details, we break down classic distinctions between the individual and the collective. Listening\u2014 pathetikos and logi- kos,empeiria and tribe\u00af\u2014is not what we ourselves would desire to hear, rendering optimism over despair (an expectation ofthe unexpected), but rather in listening to learn a lifeworldfrom others (the world surprising the soul). Listening allowsus, as Geertz remarks, to distinguish a \"wink\" from an eyeirritation or to acknowledge the uncertainty inherent in one'sattempt to distinguish it. In weaving a perceptive net in eld-work and in writing\u2014with the detail that it entails\u2014we hearhow a subject's voice is projected outward and alternativeforms of life are imagined and tested. I return to Deleuze'simage of a social eld \"leaking\" on all sides. Are anthropol-ogists challenged to go even farther? T o explore just how itleaks and those leaks' viscosity? Victor IgrejaInstitute for Social Science Research, Australian Center forPeace and Conflict Studies, Brisbane, Australia (vigreja@yahoo.com). 18 IX 09 In this interesting article, Joa o Biehl and Peter Locke describe and analyze the life of a Brazilian woman called Catarina andsome survivors of violence in Sarajevo through the philo-sophical ideas of the late Gilles Deleuze. Reading this articleas part of a collective and comparative project coupled withthe signicant differences between the two countries, one im-Biehl and Locke The Anthropology of Becoming 343 mediately gets expectations of a renewed demonstration that \"a comparative perspective can lead to asking very useful andsometimes new questions\" (Moore 1966:xix). This is not whatBiehl and Locke do; of particular signicance in their analysisis interesting project: using Deleuze's philosophicalidea of \"potentiality for becoming\" to illuminate our under-standing of cases similar to Catarina and postwar Sarajevo. In order to construct their arguments, Biehl and Locke assert that ethnography and philosophical dialogues \"[high-light] the limits of psychiatric models of symptoms and hu-man agency.\" This critique is repeated many times, althoughit lacks specicity and does not capture the complexities ofpsychiatric practice and research. There are psychiatrists whowould agree with Biehl and Locke that violence creates aparadox of devastation and recovery. Other psychiatrists de-veloped specic methods to rene diagnostic instruments andhave done longitudinal studies during many years. Still othershave developed comprehensive public mental approaches. Be-ing someone involved in the past 12 years in multidisciplinaryresearch on the manifold effects of the Mozambican civil warand famine, I think that the repetition of the critique ofpsychiatric models coupled with the lack of serious compar-ative anthropological analysis does not advance knowledge.The focus on these repetitions only delays the anthropologicaldebates on how to develop relevant and clearly articulatedconcepts and cocktail methods to understand the complexitiesof the human toll of violence and trauma. Instead, one of thethings that Biehl and Locke, following Deleuze and Guattari,write is that the symptom is \"a bird beating its beak againstthe window.\" It is unclear whether the symptom is the birdor the bird beating its beak against the window or the windowthat resists the beating or fails and breaks. Although Biehl and Locke afrm that \"people's everyday struggles and interpersonal dynamics exceed experimentaland statistical approaches,\" they do not recognize the com-plexities of these approaches nor do they really engage withanthropological debates on the performativity of encountersbetween anthropologists and their interlocutors. But just suchengagement is necessary in order to clearly grasp the limitsof \"intense listening.\" Although they know that listening isfar from being all that anthropologists do, Biehl and Lockecould have also seriously engaged with other works dealingwith issues of violence, creative resistance, and the politics ofrecovery (Lubkemann 2008; Schafer 2007). This lack of debatewith similar disciplinary works and the author's choice forcritiquing psychiatry and statistical methods obfuscates thefocus of their project of \"writing fora certain vision of an- thropology.\" They ended up pushing the debate in the wrongdirection and reinforced the misleading perception that tostudy violence, anthropologists need to critique psychiatry inorder to justify their procedural choices. The authors reiterate the importance of detail and context, but they do not clarify the meaning of detail and context andhow these have to be worked through to advance their insightsonbecoming . It is a queue of details: Catarina's sexual ex-periences, the misshapen nose of Milan, and so forth. For example, regarding Catarina's sexual experiences, their inter-pretation suggests desire. Why not also think that Catarina istrying to talk about rape? Nowhere is it explained how thenumerous details form part of a systematic body of knowl-edge, the inclusion or exclusion criteria for selecting and com-municating these details, the rules applied when editing thelife of Catarina and Milan, the weight given to the quotationsof the interlocutor's statements, and the location where suchenunciations are made. The authors could have claried theseissues and fleshed out their alternative research practices tounderstand \"a people yet to come.\" Particularly Biehl's in-tuitive borrowing of simple play-therapy techniques indicatesa tentative move toward a creative methodological cocktail inorder to engage with individuals going through very disturb-ing predicaments. But Biehl and Locke do not systematicallyengage in a serious exploration of the potentialities of com-bining methodologies. Instead, inspired by the reflections ofDeleuze, they shift between praising ethnographic methodsand considering that others' interventions appear as \"highlylimited and impoverished, restricted in imagination and outof touch\" and \"epistemologically myopic.\" I have doubts thatthrough this politics of persuasion and ill-informed polari-zation of research methods it is possible to mobilize lanternsto give visibility to the multifaceted experiences of people likeCatarina and Milan. Patrice SchuchDepartamento de un critique severe\" (Deleuze 1990), Gilles Deleuze attempts to trace writing as flux rather than code. His purpose:to stir something up, make something move. In the samepiece, Deleuze contends that there are two ways of reading abook. If one takes it as a box referring to an inside, thusseeking for its signied or signier, one's task would be tocomment, interpret, demand explanation, and endlessly writethe book of the book. The other way of reading a book is totake it as an a-signifying machine, which prompts the ques-tion, \"Does it work, and how? How does it work for you?\"This is an intensive mode of reading, in which there is nothingto explain or interpret. In other words, it is reading like anelectric circuit, which relates the book immediately to theOutside: flux against flux, machine with machines, experi-mentation and events. I would like to retain here this second form of reading as a way of establishing a zone of proximity with Biehl andLocke's article, as it seems to me that the authors' successfulintervention was precisely to put to work certain Deleuziannotions such as becoming, rhizome, cartography, and mi-344 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 3, June 2010 nority in order to spark innovation in anthropology. This opens the discipline up to new possibilities, including re-functionalizing ethnography as an analytical engagement withthe complexity of people's lives and desires, immersed as theyare in constantly mutable social worlds. For the authors, thistask demands a reconguration of our theoretical and meth-odological tools in order to engender modes of writing thatincorporate both the vitality of people's cartographies and anattention to the emergent, to \"a people yet to come.\" Such opening to the emergent is no doubt what engaged me the most. Among the various possible lines of flight avail-able for the reader, I choose to highlight the primacy of desireover power, which Biehl and Locke stress as a fundamentaldifference between the analytics of Deleuze and Foucault. De-sire stresses lines of flight and escape, indeterminations. AsDeleuze's cartographic approach, it gives way to multiple pos-sibilities and makes visible crossroads where choices can bemade beyond the shadow of determinism. Along with theethnographic Locke's perspective\u2014the Deleuzian inspirationhelps to unveil the ways in which people live their lives andstruggle to articulate desire, suffering, and knowledge whileimmersed in particular congurations connecting culturalrepresentations, political economy, collective experience, andindividual subjectivities (Biehl, Good, and Kleinman 2007:1-23). Here, subjectivity is not only about resistance, andneither is it merely silenced by power (Fischer 2007). Thatsaid, how does one make sense of the article's insistent op-position between desire and power? If it is true that desire always assumes human agency, agency is not always synonymous with resistance to domination. Itcan be seen as capacity for action engendered and made pos-sible by concrete, historically specic relations of subordi-nation (Mahmood 2000). Or it can be further subdivided intoagency of power and agency of projects\u2014the latter consistingof desire and intentionality\u2014in order to understand differentmodalities of agency (Ortner 2006). What makes these dif-ferent analytical perspectives on agency interesting is that theyhighlight something Biehl and Locke continuously refer to:the closer the anthropologist is to real people, their projects,their expectations, and their anxieties, the greater her abilityto capture drives and desires that escape the binary of resis-tance/subordination. This raises the question as to whetheran insistence on opposing an analytics of desire to an analyticsof power would not maintain the binary logic of subversionand resignication of norms when, as the authors themselvescontend, ethnographically individual biographies are pregnantwith collective implications and inflections, and collective cat-egories become evident only through an understanding ofindividual lives and trajectories? In other words, how to ar-ticulate desire and power without sacricing the dynamic,open-ended, and fluid quality of all human relations? The greatest appeal of Biehl and Locke's article is not so much its emphasis on desire as compared to power but ratherits treatment of the dimension of desire as a condition ofpossibility for new experiences. This brings to anthropological analysis much-needed renement and complexication of itsown project: instead of researching the already established,done, determined, and classied, anthropology endeavors tounderstand the unnished, the emergent, the open, the poly-semic, and the uncertain. In this sense, an analytics of desirewould not focus on the pursuit of well-articulated and denedindividual or collective projects but on the ambivalences andcontestations by people immersed in multiple and constantlychangeable worlds. This seems to be the boldest challenge setforth by Biehl and Locke, as it demands the broadening ofthe imaginative world not only of our interlocutors but ofour own disciplinary canons.

Butlike the very verb on which their argument turns\u2014to become\u2014their call for the craft of anthropology to act as a \"mobilizingforce in this world,\" though shot through with an inspiringoptimism, is partially realized: the authors chart a novel pathfor listening, reading, and writing experiences that eschews aconning common sense (writ large, e.g., through discoursesof pharmaceuticalization and postwar reconstruction), but weare left to imagine for ourselves how this heightened attentionto \"becoming\" might challenge the practices and assumptionsof technocrats, policy makers, and caregivers. The gap between the proposed analytical lens and its po- tential to affect the social and material conditions of the peo-ple whom Biehl and Locke study lies with its ephemeral object.It is more than a question of translation\u2014that is, how tolisten for and, in turn, articulate experiences that elude anal-ysis through power and knowledge, social suffering, and neo-liberal rationality. It is the dilemma of the necessarily incom-plete and at times invisible. Biehl and Locke anticipate this,repeatedly underscoring how Deleuze's notion of \"becoming\"intimates movement across emotional, social, and experientialregisters. But how can the \"grit of ethnography,\" tacking alongsporadic and unpredictable courses of imaginings, desires,partial words, and incomplete bodies, resonate with audiencesinto whose ears we hope to pour more complex, nuancedunderstandings yet who are invariably bound by the con-stricting conventions of \"common sense?\" It is a disheartening disjuncture, yet one familiar to scholars working, as Locke has, in places like postwar Bosnia-Herze-govina. Take, for example, the phrase \"missing persons,\"which signals a particular population among Bosnians: some30,000 individuals who were killed during the three-and-a-half-year war but whose remains were unrecovered. WhileBiehl and Locke The Anthropology of Becoming 345 Biehl and Locke do not focus on such literal manifestations of \"minor\" or \"missing\" people, the example ts well withintheir rubric of \"becoming.\" For the majority of Bosnia's miss- ing remains just that\u2014unrecovered and unidentied. These missing persons exist in a liminal state in which survivingrelatives cannot mourn with certainty of their fate; they lackknowledge about the missing person's nal moments of lifeand death and the whereabouts of his remains. And so families are left with memory and imagination, two streams of their emotional and psychic lives that connect the past with thepresent, extending into the future. If all goes well, the tech-noscientic apparatus developed to respond to the void cre-ated by unnamed bodies eventually presents families with a DNA-based identication\u2014statistically sound evidence of matching genetic proles, diagrams of skeletal remains re-covered, photocopied photographs of clothing and personalpossessions found with the remains. Behind this neatly packaged and presented set of docu- mentation lies the expectation that surviving families, their questions now answered, can move on, move forward, move out from underneath the pall of their grief because, at long last, they know. Here, unlike the unpredictable and innovative \"swerves\" described by the authors, movement is to follow a particular path toward social repair, and the onus lies with families to embrace and act on the \"gift\" of recovered remains and marked gravesites. For along with identied bodies come agendas of refugee return, reconciliation, and social reconstruction. I take seriously Biehl and Locke's invitation to complicate and challenge this teleology of movement; the families of the missing and the missing themselves deserve no less. In fact,one of the most compelling aspects of their article is the aim to lift up the meaningful words and actions of minor, missing persons. There is a refreshing optimism in what they ask us to study\u2014that amid the decay of Vita and the anxiety of Sarajevo (and beside the graves of Bosnia's missing) lie count- less moments of social interaction and expression that chal- lenge assumptions about the limitations of life. But the ques- tion of how lingers, and my own concern is that the desire to craft a new anthropology might have the unwanted, un- intended affect of eclipsing the very voices and lives we wish to open up to deeper understanding, at least among the eld of policy makers and practitioners. \"We are not the stars of this movie.\" Closing a recent talk before a room full of specialists in forensic genetics, the co- founder of the Argentine Forensic Anthropology T eam Luis Fondebrider urged humility among his audience. Gently and humbly he reminded those who have championed the suc-cesses of DNA and, more generally, forensic science in iden-tifying missing persons that the lived experiences of loss andsurvival, especially those of the families, must not be over-shadowed by a fascination with our ability to produce knowl-edge and x identity. In a similar vein, the study of \"becom-ing\" must strike a delicate balance between analysis andrepresentation, keeping at its center those whom it strives to serve through the art of anthropology. L. L. WynnDepartment of Anthropology, Macquarie University,Sydney, New South Wales 2109, Australia (lisa.wynn@mq.edu.au). 23 IX 09 Biehl and Locke weave together compelling portraits of urban poverty with a theoretical vision for how anthropologists canbalance our understanding of collective structures and indi-vidual subjectivities. This balance between understanding in-dividual and collective has always been anthropology's chal-lenge. The authors show how taking subjectivities seriouslyreveals what grand theories miss. Biehl takes Catarina'sdictionary literally and thus sees what clinicians and socialworkers are blind to; in Maja, Locke sees not just anothersufferer of collective PTSD but an individual sublimating heranger to mount a microscale challenge to politics-as-normal.This is the \"anthropology of becoming,\" an art of bricolage,where bricolage is both what anthropologists do with theoryand what people do with their lives. But what Biehl and Locke also offer, almost parenthetically, is not only a vision of anthropology but of the anthropologist.There is a haunting line that appears both here and in Biehl'sbook, Vita: \"The anthropologist is not immune.\" This cryptic aside alludes to the intertwined desire of informant and an-thropologist and reminds us of the improvisatory quality ofethnography. In describing both lives and ethnography ascreative works of art, we see anthropologist and informanton the same plane, collaboratively engaged and dialecticallybound. In this light it becomes particularly interesting to consider their reading of George Marcus's 2008 interview assessing thestate of anthropological theory today. In that interview (one ofa series published in recent years, all widely disseminated onlinewhere Marcus's cranky \"nothing new under the sun\" attitudeis critiqued with respectful indignation), Marcus is nostalgicfor what he considers the last great era of anthropological the-orizing. What followed that era was one of some uncertaintyabout the future of ethnographic writing. But despite the pes-simistic predictions of some doomsayers, this era of critiquedid not lead to anthropologists writing themselves out of jobswith their skepticism about truth and representation. We havedoggedly kept on writing and representing, and as Biehl andLocke point out, this has included new topics, theoretical ap-proaches, and experiments in writing. One lingering effect of the Marcus-era critique of anthro- pological representation was a quiet compromise over wherethe anthropologist ts into the text. Wary of the label of\"navel-gazing\" that often stuck to that era's experiments inethnographic writing but mindful of the need to acknowledgein our writing the forces that generate scholarship, anthro-pologists have typically resolved that dilemma by carefully346 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 3, June 2010 treading the middle ground. They introduce the ethnographer and the eldwork circumstances, but then this characterpromptly retreats so they can press on to demonstrate that their real object of academic inquiry is not actually the an- thropologist. But the anthropologist can never completely re-treat from the pages of her ethnography. This is not only aresult of the political imperative that requires us to stay re-flexively attuned to the structures that deliver us into a com- munity, shape the relationships we develop there, and influ- ence what we write; it is also a product of our peculiarmethodology, which mandates that everything we learn, welearn through our own embodied experience. What Biehl and Locke offer us is a vision for how to con- dently keep the anthropologist in the picture. Ethnography, they remind us, is art\u2014both the art of the anthropologist and his informants. Ethnography is also detective work, and the detective can never be written out of the mystery she inves- tigates. This comes through powerfully in Biehl's book Vita, which he summarizes here and which is as carefully paced and suspenseful as a detective mystery. It also comes through in Locke's investigation of institutions and lives in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Not only is there no detective mystery without a detective, there is also no hand-wringing angst about where the detective ts into our understanding of the mystery being investigated. The detective is simultaneously central and pe- ripheral to the story being told. I have only one reservation, and it comes at the very end of this article, where Biehl and Locke claim that what is at stake is \"our craft's potential to become a mobilizing force in this world.\" The examination of individual lives gives a face to collective struggles. As the authors note, this is what ethnography has always done best. Wings of Hope and Ca- tarina's dictionary show us the power and creative potential of complaint, anger, and bitterness, even in the face of poverty, sickness, and social abandonment. But in focusing on indi- viduals' responses to structural forces, the lines of flight and leakiness surrounding social elds, might we run the risk of heroicizing responses to poverty and oppression? If shining that empirical lantern on individuals' ways of making do leads us to marvel at human ingenuity and the triumph of desireeven in social death, will our marvelling weaken our call to political action? Reply \"There is so much that comes with time . . . the words . . .and the will not nd in the book. . . .Nobody will decipher the words for me. I will not exchangemy head with you, and neither will you exchange yours withmine. One must have a science, a light conscience. One needsto put one's mind in place. . . . I am writing for myself tounderstand, but, of course, if you all understand, I will be very content.\" Catarina's words came to mind as we read this provocative set of comments on \"Deleuze and the Anthropology of Be-coming.\" Her hermeneutics and ethics inspired us in the wayswe conceived and crafted this response. Adam Geary recognizes an \"invitational quality\" in our article, pointing to the ways in which it works to open \"linesof dialogue not only between ethnographers and their subjectsbut within anthropology and between it and other disci-plines.\" Similarly, Patrice Schuch underlines the potential ofcertain kinds of to make us work\u2014both on ourselvesand on \"the Outside: flux against flux, machine with ma-chines, experimentation and events.\" Schuch reminds us, invoking Deleuze's own response to a critic, that there is much at stake in different forms of reading:if one takes the text \"as a box referring to an inside, thusseeking for its signied or signier, one's task would be tocomment, interpret, demand explanation.\" But readers canalso choose a less prosecutorial approach, working to establish\"zones of proximity\" with a text and striving to understandhow the stories of others might emancipate one from a prioriassumptions. This emancipatory mode attends to what textsunleash , the forms of understanding that they open up be- tween us, and between their own lines: a truth/thought/poeticeffect that is owned by no one. It is humbling and immensely rewarding to see such a wonderful group of scholars read and respond to the articlein precisely this spirit (with very few exceptions). The re-spondents' mode of engagement\u2014methodical, perceptive,critical, generous, and open to the unknown\u2014restores a kindof infancy, a sense of potential and possibility, to the text wecrafted and (in a way) to the worlds from which it drew. Intheir own manner, and to unpredictable effect, this is whatthe subjects we engage in the eld also do. As Lisa Wynnobserves, the anthropology of becoming is \"an art of bricolage,where bricolage is both what anthropologists do with theoryand what people do with their lives.\" Recall Catarina. In the course of the anthropological en- counter, she denaturalized her abandonment and madness,claimed historicity, and invented, against all odds, a new nameand the possibility of a chance at life. As people and theirtrajectories are plotted into the collective narrative of eth-nography, they also keep plotting their own paths: Milan be-gins to exceed his destiny as a child of war, and Maja, withall her anger and tinkering with scarce resources, breaks openthe totalizing diagnoses that claim to fully encompass the pastand future of her nation. Drawing from her own ethnographicwork in a low-income neighborhood in Santiago, Chile, ClaraHan adds that \"exposure to the unexpected, acquired skill,and diligent practice\" constitutes a distinct \"perceptive netand sketch[es] a form of life that subjects at once hold on toand test the limits of.\" This potential to become newly unknown (or differently known) can help us better understand how our modes ofBiehl and Locke The Anthropology of Becoming 347 engagement and concepts can change something of the worlds we live in\u2014and, hopefully, of anthropology. By and large, therespondents bypass the kind of polarizing polemics\u2014all toocommon in the academy\u2014that stage the other's ignorance inorder to replace it with one's own knowledge and nal judg-ment. We see so much wasted energy and missed opportunityin this style of reasoning, a willful staking out of zones of distance and disregard : the inverse, hollow and cold, of the kind of proximity Schuch proposes and that Angela Garciarefers to as \"mutual becoming.\" We appreciate how most of the commentators shared what the article opened up for them, what they saw and felt in thestories and ideas that we conveyed, rather than simply pro-jecting deciencies and indicting the authors for failing tofulll imagined promises. Either way, commentators com-posed their own texts, giving hints of their own intellectualadventures and ethnographic and ethical afnities\u2014effectsthat the ideas and idioms of our article could not have an-ticipated. \"We are left to imagine for ourselves,\" writes SarahWagner. This active form of reading, in reappropriating thestories we told and the ideas we tried out, makes both writerand reader newly accountable for what emerges. \"Everywherethere are starting points, intersections and junctions, that en-able us to learn something new if we refuse, rstly, radicaldistance, secondly the distribution of roles, and thirdly theboundaries between territories\" (Rancie `re 2009:17). This openness to the existence of a third ,s ot os p e a k \u2014 a n it, an indenite, neither text/performer nor reader/spectator, but something that, in coming about in the provisional en-counter between them, generates new elds of understandingand possibility\u2014is exactly what we long to see more often ininteractions among anthropologists as well as between an-thropologists and their interlocutors in the eld. Along with\"the anecdote, the vignette, the ethnographic incident, theorganic local theorist,\" as Michael M. J. Fischer beautifullyputs it, this third eld\u2014fundamentally relational, the exclu-sive property of no single individual\u2014can also act as \"pebblesand labyrinths in the way of theory.\" The exchange that lls these pages has helped to crystallize for us the heterogeneity, creativity, and promise that marksanthropology today, contradicting orientations that mournthe passing of old - isms and schools while awaiting the de- velopment of a new and dominant paradigm (as if we mustbe bored and helpless without one). Anthropologists just\"doggedly kept on writing and representing,\" as Lisa Wynnpoints out, and productively so. The tension between em-pirical realities and theories is permanent and irresolvable. Inleaving aside pointless debates about the hierarchy of dis-courses or the nature of identity, the notion of becoming canhelp us to capture better the fecundity of the everyday blurringof reason, life, and ethics. Attending to life as it is lived andadjudicated by people in their realities produces a multiplicityof approaches, theoretical moves and countermoves, an arrayof interpretive angles as various as the individuals drawn topractice anthropology. Accounting for \"tragedies generated inlife\" (as Catarina would put it), social determinants, and in- stitutional and human heterogeneities may not be new oreasy, much less the key to an ultimate social theory, but itnever gets old or less valuable. There is a \"piercing power\" in the voices of individuals that ethnography can capture, writes Vanessa Fong, and which\"cannot be reduced to theoretical constructs.\" There are manyways to take up the challenge of remaining attuned to life'sirrevocable complexity and \"messiness\" and to insist that peo- ple must come rst in our work, that arcane academic language, solipsistic debates, and turgid prose should not be allowed tostrip people's lives, knowledge, and struggles of their vitality\u2014analytical, political, and ethical. Like literature, ethnographicwriting can push the limits of language and imagination asit seeks to bear witness to life in a manner that does notbound, reduce, or make caricatures of people but liberates,if always only partially, some of the epistemological force andauthority of their travails and stories. Allowing people's everyday arts of existence to become g- ures of thought is no straightforward task. In the contem-porary politics of knowledge, Fischer observes, anthropolo-gists defer too readily to philosophers, seeking authorizationin their pronouncements, \"even though they [the philoso-phers] generally abandon any pretense to being empiricallygrounded.\" Why, Fischer asks, does Deleuze get the power ofsurname-only reference and decontextualized and Milan\u2014do not receive the sameimpersonal treatment? The point, we suggest, may not be tomove our interlocutors in the eld up to our level in thehierarchy of epistemological authority\u2014or to that of the Eu-ropean White Male Philosopher\u2014but to dislodge the hier-archy altogether, to argue for an equality of intelligences andto nd novel public and scholarly ways to harness the creativeconceptual work activated in the eld. Read in this light, our article does not privilege Deleuze's knowledge over that of our eld interlocutors. On the con-trary, it is because we met and were in part transformed bypeople like Catarina and Maja that we feel a kinship with ahandful of Deleuze's ideas. The \"and\" in our title makes adifference: \"Deleuze and the Anthropology of Becoming,\" in- stead of, for example, \"A Deleuzian Anthropology of Becom-ing.\" We see in his reflections a way to begin to articulateand expand our intuitions\u2014grounded much more in eld-work experiences than in our limited reading of philosophy\u2014of who and what people are and can become amidst the\"viscosity\" (as Clara Han so aptly puts it) of leaking socialelds and encounters. But as Fischer has rightly suggested tous, we should also look for creative ways to personalize andcontextualize theorists. Probing the worldliness and the on-tological stakes in concept making restores to theorists theirsingularity and makes their concepts at once \"more limitedand more powerful (targeted, precise)\" (Michael M. J. Fischer,personal communication, 2009) We recognize and value the fact that other thinkers (such as Cixous) and traditions (such as feminist criticism), not to348 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 3, June 2010 mention alternative readings of psychoanalysis and of Fou- cault, could be very productively brought to bear on thethemes addressed in the article. There is, as Fischer, Garcia, and Geary remind us, a diverse set of intellectual lineages and histories to the ideas we engage, and something perennial,rather than teleological, about anthropological wrestlings withthe tensions between structure and agency, desire and power,the raw unnishedness of experience and the false closure of theory, and ethnography as literature versus ethnography as \"lab report\" (Geertz 1988). We see an important and distinctive contribution in an- thropology's long tradition of traveling with Big Ideas and reworking them through encounters with people and cultural differences: Malinowski rereading Freud in the South Pacic, Geertz thinking with Weber in Indonesia. Some of the theoriesin vogue in anthropology today\u2014from Foucault's biopoliticsand Agamben's bare life to Bourdieu's habitus and neo-Marx- ian concepts of structural violence and social suffering\u2014strike us, despite being indisputably relevant and helpful in many ways, as also somewhat overdetermining (at least in the ways in which they are taken up and applied), thus inhibiting eth- nographically grounded conceptual innovation. People are plu- ral and ambiguous, irreducible to history and populations, norms and social forces. We are marked by the unconscious, by the language of our ancestors, by knowledge and power, by scarcity and political economy, by interpersonal dynamics and desires, that is, by the immanence of worldliness. We believe that a crucial element of this immanence is the day-to-day anticipation or envisioning of alternative forms of existence. The main characters of our works have taught us that there were crossroads in their lives\u2014concrete instances of tinkering and manipulation with family dynamics, politics, ethnic af- liations, biology, and morality. Just as the past could have been otherwise, the present is not an inevitable destiny. This sense of crossroads is a condition for the pursuit of individual and collective rights to a decent life and future. \"Instead of researching the already established, done, determined, and classied,\" the anthropology of becoming, Shuch observes, \"endeavors to understand the unnished, the emergent, the open, the polysemic, and the uncertain.\" As both Fischer and Fong note, our discipline's relentless empiricism holds phi- losophers accountable to reality and allows philosophical ideas to have more\u2014or less\u2014currency in our conversations aboutconcrete human conditions. If this engagement leads to thesubtraction of theories, so much the better (see Nietzsche's Twilight of the Idols; or, How to Philosophize with a Hammer 2009 [1888]). We are grateful to Fischer, Fong, Wagner, and Wynn for highlighting our effort to show how theory becomes part ofthe ways in which lives are foreclosed or constrained on theground: how rationality is actively embroiled in people's des-tinies, complicated and opened up, day-to-day, by their strug-gles both to inhabit and break open the categories and di-agnoses applied to them. How, we are asking, can we continueto theorize, without being complicit with the real-world dam- age certain kinds of theorizing can do? Bold and creative responses to this question are too often chastised by the self-appointed arbiters of what counts as goodscholarship, attached, as they are, to fantasies of using an-thropology to master the ur-conditions of knowing. Analyticaldistance too easily becomes a sanctioned form of disregard.Ivory tower dismissals of public anthropology or any call togreater empathy and moral commitment in our projectsgroundlessly assume that actively listening to and assisting theworld's most vulnerable somehow renders invalid the knowl-edge generated in the process; or, most bewilderingly, that itmust represent a calculated attempt to set oneself up as a\"savior\" (as Gilbert puts it). The choice between salvationand disregard is a false one. The question is not just\u2014or perhaps no longer\u2014how eth- nographic authority is constituted but how it can be madeto circulate as more than a footnote to philosophy or eco-nomic models and without being co-opted into the reduc-tionist technical modus operandi of policy debates. Severalof the responses raise questions about how the study of be-coming can be made relevant for policy making and inter-vention without, as Wagner puts it, \"eclipsing the very voicesand lives we wish to open up to deeper understanding.\" Wetake this concern to heart; our critique of the quick technicalx applies also to the quick theoretical x, and becoming,certainly, offers neither\u2014while still helping us to map livesand social elds in transit. There is no universal formula forrelevance, and ethnographic work should not be valued solelyfor its immediate instrumentality. The insights anthropolo-gists produce are often, nonetheless, urgent; thus, we mustcontinue to challenge orthodoxies of all kinds (Farmer 2008)and seek original ways to communicate the \"ordinary affects\"(Stewart 2007) and categories that are signicant in humanexperience\u2014which the powers-that-be dismiss as \"anecdotal,\"nongeneralizable, and inherently impractical\u2014to the worldsof science, policy, and jurisprudence. This is not, as Igreja worries, to encourage an \"ill-informed polarization of research methods\" but rather to insist on thecomplementarity of approaches. While Igreja caricatures ourposition as ethnography (good) versus psychiatry (bad), in ourview one mode of inquiry always contextualizes the other, add-ing nuance and exposing methodological limitations and pos-sibilities. Wagner eloquently advances a similar argument, bothin her comments and in her larger work on the crucial role ofmemory, meaning, and imagination in the process of usingDNA science to identify the remains of Bosnia's missing people(2008). Rather than merely dismissing psychiatry and its med-icines, we argue that mental health professions and interven-tions could benet from anthropology's people-centered evi-dence, which, as ever, claries the inescapable knotting ofbiology, social environment, medicine, and the desire for care.On this point, it is always illuminating to revisit Mauss's en-during lessons on l'homme total (see Garces and Jones 2009). Symptoms are, at times, a necessary condition or resourceBiehl and Locke The Anthropology of Becoming 349 for the afflicted to articulate a new relationship to the world and to others. Catarina claimed that she had become a failedmedical regimen, and ethnography illuminated how her fam-ily had come to depend on this explanation to excuse itselffor her abandonment\u2014a social side effect of the larger phar-maceuticalization of mental health care in Brazil (see Biehl2005, 2007). However, Catarina's assimilation of her expe-rience of psychiatric treatment into a new identity, CATKINE,was intimately related to her struggle to anticipate a morelivable reality. By the same token, Locke's larger ethnographicwork on Sarajevo (Locke 2009) explores how the availabilityof psychiatric drugs and psychosocial services has enablednew, hybrid ways of remaking lives, families, and social roles.Psychiatric rationality is utterly enmeshed in the worlds weengage, altering people's lives and desires\u2014sometimes dele-teriously, cementing foreclosures, and at other times allowingnew openings and forms of care. Anthropological work is wellqualied to understand this tension, bringing us closer to thepolitics and ethics involved in the on-the-ground deploymentof psychiatric categories and treatments\u2014increasingly outsidethe clinic, in homes and in people's solitary relationships totechnology (Biehl and Moran-Thomas 2009). As anthropologists, we can strive to do more than simply mobilize real-world messiness to complicate\u2014or serve\u2014or-dered philosophy, reductive medical diagnostics, and statis-tics-centered policy approaches. Both the evidentiary forceand theoretical contribution of our discipline might be in-timately linked to giving creative form to people's arts ofliving. As Wynn writes, \"In describing both lives and eth-nography as creative works of art, we see anthropologist andinformant on the same plane, collaboratively engaged anddialectically bound.\" This approach has the potential to cir-cumvent \"crisis of representation\"-style agonizing, allowingus to linger, more productively, with the agonistic and un-certain dimensions of our eld engagements. In ethnographic writing, specic human stories can illu- minate larger social processes as well as people's capacities,irreducible to any philosophical concept, to endure or tran-scend, humbly or grandly, the weight of history and control.This is the immanence of lived experience, which always in- cludes forms of sublimation, however marginal or obscure.These impulses, as deeply human as the institutional forcesthat constrain them, need social recognition and care in orderto be sustained and to acquire political value. By more activelycultivating this kind of recognition, ethnography has the po-tential to trouble the inequality that has, in Didier Fassin'swords, \"insinuated itself into the humanitarian politics of life. . . there are those who can tell stories and those whose storiescan only be told by others\" (Fassin 2007 a:518). In facing and stretching their limits, people exercise various degrees of plasticity. The subjects we worked with activelyengage with new medical technologies, weave forms of spir-ituality into everyday labor and community, and inhabit mul-tiple temporalities as they live with the past and think towardthe future. Such becoming, we believe, is a fundamental entrypoint to the work of capturing the fabric of the times and people's everyday realism. Our ethnographic works should beattentive, as some of the commentators warn, to the dangersof rendering optimism over despair or romantically projectingagency onto desperate situations. The lives we encounter areprofoundly unequal, ambiguous and uncertain, and ill-disposed to clear-cut analysis and moral judgment. Y es, itrequires intense listening and long-term engagement withpeople to perceive and understand the moments and the dif-cult conditions in which repetitions and flights can turn vitalor deadening. Biehl recalls how startled he was when Catarina,on one occasion, became enraged and threw her dictionaryto the ground. She had just heard that Biehl had been unableto convince her family to schedule a visit. Writing, in the end,could not take her back home\u2014what she wanted most. Becoming is not revolution, and yet, as Wagner writes, even \"amid the decay of Vita and the anxiety of Sarajevo (andbeside the graves of Bosnia's missing)\" we nd \"countlessmoments of social interaction and expression that challengeassumptions about the limitations of life.\" Life bricolage\u2014what people make, often agonizingly, out of whatever is avail-able to them in order to endure the terminal force of reali-ties\u2014is a form of art, and we believe that it is not just Kafka,Joyce, and Proust, for instance, who can \"invent a new lan-guage within language\" (Deleuze 1997:lv). Moving away from the overdetermined and toward the incomplete, human be- comings intrude into reality, enlarging our sense of what is socially possible and desirable. T o endeavor to engage this dimension of human experience is, by its very nature, fraught,and will undoubtedly require greater professional freedom and bolder experiments in anthropological writing and genre. But not to represent and sustain people's sense of anticipation, even in the darkest of circumstances, is also a failure. These tensions should not paralyze our storytelling, but should ndexpression, so that the reader can grow closer to people. \u2014Joa o Biehl and Peter Locke References Cited Abu-Lughod, Lila. 1993.
