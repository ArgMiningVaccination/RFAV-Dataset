Astin, PhD, Shauna L. Shapiro, PhD, David M. Eisenberg, MD, and Kelly L. Forys, MA Background: Although emerging evidence during the past several decades suggests that psychosocial factors can directly influence both physiologic function and health outcomes, medicine had failed to move beyond the biomedical model, in part because of lack of exposure to the evidence base supportingthe biopsychosocial model. The literature was reviewed to examine the efcacy of representativepsychosocial-mind-body interventions, including relaxation, (cognitive) behavioral therapies, medita-tion, imagery, biofeedback, and hypnosis for several common clinical conditions. Methods: An electronic search was undertaken of the MEDLINE, PsycLIT, and the Cochrane Library databases and a manual search of the reference sections of relevant articles for related clinical trials and reviews of the literature. Studies examining mind-body interventions for psychological disorderswere excluded. Owing to space limitations, studies examining more body-based therapies, such as yogaand tai chi chuan, were also not included. Data were extracted from relevant systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials. Results: Drawing principally from systematic reviews and meta-analyses, there is considerable evi- dence of efcacy for several mind-body therapies in the treatment of coronary artery disease (eg, car-diac rehabilitation), headaches, insomnia, incontinence, chronic low back pain, disease and treatment-related symptoms of cancer, and improving postsurgical outcomes. We found moderate evidence ofefcacy for mind-body therapies in the areas of hypertension and arthritis. Additional research is re-quired to clarify the relative efcacy of different mind-body therapies, factors (such as specic patientcharacteristics) that might predict more or less successful outcomes, and mechanisms of action. Re-search is also necessary to examine the cost offsets associated with mind-body therapies. Conclusions: There is now considerable evidence that an array of mind-body therapies can be used as effective adjuncts to conventional medical treatment for a number of common clinical conditions.(J Am Board Fam Pract 2003;16:131-47.) Evidence emerging within the past several de- cades suggests that psychosocial factors fromemotional states, such as depression, behavioraldispositions, such as hostility, and psychosocialstress can directly influence both physiologicfunction and health outcomes. 1-4Evidence from several converging lines of research, however,also suggests that despite seemingly widespreadacknowledgment of and support for the impor- tance of the biopsychosocial model, 5-7psycho- social factors continue to be overlooked ormissed in many clinical encounters 8-12and are frequently underemphasized in medical educa- tion.13-15Whereas the reasons underlying the failure of medicine to move beyond the biomed- ical model are no doubt complex (eg, overloadedcurriculum, inadequate economic incentives),lack of exposure to the evidence base supportingthe biopsychosocial model might be one suchfactor. Furthermore, while studies have shown that evidence of the effectiveness of a given ther- apy is frequently insufcient to change clinicalpractice, 16the generation, synthesis, and com- munication of research ndings continue to becentral tasks for evidence-based medicine.Submitted, revised 16 May 2002.

Modality DescriptionUse by the Public17(%) Relaxation techniques Relaxation techniques, broadly dened, include those practices whose primary stated goal is elicitation of a psychophysiological state of relaxation or hypoarousal. In certain practices, the goal might be to reduce muscular tension (as in progressive musclerelaxation in which muscles are alternatively tensed and relaxed). In other cases, theprimary goal is to achieve a hypometabolic state of reduced sympathetic arousal. Themost prominent example of the latter is Benson's relaxation response 18,1916.3 Meditation Meditation has been dened as the \"intentional self-regulation of attention,\" a systematic mental focus on particular aspects of inner or outer experience.20-23Unlike many approaches in behavioral medicine (eg, biofeedback, relaxation strategies), mostmeditation practices were developed within a religious or spiritual context and held astheir ultimate goal some type of spiritual growth, personal transformation, ortranscendental experience. It has been argued that as a health care intervention,meditation can be taught and used effectively regardless of a patient's cultural orreligious background. 24The two most extensively researched forms are transcendental meditation,25in which practitioners repeat a silent word or phrase (a mantra) with the goal of quieting (and ultimately transcending) the ordinary stream of internal mentaldialogue, and mindfulness meditation, 26in which practitioners simply observe or attend to (without judgment) thoughts, emotions, sensations, perceptions, etc, as they arisemoment by moment in the eld of awareness10.0 Guided imagery Guided imagery involves the generation (either by oneself or guided by a practitioner) of different mental images. Using the capacities of visualization and imagination,individuals evoke images, usually either sensory or affective. These images are typicallyvisualized with the goal of evoking a psychophysiological state of relaxation or withsome specic outcome in mind (eg, visualizing one's immune system attacking cancercells, imagining oneself feeling healthy and well, exploring subconscious themes, etc)4.5 Hypnosis Hypnosis has been dened as \"a natural state of aroused, attentive focal concentration coupled with a relative suspension of peripheral awareness.\" 27Primary components of the hypnotic trance experience include (1) absorption, or the intense involvement of acentral object of concentration; (2) dissociation, in which experiences that wouldordinarily be experienced consciously occur outside of normal conscious awareness, inpart owing to the intense absorption; and, (3) suggestibility, in which persons are morelikely to accept outside input (ie, instructions, guidance) without cognitive censor orcriticism 271.2 Biofeedback Developed in the 1960s, biofeedback involves the use of devices that amplify physiological processes (eg, blood pressure, muscle activity) that are ordinarily difcult to perceivewithout some type of amplication. Participants are typically guided through relaxationand imagery exercises and instructed to alter their physiological processes using as aguide the provided biofeedback (typically visual or auditory). Examples of prominentforms of this therapy are electromyographic biofeedback, in which patients with acondition, such as tension headaches, are provided with feedback regarding the degreeof tension in the frontalis muscle, or temperature biofeedback, in which patients withmigraine headache disorder are instructed to warm their hands using as their feedbackcue sounds or tones indicating temperature changes in this region of the body1.0 Cognitive behavioral therapyAmong more traditional psychological interventions, one of the more prominent MBTs is cognitive-behavioral therapy. It emphasizes the role of cognitive processes in shapingaffective experience and argues that problematic emotions, such as anger, depression,and anxiety, result from irrational or faulty thinking. 28,29Behavior therapy (as distinguished from cognitive behavior approaches) tends to emphasize the use ofenvironmental reinforcements (eg, not rewarding certain behaviors) to change or elicitcertain behavioral changes.N/A Psychoeducational approachesThese approaches typically combine certain psychological strategies (eg, cognitive behavioral coping skills training, relaxation, meditation, and imagery for stressreduction) with patient education (ie, teaching patients about their disease, appropriatetreatments, self-care behaviors, and communicating with health care providers). Aprototype is the Arthritis Self-Management Program developed by Lorig andcolleagues 30N/A N/A/H11005not available. Note: In describing MBTs, researchers have used a number of broad, interrelated terms, including \"behavioral,\" \"psychosocial,\" \"psychoeducational,\" and so on. Such variations in terminology can reflect differing approaches and emphases. Often, however, thetermssimplyreflecttheparticulartheoreticalorientationsoftheinvestigators(eg,thoseworkinginthecomplementaryandalternativemedicine eld might refer to meditation as a mind-body therapy, whereas researchers within behavioral medicine might refer to it asa behavioral intervention). For simplicity of presentation, we have tried to use the broader term mind-body therapies throughout the article to refer collectively to these different approaches. 132 JABFP March-April 2003 Vol. 16 No. 2 on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from The purpose, therefore, of the present review is to provide a general overview of the state of the scienceregardingtherelativeefcacyofanarrayofpsychosocial-mind-bodyinterventions.Thisarticlereviews the efcacy of mind-body therapies(MBTs) in the treatment of health-related prob-lems other than mental illness or psychologicaldifculties. The National Institutes of Health(NIH) dene MBTs as \"interventions that use avariety of techniques designed to facilitate themind's capacity to affect bodily function and symp-toms.\" As summarized in Table 1, the prominentMBTs we examine include relaxation, meditation,imagery, hypnosis, and biofeedback. Owing to space constraints, we have focused the reviewonseveralspecicclinicalareas.Theseareaswere selected primarily because of their more ex-tensive investigation in terms of MBTs. We do notaddress additional body-based approaches, such asyoga and tai chi chuan, nor do we address theresearch examining spiritual healing practices, suchas prayer and distant healing. 31Finally, we do not review the literature of what might be termedbody-mind medicine, eg, the use of exercise andmassage to influence psychological function. Methods An electronic search of the MEDLINE, PsycLIT,and the Cochrane Library databases and a manualsearch of the reference sections of relevant articleswas conducted. Search terms included specicMBTs (eg, relaxation terms and pain\"). To further thescope of our search, we selected systematic reviewsof MBTs. When these reviews did not exist, weexamined the available literature, focusing on ran-domized trials. Although in theory systematic reviews reduce bias by objectively and systematically sorting outandthensynthesizingresultsfromavailablestudies,such reviews are still prone to bias. 32We therefore examined the methodological quality of the meta-analyses as an aid to assessing the validity of theirconclusions. We used the instrument developed byOxman and Guyatt 33to assess quality. This scale contains nine items and rates reviews on a scalefrom1to7(higherscoresreflectingbetterquality).Results Description of Mind-Body TherapiesWhile we have characterized the various MBTs assomewhat discrete categories, there is, in fact, con-siderable crossover between them, eg, imagery isoften included as part of meditation and relaxation;biofeedback often uses imagery and relaxationtechniques. In addition, studies examining thehealth benets of MBTs often combine modalities.For example, one frequently nds in the literaturereferences to psychosocial interventions or stressmanagementtechniquesthatcanincluderelaxationand biofeedback, as well as a cognitive-behavioralcounseling component. In Table 1, we have briefly described the more prominent MBTs. Quality of Reviews Datafrom28systematicreviewsaresummarizedinTable 2. There was a mean quality rating of 4.5 (of7.0). 33Eight reviews (29%) were judged to have majormethodologicalflaws(scoring3orless).Fiftypercent mentioned publication bias as a potentialissue, and 18% assessed whether it was present (eg,funnel plot). Fifty-seven percent tested for hetero-geneity, whereas 54% conducted sensitivity-sub-group analyses. There was a trend toward morerecent reviews scoring higher on quality ( P/H11005.06) and higher quality reviews being less likely to con-clude that the treatment was effective. Overall, the quality of reviews compared favor- ably with other areas of medicine. For example,among reviews in asthma 63and analgesia,6480% and 41%, respectively, were judged to have majormethodological flaws based on the Oxman-Guyattscale. Of particular concern in meta-analyses is the issue of publication bias. Sutton et al 65in their analysis of 48 systematic reviews, found that 54%showed some evidence of publication bias. Addi-tionally,whileonlyinfourcasesdidadjustmentforpublication bias change the statistical signicanceof the effect sizes, the failure to assess and controlfor publication bias could potentially invalidate theresults of some meta-analyses. In our review of theve meta-analyses that assessed whether publica-tion bias was present, none found any evidence forit. Whereas it is unclear the extent to which pub-lication bias might have influenced the results andconclusions of the other reviews we examined, Sut- Mind-Body Medicine 133 on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from ton et al65suggest that this number is probably fairly low (approximately 8% based on their anal- ysis). To summarize, most (71%) of the mind-body meta-analyses we examined were deemed to haveeither minimal or relatively minor methodologicalflaws, and their quality was comparable to, if notslightly better than, reviews in other areas of med-icine. We therefore feel relatively condent thatour overall conclusions and recommendations(which are based to a large extent on these meta-analyses) are defensible based on the current liter-ature.Thatbeingsaid,becauseanumberofreviewsdid contain major flaws, we suggest that futuresystematic reviews in the mind-body area attemptto incorporate reporting guidelines such as thosediscussed in the QUOROM statement. 32 In addition, it is important to note that the ultimate validity of any ndings derived from asystematic review must obviously be evaluated inthe context of the quality of the trials themselves.Among the sample of reviews we rated, 61% in-cluded only randomized controlled trials. In thosereviews in which nonrandomized trials were in-cluded, in no instance were signicant differencesobserved when the outcomes in randomized (ie,higher quality) trials were compared with those innonrandomized trials. In six reviews, 38,48,49,55,58,61 it was not possible to determine whether trialsreferred to as controlled were randomized or not. Finally,wenotethataseriouslimitationinmost mind-body studies reviewed is the absence of anyplacebo or sham control condition, because practi-tioners cannot typically be blinded to the treat-ment, and it is often not possible to blind patientsto group assignment. Pain-Related Disorders Arthritis Studies have examined the efcacy of multimodal MBTs in the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheuma-toid arthritis, and bromyalgia. These treatmentstypically include some combination of relaxation,biofeedback therapy, cognitive strategies (eg, forcoping with pain), and education. NarrativereviewssuggestthattheArthritisSelf- Management Program (ASMP) 30might be a par - ticularly effective adjunct in the management ofarthritis. 66This community-based program con - sists of education, cognitive restructuring, relax-ation, and physical activity to reduce pain and dis-tress and facilitate problem solving. An analysis of501 patients (68% osteoarthritis, 15% rheumatoidarthritis, and 17% other forms of arthritis) foundthat reductions in pain were maintained 4 yearsafter the intervention, and physician visits werereduced by 40%. 67 A 1996 meta-analysis61compared effect sizes of psychoeducational interventions, including theASMP, with those found in randomized trials ofnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).Overall, effect sizes appeared quite small for theseMBTs (0.17for pain, 0.03 for functional disability,0.34fortenderjointcountinrheumatoidarthritis).The authors note, however, that because most pa-tients in these trials were already on NSAIDs, therelatively small effect sizes probably represent theadditional benet in addition to medication andmight therefore be clinically relevant. There havebeen no randomized trials that directly compareMBTs with pharmacologic therapy. A recent meta-analysis 36of 25 randomized trials of MBT found small but statistically signicanteffect sizes for pain (0.22), disability (0.36), anddepression (0.17) in patients with rheumatoid ar-thritis.Atfollow-up(averaging8.5months),effectsremained signicant for all outcomes except pain,whereas effects for tender joints became signicant(effect size /H110050.35). Findings regarding the efcacy of MBTs in - bromyalgia are equivocal. A Cochrane review of 13controlledtrials(mostofwhichwereofpoormeth-odologic quality) found limited evidence thatMBTsaremoreeffectivethanwaiting-listorusual-care controls and inconclusive evidence that thesetherapies are more effective than physiotherapy oreducation-attention controls. 47 Pain Management Findings regarding the efcacy of relaxation ther-apy alone (eg, progressive muscle relaxation) forchronicandacutepainareinconclusive.Althougha1996 NIH consensus panel stated that there was\"strong\" evidence that relaxation techniques wereeffective in the treatment of chronic pain, 68a sys- tematic review of nine randomized trials39found positive treatment effects in only three studies andconcludedthatthereisinsufcientevidencefortheuse of relaxation alone in the treatment of chronicpain.Asystematicreviewofrandomizedcontrolledtrials examining relaxation for acute pain manage-ment 60similarly concluded that though there was 136 JABFP March-April 2003 Vol. 16 No. 2 on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Low Back Pain A Cochrane review examined the efcacy of MBTsin chronic low back pain. 62Twenty randomized trialswerefound.Interventionswerecategorizedasoperant (using reinforcement to modify behavior),cognitive (modication of cognitive responses topain), or respondent (modication of the physio-logic response system, eg, progressive muscle re-laxation).Althoughoverall,only25%ofthestudiesreceived high methodological quality ratings, theauthors concluded that there was strong evidence(denedasgenerallyconsistentndingsinmultiplehigh-quality randomized controlled trials) thatMBTs, when compared with wait-list controls orusual medical care, have a moderate positive effecton pain intensity (effect size /H110050.62; 95% con- dence interval [CI], 0.25-0.98) and status (effect /H110050.35; CI, /H110020.04-0.74) and behavioral outcomes (effectsize/H110050.40; 95% CI, 0.10-0.70). Results did not shed light on the relative efcacy of the differentMBTs. Headache A 1990 meta-analysis compared the efcacy of re-laxation and biofeedback (34 trials) with drug ther-apy (25 trials) in recurrent migraine headache. 49 Both approaches yielded similar results\u201443% re-duction in headache activity in the average patientcompared with 14% reduction with placebo medi-cationandnoreductioninunmedicatedsubjects.Amorerecentnarrativereviewconcludedthatacom-binationofrelaxationtrainingandthermalbiofeed-back is the preferred behavioral treatment for re-current migraine disorder. 69 A 1997meta-analysis46suggests that both home and clinic-based MBTs are more effective thanwaiting-list or usual-care controls in the treatmentof chronic benign headache (effect size /H110050.51 and 0.52, respectively, across all headache types andoutcomes). Recent evidence indicates that stress-management training is as effective as tricyclicantidepressants in the management of chronictension-type headache, suggesting that combiningthese two therapeutic approaches might be moreeffective than using either one alone. 70Cancer Evidence from multiple studies in heterogeneous groups of cancer patients71suggests that various MBTs can improve mood, quality of life, and cop-ing, 72-76as well as ameliorate disease and treatment- related symptoms, such as chemotherapy-inducednausea and vomiting, 77-80physical Consistent with 45 randomized trials examiningpsychoeducational interventions for adult cancerpatients 53found small but statistically signicant effect sizes for treatment and disease-relatedsymptoms (eg, pain, nausea) of 0.26 (95% CI,0.16-0.37), functional adjustment size /H11005 0.19; emotional adjust-ment (effect size /H110050.24; 95% CI, 0.17-0.32). A more recent narrative review of 54 studies exam-ined the efcacy of an array of behavioral inter-ventions, including contingency management,relaxation, imagery, and hypnosis, in managingtreatment-related side effects in cancer pa-tients. 85The authors concluded that such inter - ventions were effective in reducing anticipatorynausea and vomiting and treating acute pain as-sociated with diagnostic and treatment proce-dures. The evidence for chronic pain and nauseaand vomiting after chemotherapy were deemedless strong. Whereas studies suggest that MBTs can alter variousimmuneparametersincancerpatients, 86-88 it is unclear what the potential clinical importanceof these changes might be in terms of disease pro-gression. Two randomized controlled trials thatattemptedtocorrelatechangesinimmunologicpa-rameters with effects on disease progression andsurvival failed to do so. 89-90 The debate regarding whether MBTs can influ- ence survival among cancer patients remains unre-solved. Three randomized trials have shown a sig-nicant survival effect. 90-92In the most well publicized of these trials,91women with metastatic breast cancer randomized to a 1-year weekly sup-port and hypnosis group rates 10-year follow-up.

Downloaded from Incontinence Disorders There is strong evidence that biofeedback-assistedmuscle re-training is effective in the treatment ofincontinence disorders, as reflected in the 1996clinical practice guidelines from the Agency forHealth Care Policy and Research that recommendbehavioral treatments as a rst-line treatment inurinary incontinence. 97A 1998 systematic review37 concluded that biofeedback did not add signi-cantly to pelvic floor exercises in treating urinaryincontinence in women. A meta-analytic review ofve of these same trials, 98however, concluded that biofeedback-assisted pelvic floor exercises were, infact,moreeffectivethanpelvicfloorexercisesalone(OR/H110052.1;95%CI0.99-4.4).Severalrecentstud- ies biofeedback in Burgio etal 100showed that biofeedback-assisted behavioral treatment was more effective than drug therapy inreducing incontinence episodes in elderly women. Research also suggests that biofeedback is a po- tentially effective treatment for patients with pas-siveandurgefecalincontinence 102,103andimpaired fecalcontinenceafterobstetrictrauma,104andcon- stipation.105,106 Cardiovascular Disease and HypertensionHuman and animal studies show that psychologicalfactors (eg, depression, hostility, and stress) canplay a substantive role in the development andprogression of cardiovascular disease. 1In the most recent review examining the role of psychologicalfactors in coronary artery disease, the authors con-cluded: \"A confluence of pathophysiological andepidemiologic studies establish that both acute andchronic forms of psychosocial stress contribute tothe pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis.These data establish an imperative for enhancingbehavioral interventions among CAD-prone indi-viduals.\" There is evidence that MBTs can be effective in the treatment of coronary artery disease. A 1996meta-analysis of 23 randomized trials 52found that the addition of psychosocial treatments (eg, relax-ation, group and individual psychotherapy, type Abehaviormodication,stress-management)tostan-dardcardiacrehabilitationresultedina41%reduc-tion in all-cause mortality and a 46% reduction innonfatal cardiac recurrences at a 2-year follow-up.When patients were observed for more than 2years, the mortality reductions became nonsigni-cant. (Only three randomized controlled trials pro-vided longer term follow-up data, and when resultsfrom the large, nonrandomized Recurrent Coro-nary Prevention Project were added, the longerterm follow-up results for mortality became signif-icant.) The authors noted that while the interven-tions were quite diverse in terms of length, targetbehavior(s),andspecictypeoftherapy,theresultswere almost uniformly positive across studies. In a more recent meta-analysis 43examining the effectiveness of psychoeducational interventions(healtheducationandstressmanagement)across37studies, there was a 34% reduction in cardiac mor-tality,a29%reductioninrecurrenceofmyocardialinfarctions, and signicant positive effects on di-etary and exercise habits, weight, smoking, choles-terol, and blood pressure. Data from a recent pro-spective trial not included in the above reviewfound that patients with coronary artery disease(n/H1100594) randomized to a stress management in- tervention evidenced fewer recurrent coronaryevents at 5-year follow-up compared with thosepatients receiving usual care. 107 The evidence for the efcacy of MBTs in hy- pertension remains somewhat unclear. Althoughtwo meta-analyses had questioned the ef-cacy of relaxation 108and cognitive-behavioral in - terventions44in treating hypertension, a more re - cent meta-analysis51concluded that MBTs (particularly individualized cognitive-behavioralapproaches) were comparable to drug treatments(in terms of raw effect sizes) in reducing both sys-tolic and diastolic blood pressure. Since this 1994 meta-analysis, several random- ized trials have appeared that further suggest thepotential efcacy of MBTs in hypertension. Astudy of older African Americans (n /H11005127) 109 found that hypertensive patients randomized to a3-month trial in and diastolic pres-sure (10.7and 6.4 mm Hg, respectively) comparedwith those practicing progressive muscle relaxationand an educational control. In a smaller trial (n /H11005 39), 110signicant reductions in medication re - quirements were achieved by hypertensive patientsrandomized to a 6-week intervention that included temper-ature biofeedback, progressive muscle relaxation,and therapy for stress and anger management.

Insomnia Numerous trials as well as several reviews 111-114 and meta-analyses55,58have examined the efcacy of MBTs for insomnia.113A meta-analysis of 59 studies55reported that psychological interven - tions averaging 5 hours produced reliable changesinsleep-onsetlatencyandtimeawakeaftersleep.A1996 NIH consensus panel concluded that MBTs,most notably relaxation and biofeedback, producesignicantchangesinsomeaspectsofsleepbutthatit was unclear whether the magnitude of the im-provementsinsleeponsetandtotalsleeptimewereclinically signicant. 68A 1999 systematic review concluded that stimulus control, progressive mus-clerelaxation,andparadoxicalintentionmetAmer-ican Psychological Association (APA) criteria for\"empirically supported\" treatments, whereas threeadditional approaches\u2014sleep restriction, APA criteria for \"probably efcacious\"treatments. 113 MBTs can be helpful in treating late-life insomnia.114A recent randomized trial115found that cognitive-behavioral therapy (alone and incombination with pharmacologic therapy) was ef-fective in reducing time awake after sleep onset inelderly patients. Whereas drug therapy alone wasalso more effective than placebo, only those pa-tients using the behavioral approach maintainedtreatment gains at follow-up. 115 Although pharmacological treatments produce somewhat faster sleep improvements in the shortterm, behavioral approaches in the intermediateterm (4-8 weeks) show comparable effects, and inthe long-term (6-24 months) behavioral ap-proaches show more favorable outcomes than drugtherapies. 116The extent to which mind-body and pharmacological therapies can be effectively com-binedinthetreatmentofinsomniarequiresfurtherstudy. 114 Surgical OutcomesStudies have examined the efcacy of MBTs, suchas relaxation, guided imagery, hypnosis, and in-structional interventions (eg, providing informa-tion about the procedure), before surgery on post-surgical outcomes. 117The most recent meta-analysis50found moderate to large effect sizes across several outcomes including pain (effectsize/H110050.85; 95% CI, 0.17-1.52), medication use (effect size /H110050.60; 95% CI, 0.36-0.84), length of stay (effect size /H110050.65; 95% CI, 0.24-1.06), and recovery /H110020.95- 2.18).Thesendingsareingeneralagreementwithprevious meta-analyses 42,118-120that found consis treatment effects for MBTs on a va-riety of postsurgical outcomes. For example, De-vine 42reports that across 76 studies, length of hospital stay was decreased on average 1.5 daysamong patients receiving presurgical MBT inter-ventions. Atthispoint,however,thereisnoclearevidence regarding which MBTs are most effective, nor isthere consensus as to the precise psychophysiolog-ical mechanisms (eg, reassurance, patient involve-ment, sense of control, relaxation-induced immuneenhancement) that underlie these observed ef-fects. 117 Additional Clinical AreasThere are several other areas that merit furtherresearchbasedeitheronpositivendingsfromran-domized trials or strong theoretical links to psy-chosocial stress.

Cost-Effectiveness A number of clinical studies 18,145-147and narrative reviews42,120,148-150suggest that MBTs can be cost-effective. Most recently, the previously dis-cussed trial conducted by Blumenthal et al, 107 which showed signicant reductions in coronaryevents for patients randomized to a stress manage-ment intervention, found signicant cost savingsassociated with the program (when compared withan exercise program or usual medical care).

Downloaded from Some persons report experiencing increased anxiety while practicing relaxation techniques. The few small controlled trials that have examined theincidence of such relaxation-induced anxiety havefound rates from 17% 151to 31%152for relaxation to as high as 53.8% during meditation.152Factors that might be associated with such effects includefear of losing control, general restlessness and fearofinactivity,andfearoflettinggo. 151,153Additional aversive states include unfamiliar feelings and sen-sations, intrusive thoughts, sense of losing control,floating, dizziness, feelings of vulnerability, sensa-tions of heaviness, and myoclonic jerks. 153In a survey of 116 psychologists using relaxation tech-niques in their practice, the most frequently re-ported problems encountered by patients were in-trusivethoughts(15%),fearoflosingcontrol(9%),disturbing sensory experiences (4%), and musclecramps and spasms (4%). Respondents reportedthat they terminated 3.8% of clients because sideeffectswereseriouslyinterferingwithtreatment. 154 It has been suggested that some of these side effects are to be expected and can be used thera-peutically. 155Forexample,awarenessofphysicalor psychological tension or stress during the practiceof meditation and relaxation can facilitate one'slearning to cope more effectively with stressful lifesituations when they arise. Studies also suggest that some patients might experience transitory negative effects either duringor after hypnosis. 156-159These effects include headaches, drowsiness, confusion, such symptoms. 158It has been sug - gestedthatthemoreseriouscomplicationsareusu-ally the result of the misapplication of hypnotictechniques or simply poor clinical practice (eg, notpreparing patients sufciently). 158 Given the above ndings suggesting that al- thoughrelativelyinfrequent,MBTscangiverisetocertain negative effects, we concur with Carlsonand Nitz 160that it is only prudent to apply such therapies after \"careful evaluation of patients andwithin the context of an appropriate professionalrelationship.\" Directions for Future Research In this review we have suggested that a number ofMBTs should be considered for inclusion as ad-junctive or complementary therapies for severalcommonmedicalconditions.Wehavesummarizedthis best clinical evidence in Table 3. We believe,however, a host of clinical and research issues mustbe better addressed if MBTs are to be more effec-tively integrated into conventional medical care.These issues include examining the role of MBTsin primary and secondary prevention; comparingthe clinical and cost-effectiveness of MBTs againstoneanothertodeterminemoreclearlywhichstrat-egies are most effective under what conditions andfor which patients; better clarifying which patientsare most likely to respond positively to MBTs andwhat the key psychosocial, contextual, and disposi-tional variables might be (ie, emotional distress,readiness to change, desire for control); examiningtherelativecontributionofnonspecic(ie,placebo)factors associated with the effectiveness of MBTs;and continuing to elucidate the mechanisms of ac-tion underlying these therapeutic approaches. Conclusion We believe that the cumulative clinical evidencereviewed here lends strong support to the notionthat medicine should indeed adopt a biopsychoso-cial 5,7rather than exclusively biologic-genetic model of health. AssummarizedinTable3,basedonthepositive ndings of meta-analyses and randomized con-trolled trials, there is strong evidence to supportthe incorporation of an array of mind-body ap-proachesinthetreatmentofchroniclowbackpain,coronaryarterydisease,headache,andinsomnia;inpreparation for surgical procedures; and in man-agement of the treatment and disease-relatedsymptoms of cancer, arthritis, and urinary inconti-nence. Although we have noted several areas thatfuture research should address (eg, mechanisms ofaction of MBTs, the relative contribution of non-specic factors), given the relatively infrequent andminimal side effects associated with such treat-ments and the emerging evidence that these ap-proaches can also result in signicant cost sav-ings, 107we believe that the integration of psychosocial-mind-body approaches, particularlyin the clinical areas highlighted above, should beconsidered a priority for medicine.
