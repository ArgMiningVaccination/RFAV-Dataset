We included vital self-care steps like washing your hands, getting plenty of rest, and avoiding crowds. Now, we'd like to add another really powerful tool. Research shows that prayer and meditation may have a significant and positive impact on your immune system. In a time of uncertainty amid the spreading pandemic, prayer may be more beneficial than ever. While social distancing measures have led to the closure of many places of worship\u2014churches, mosques, and synagogues\u2014you can still pray at home. Even if you aren't accustomed to this type of practice, you may find benefit in spending some time praying or meditating. It doesn't have to be complicated. Sit quietly and share your prayer or intention. Ask for strength or guidance when needed, or affirm your faith in a higher power. The connection established through prayer is particularly powerful at a time when many are feeling socially isolated, scared, or lonely. [The many benefits of spirituality are well-documented (](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2802370/) [2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2802370/)). Part of this is the reassurance granted by releasing worries, rather than carrying them inside alone. When we pray, we rewire unserving pathways, replacing doubts with faith. By including [gratefulness and gratitude](https://energymattersllc.com/blogs/news/is-gratefulness-the-key-to-happiness) in your prayer, you also invite a higher energetic vibration\u2014associated with peace and wellness. It's not a coincidence that people who regularly pray have better health and lower blood pressure compared to those who don't.
