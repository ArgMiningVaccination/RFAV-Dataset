From the work of Schultz (1964) through the early 1990s,most development economists instead took it as axiomatic that people in developingcountries were \"poor but efcient\". The eld of development economics has been transformed since the 1990s in part by the growth in experiments. Most of these have focused either on issues of im-portance to development economics, such as the rate of return to capital for smallenterprises, or policy issues, such as nding ways to increase use of fertilizer to in-crease agricultural production in Africa. Until recently, only a few were designed totest behavioral theories or to identify the parameters of behavioral models. Yet, inthe past decade, development economics has increasingly come to incorporate theo-ries and ideas from behavioral economics into the study of questions in development,giving birth to the subeld of behavioral development economics .1Introduction 347 Our denition of \"behavioral\" economics hews closely to those in other chap- ters in this handbook. We view behavioral economics as consisting of systematic deviations from the standard economic model in terms of preferences, beliefs, anddecision-making. These deviations are motivated by insights from psychology butare typically captured using economic models (Rabin, 1998; DellaVigna, 2009). In parts of this chapter, we extend this denition to include systematic deviations byrms from prot-maximization, even if the underlying psychology is not yet wellunderstood. We discuss several areas in which concepts from behavioral economics have proved useful in shedding light on issues in development economics. We focus onthree types of non-standard preferences\u2014present bias, reference-dependent prefer-ences (loss aversion), and social preferences\u2014and three key areas of non-standardbeliefs\u2014na\u00efvet\u00e9 about present bias, projection bias and deviations from Bayesianlearning. We touch upon other behavioral concepts related to non-standard decision-making, including limited attention and memory, mental accounting, and defaulteffects. We also discuss the literature on the psychology of poverty, which arguesthat the conditions of living in poverty themselves have a causal effect on cognitive function and economic behavior. We begin by examining a key puzzle in development economics. The Euler equa- tion derived from intertemporal choice models directly relates consumption growth to rates of return on available investment opportunities. Calibrated versions of thisequation using standard preference parameter values, rational expectations, and thehigh rates of return to investments identied in recent studies in developing countriespredict high consumption growth of over forty percent annually. Observed consump-tion growth is much lower. We argue that the puzzle cannot be explained by creditconstraints, non-concave production functions, or stochastic production. Present bias can play an important role in resolving this puzzle, because it can explain impatient short-run behavior while maintaining realistic predictions aboutlonger-run choices. The modied Euler equation implied by present-biased prefer-ences can generate a signicantly lower effective discount factor and thus substan-tially reduce the implied rate of consumption growth. Under-investment in preventive health is a particularly striking and widely docu- mented example of individuals' failure to take advantage of high-return investmentopportunities. We argue that this underinvestment in preventive, as opposed to cu-rative, health care is difcult to explain in a purely rational model. For instance,positing large disutility costs from preventive health activities would not be enoughto explain the low levels of health investments, as this explanation is at odds withthe high sensitivity of demand for preventive health to small differences in price orconvenience. We use the case of health to explore a more general issue: the role of mis- prediction of future preferences in shaping current mis-optimization and choices. A general insight from behavioral economics is that the distortions arising from non-standard preferences (such as present bias or loss aversion) can be greatly magniedby biased beliefs about these preferences. In the case of present bias, realistic param-348 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics eter values of present bias alone can explain some failures to invest in high-return investments. However, explaining failures to invest in very high return investments(in preventive health or elsewhere) typically requires another ingredient: at least par-tialna\u00efvet\u00e9 regarding future present bias . A (partially) na\u00efve individual underestimates the degree of their future present bias. Such na\u00efvet\u00e9 can magnify the welfare losses associated with present bias sinceindividuals may delay very high return investments with small short-run utility costsbecause they incorrectly anticipate making these investments later. Fully na\u00efve indi-viduals will not take advantage of commitment devices to overcome their self-controlproblems, while partially na\u00efve individuals will mis-predict whether a given commit-ment device is likely to work for them. Na\u00efvet\u00e9 and uncertainty in the environment(which increases the value of flexibility) are likely to drive down demand for com-mitment and may explain why commitment devices are not more widespread. People in developing countries are often highly exposed to risk, enjoy little social insurance from governments, and live close to subsistence, giving them little marginof adjustment. Many also have limited scope for borrowing. Whereas standard the-ory suggests that risk-averse households without access to borrowing should build up buffer stocks to insulate themselves from risk, present-biased consumers will have difculty saving and maintaining liquid assets and hence will wind up liquidity con-strained. This will leave them exposed to shocks and unable to self-insure. A standard nding in development economics is that demand for even actuarially- fair weather insurance or health insurance is surprisingly low. Present bias, by gener-ating liquidity constraints, may also reduce demand for standard insurance contractswhich require up-front payment of premia. Another implication of these endogenous liquidity constraints is that it will be difcult for present-biased agents to respond to surprise opportunities for investmentwithout accompanying provisions for credit. This issue makes it difcult to interpretsome standard tests for willingness to pay that are common in the health and envi-ronmental literatures. Loss aversion may help explain why many apparently high expected return in- vestments in developing countries remain unexploited. Just as present bias yieldsmuch larger distortions when combined with na\u00efvet\u00e9, loss aversion can have muchmore negative effects on investment when combined with narrow bracketing, the ten-dency to consider decisions in isolation from each other. Loss aversion may generatestickiness of assets, which arguably better matches some of the dynamics of assetsthan many poverty-trap models based on increasing returns. In contrast, loss aversionhas ambiguous theoretical effects on the demand for insurance. Individuals may mis-predict their future preferences in various ways. As dis- cussed above, na\u00efvet\u00e9 may greatly exacerbate the consequences of present bias.Projection bias , the tendency to overestimate the degree to which one's future tastes will resemble one's current tastes, may reduce investment in preventive health andinsurance, to the extent that people nd it difcult to imagine that they may becomesick in the future and the extent to which they will need resources if they or theirfamily might be hit by a health shock.1Introduction 349 Beyond mis-predicting future preferences, individuals may hold non-standard beliefs, which might interfere with many important decisions, including technology adoption, health investments, or insurance and savings decisions. Individuals may exhibit a failure to correctly interpret information for various reasons, among them redundancy neglect, belief in the law or small numbers, andselection neglect. For instance, under redundancy neglect, people may overweightinformation from others because they do not consider the possibility that multiple ap-parently independent signals may all ultimately stem from a common source. Theorysuggests the possibility of potentially dramatic equilibrium effects on social learning,in which people become condent in false beliefs about the efcacy of technologiesor health investments, and society becomes locked in to an incorrect choice. Failures to seek or share valuable information can also cause biased beliefs to persist in large shares of the population. On the supply side of information, envyor pride may hinder people from sharing valuable information with others. On thedemand side, fear of shame or stigma could inhibit learning by preventing individ-uals from asking questions that might make them look ignorant or stupid. Limited attention and memory may also distort learning and thus interfere with technology adoption. Beyond interfering with learning, these factors could also cause underin-vestment in preventive health or savings choices. Finally, beliefs might also be biased due to motivated reasoning . Individuals may derive utility from thinking of themselves highly (ego utility) or from foresee-ing a bright future for themselves (anticipatory utility), which may distort decisionsto acquire valuable information as well as the processing of received information.Such biased beliefs could be particularly important for choices involving protectionof health or other disaster risks. In addition to non-standard preferences and beliefs, we consider non-standard decision-making , i.e. failures to optimize, given preferences and beliefs. We consider non-standard decision-making in the context of savings choices, including mentalaccounting, susceptibility to default effects, and limited attention and memory. Whilethese topics have received less attention in recent development economics research,they provide opportunities for relatively minor policy and product design choices tohave major impacts on individuals. For instance, labeling savings accounts as \"healthsavings\", setting default choices to desired options, or providing reminders to adhereto medication can powerfully impact behavior at minimal costs. Most of this review, like much of the behavioral development economics litera- ture, treats behavioral distortions as universal features of human behavior , and examines the ways in which behavioral biases interact with features of developingsocieties or play out differently given the differing circumstances and institutions ofthe developing world. The same psychological forces often seem to be at play indeveloped and developing countries. For instance, present bias has been shown to ex-plain how individuals allocate work over time in both the United States and in India(e.g. Augenblick et al., 2015 and Kaur et al., 2015); the endowment effect exists both in labs in college students in Canada and in the eld in dairy-farmers in Kenya (e.g.Knetsch, 1989 and Carney et al., 2018).350 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics Similarly, default effects powerfully affect savings choices in the US and Afghanistan (Madrian and Shea, 2001; Blumenstock et al., 2018), while DellaVi- gna and Pope ( 2018) show that the treatment effects on worker effort of ten different behavioral treatments, leveraging social preferences, time preferences, probability- weighting, crowd-out and other ideas from psychology, are very similar in Indianand US samples of online workers. However, differences in institutions and markets imply that the same behavioral factors that are at play in developing and developed countries have different implica-tions for behaviors. For example, present bias may impact preventive health invest-ments less severely in a society in which most people receive clean water through amunicipally managed system than in a society in which people need to make activechoices to boil water or treat it with purchased supplies of dilute chlorine solution.Similarly, in the section on \"behavioral labor\", we argue that behavioral factors suchas present bias and reference dependence may matter more for labor supply and work-effort decisions in developing countries, where labor markets are characterized byhigh levels of self-employment and informality. Self-employment and informalitymean that workers in developing countries often do not face the commitment and monitoring provided by the formal rms common in rich countries. To take another example of how the features of institutions and markets interact with behavioral factors, note that developing countries typically have much smaller rms than rich countries, arguably because large rms are open to predation, andthat those large rms which do exist often enjoy considerable market power. Thisimplies that selection pressures that might drive out managers or rms that systemat-ically fail to maximize prots might be weaker in poor countries. Hence, one shouldexpect more \"behavioral rms\" in poor countries. While in rich societies the conse-quence of wide-spread present bias and naivet\u00e9 may be some workers failing to takeadvantage of employer match programs for retirement savings, in poor countries, thismay lead to unexploited high-return investment opportunities for a wide range ofrms. In the nal sections of the chapter, we go beyond considering such \"universal\" psychology to discuss two more speculative literatures which raise the possibilitythat behavioral factors themselves may operate differently across societies or levelsof income. Many forms of social preferences may be fairly universal. Thus, for ex- ample, work on fairness norms in developing countries suggests that wages may beconstrained by fairness norms even independent of some of the institutions, such asunions, that are thought to play a major role in developed societies, suggesting moresimilarity across societies than one might have expected. However, even if socialpreferences are based on universal psychological building blocks, the very fact thatthey are social creates more scope for them to be shaped by the cultural environment.To take a trivial example, humans may be susceptible to creating in groups and outgroups, but who is in what group will be dened by culture. In fact, there might be systematic differences between developed and developing societies in social preferences and attitudes such as trust, reciprocity, and the abilityto cooperate. Indeed, some go so far as to argue that the cultural ability to cooperate1Introduction 351 outside of small kin-based groups is rare and key to development. In this view, the scarcity of large rms in developing societies, and hence the potential role for behav-ioral factors in rm behavior, is not driven simply by policy mistakes such as statepredation on large rms, but rather reflects fundamental cultural features of societiesthat make cooperation difcult outside of the extended family. Similar factors may interfere with state capacity. We discuss the evidence for differences in social prefer- ences across societies, and the extent to which these differences may be thought of ascauses or consequences of development, and how they may be shaped by policy. Finally, we discuss the nascent literature on the psychology of poverty , which investigates whether poverty itself affects cognitive function and economic decision-making in meaningful ways. The main argument of this literature is that the con-ditions associated with poverty, such as the constant worries about money, greaterexposure to factors such as pain, sleep deprivation, noise and malnourishment, andless access to mental health care, may influence cognitive function (largely nega-tively). Worse cognitive function may in turn affect decision-making and productivityin ways that generate a psychological poverty trap. While the literature provides someevidence of effects on cognitive function, studies evaluating effects on economic out-comes and behaviors remain scarce. This chapter complements several existing review articles on behavioral de- velopment economics. An accessible and thorough review of empirical research inbehavioral development economics is provided in World Bank ( 2015). While that report is aimed at policy makers, this chapter is written for researchers and grad-uate students, and is thus somewhat more technical. Schilbach et al. ( 2016) and Dean et al. ( 2018) cover in detail the relationship between poverty and cognitive function, which we touch on in Section 10. Datta and Mullainathan ( 2014) describe principles of behaviorally-informed design of development policy. Finally, Demerittand Hoff ( 2018) provide a history of the rise of behavioral development economics. While our chapter concentrates on \"universal\" behavioral models such as presentbias, reference-dependence and limited attention, Demeritt and Hoff point to a differ-ent strand of behavioral development economics, which emphasizes the importance of the \"cultural mental models\" - categories, concepts, identities and worldviews - that individuals use to interpret situations and make decisions. Before proceeding, we discuss a few caveats and critiques of behavioral de- velopment economics. First, just as behavioral economics seeks to build on and improve upon existing neoclassical models, behavioral development economics seeksto augment existing theories of development economics by capturing systematic andrelevant aspects of human behavior, often using parsimonious extensions of existingmodels (Rabin, 1998). Second, behavioral development economics does not deny the importance of insti- tutions or economic policy in economic development. Instead, it takes local economicenvironments seriously, and studies how universal behavioral factors play out in thecontext of the choices, markets and institutions common in developing countries. Rather than diverting attention from the study of important structural issues, behav-352 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics ioral development may sometimes help better identify and understand these issues and potential reforms. Third, a critique of behavioral development is that such work is too quick to abandon the possibility that apparently irrational actions by people may reflect realeconomic incentives and constraints. For example, Rosenzweig and Udry (2014)a r -gue that it is difcult to generalize about the effectiveness of agricultural inputs evenfrom several seasons, because agricultural production is highly stochastic and returnsto inputs may vary across seasons. This view implies that one should not too quicklyjump to the conclusion that certain behaviors (such as not using more fertilizer) areirrational. We see merit in this view. One way that behavioral economists can addressthis critique is by designing experiments to more precisely identify specic behav-ioral mechanisms and to test for those, rather than to simply reject a single rationalmodel and label any residual as \"behavioral\". We believe that the best work in be-havioral development economics takes precisely such an approach. The solution tothe problem of bad behavioral-development research is more careful and rigorousbehavioral-development research. Fourth, some see behavioral development economics as blaming the poor for their poverty. In fact, behavioral development is largely concerned with universal psycho-logical factors and does not generally attribute poverty to having greater behavioralbiases. Moreover, we do not view having behavioral biases as in any way deservingblame, since there is no reason whatsoever to believe that they are freely chosen. Fifth, behavioral economics is often seen as opening the door to paternalistic poli- cies and restrictions on individual choice. While we believe that understanding therole of behavioral factors in a scientic way does not automatically translate into anypolicy or political implications, we also argue that misunderstanding human behaviorcan also lead to bad policy outcomes. Policymakers are sometimes enthusiastic about behavioral economics due to the perception that it promises inexpensive but effective interventions, and want to applyit to policy right away. However, behavioral economics should arguably make policymakers more cautious for two reasons. One is the subtlety of thinking about welfare in a behavioral world, a topic which we do not cover, and for which we refer readersto the chapter by Bernheim and Taubinsky ( 2018) in this handbook. In addition to philosophical issues involved in conducting welfare analysis with behavioral agents,in the case of behavioral development, behavioral biases will often interact with mul-tiple market failures, potentially leading to second-best issues and making welfareanalysis more challenging. Another reason for humility in policymaking is preciselybecause behavioral economics demonstrates that small details can matter for people'schoices. Consequently, unintended consequences may be more likely in a world withbehavioral agents. Finally, while we have argued that many behavioral phenomena are relevant for development economics, it is worth noting that other ideas, which have been foundto be important in laboratory experiments, and in some cases in some real-worlddeveloped-country contexts, have not turned out to play an important role in pop-ular applications in development. Research provides little support for some views1Introduction 353 widely espoused by development practitioners and NGOs regarding the alleged coun- terproductive behavioral effects of more favorable nancial treatment of poor people.Rather, the growth of scientic behavioral development economics research has ledto the formal testing and rejection of several of these hypotheses, and in some cases,this has arguably influenced policy debates. For example, some have conjectured that reducing the cost of preventive health products such as mosquito nets or distributing them for free would lead people tovalue them less and use them less. Rigorous testing by Cohen and Dupas ( 2010) and Ashraf et al. ( 2010) yields no support for this conjecture. Broadly speaking, this evidence has moved the policy debate towards free distribution of preventive healthgoods such as mosquito nets. Similarly, while many practitioners have voiced concernthat nancial compensation for community health workers could crowd out intrinsicmotivation or lead to selection of less motivated staff, and indeed in some labora- tory experiments there is evidence of a tradeoff, most real-world experiments provide little evidence that extrinsic nancial incentives crowd out intrinsic incentives mean-ingfully, and indeed provide evidence that recruiting community health workers inways that emphasize career benets leads to better selection. To take a nal example,many development practitioners were concerned that unconditional cash transfers tothe poor would be largely dissipated on alcohol and cigarettes, but evidence fromHaushofer and Shapiro ( 2016) does not support this view. Roadmap. The remainder of this chapter is organized according to topics in devel- opment economics, rather than by behavioral biases. Section 2examines the puzzle of high rates of return without rapid growth. Section 3examines behavioral factors that may contribute to low investment in preventive health. Sections 4and5discuss how non-standard preferences, beliefs and decision-making can affect savings be-havior and demand for insurance. Section 6investigates how technology adoption decisions may be affected by limited attention and present bias, as well as by failuresin learning. Section 7discusses behavioral labor economics in developing economies. We rst consider how some characteristics of labor markets in developing countries maypotentially exacerbate behavioral biases. We then discuss the labor supply and workerproductivity, as well as the role of fairness norms in wage-setting, the selection ofworkers, and female labor-force participation. Section 8discusses behavioral rms, arguing that rms in developing countries may be more subject to behavioral biases,since limits on the span of control in developing societies weaken the opportunitiesfor market forces to eliminate behavioral rms, and imply that a greater proportion of the population in developing countries acts as managers or owners of rms. Sections 9and 10discuss culture, social preferences, and the psychology of poverty. We rst briefly review the intellectual history of this eld and then cover questions regarding the existence of differences in social preferences across soci-eties, whether these preferences matter for development, and the potential to changethese attitudes through social contact across groups, or other deliberate policies. Wethen review the recent literature on the psychology of poverty, including the effectsof scarcity on cognitive function and economic behaviors, the potential role of other354 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics deprivations beyond lack of money, and mental health. Finally, we explore question around aspirations, hope, and religiosity. 2High rates of return without rapid growth A recent body of research in development economics nds that, although there isconsiderable heterogeneity, many potential investments in developing countries yieldvery high returns (Banerjee and Duflo, 2005). Among the direct estimates, Banerjee and Duflo ( 2014) exploit exogenous policy- variation over time and estimate that the returns to capital in certain Indian rms mustbe at least 105%. De Mel et al. ( 2008) use randomized grants to generate shocks to capital stock for a set of Sri Lankan microenterprises and nd the average real returnto capital in these enterprises is 55% to 63% per year. Kremer et al. ( 2013) use ad- ministrative data on whether rms purchased enough to take advantage of quantitydiscounts from wholesalers and estimate a lower bound on rates of return for the me-dian shop of well over 100 percent per year. Duflo et al. ( 2008) estimate an annual rate of return of about 70 percent for the most protable quantity of fertilizer in their study. High rates of return are also evidenced by high interest rates people are willing to pay to borrow (Aleem, 1990; Fafchamps, 2000). Individuals in developing countries often borrow at annual interest rates upwards of 70%. For example, many small-scale fruit vendors in Chennai borrow at a daily interest rate of 5% (Karlan et al., 2018). The authors payed off high-interest moneylender debt for a randomly selected subsetof vendors. Most borrowers returned to debt as soon as six weeks after the payoff oftheir original debt obligations. Moreover, treatment individuals were again borrowingat the same rate as control households one to two years after intervention. In this section, we demonstrate that such high rates of return are difcult to recon- cile with the standard neoclassical model under reasonable parameter assumptions,even when considering that income and returns may be stochastic, people are risk averse, that individuals may face \"taxes\" either from the state or from family/social pressure, and that production functions are sometimes non-concave. We will thenconsider whether various behavioral factors can help solve this puzzle, focusing onpresent bias and loss aversion as potential explanations. 2.1The Euler equation puzzle In a standard dynamic optimization model, the Euler equation implies that high re-turns to capital predict rapid rates of consumption growth, even in the absence ofany capital market. To see the underlying logic, consider rst a simple deterministicdiscrete-time intertemporal consumption model, in which innitely-lived householdsmaximize their lifetime utility. Assume households solve the following optimizationproblem: max {Ct}/summationtext t=0tu(Ct), where 0 << 1 is the annual exponential discount factor; Ctis the household's consumption in period t;u(Ct)measures the utility2High rates of return without rapid growth 355 derived from consuming Ctin period t.u(C) is increasing and concave and satis- es the usual Inada conditions: u/prime(C) > 0 and u/prime/prime(C) < 0, lim c0u/prime(C)= and limcu/prime(C)=0. The budget constraint of the household is xt+1=f/prime(Kt)(xtCt), where xtis household assets (\"cash on hand\") in period t, with x0given; f( K) is the production function denoting the value of the output in the next period including any remain- ing value of the capital; f/prime(K) is the gross rate of return to capital; f( K) satises f/prime(K) > 0 andf/prime/prime(K) < 0, lim K0f/prime(K)= , limKf/prime(K)=1. Solving for consumption path discrete-time Euler equation: u(C)=log(C) if=1.1Then, the Euler equation implies that the growth rate of consumption is (f/prime(Kt))1 1. With standard values for discount rates and the in- tertemporal elasticity of substitution, it follows from that high returns to capital implyhigh consumption growth. For example, suppose that the gross rate of return on capital, f /prime(K)=150% (well within the range of estimated returns to capital in developing-country settings) and =0.96. Then, with log utility ( =1 and elasticity of intertemporal substitution equal to one), the implied growth rate of consumption isC C=44%. No country grows at anything like this rate. One does not observe sustained consumption growth rates of this magnitude even for the subset of the population that appears to have access to returns of this magnitude. Alternatively, using a ballpark estimate from the macro literature for the elasticity of intertemporal substitution of 0.5 (and therefore =2), the implied consumption growth isC C=20% per year.2This number implies a 38-fold increase in consumption in 20 years, far higher than actual growth rates of consumption.3Working in reverse, a consumption growth rate of 5% implies that f/prime(K)=115%, i.e. net rates of return of 15%, which is much lower than the rates observed in many contexts. The nding that many people in developing countries face high rates of return yet do not have dramatic growth in consumption thus poses a puzzle in the frameworkof the neoclassical model. Some would try to resolve this puzzle by arguing that 1Under CES utility, the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is equal to1 . 2A value of 0.5 is used in standard calibrations in macro studies (e.g., Hall, 2009, 2016). See Havr\u00e1nek (2015)f o rar e v i e w . 3Suppose individuals instead had a Stone-Geary utility function incorporating subsistence levels of con- sumption. Then, they would become unwilling to intertemporally substitute at very low levels of income. However, being close to such subsistence constraints does not seem consistent with the observed high- frequency variation in consumption even among the poor (Collins et al., 2009) and the high share of income spent on goods which are not necessities, such as low-calorie foods, alcohol, and cigarettes (Banerjee andDuflo, 2007). Moreover, high rates of return are observed not just for the ultra-poor, but also for some people who are not near that absolute consumption floor, for example, shopkeepers in Sri Lanka or Kenya.356 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics households face a high implicit tax on the return on capital, for example, due to predation by corrupt government ofcials, or due to redistributive pressures from extended family members. Allowing for realistic levels of such distortions, it is difcult to reconcile the data with standard calibrated values for an exponential discount rate. For instance, Jakielaand Ozier ( 2015) show with a lab-in-the-eld experiment that women (but not men) face a \"kin tax\" of 4% when making an observable investment, which would not dramatically change the above calibration. Moreover, their experiment also includes men for whom the authors do not nd such kin taxes. Further, marginally increasing inventories for a shopkeeper or marginally increasing fertilizer use by a farmer would not easily be observable either by the state or by kin outside the nuclear family, and as such would not be subject to such a tax. Finally, \"taxes\" by kin or other social groupsare not pure taxes but would likely generate either some reciprocal obligations from those receiving the transfers or some utility benets to the household making the transfers. It thus seems difcult to believe that such taxes would fully resolve thepuzzle. 4 It is worth noting that the same households who hold high-interest debt often hold low-return assets. For instance, Collins et al. (2009) report that every household they survey has both low-interest savings and high-interest debt at the same time. Anagol et al. ( 2017) estimate that cows and buffaloes earn large negative returns in India, and yet are owned by 45% of rural households. Similarly, the shopkeepers in Kremer etal. (2013) who leave unexploited inventory-investment returns of over 100% per year simultaneously deposit money in savings accounts returning a few percentage points. As discussed below, one interpretation might be that people hold these low return assets to diversify risk, while another is that they are seeking to manage liquidity. Poverty traps. Could a non-concave production function help square such high rates of return with the lack of dramatic growth in consumption? Under the usual concave production function, poor households will have higher returns to investment, willaccumulate wealth, and thus converge to richer households. With an S-shaped pro- duction function that is convex for low levels of capital and then concave at higher levels, there may instead be multiple steady states. Which of these steady states a household converges to may depend on its initial capital stock, and the long-run dis- tribution of wealth may depend on the initial distribution. Such a model can featurepoverty traps: households that fall below a certain threshold may be stuck at low levels of returns and be unable to accumulate wealth. In general, there is limited ev- 4A given percentage informal \"tax\" leveled by extended family could potentially be more distortionary if it was levied on capital itself rather than simply on capital income, especially if they were particularly high for certain types of investment, for example, on more observable capital goods, but in general there is no reason to assume that informal taxation systems would be more distortionary than formal taxation systems used in developed countries, and in any case, even a 4% tax on capital would not be a big deterrent if gross returns were on the order of 150%.2High rates of return without rapid growth 357 idence that such poverty traps are widespread, but they are likely to be present in at least some situations (Kraay and McKenzie, 2014; Bandiera et al., 2017).5 Yet even in models with poverty traps and non-concave production functions, the observed initial conditions still need to be consistent with the model. An S-shapedproduction function allows for a steady state with a low rate of return (at either low or high wealth), but it nevertheless also implies that individuals who face a high marginal rate of return to investment should exhibit fast consumption growth. Thus, even under a model with a non-concave production function, one would not observe households with high marginal returns and low growth. Even the presence of assetswith increasing returns would not explain high returns to divisible fertilizer invest- ments for farmers or inventory for shopkeepers or fruit sellers. Lumpy investments with high rates of return can remain unexploited in the pres- ence of credit constraints. Thus, households might not be able to purchase an asset,like a cow, even if it generated a high return. However, even lumpy investments with credit constraints are not a sufcient condition for unexploited high returns. For ex-ample, consider a household that has a discount factor of 0.96, a non-lumpy liquid investment opportunity offering a 10% return and a lumpy investment opportunity yielding a 50% rate of return on a discrete investment. The households would ini-tially save in the liquid non-lumpy investment and then reallocate assets to the lumpy investment once a sufcient amount was accumulated. Even with a zero rate of return on the non-lumpy investment, the household would save up for the lumpy investmentunless it required a very large investment. Moreover, even if certain physical assets are lumpy, the nancial returns to in- vestment could potentially be smoothed with appropriate nancial products, informalinstitutions, or government programs. Lumpy investments could be exploited using mechanisms such as ROSCAs, borrowing and lending contracts, or government pro- grams that would either simply transfer resources to individuals stuck in poverty trapsor would lend them resources and then use the power of the state to collect repay- ments. Lotteries and ROSCAs are indeed very popular, suggesting that there are ways to address potential non-concavities in the production function, but they do not seemto enable the rates of consumption growth one would expect with a gross rate of return to capital of 150% or more. In any case, one should not observe high returns to non-lumpy investments with- out rapid consumption growth. Yet, research has documented high returns to fertilizer(Duflo et al., 2008) and to small increases in working capital for small rms (Beaman et al., 2014;K r e m e re ta l . , 2013). Moreover, extending credit to poor households does not result in transformative effects (Banerjee et al., 2015a; Meager, 2019). Credit con- straints cannot in themselves explain high rates of return. 5One rarely observes multi-modal distributions of income; there is little evidence that temporary positive shocks lead to sustained increases in income over time; and unconditional transfers such as Give Directly and the Georgia land lottery did not provide evidence of poverty traps (Haushofer and Shapiro, 2016; Bleakley and Ferrie, 2016).358 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics Stochastic returns and risk aversion. If returns are stochastic, risk aversion might deter individuals from making investments, even if expected returns exceed the dis- count rate. Can we explain the Euler equation puzzle with stochastic income and risk aversion? Suppose, for example, income in period tis: Yit=Y0+t+n/summationdisplay i=1itfi(Kit) (2) where there are nassets or capital goods and capital goods ihas stochastic return it in period twith an arbitrary pattern of correlation. In this setting, the stochastic Euler equation is: u/prime(Ct)=Et/bracketleftbig itf/prime i(Kit)u/prime(Ct+1)/bracketrightbig ,i=1,2,...,n (3) Given an initial capital stock, risk aversion will decrease investment in assets thatco-vary positively with consumption and increase investment in assets that co-vary negatively with consumption. In this framework, it will be optimal for risk-averse households to build a buffer stock of low-risk savings that they can draw upon whenthey experience negative shocks (Deaton, 1991; Carroll, 1997). In the ergodic dis- tribution, few people will have a low buffer stock. Keeping a high buffer stock willallow most people to smooth consumption, so that consumption will be largely insen- sitive to high-frequency income shocks or predictable changes in income. It follows, for example, that most market traders in the ergodic distribution should be willing toinvest in working capital and most farmers should be willing to invest in fertilizer. All but those who recently experienced a string of negative shocks would have a sufcient buffer stock of relatively safe assets to allow them to invest in assets like fertilizer. Even if the returns to fertilizer investment in a season are highly correlated with harvest during that season, for example, because they depend on rainfall duringthe season, they should only be modestly correlated with lifetime income and thus consumption. Therefore, risk aversion should only modestly reduce investment, and cannot fully explain the Euler equation puzzle. In fact, however, liquid buffer stocks are typically modest (Deaton, 1989). While consumption is smoother than income, it does still co-vary substantially with incomeshocks (Townsend, 1995; Collins et al., 2009). For instance, Jalan and Ravallion (1999) estimate that the pass-through of income shocks to consumption is 40% among the poorest decile of households in rural China. Kazianga and Udry ( 2006), studying a period of severe drought in Burkina Faso, nd little evidence of consump-tion smoothing. Moreover, consumption varies not just with shocks to income, but also with pre- dictable variation in income, contrary to models with patient consumers. Both foodand non-food consumption have been documented to vary seasonally with the har- vest cycle: consumption is lower before harvest in the lean season, and higher after harvest, when farmers are cash rich (Mani et al., 2013;K a m i n s k ie ta l . , 2014;B a s u and Wong, 2015). While some of this variation can be explained by seasonal price2High rates of return without rapid growth 359 fluctuations and lack of storage opportunities, consumption varies across the pay cy- cle also among the poor in rich countries, where markets are thick and food pricesdo not show similar fluctuations. For instance, Shapiro ( 2005) shows that caloric in- take declines by 10-15% over the course of a month after delivery of food stamps.Stephens ( 2003) similarly shows that social security recipients in the United States fail to smooth consumption between checks. A related nding is that investment decisions of farmers are affected by the timing of predictable variation in prices and expenditures. For instance, Burke et al. ( 2018) show that farmers fail to exploit arbitrage opportunities created by seasonal pricevariation in local grain markets. That is, they sell when prices are low, and buy forpersonal consumption when prices are high in the lean season. Providing access tocredit reduces this failure to arbitrage and generates returns on investment of 29%.The question, however, is why farmers are not able to build up liquid buffer stocks toexploit this investment opportunity themselves, even in the absence of credit markets. One could further enrich the model, for example, by allowing for illiquid invest- ments. Households might indeed be more reluctant to invest in fertilizer or inventories if they might be subject to income shocks and thus require liquidity before the payoff on those investments was realized. However, the same basic approach of building upa buffer stock, for example, of cash or grain or other relatively liquid assets such asjewelry or livestock that could be sold in bad times could help address this problem. In summary, we have argued that the high rates of return without rapid consump- tion growth, evident in many parts of the developing world, pose a puzzle that cannotbe explained by the standard neoclassical model, non-concave production functionsor risk aversion. We now discuss theories from behavioral economics that may shedlight on this puzzle. 2.2Present bias Modest rates of consumption growth can be reconciled with high rates of return tocapital if discount rates are high. For example, if the discount rate is approximatelythe same magnitude as the net return to capital, then one would not expect much con-sumption growth. High constant discount rates on the order of 50% per year, however, would generate implausible predictions for individuals' willingness to make long-run investments: people would not give up one dollar today for one billion dollars in 30years. With such a high discount rate that was constant over different time horizons,no one would hold on to land or get an education. A discounting model involving a high, constant discount rate makes unrealistic predictions because the model only has one parameter to t two different empiricalregularities: a high degree of impatience in the short run (to match high short-run ratesof return and borrowing rates) and a relatively high degree of patience in the long run(to match relatively low longer-run returns to investments in land or education). Sincethe constant discounting model assumes that the short-run and long-run discountingparameters are the same, it cannot match both moments at the same time (Frederick et al., 2002).360 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics Laibson's ( 1997) model of quasi-hyperbolic discounting posits that individuals discount all future periods by a present bias parameter relative to the immediate present.6Discounting between all future periods follows the standard exponential model. Having a present-bias parameter in addition to the exponential parameter allows this model to resolve some of the puzzles described above. The recent litera- ture in behavioral economics provides structural estimates of ranging from about 0.7 to 0.9 on average across studies, although with substantial individual heterogene- ity.7 How can present bias be incorporated into the Euler equation we discussed above, and can plausible values of present bias help resolve the Euler equation puzzle? Harrisand Laibson ( 2001) (4) where C/prime(xt+1)=dCt+1 dxt+1is the marginal propensity to consume out of liquid assets. Comparing the standard Euler equation in Eq. ( 1) to this hyperbolic Euler equa- tion reveals that the standard exponential discount factor is replaced by an effective discount factor [C/prime(xt+1)+(1C/prime(xt+1))]. This effective discount factor is a weighted average of the short-run discount factor and the long-run exponen- tial discount factor . Crucially, the weights are given by the (anticipated) marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of cash on hand in period t+1. If an individual expects high MPC in the next period (for example, if she expects low cash-on-hand), then her effective discount factor will be closer to , and she will appear impatient. In contrast, if an individual expects a low MPC in the next period (if she expects high cash-on-hand), then her effective discount factor will be closer to and she will appear patient. Given that households in developing countries typically have low cash-on-hand and a high MPC, present bias might make them appear particularly impatient, even if they have the same time preferences as richer individuals (Dean and Sautmann, 2018; Cassidy, 2018). If the household expects to be liquidity-constrained in the next period, with an MPC out of liquid assets approaching 1, their effective discount factor,with=0.8 and =0.95, will be 0.76, compared to 0.95 for an exponential agent. Thus, incorporating present bias goes some way towards resolving the Euler equationpuzzle posed above, although it does not eliminate it altogether. (As discussed below,na\u00efvet\u00e9 can greatly increase the welfare cost of present bias.) While heterogeneity in cash-on-hand and MPC themselves generate variation in patience in a present-bias model, there is reason to believe that there also exists sub- 6In this chapter, we discuss time preferences and self-control problems through the lens of the present- bias model, which has emerged as a workhorse model in this literature. However, numerous other models of limited self-control and intertemporal choice exist, some of which make similar (or even identical) pre-dictions in the problems we consider. We refer readers to Ericson and Laibson ( 2018) in this handbook for a broader perspective on this literature. 7On estimation of time preferences, see Ericson and Laibson (2018) in this volume and Cohen et al. (2016) for details as well as a brief discussion further below in this section.2High rates of return without rapid growth 361 stantial heterogeneity in present bias itself. Augenblick and Rabin ( 2018) estimate that 78% of individuals are present biased, with the rest either acting as exponential discounters or even exhibiting future bias.8The mean estimate of in their sample is 0.79, with a standard deviation across individuals of 0.29. The extent to which ob-served heterogeneity in the returns to capital or unexploited investment opportunitiescan be explained by heterogeneity in discount factors is an open question for futureresearch. The quasi-hyperbolic model can explain another important set of facts about the poor: low levels of precautionary savings in liquid form, and high covariance of in-come and consumption. Under standard lifecycle models, individuals will save upsubstantial buffer stocks of liquid savings. They will thus be able to self-insure againstshocks, and income and consumption will not co-vary much. In contrast, present-biased agents will have low levels of liquid savings (e.g. Angeletos et al., 2001). When such agents are hit with shocks, their lack of buffer-stock savings implies thatthey will be unable to self-insure, and consumption will thus co-vary substantiallywith transitory income shocks. 9In fact, consumption will also vary with perfectly predictable changes in income, as is the case with farmers over the harvest cycle.Standard lifecycle models typically cannot explain the sensitivity of consumption topredictable falls in income, even in the absence of credit markets (Jappelli and Pista-ferri, 2010). Note also that these endogenous liquidity constraints generate the high MPC discussed above, which causes present-biased agents to appear impatient. In contrast to their failure to build up liquid savings, sophisticated present-biased agents may build up substantial illiquid assets since they correctly forecast their fu- ture self-control problems (Angeletos et al., 2001). Such individuals may invest in education or hold on to land, rather than selling it, since land and human capitalare both illiquid assets that provide valued protection against over-consuming. Thus,these agents will be willing to save up even in low-return illiquid assets (such as landor, to a lesser extent, jewelry and cattle), which may partly explain why householdsdo not appear to equate marginal returns across assets. In the case of completely na\u00efve present-biased agents, who think they will be exponential discounters without self-control problems beginning tomorrow, illiquidassets will only be accumulated if they are perceived to be attractive, high-return in-vestments. Apart from this feature, the level of na\u00efvet\u00e9 or sophistication has beenfound to matter relatively little for quantitative predictions about savings and con-sumption paths in lifecycle consumption models (Beshears et al., 2015). 10,11 8Some of this estimated variation might be estimation noise. 9Karlan et al. ( 2014a ) nd that providing rainfall insurance increases agricultural investment and leads to riskier investment choices in Ghana. Present bias can explain why farmers did not self-insure by saving, despite substantial demand for insurance. 10In the case of the na\u00efve hyperbolic Euler equation, the MPC term will be replaced by the agents (incor- rectly) perceived MPC in the next period. 11As shown by O'Donoghue and Rabin ( 1999, 2001), the level of sophistication theoretically matters a great deal for procrastination and the demand for commitment. We will discuss this in detail in Section 3,362 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics Given that present-biased agents are (endogenously) effectively liquidity con- strained, how does providing access to credit affect their behaviors and welfare? Angeletos et al. ( 2001) show that present-biased agents will frequently use revolv- ing credit. They will do so not just in response to shocks, but also to fund instantgratication, and for entirely predictable expenditure events. While the use of creditto smooth shocks enhances welfare, present-biased agents may be harmed by access to credit to fuel consumption binges. Self-control and poverty traps. Banerjee and Mullainathan ( 2010) investigate the possibility that self-control (or, alternatively, time preferences) may depend on peo- ple's income. Specically, their model introduces the possibility that specic goods such as sugar, fat, and alcohol are temptation goods. Such goods that are valued in the moment, but one does not want the future self to consume. The authors fo- cus on the implications of assuming \"declining temptations\", i.e. that the fraction of the marginal dollar spent on temptation goods decreases with overall consump- tion. For instance, one can only eat so many donuts or so much ice cream, or drink so much alcohol or cups of chai on any given day. This model creates sev- eral novel and important predictions, including the possibility of temptation-based poverty traps. However, little existing empirical work provides rigorous tests of this model's assumptions and predictions. Experiments testing them\u2014especially the ones that deviate from other models of discounting\u2014would be valuable. Measuring time preferences. Development economists are often interested in mea- suring time preferences, including present bias, using surveys or lab experiments inthe eld. Such measures have been used for parameter identication (Mahajan and Tarozzi, 2011), to test mechanisms by estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (Ashraf et al., 2006), or as outcome measures responding to some treatment them- selves (Alan and Ertac, 2018). In principle, time preferences should be measured by identifying indifference points between units of utility in different time periods.For instance, a present-biased individual may be indifferent between 1 util today and 1.3 utils tomorrow and indifferent between 1 util in 300 days and 1.001 utils in 301 days. In practice, time preferences are difcult to measure, and the literature has not converged on a broadly accepted and easily implementable approach. Cohen et al. (2016) as well as Ericson and Laibson ( 2018) in this volume provide for thoughtful discussions. The most common approach in the literature is to provide choices between mon- etary payments earlier or later in time. This approach has many benets, includingthat it is relatively easy to implement using off-the-shelf experimental protocols (e.g. Andersen et al., 2008; Andreoni and Sprenger, 2012), and that choices elicited in this way have been shown to correlate, albeit weakly, with real-world behaviors suchas exercise and smoking (Chabris et al., 2008), credit scores (Meier and Sprenger, 2011), income (Tanaka et al., 2010), and procrastination (Reuben et al., 2015). in the context of preventive health behavior, another example of apparently under-exploited high-return investments.2High rates of return without rapid growth 363 This widely popular approach rests on shaky theoretical foundations. Cubitt and Read ( 2007), for instance, show that choices over money payments at different time horizons need not reveal anything about time preferences since individuals' marginal propensity to consume from such payments will likely deviate from one. Optimizing individuals should smooth consumption over their lifecycle. Thus, re- ceiving $100 today (say, in experimental payouts) may only increase consumptiontoday by pennies. Even with reasonable liquidity constraints, one would expect con-sumption to be smoothed over weeks or more, whereas present bias is thought tooperate over a shorter time horizon of hours or days (e.g. McClure et al., 2007; Augenblick, 2018). Indeed, choices over money earlier or later may reveal more about effective interest rates faced by individuals, or about their time-varying liquidity and nancial shocks, even among the poor in developing countries (Dean and Sautmann, 2018; Cassidy, 2018). A promising recent alternative approach to measuring time preferences is to of- fer participants choices between actual consumption events or effort. For example,McClure et al. ( 2007) offer sips of juice to thirsty individuals, while Augenblick et al. (2015) ask participants to choose between different amounts of tedious work on different dates. This approach offers some distinct advantages, since the participantcannot as easily smooth away the (dis)utility associated with these tasks. Perhaps forthis reason, present bias is more evident in tasks using such real rewards. Augenblicket al. ( 2015) estimate a mean of 0.9 when using an effort task, compared to =0.974, much closer to exponential discounting, when using monetary payments with a parallel design. However, such approaches come with their own challenges, particularly the logistical difculty of implementation, the practical problems of sub- ject comprehension, and the remaining possibility that consumption or effort outsidethe experiment adjusts in response to consumption in the experiment. Where does this leave development economists who would like to measure time preferences or present bias using surveys or experiments in the eld? Unfortunately,there are no easy answers. If measuring time preferences is central to the research, implementing a real-effort task as in Augenblick et al. ( 2015) or Augenblick ( 2018) may be the best option. If not, utilizing a money-earlier-or-later task may still provide some signal of patience over monetary payments, even if it does not cleanly isolatetime preferences. Recent evidence suggests that hypothetical and incentivized choices over money provide fairly similar results (Ubfal, 2016; Madden et al., 2004;F a l ke ta l . , 2016), making hypothetical choices over money an even lower-cost approach. However, hy-pothetical choices over money may still fail to pin down present bias precisely for thereasons described above in the discussion of the incentivized cases. These questionsmay be supplemented with qualitative survey questions on self-assessed willingnessto wait for larger rewards, as in Falk et al. ( 2018). 12 12The Global Preference Survey of Falk et al. ( 2018) is worth highlighting here. The authors provide an accessible dataset of unincentivized survey measures of risk, time and social preferences from 80,000364 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics 2.3Reference-dependent preferences A large body of evidence in psychology and economics suggests that individuals evaluate and experience outcomes\u2014such as consumption, wages, investment returns,or hours worked\u2014not in terms of absolute levels, but relative to reference points(Markowitz, 1952; Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). Moreover, losses relative to that reference point loom larger than gains, a phenomenon termed loss aversion. Lab andeld estimates provide estimates of loss aversion in the range of =22.5, meaning that a loss of $1 is weighted on average as much as a gain of $2 to $2.5. 13We will now consider whether reference-dependence and particularly loss aversion can explainaspects of the Euler equation puzzle described above. The rst empirical fact motivating the Euler equation puzzle is the high estimated rate of return on a variety of investments among many small rms. A different way to frame this fact is that numerous high-return investments appear to be left unexploited at equilibrium. Loss aversion may help explain this fact, at least in part. The intuitionis that high-return investments invariably involve some possibility of losses relativeto forgoing the investment; loss aversion will make such investments less attractive.More generally, loss aversion can explain substantial risk aversion over small to mod-erate stakes, contrary to standard expected utility models. Why turn to loss aversion to understand risk aversion over modest stakes, when the textbook already provides diminishing marginal utility of wealth as an expla-nation? The reason is that expected utility cannot explain small-to-moderate stakesrisk aversion without implying nonsensically high levels of risk aversion over largestakes, a point eloquently made by Rabin ( 2000). Experiments show that many in- dividuals will reject a gamble with equal chances of gaining $2 or losing $1, or of gaining $200 or losing $100. Rabin shows that being indifferent to such a gamble (at any wealth level) due to diminishing marginal utility of wealth would require suchrapidly diminishing marginal utility of wealth that such an individual would rejecta gamble with a 50% chance of a $4 loss and a 50% chance of anylevel of gain (O'Donoghue and Sprenger, 2018). In contrast, a person with a loss aversion param- eter=2 would be indifferent to a gamble with a 50-50 chance of losing $1 and winning $2 but, much more reasonably, would accept a bet with a 50-50 chance oflosing $4 and winning $10. Loss aversion can thus explain the rejection of positiveexpected-value gambles at small or moderate stakes. Expected-utility maximizers, incontrast, should be approximately risk-neutral over small stakes. Consider the example of low take-up of fertilizer in Kenya, which was estimated by Duflo et al. ( 2008) to have an average return of just over 50%. Suppose a unit of fertilizer costs $2, and its use increases output by $6 with 50% probability and has no individuals in 76 countries. Their measure of patience is a function of both answers to quantitative money earlier or later questions, as well as a qualitative self-assessment of patience. In a paper exploiting these data, Dohmen et al. ( 2018) document a positive correlation between patience and income, both within and across countries. 13O'Donoghue and Sprenger ( 2018) in the rst volume of this handbook provide a detailed discussion of reference dependence.2High rates of return without rapid growth 365 effect with 50% probability. Then, the expected return of fertilizer is 50%. Given the relatively small stakes, an expected-utility agent would be approximately risk neu-tral, and would make the investment, since the expected value is 0 .5\u00b7($6$2)+ 0.5\u00b7($2)=+$1. In contrast, a loss-averse agent with =2.5 who narrowly brack- ets returns for this investment would not invest, since 0 .5\u00b7($6$2)+\u00b70.5\u00b7($2)= $0.5. Despite the clear intuition for how loss aversion could cause individuals to forgo high-return investments, we have relatively limited eld evidence of the importanceof loss aversion in developing countries. Kremer et al. (2013) provide correlationalevidence: shopkeepers in Kenya who exhibit greater small-stakes risk aversion inexperimental tasks (presumably due to loss aversion) also maintain lower invento-ries, thus forgoing bulk-purchase discounts and increasing the probability of creatingstock-outs. Carney et al. ( 2018) provide eld-experimental evidence on loss aversion, credit and technology adoption among dairy farmers in Kenya. The authors study the de-mand for collateralized loans to fund the purchase of durable assets (both domesticand productive assets). They show that the endowment effect\u2014a canonical implica- tion of loss aversion\u2014causes borrowers to dislike taking loans in which the collateral is an asset they already own, since already-owned assets (such as land, jewelry, orcattle) are already in the borrower's reference point. The prospect of losing such as-sets in case of loan default (say, due to a negative income shock) makes such loansunattractive. In contrast, the authors show that loans collateralized using the new as-set being nanced by the loan itself, as in mortgages or car loans, are more attractiveto borrowers, since the new asset is not yet in the reference point at the time of loantake-up, and borrowers do not anticipate experiencing as great a sense of loss in caseof default. To isolate this effect, the experimenters endow potential borrowers with a randomly-selected durable asset. A week later, individuals are offered a loan tonance the purchase of a second randomly-selected asset, varying whether the col-lateral required is the endowed asset, or the new asset itself. The authors nd thatborrowers are willing to pay approximately 9 percentage points per month higherinterest rates to collateralize using the new asset. Interestingly, the same-asset collat-eralized loans do not result in higher default rates, despite the higher take-up. Thissuggests that, after taking possession of the new asset, borrowers' reference pointsupdate such that they come to develop a comparable endowment effect over their newasset, even before it is paid off. Crucially, individuals systematically under-estimatetheir future endowment effect before possessing an asset, an example of na\u00efvet\u00e9 orprojection bias. Carney et al. illustrate a general theme of this chapter, the interaction between universal behavioral phenomena and institutions that differ across societies. To theextent that people are reluctant to use goods they already own as collateral, creditorsoperating in markets with institutions that make it easy to repossess collateral willsimply ask them to collateralize loans with the new items they are buying with theloan. On the other hand, where the institutional environment is weak enough that366 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics it's hard to collect certain types of collateral, lenders may accept only the easiest to collect forms of collateral. For example, in the environment studied by Carney et al., the nancial institution making the loans, like most of its type, normally required that one-third of each loanbe collateralized with the borrower's own deposits held in the nancial institution, and the remaining two-thirds be guaranteed by deposits by co-signers. Work by Jack et al. (2016), suggests that substituting the ability to collateralize loans with newlypurchased assets, rather than with deposits in the nancial institution, increased take-up of loans for rainwater harvesting tanks used by dairy farmers from 2.4% to 44%.This is thus an example of how in the context of developing country institutions,loss aversion may prevent individuals from undertaking potentially high return in-vestments, since nancing these investments requires putting existing assets at risk. The above discussion is all based on either static decisions, or on models with limited dynamics. Unlike the literature on present bias, we only have a limited un-derstanding of the implications of reference-dependence in life-cycle models. Oneexception Pagel ( 2017) who studies life-cycle consumption with expectations- based reference dependence. We conjecture that dynamic models with referencedependence may yield more reasonable dynamic predictions, with a fair amount ofstickiness in asset levels, but without the dramatically different dynamic behavioraround a threshold asset level than poverty trap models. Loss aversion is less directly helpful in understanding the second empirical fact underlying the Euler equation puzzle: borrowing at high interest rates without a cor-responding increase in consumption over time. One way in which loss aversion mayincrease demand for credit is if credit is used to insure against consumption losses orlosses of assets in case of negative income shocks. Of course, the question remainswhy individuals are not able to self-insure by building up liquid buffer stocks, whichcould be due to present bias as described in the previous subsection. Narrow bracketing. The effects of loss aversion on choices involving risk are partic- ularly likely to be important when individuals engage in narrow bracketing. Narrowbracketing refers to an individual considering each choice or source of uncertaintythey face in isolation, failing to integrate it with other choices and risk from othersources (Tversky and Kahneman, 1981). Narrow bracketing is implicitly assumed in a range of economic models and analyses. It has bite in the case of loss aversion, dueto the importance of the sharp kink in the utility function at the reference point, whichwould effectively be smoothed out if individuals were considering many sources ofuncertainty simultaneously. Narrow bracketing can also reduce dynamic problems to repeated static prob- lems if individuals bracket, for instance, daily income or annual stock-performance.Bracketing also helps explain the so-called Samuelson bet problem: an individualmay turn down a single 50-50 gamble of losing $100 or gaining $120 but would bewilling to accept a hundred such gambles if offered together (Haigh and List, 2005; Bellemare et al., 2005). Such choices are not compatible with expected utility but are easily explained by the decision-maker bracketing the bets more broadly when ahundred bets are presented together.2High rates of return without rapid growth 367 Lab evidence suggests narrow bracketing is in fact common and leads individuals to make rst-order stochastically dominated choices (Tversky and Kahneman, 1981; Rabin and Weizs\u00e4cker, 2009). Field evidence on reference-dependence also presents cases of narrow bracketing, from taxi drivers bracketing daily labor supply and earn- ings (Camerer et Crawford T\u00f4, 2018)t o investors bracketing realized nancial gains or losses from each asset (Barberis andXiong, 2012). Many open research questions remain in this area, including deter- mining in which cases individuals narrowly bracket, how these brackets are formed, whether individuals can be taught to bracket more broadly, and whether such inter- ventions translate into reduced risk aversion in investment decisions in the eld. Narrow bracketing may be particularly relevant in developing countries. Many households run small rms and face a host of potentially risky decisions. For exam-ple, a shopkeeper might have to make decisions of how much inventory to buy on each of many different products and in each case if they are loss averse, they might be concerned about the potential that some of the types of goods might go unsold,creating a loss. A farmer makes decisions every growing season about whether to useeach of several different agricultural inputs, as well as whether to invest in livestock, farm equipment such as irrigation pumps, etc. If the manager of a shop or a farm treats each of these decisions in isolation, they may wind up turning down gambles that arevery attractive. Loss aversion combined with narrow bracketing could help explainthe high unrealized rate of return on additional inventory investment in Kremer et al.(2013). Reference-point formation. Models of reference-dependence come with an impor- tant degree of freedom: the assumption about what constitutes the reference point. The literature has taken different approaches to selecting the relevant reference point: the status-quo level of wealth or assets (e.g. Kahneman and Tversky, 1979) and ra- tional expectations of consumption (K oszegi and Rabin, 2006, 2009)a r et h em o s t common. Other papers have chosen different reference points, such as the average oflagged outcomes (DellaVigna et al., 2017) or salient targets such as round-number nishing times among marathon runners (Allen et al., 2016). Different assumptions about reference-point formation can generate important differences in predicted behavior. Assuming a status quo reference point can pre-dict staying in place, and sticky asset allocations, as well as a high degree of local risk aversion. With expectations-based reference points, multiple equilibria are possi- ble (K oszegi and Rabin, 2006, 2009). If people have a stochastic reference point (and are already anticipating uncertainty in outcomes), they will often be somewhat morewilling to take risks. We conjecture that both types of reference points are relevantand important in different contexts. When people face decisions that they have much experience with (e.g. planting usual crops), expectations will likely determine their reference points. In contrast, if they face new choices (e.g. trying new technologies),the status quo may be more likely to determine their reference point. Investigatingthis question and the formation of reference points more generally remain importantareas for future research.368 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics 2.4Other behavioral factors There is no reason to think that present bias and loss aversion are the only behavioral factors affecting individuals' consumption and investment choices over time. As we discussed above, quantitative estimates of present bias can explain why high-return investments are not exploited, but not failure to exploit very high return investments.Biased beliefs, in particular, na\u00efvet\u00e9 about present bias, can dramatically distort behavior, as discussed in Section 3. Similarly, narrow bracketing can dramatically increase the consequences of loss aversion. Other behavioral concepts might also help explain some of the facts described above. We will not discuss these in detail here but refer to the remaining sections of this chapter. For instance, pessimistic beliefs about the returns to various investments may provide an explanation for why high-return investments remain unexploited. Beliefs may be biased due to inattention, as argued for the case of the seaweed farmers by Hanna et al. ( 2014), as discussed in Section 6. Moreover, beliefs may be biased due to failures of social learning, as discussed in Section 6.3(Eyster and Rabin, 2014). Entrepreneurs and CEOs in rich countries are thought to display overcondence (e.g. Malmendier and Tate, 2005), but we have little evidence on whether owners of small businesses in poor countries do the same.Indeed, it is possible that the poor display under-condence and low self-efcacy (McKelway, 2018). Individuals may also feel shame or stigma from asking others for information (e.g. Chandrasekhar et al., 2018), or may dislike standing out from others and risking public failure by attempting to adopt a new technology or acquirenew skills. All the above factors might interact in important ways. Present-biased individuals might also have biased beliefs, possibly precisely because present bias prevents themfrom engaging in costly information-acquisition and correcting their beliefs. 3Health Low investment in preventative health is one specic case of apparently underinvest- ment in high-return opportunities.14The neoclassical model has difculties explain- ing such behavior, especially when paired with the high sensitivity of this investment to price and convenience. We argue that present bias combined with at least partial na\u00efvet\u00e9 can help explain some cases of low investment in preventive health due to procrastination and liquidity constraints. However, other cases remain unexplainedby present bias alone. We argue that biased beliefs could play an important role in explaining other cases of low investment. 14Behavioral economists have also studied other aspects of health economics, such as health insurance. We do not cover those topics here, in part due to less evidence on those topics from poor countries, and refer readers instead to the chapter by Chandra et al. ( 2018) in this handbook.3Health 369 3.1Underinvestment in preventive health The recent literature has established several stylized facts regarding health behavior in developing countries. These have been extensively discussed in recent reviews by Dupas ( 2011a), ( 2017). After briefly summarizing some of these facts, we explore the extent to which potentialbehavioral explanations can help explain them. Health is both a consumption and an investment good. It influences people's utility directly, but also impacts their productivity and ability to generate income in the near and distant future. Medical advances made over the past century have greatlyexpanded the ability to treat infectious disease and have dramatically decreased the costs of doing so. Today, many highly effective life-saving technologies that prevent and treat disease, such as insecticide-treated bed nets, deworming pills, and chlorine treatment for water are available for a few dollars or less. 15While adoption of these technologies has driven massive health improvements in the developing world, andgenerated life expectancies much higher than those historically achieved by currently developed countries when they were at similar levels of income, there is still apparentunder-adoption of preventive health and treatment for chronic conditions. Take-up rates of many health investments are surprisingly low considering their low costs and immense long-term benets. One way to see this is as a special case of the more general problem of under- exploitation of apparently high-return investments highlighted in the section on the Euler equation puzzle. An alternative interpretation could be that people have a low value of health, but demand for treatment (rather than prevention) of health condi- tions seems much higher (e.g. Cohen et al., 2015) and this is inconsistent with that alternative interpretation. Indeed, there is considerable evidence of relatively ineffec- tive health expenditure (e.g. Das and Hammer, 2007). In fact, Banerjee et al. (2015a) and Dupas and Robinson ( 2013b) nd that out-of-pocket health expenditure among Indian slum dwellers and rural Kenyan households comprises about 10% and 8% of total household expenditure, respectively. While the data are not broken down into acute and preventive spending in their studies, it is unlikely that these households are spending these sums on cheap prevention products. Low willingness-to-pay for preventive health. Fig. 1, taken from Dupas and Miguel's review chapter on eld experiments in health, illustrates this point. Indifferent demand experiments offering individuals in developing countries health- investment goods, a signicant fraction of individuals decided not to purchase thegoods, even at low prices well within the budget constraint of most poor households. Such choices are remarkable given that the large expected future benets of these health goods exceeded the investment costs, sometimes by orders of magnitude. 15Taking deworming pills is not prevention but treatment. However, from a behavioral perspective, treat- ment for chronic conditions is more similar to prevention than acute care: (1) acute conditions are salient, but the worm load builds up over time and people don't see a sudden worsening of health; (2) there isa short-run disutility of taking deworming medicine as the worms are expelled. Any nutritional or othergains take place over time.370 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics FIGURE 1 Demand for preventative health products. The y-axis plots the share of individuals or households taking up the product. From Dupas and Miguel (2017). For example, deworming has a large impact on a variety of outcomes, including future school attendance, work hours, and education, with an estimated private NPV nancial benet of deworming of $142 (Baird et al., 2016). However, only 18% of parents purchased medication when they had to pay a small fee of about $1 (Kremerand Miguel, 2007). Similarly, Berry et al. ( 2018) nd that individuals' willingness to pay for clean water technology is less than 15% of production costs. Kremer et al.(2011) show that households in Kenya have low willingness-to-pay for cleaner water, implied through the additional distance they are willing to walk to use an exogenouslycleaner water source. Their calculations imply a WTP to avert one disability-adjustedlife year of $23, while policy-makers typically apply much higher values. (Un)healthy behaviors. In addition to investing in their future health via purchas- ing bed nets, getting immunizations, or deworming, individuals can choose to leada healthier lifestyle by limiting or avoiding certain behaviors. Such behaviors in-clude eating unhealthy food options (e.g. high intake of fat and sugar), consumingaddictive substances such as alcohol and cigarettes, or not sleeping or exercisingsufciently. In both developed and developing countries, signicant fractions of the population express a desire to engage in a healthier lifestyle in the future, while hav-3Health 371 ing difculties to do so in the present. The health consequences of such behaviors can be severe, and their importance has been strongly on the rise in developing countries (Bloom et al., 2011). Non-communicable diseases such as hypertension, cancer, and, diabetes are the leading cause of death worldwide (Islam et al., 2014; WHO, 2015), yet, until recently, have received less attention by researchers and pol- icymakers compared to acute conditions with similar burdens of disease. High sensitivity of health investments to price and convenience. In addition to illustrating low levels of demand, Fig. 1also displays high demand elasticity for preventative health investments. Even small price increases seem to lead to precipi- tous declines in demand for products such as water treatment (Ashraf et al., 2010), deworming (Kremer and Miguel, 2007), insecticide-treated bed nets (Cohen and Du- pas, 2010), and vitamins (Meredith et al., 2013). Take-up of health investments is also sensitive to convenience in some cases. Thornton (2008) nds that whether peo-ple pick up HIV test results is very sensitive to relatively small differences in walking distance to obtain results. A mirror image of these large effects of small price increases is the nding that providing small incentives for healthy choices can have large effects on healthy be-haviors and investments among the poor. For instance, providing small, time-limited non-nancial incentives for child immunization leads to large increases in immu-nization (Banerjee et al., 2010), and small, time-limited nancial incentives greatly increase the proportion of people who pick up their HIV test results in Malawi(Thornton, 2008). Lower price-sensitivity for acute care. In contrast to high price-sensitivity for preventive-health products, households appear to have a relatively low price-elasticityfor acute care. Cohen et al. ( 2015) look at price sensitivity for antimalarial treatment. In this study consumers are offered vouchers for subsidized anti-malarials to be re-deemed at the closest drug shop. Increasing the price of an antimalarial treatmentcourse for young children by 250 percent, from $0.30 to $1.5, does not reduce the share of households buying the treatment (about a third). However, as expected, de- mand does fall at much higher prices. Only 4 percent of households buy the treatmentat $3. Knife-edge interpretation. One story might be that people who do not take up pre- ventive health goods perceive large benets from preventive health investments, butthey perceive even higher costs, and hence make a rational decision not to take up the preventive health measures. Thus, for example, they might worry that vaccines carry side effects or have religious objections to vaccination; they might be worried aboutthe unpleasantness associated with expelling worms in response to taking deworming medication; they might nd mosquito nets inconvenient and uncomfortable, and they might prefer not to know if they are HIV positive. It would be difcult to reconcile this type of story with the high sensitivity to price and convenience observed across several different preventive-health items andservices, however. In a standard optimizing model, with individuals comparing the(discounted) costs and benets of the action, observing a large mass of consumers372 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics change their decision in response to a small change in prices has a clear interpre- tation: a large share of consumers must be very close to indifferent between takingup the health investment or not. Therefore, the small incentive could easily tip thebalance between costs and benets and change their decision. That is, the costs and benets associated with investing in their health must have been nearly equal, such that they were making decisions balanced on a knife's edge. While possible for a sin-gle product, it appears extremely unlikely that this situation would occur for so manydifferent households (at the same price), and across a range of different technologiesand settings. This reasoning suggests that households which do not adopt these preventive be- haviors either do not perceive large benets, or that decisions are not being made in the way conventionally modeled by economists. Of course, some health investments (e.g. vaccination against rare diseases) likely indeed have small private benets. How-ever, there are also cases of low take-up of health investments with large private ben-ets. In at least some of these cases, individuals report believing in the effectivenessof health investments (Kremer et al., 2011). A careful investigation of such beliefs, including rigorous ways to address social desirability bias, and potential other expla- nations for low demand would be a highly valuable contribution to this literature. 3.2Present bias Present bias might explain some of the ndings described above through two chan- nels. First, many health behaviors feature tradeoffs either between immediate costs and delayed benets, or alternatively, immediate gratication and delayed costs. Suchbehaviors include getting vaccinated, seeing the doctor for a check-up, taking med- ication, purchasing a bed net, and avoiding potato chips, risky sexual activities, or smoking. Immediate costs often include hassle and psychological costs, for instance,of going to the doctor, walking to a water source farther away than the nearest one,taking medication, or other health-promoting behaviors. Present bias can cause indi-viduals to procrastinate indenitely on taking such healthy actions, as we explain indetail below. Time-limited incentives and discounts may help reduce procrastination, as can reducing hassle costs and providing individuals with commitment devices. Second, as discussed in Section 2above, present bias can generate endogenous liquidity constraints for households. These liquidity constraints may, in turn, cause households to leave high-return investments unexploited, including preventive-healthpurchases. They may also generate high price-sensitivity in the take-up of such in-vestments. 3.2.1 Procrastination and health behaviors Many preventive-health behaviors involve a utility cost in the present, paid in re-turn for health benets in the future. For instance, treating one's water, walkingto a farther-but-cleaner water source, getting a vaccination, getting more exercise,improving one's diet, drinking less alcohol all involve utility or hassle costs (as dis-3Health 373 tinguished from purely nancial costs) in the present, with benets potentially years in the future. The degree to which present bias hinders the take-up of such behaviors depends crucially on two factors: (a) how sophisticated an individual is about their present bias (O'Donoghue and Rabin, 1999, 2001), and (b) whether the task involves clear deadlines. Na\u00efvet\u00e9 and sophistication. A na\u00efve, present-biased individual prefers and expects to do a painful but worth-doing task tomorrow but fails to account for the fact thatthey will also be present-biased then. The na\u00efvet\u00e9 required for present bias is usually thought of as overcondence about future self-control. 16Sophistication, on the other hand, makes the individual realize that if they do procrastinate today, they will alsolikely do so tomorrow, increasing the cost of putting off the difcult task today. Inthis way, na\u00efvet\u00e9 can greatly amplify the impact of present bias on behavior and leadto large distortions and welfare consequences (O'Donoghue and Rabin, 2001). To better understand the extent to which present bias can explain low take-up of preventive-health behaviors and the extent to which the explanation depends onna\u00efvet\u00e9, we distinguish between the following categories of health behaviors: Case I: Health investments without deadlines Consider rst a health investment good or action without a deadline for take-up. Theory tells us that a sophisticated present-biased individual might delay taking up such an investment good for a few time periods (say, days or weeks) due to presentbias. However, she will take up the good eventually, since she will foresee her futurepresent bias and thus avoid lengthy and costly delays. More generally, sophisticateshave rational expectations, so they anticipate correctly what they will do it if theywait. For them, delaying from period tto period is a single decision to procrastinate. Therefore, small self-control problems cannot cause severe welfare losses in suchinvestment decisions for sophisticates (O'Donoghue and Rabin, 2001). In contrast, (partially) na\u00efve individuals do not (fully) understand their future self- control problems. Such individuals may think every day that they will incur the costinvesting on the following day, and never actually follow through with their plans.Na\u00efvet\u00e9 can compound the impact of self-control problems by inducing individuals to make repeated decisions to procrastinate, each time believing they will do it next period. 17The welfare costs arising from procrastination can become arbitrarily large since a na\u00efve individual never compares the immediate costs to future benets. In-stead the individual keeps comparing the costs of taking up the good today to thecosts of doing so tomorrow, wrongly anticipating that she will take up the good re-gardless of the choice of doing it immediately (O'Donoghue and Rabin, 2001). 16Sometimes, however, this is observationally equivalent to overcondence about future availability of time, or even overcondence about not forgetting in the future. 17This also holds for partial na\u00efvet\u00e9. Any degree of na\u00efvet\u00e9 is sufcient to generate procrastination and can cause much more severe welfare losses than complete sophistication.374 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics Many of the lifestyle choices with important health consequences involve habits that could at least in principle be changed every day. On any given day, a smoker or drinker may decide to quit. An individual may start improving their food intake, sleep,or exercising behavior on any day. In such situations, the structure of costs and ben-ets is the same as for take-up decisions without deadlines. A change in habit often causes short-run costs for a limited time and yields signicant benets in the often- distant future. While the short-run costs of such behavioral change can be substantial(e.g. quitting smoking), they are arguably far outweighed by the long-run benets inmany cases (e.g. avoiding lung cancer). There is typically no enforced deadline thatdetermines when to start changing a habit. As discussed above, while a sophisticatedperson may delay changing their habits for a few days, present bias cannot lead tolarge costs caused by the delay for this person. In contrast, a (partially) na\u00efve personmay procrastinate for a long time, possibly forever telling themselves that they will start developing virtuous habits soon but never actually following through. The above discussion highlights the importance of considering na\u00efvet\u00e9 in models of present bias. For instance, if an individual is observed to never get a flu shot de- spite being well-informed about the benets and perhaps even displaying some statedintention to do so, they may be procrastinating. If a researcher were to attempt to ta model of sophisticated present bias to the data, they would conclude that the indi-vidual has such pathological levels of present bias, that they simply don't care aboutthe future. If instead they allowed the individual to be na\u00efve about their present bias, plausible values of present bias may be able to t the data quite well. While evidence of demand for commitment suggest at least some sophistication (Schilbach, 2019; Casaburi and Macchiavello, 2018), the best direct estimates of individuals' sophis- tication suggest that individuals are largely na\u00efve on average (e.g. Augenblick andRabin, 2018). Similarly, it is important to make sensible assumptions about the length of a time period when modeling choices under present bias. A na\u00efve present-biased individualdeciding whether to get a flu vaccination today or tomorrow may be tempted to wait until tomorrow, since the expected cost of delay (i.e. the chance that he may get the flu this evening) will be small compared to the lower discounted cost of getting thevaccination tomorrow (which is down-weighted by the present bias factor). The costof delay might instead appear quite large if the choice is between going now andgoing next month. The empirical literature suggests that the \"present\" in present biasis a matter of hours or, at most, a day (Augenblick, 2018). Thus, it will often be appropriate to model daily decision-making, unless the opportunity to take the costlyaction truly only occurs once a month. Impact of small incentives. In the absence of other issues, present bias will not lead to large distortions for fully sophisticated present-biased individuals (O'Donoghueand Rabin, 2001). As a result, there is only limited potential for small incentives to alter take-up behavior of sophisticated agents, nor is there much need for them to doso. Small incentives might accelerate take-up by sophisticated present-biased indi-viduals, but they are unlikely to cause large shifts in the extensive margin of demand.In contrast, small but time-limited discounts can have large effects for na\u00efve present-3Health 375 biased individuals facing costly actions without deadlines. The time limit on these incentives is crucial: on the last day of the incentives (or at some sooner date, in case of uncertainty), the choice is between making the investment today at a lower price orin the future at a higher price. The time limit makes acting immediately more attrac- tive and can thus inhibit procrastination. In contrast, this reasoning does not apply for permanent incentives. Essentially, time-limited discounts provide a deadline, which can help overcome procrastination problems, as we discuss below. Case II: Health investments involving deadlines (but no or small monetary costs) Consider next a one-shot decision of an investment good that is otherwise not available. An example could be a one-time visit by an NGO that offers to provide you with deworming pills free-of-cost, or a vaccination camp at a local health clinic where age-sensitive vaccines are provided for free. For realistic parameter values and in the absence of other behavioral biases, present bias cannot explain the lack of take-up of such high-return, time-limited investment goods. Present bias induces individuals to put less weight on future benets relative to current costs. However, re- alistic estimates of present bias nd values of 0.7, which implies a 30% reduction in weight on future periods relative to the present. Even a present-biased individual with=0.5o r=0.3 (on the low end of empirical estimates) would take up the de- worming or vaccination for their child (assuming they care about them sufciently) since the associated benets outweigh costs by orders of magnitude. This insight does not depend on the level of sophistication about present bias, since individualsdo not need to make predictions about their future behavior to make this one-shot decision. The present bias model similarly has difculty explaining individuals' lack of take-up of investment behaviors that are available for a longer but still nite time with a clear deadline. Essentially, on the day of the deadline, the individual's choiceproblem reduces to the one-shot decision as described in the previous paragraph, and the present-biased individual will take up on that day if he has not done so already, regardless of na\u00efvet\u00e9 or sophistication. The above conclusion is not greatly affected by the presence of shocks to the cost of taking the action on any given day (subject to the deadline), provided the individual has accurate beliefs about the distribution of shocks. For example, on any given day, individuals may nd it particularly costly to go to the clinic to get an immunizationsince they may be busy or unwell. If they are forward-looking and think through the optimal stopping problem, they will have in mind a reservation cost below which they will take the action on each day, with the reservation cost rising over time. Na\u00efve and sophisticated agents may have different reservation costs on any given day, since the na\u00efve agent expects to be more patient in the future. But, again, both will do the taskon the last day if not done already, barring an extreme or unlucky shock. The welfare losses from present bias in this case are thus bounded by the cost of delaying until the deadline. Na\u00efve individuals are, however, more likely than sophisticates to delay the task up to the deadline before nally completing it. If individuals have biased beliefs about the probability of future shocks, even deadlines may not ensure take-up. For instance, suppose individuals have imperfect376 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics memory, with a probability of simply forgetting about the task on any given day. If they are sophisticated about this imperfect memory, they will act similarly to asophisticated present-biased individual and will not delay for long, since they realizethey might forget to do the task in the future. If they instead underestimate theirchances of forgetting in the future, they might put off the task until tomorrow, andthen forget to complete it despite the deadline. 3.2.2 Low willingness to pay and high price sensitivity Above, we considered cases in which costly health behavior did not involve substan-tial monetary costs. We discussed that present bias with na\u00efvet\u00e9 can generate lowadoption of healthy behaviors due to procrastination problems, at least in the absenceof strict deadlines. However, many health investments involve some monetary cost upfront (in addition to any hassle costs), for example, purchasing bed nets, paying fordeworming pills, and buying water lters or chlorine tablets. We discuss how presentbias can drive down demand for such goods, and cause high price-sensitivity, throughthe mechanism of liquidity constraints. However, many health investments involve some monetary cost up front (in addi- tion to any hassle costs). For example, purchasing bed nets when they are offered forsale rather than given away for free, paying for deworming pills, buying water ltersor chlorine tablets, etc. Next, we discuss how present bias can drive down demandfor such goods, and cause high price-sensitivity, through the mechanism of liquidityconstraints. Case III: Health investments involving signicant nancial costs (with or without deadlines) Present bias has been invoked as an explanation for the overall low willingness-to- pay and high demand-elasticity for preventative health goods (Dupas, 2011a;K r e m e r and Glennerster, 2011). The empirical facts of low WTP and high price-sensitivity are not directly related to the mechanism of procrastination described above. That is,even when a researcher unexpectedly shows up at a household's door and offers apreventive-health good for purchase with a one-time-only offer, demand is low, andprice-sensitivity is high, despite no possibility of procrastinating over the purchase.However, present bias may still curb demand by generating liquidity constraints. Liquidity constraints. Although the related empirical evidence is mixed, liquidity constraints are an often-cited reason for individuals' low demand for health invest-ments (Dupas and Miguel, 2017). Some studies have found that offering preventive health products with a line of credit greatly increases take-up (e.g. Devoto et al.,2012 on piped water connections and Tarozzi et al., 2014 on bed nets). Offering savings technologies such as safe-boxes labeled as being specically for health sav-ings increased health investments (Dupas and Robinson, 2013b). On the other hand, unconditional cash transfers (Haushofer and Shapiro, 2016) and the ultra-poor grad- uation program, which may each ease liquidity constraints, did not have detectableeffects on health or health expenditures.3Health 377 While at any given point in time, lack of liquidity may explain why individuals do not invest in their future health, liquidity itself is endogenous. As described in Sec- tion2, risk-averse non-present biased people living in an environment where they are subject to shocks, should build up buffer stocks over time, even if they are initiallyvery poor. However, present-biased individuals will nd it difcult to build up sub-stantial buffer stocks and hence will be much more liquidity constrained (Angeletos et al., 2001). As such, evidence of liquidity constraints preventing individuals from making investments in their health can be interpreted as evidence in favor of the importance of present bias rather than evidence against it. Moreover, once an individual is effectively liquidity-constrained, present bias can further reduce their demand for an investment good, since the monetary cost of the investment will reduce immediate consumption more severely in the presence of liquidity constraints (since consumption smoothing is hampered by liquidity con- straints). Such a reduction in immediate consumption to nance the health investment will be particularly unattractive to a present-biased agent. Demand estimation. An important frontier in this area is how to estimate demand for health investments or other goods in the presence of liquidity constraints.18Unan- nounced visits to study participants, offering to sell a good, will not measure long-rundemand under liquidity constraints. Several approaches have been pursued. One is to endow people with money rst. However, it is unclear how much money is needed in a buffer stock world. In a model in which people are subject to shocks and hold buffer stocks, WTP is likely to rise smoothly with the amount of money that peopleare given in the experiment. Demand will only level off with a high buffer stock. Sep- arately from this issue, endowing individuals with cash and then offering them items for sale is likely to result in experimenter demand effects. A second approach is to allow individuals time to purchase the good or to allow them to pay with their time (Dupas, 2009). Offering coupons to purchase the good at a local shop may reduce demand effects (Duflo et al., 2018). A third approach is to allow individuals to pay using credit (Devoto et al., 2012). Present bias and liquidity constraints complicate welfare calculations using willingness-to-pay estimates. Welfare may be underestimated for at least two rea- sons. First, present-biased individuals are likely to face liquidity constraints, which will lower demand estimates. Second, even in the absence of liquidity constraints, present bias may lower demand estimates for durables and long-run investments if costs are upfront and not smoothed over the lifetime. Of course, behavioral models including more generally some challenges to using revealed preference to infer wel- fare (K oszegi and Rabin, 2007; Bernheim and Taubinsky, 2018 in this handbook). 3.2.3 Commitment devices Demand for commitment devices can provide decisive evidence revealing present bias, or more generally, self-control problems, contributing to certain behaviors. 18We refer the reader to Dupas and Miguel (2017) for a detailed discussion of this topic.378 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics Commitment devices are arrangements entered into by an individual with the aim of helping fulll a plan for future behavior that would otherwise be difcult owing tointrapersonal conflict stemming from, for example, a lack of self-control (Bryan et al.,2010). Demand for such devices is often interpreted as \"smoking-gun\" evidence oftime-inconsistency and self-control problems. It is difcult to rationalize why some-one would elect to constrain their future choice set in the absence of time-consistentpreferences. Laibson's ( 1997) model of quasi-hyperbolic preferences features time- inconsistent preferences (induced by present bias) and can thus generate demandfor commitment. Alternative models of self-control are equally consistent with de-mand for commitment (Thaler and Shefrin, 1981; Gul and Pesendorfer, 2001, 2004; Fudenberg and Levine, 2006). Ashraf et al. ( 2006) provide a proof of concept that offering commitment de- vices can cause important changes in behaviors, as discussed in Section 4.1.M o r e recently, development economists have documented demand for commitment toachieve health-related goals. Gin\u00e9 et al. ( 2010) offered smokers a voluntary commit- ment product to support their attempts to quit smoking. Eleven percent of individualswho were offered the commitment device took it up, with modest but signicant im-pacts on smoking six months later, which persisted in surprise tests at 12 months. Schilbach ( 2019) explores the relationship between alcohol consumption and self- control among rickshaw drivers in Chennai. As part of the experiment, participantswere offered a choice between receiving an unconditional payment of a xed amountor a conditional payment that had a high payoff for sobriety (measured using a breath-alyzer) and a lower payoff otherwise. The amount of the unconditional paymentvaried, such that one of the unconditional options weakly dominated the conditionaloption and another strictly dominated the conditional option. Schilbach ( 2019) nds substantial demand for costly commitment to sobriety: more than half of those of-fered the choices chose the weakly dominated option that incentivized sobriety overthe unconditional payment, and more than a third chose the strictly dominated con-ditional incentives over the larger unconditional payment. Despite this promising evidence, commitment devices have not taken off as a pol- icy tool or in real-world markets. Two weaknesses are at the heart of this issue. First,while Schilbach ( 2019) and Casaburi and Macchiavello (2018) nd high take-up for costly commitment, demand for commitment devices is relatively low in many othersettings (Laibson, 2015). 19Second, many of the individuals who demand commit- ment fail to follow through with their plans despite the commitment device, such thatthey ex post appear to be made worse off by being offered commitment (John, 2018; B a ie ta l . , 2017). Does the mixed (at best) success of commitment contracts imply that self-control problems are not an important driver of preventive health behavior? To answer this question, it is important to keep in mind determinants of commitment demand. A key requirement for generating demand for commitment is a sufcient level of sophis-tication about self-control problems. A completely na\u00efve present-biased individual 19See Table 1 in Schilbach ( 2019) and Table 1 in John (2018) for overviews of the existing evidence.3Health 379 would never demand commitment, since they believe they have no self-control prob- lems beginning in the next period. Thus, demand for commitment is a one-sided test for self-control problems: nding demand for commitment indicates self-control problems (in the absence of confusion or social pressure to sign up), but absence of demand does not necessarily mean self-control problems do not exist or are not im- portant in that domain or in other domains. It could instead be that (a) individualsare not sufciently sophisticated to demand commitment, (b) that the commitment device is perceived as being ineffective, or (c) that uncertainty in the environment makes commitment unattractive despite self-control problems (Laibson, 2015). The variation in take-up across settings could partly be explained by variation in the extent of individuals' present bias, as well their awareness of such problems. While standard models of present bias assume that both the level of present bias and the level of sophistication about it ( ) are the same across all dimensions, it could be that individuals are more aware of their self-control problems in some dimensions than in others. Of course, it is surely the case that much of the variation is simply explained by difference in beliefs or long-run preferences: many people may simply not think the task is worth doing and would not want their future selves to do it either. People may also have varying beliefs about the likely effectiveness of the contract, which in turn might be related to individuals' experience with the device. Better understanding the role of individuals' beliefs in commitment decisionsremains an important area for future research. Individuals' failure to follow through is a second reason why commitment has not become a more successful policy tool (John, 2018). If people are only partially aware of their present bias, there may be systematic failures of commitment, withplausibly negative effects on welfare. Those who are partially na\u00efve may accept acommitment contract without realizing the true extent of their present bias, resulting in them incurring the cost of the commitment device without its intended benet. Bai et al. ( 2017) show how people may be willing to take out commitment con- tracts that are ultimately welfare harming. They study attendance at \"Hypertension Day\" health camps organized by a healthcare provider in rural India. In partnership with the provider, they offer contracts in which individuals make a large up-front payment, which reduces future attendance fees or, in the case where the payment ex-ceeds the visit fee, provides a conditional payment for each future visit to the camp. The authors nd low demand for the commitment contracts, but among those who do take up a commitment contract, a large proportion do not follow through with their future visits to the camp. These people lose the paid up-front fee and do not gain the health benets that the contracts were intended to facilitate. This behavior is consistent with partial na\u00efvet\u00e9, where individuals demand some commitment, but not enough to overcome their present bias, which they do not fully anticipate. 20 20The authors also design a contract intended to appeal to na\u00efve individuals: they bundle together price discounts and commitment. The idea is that na\u00efve individuals who expect to attend the health camp in any case might sign up to take advantage of the discount, but then be helped ex-post by the commitment aspect of the contract. Yet, even for this contract, follow-through rates are disappointing.380 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics Future research on commitment devices might fruitfully focus on how to improve their success rates and increase their demand. One approach might be to attempt to de-bias individuals about the extent of their self-control problems, say by drawingtheir attention to the gap between their intentions and actions, or similar gaps amongothers. Another would be to facilitate learning by providing individuals with guided experience with selecting commitment devices. Finally, even if agents are fully sophisticated regarding their present bias and have accurate beliefs regarding costs and benets, commitment may not be optimal if there is uncertainty about the future (Amador et al., 2006; Laibson, 2015). In environ- ments with uncertainty that will be resolved in future periods, commitment becomesless valuable insofar as it limits the agent's ability to act upon any new information.Therefore, with uncertainty or (partial) na\u00efvet\u00e9, a more promising approach may beto reduce hassle costs, provide direct time-limited incentives, or ease liquidity con-straints. Another approach in the face of uncertainty is to utilize \"soft\" commitments,as discussed in Section 4.1. In summary, present bias appears to have explanatory power for some of the low demand for health investments described above, through two channels: procras-tination (in the case of health behaviors without deadlines, and na\u00efve agents), andliquidity constraints (in case of na\u00efve or sophisticated present-biased agents who en-dogenously create liquidity constraints). The classic tool in the literature to deal withself-control problems\u2014commitment devices\u2014have shown some promise but haveyet to overcome important shortcomings to become an important policy tool. Present bias on its own is by no means sufcient to explain all the patterns observed in the data. However, it is important to keep in mind that the different be-havioral explanations we discuss in this chapter are by no means mutually exclusive.For instance, present bias and biased beliefs may well jointly explain some of thebehaviors that cannot be explained by each of these factors on their own. However, some of the above patterns in behavior cannot be explained by liquidity constraints, for instance, individuals' high sensitivity to convenience as documented by Thornton(2008). Explanations involving biased beliefs appear more plausible in such cases. 3.3Biased beliefs To make good decisions regarding their health, individuals must form accurate beliefsabout several variables. What is the likelihood of falling sick with different conditionsin the future? How severe would the consequences of falling sick be? What is thecausal effect of different interventions on the likelihood of falling sick, or of beingcured? How good are various providers and should one trust their recommendations? Learning the right answer to these questions is difcult even for a fully rational (Bayesian) agent who has perfect memory and the ability to process complex infor-mation. There are many reasons why it is difcult for an individual to form accuratebeliefs, including fundamental uncertainty and heterogeneity across individuals inrisks and responses to treatment, the self-limiting nature of many diseases, external- ities, long time-horizons, and the complicated nature of many medical conditions.3Health 381 Indeed, this point was made by Arrow ( 1963) in a paper sometimes considered the founding work of modern health economics. In addition to the general difculty of learning about health, individuals often face additional challenges to learning, especially in developing countries. For instance, sometimes they may simply not have access to relevant information, and there may be few trained experts around to learn from. Once we additionally account for the fact that human beings systematically depart from the Bayesian learning benchmark(see Benjamin, 2018 in this volume), the likelihood that individuals have inaccurate beliefs\u2014and perhaps systematically biased beliefs\u2014becomes even greater. Below, we discuss how inaccurate beliefs may explain some patterns in health be- havior in developing countries. We describe reasons for inaccurate beliefs includingsimple lack of access to information, as well as specic biases in learning and beliefs which may be important, including information avoidance and motivated reasoning, incorrect mental models, and non-Bayesian social learning. Inaccurate beliefs. Misperceived returns to health investments could help explain the stylized facts described in Section 3.1. Underestimating returns will drive down the demand for preventive health investments. Perceived returns close to zero could also help explain the high demand elasticity for such investments. Surprisingly lit- tle work directly elicits individuals' beliefs regarding the returns to different healthinvestments. While quantitative belief elicitation is challenging, methods have beendeveloped to elicit even probabilistic beliefs meaningfully in low-literacy popula-tions in the developing world (see Delavande et al., 2011 and Delavande, 2014 for reviews). One example is Delavande and Kohler ( 2009), who elicit subjective probabilities of HIV infection in Malawi. Compared to the actual HIV prevalence of 6.9% in Sub-Saharan Africa at the time, 67% of respondents report that their likelihood of beingcurrently infected with HIV is 0, while only 1% think the likelihood is 100 percent.Godlonton et al. ( 2016) elicit men's beliefs about male circumcision and HIV trans- mission risk and nd that only 36% correctly believe circumcision is related to lowerHIV transmission risk. It remains to be seen whether inaccurate beliefs, by themselves, can help explain under-investment in preventive health. It could even be that eliciting beliefs height-ens the puzzle in some contexts, if many individuals over-estimate the returns tohealthy behaviors or the risks involved in unhealthy behaviors such as for the risksassociated with smoking in the US (Viscusi, 1990) and the risks of HIV transmis- sion in Malawi (Anglewicz and Kohler, 2009). However, our lack of understanding of these beliefs constitutes a glaring gap in the literature at present. More systematicelicitation of beliefs\u2014including quantitative beliefs\u2014in the health domain will be a valuable agenda for future research. Information interventions. A substantial body of work has studied the effects of information interventions on health behaviors (although often without measuring beliefs themselves). These have been treated as tests for whether information is abinding constraint on preventive health behaviors. Put differently, providing informa-tion and measuring changes in health behaviors is an indirect way of testing for errors382 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics in beliefs in the baseline. However, this approach depends on numerous assumptions which are rarely tested: that the information treatment was effective in changing be-liefs in the intended direction, and that the information intervention did not impact behavior in other ways such as through increased salience or demand effects. Dupas and Miguel ( 2017) provide a thorough review of this literature and point to the mixed overall ndings. While some information interventions such as inform- ing students about how to avoid worm infections (Kremer and Miguel, 2007) and providing information about HIV/AIDS to students (Dupas, 2011b) had no effects on behaviors, other cases show more promising results, especially when providingpersonalized information. Madajewicz et al. ( 2007) show that informing households about well safety regarding arsenic levels causes large switches from unsafe to safewater sources. Dupas ( 2011b) nds that teenage girls in Kenya falsely believed older men would expose them to lower HIV risk than younger partners, an informing them about the higher risk of infection of older men led to changes in behavior. Several other well-known examples of effective information campaigns exist, for instance, Egypt's campaign on oral rehydration for diarrhea treatment (Levine and Kinder, 2004). However, similar information campaigns implemented over a long period of time have not had a transformative effect on infant death rates from di-arrhea (Rao et al., 1998). Other examples show more mixed results of information campaigns. For instance, while health warnings on packaging have been shown todecrease tobacco use in some settings (Borland et al., 2009), similar warnings have been less effective at decreasing alcohol consumption (Anderson et al., 2009). We only have a limited understanding why information interventions can have large impacts in some contexts, but small to null impacts in others. Dupas (2011a) points to several determinants that could be important of the success of informationcampaigns. One possible explanation is that it matters who receives the information,due to individual-level differences in returns to health investments. An alternative hy- pothesis is that multiple behavioral biases are jointly affecting individuals' decisions and only addressing one of them is insufcient. For example, in the case of alcoholconsumption, information interventions could play a role, but only if individuals alsoreceive help in overcoming potential self-control problems. A different hypothesis is that in cases of motivated beliefs, information interventions will not be success- ful since individuals are actively trying to avoid updating their beliefs, as discussedbelow. Motivated reasoning. Information avoidance and motivated reasoning may arise when beliefs enter directly into an individual's utility function, in addition to theirinstrumental value. A variety of theoretical concepts can capture this phenomenon,including anticipatory utility (utility from anticipating the future; K 2003), Mayraz ( 2011), Caplin and ( 2001, 2004), Brunnermeier and Parker (2005)) or news/realization utility (utility from learning good or bad news; K oszegi and Ra- bin,2009). In these models, acquiring more information does not necessarily make individuals better off, such that they will sometimes eschew seemingly useful infor-mation.3Health 383 One compelling example from the developed world is Oster et al. ( 2013)w h o study genetic testing among individuals at risk for Huntington's Disease (HD). While Huntington's is a degenerative neurological disorder without cure, it may still bevery useful to learns one's HD status as it can inform important life decisions re-garding childbearing, retirement plans, savings, or education. However, despite therelatively low economic cost, pre-symptomatic testing is rare. Moreover, actionsamong untested individuals are strongly skewed toward the optimal action of thosewho do not carry the HD mutation. Finally, individuals often get tested when theirsymptoms paired with their genetic disposition predicts a positive result with near certainty. The standard neoclassical framework has difculties explaining this set of results. Oster et al. ( 2013) explain the patterns in the data using a model of anticipatory util- ity. Untested individuals have the option to choose their beliefs about the future, at the cost of increasing the probability of choosing the wrong action. Avoiding informationmay be optimal if the increase in anticipatory utility outweighs the costs associatedwith making choices based on wrong beliefs. Oster et al. ( 2013) explain the patterns in the data using a model of anticipatory utility. Untested individuals have the op-tion to choose their beliefs about the future, at the cost of increasing the probabilityof choosing the wrong action. Avoiding information may be optimal if the increasein anticipatory utility outweighs the costs associated with making choices based onwrong beliefs. Work on this topic in developing countries is scarce, but there is little reason to think that a similar psychology might not apply also in poor countries, and with re-spect to important health conditions ranging from HIV to hypertension and diabetes.Indeed, Li et al. ( 2018) provide suggestive evidence on information aversion in the case of diabetes blood-testing at a rural hospital near Beijing. Although Oster et al. (2013) and Li et al. ( 2018) both use the same model of anticipatory utility to rationalize their results, anticipatory utility alone cannot fullyexplain people's preferences over medical testing. In line with the evidence for otherhealth products, Li et al. (2018) and Thornton ( 2008) show that demand for medical test results can be highly sensitive to small changes in prices, even among relativelyhigh-risk populations. It is hard for anticipatory utility by itself to drive this result:it would require individuals to be close to indifferent, once accounting for both thetotal expected benets and costs of getting tested, and the change in anticipatoryutility from being tested. It seems unlikely that this would occur by chance for many individuals. Incorporating present bias into models of information preferences might help ex- plain this behavior. If people are averse to learning medical test results, say due to news utility or simply because they dislike focusing their attention on their healthstatus, then a present-biased person could forgo testing because they put dispro-portionate weight on the immediate welfare costs of learning the test's result. 21 21News-utility is different than anticipatory utility. In the case of news utility, the utility cost of receiving news is at the moment that the news is received. By the next period, once the information has been incor-384 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics Especially in the case of na\u00efve present bias, small psychological costs of learning new information may cause individuals to procrastinate indenitely on obtaining their testresult, as in Thornton ( 2008). Redundancy neglect. Individuals may learn about health choices\u2014such as which provider to go to\u2014by observing their peers' decisions and experiences. To interpretpeer behavior, they must employ some theory as to how and why others made theirown decisions. For example, an individual who observes her two neighbors go to alocal witch doctor needs to think through what information their choice reveals. Onepossibility is that both those neighbors chose to visit the witch doctor due to indepen-dent private information. Another is that one of those neighbors simply observed andimitated the other. In the latter case, the signal in support of visiting the witch doctoris weaker\u2014despite observing two neighbors, there is effectively just one informationsource. Eyster and Rabin ( 2010) provide a model of na\u00efve social learning in which people fail to appreciate the redundancy in their predecessors' actions by naively interpret-ing their actions as independent. The authors show that societies which behave in thisway can converge to condent and wrong beliefs, an outcome that is impossible instandard rational-actor economics. Eyster et al. ( 2018) run a lab experiment in which student subjects act in precisely this way: by failing to account for the redundancy inone another's actions, subjects do worse than they would do without the possibilityfor social learning. While we do not have tests of this from the health domain, so-cial learning about health behaviors and providers might be a promising domain inwhich to study these biases. We discuss applications related to technology adoptionin Section 6. Sampling and statistical biases. People often generalize from small amounts of information\u2014they tend to exaggerate the extent to which a small sample of out-comes represents the distribution of outcomes they will face in the future (Tverskyand Kahneman, 1971; Grifn and Tversky, 1992; Rabin, 2002). For example, an in- dividual who recovered from an illness after visiting a health provider and followingtheir instructions may be excessively condent that the provider is highly able. Furthermore, summary statistics about a health behavior or product might not be sufcient to correct beliefs: people also display a tendency to under-infer from largesamples (Grifn and Tversky, 1992; Benjamin et al., 2016). Information campaigns that provide scientic evidence supporting a new treatment may thus have limitedeffect, since individuals might continue to overweight individual negative experiencesor anecdotes relative to seemingly conclusive statistical evidence that runs counter.Countering these statistical biases is potentially critical for more accurate beliefs and better health behaviors. porated into the reference point, the past news no longer \"hurts\". In contrast, in the case of anticipatory utility, news once learned will continue to affect one's anticipatory utility in future time periods.3Health 385 3.4Incorrect mental models Individuals may interpret what they see through the wrong causal model or theory, as investigated by Schwartzstein ( 2014). Gagnon-Bartsch et al. ( 2018) show theoret- ically that, if individuals have in mind the wrong theory, and they use that theoryto direct their attention to information, they may fail to correct their beliefs despiterepeatedly observing outcomes which are inconsistent with their beliefs. One potential source of mistakes in causal inference in health behaviors is that many health conditions are self-correcting. That is, most individuals will naturallyrecover, given time, from most illnesses. Individuals may misattribute their recoveryto any health care choices they made while sick. Relatedly, an incorrect mental model which seems important in health behaviors in poor countries is a belief in magical theories of sickness such as curses, witchcraft,the evil eye, and superstitions. If individuals see the world through such beliefs, thenthey may mis-infer from observing episodes of sickness, recovery or even deathby updating about irrelevant variables while not attending to causally relevant fac-tors. Ashraf et al. ( 2017) provide another example in the context of traditional be- liefs about maternal risk in Zambia. The authors describe a wide-spread traditionalbelief that marital indelity is a primary cause of health complications during child-birth. This superstition discourages women from sharing their experience with others, and even from seeing medical help when complications arise during delivery, since revealing difculties would cause stigma for the pregnant woman. In addition, theauthors argue, the traditional mental model causes the community to misattributematernal deaths to indelity, making it harder for social learning about the true riskfactors to occur. Beliefs regarding diarrhea can cause dehydration and is fatal for more than half a million infants annually. Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) made of sugar and saltsis highly effective at preventing dehydration and decreasing fatalities from diarrhea.Yet in many areas it is not widely used, despite its low cost. While one could comeup with behavioral explanations that could arguably limit ORS take-up, evidence suggests that a key constraint is simply access to information about its effectiveness, which is in part not demanded or valued since many parents have the wrong mentalmodel of diarrhea. Parents observe their infant's watery stools and infer that they should decrease their child's fluid intake (which is exactly the wrong thing to do, but is an intuitiveconclusion). In India, when poor women were asked how to treat an infant's diarrhea,30 to 50 percent recommended decreasing fluids to keep the infant \"dry\" (Datta andMullainathan, 2014). In fact, reducing fluid intake is a common response to infant diarrhea in many regions of the world (Carter et al., 2015). In this case people are not merely unsure of the right course of action, but instead condently hold utterly false beliefs.386 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics 3.5Other behavioral factors Emotions and decision-making. Making rational economic decisions is difcult even in the best of times. Decisions regarding health care must often be made in very difcult times. When an individual or a family-member is sick, emotions of sad-ness, fear, and anger are likely to be prominent. While behavioral economics has notstudied the role of emotions in as much detail as phenomena like present bias or lossaversion, evidence exists in psychology that emotions systematically affect decision-making (Loewenstein and Lerner, 2003; Lerner et al., 2015). Health behaviors may be a valuable application of those ideas to studying economic behaviors. Salience. Incentives for health behavior might operate not only due to the incentive- effect itself, but because the incentives make the importance of the behavior salientto individuals. Such salience effects could increase individuals' perceived benetsfrom investing in their health or they could serve as reminders in situations that ne-cessitate repeated actions, for instance, vaccinations or medical adherence. The roleof salience in the context of health investments remains to be investigated in futurework. Social image. In an innovative study in Sierra Leone, Karing ( 2018) studies how social image concerns can be leveraged to increase vaccination rates. She provides mothers with colored bracelets that allow them to signal to others whether their childis vaccinated. The author cleverly designed her study to enable her to disentanglesocial-image motives from memory and salience (for instance, by providing placebobracelets that do not communicate information about the number of vaccinationscompleted, but which plausibly still remind the mother about vaccinations). Karing nds that the intervention increases timely and complete vaccination at a cost of 1 USD per child. Zero-pricing and the absence of sunk-cost effects. Policy-makers often want to encourage take-up of preventive health, sometimes due to behavioral internalities,but also due to straightforward epidemiological externalities or social concerns for children or scal externalities from increased labor supply and taxation (Baird et al., 2016). From a policy perspective, the above discussion suggests that charging a lowprice is not likely to be a good solution, since it deters many people from purchasing,while not raising much revenue. Demand is sensitive enough to price that it willtypically make sense to go all the way down to a zero price. This argument does notdepend upon arguing for any special psychology around zero pricing. 22Logistical costs of dealing with any payment provide another argument for a zero price insteadof a small positive price. In tension with the desire to increase take-up, development organizations, in- cluding international nancial institutions such as the World Bank, have at times 22One might argue even for negative prices, but these create obvious incentives for people to take the good, accept the subsidy, and then not use it.4Savings 387 advocated charging users for preventive health products and services. The main mo- tivation for this is the pursuit of nancial sustainability. However, another reason thatis often cited in support of positive prices is that higher prices may stimulate higher usage through a sunk-cost effect. The sunk cost effect describes a direct effect that price has on use: it predicts that paying a price for a good makes an individual morelikely to use it (Thaler, 1980;E y s t e r , 2002). These effects have been demonstrated in evidence from the eld and the lab in rich countries. For instance, Arkes and Blumer(1985) experimentally offered discounts to season ticket holders at a theater and show a positive relationship between the effective price paid for a ticket and performanceattendance. In the context of preventive health products in the developing world, there is good evidence that higher prices (or even positive relative to zero prices) do notcause greater product use. Ashraf et al. ( 2010) use a eld experiment to estimate the impact of the price of a drinking water disinfectant on its use. Their experimental design usesa two-stage randomization procedure as in Karlan and Zinman ( 2009) to distinguish between a screening effect, through which prices limit take-up to buyers who aremore likely to use the product, and a sunk-cost effect. Conditional on a household's willingness to pay, they randomize surprise price-discounts to obtain variation in the actual price paid by a household. The authors nd a strong screening effect, but noevidence of a sunk-cost effect on ultimate usage of the product. While willingness to pay sensibly predicts usage, the actual transaction amount paid does not. Those who paid a positive price were no more likely to use the product at endline than those whoreceived it for free. Cohen and Dupas ( 2010) use a similar two-stage price randomization design to study the influence of prices on use of insecticide-treated bed nets. Conditional onpurchase of a net at a posted price, they surprise buyers with a randomly determineddiscount and estimate the relationship between the discount size and net use. Consis- tent with the results of Ashraf et al. ( 2010), they nd no signicant effect of effective price on usage, suggesting that the sunk cost effect is not an important determinant of usage of health products. Overall, therefore, the evidence suggests that a policy-maker looking to increase usage of preventive-health products should avoid small positive prices, as they leadto large reductions in take-up without increasing utilization. 4Savings In recent years, an active eld-experimental literature has studied savings in devel-oping countries. 23At the individual level, as described in Section 2, savings are 23See Karlan et al. ( 2014b) for an excellent recent review of neoclassical and behavioral constraints on saving in developing countries.388 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics necessary to self-insure against risks and to nance lumpy investments. Barriers to savings might thus reduce welfare and opportunities for growth. One part of the recent literature on savings has studied \"standard\" barriers to saving, such as a lack of access to formal savings products, for instance, due to pro- hibitive costs of opening a bank account. Several papers randomize subsidies for opening various types of bank accounts or other savings products, with mixed re-sults. Dupas et al. ( 2018a) conduct experiments in three countries and nd only small effects of providing bank accounts to poor individuals. Many participants in theseexperiments do not actively use their newly-opened bank accounts. The authors con-clude that merely expanding access to bank accounts is unlikely to lead to noticeable welfare improvements among the poor. In contrast, other papers nd increases in productive investment (Dupas and Robinson, 2013a), savings (Prina, 2015), and even income (Schaner, 2018). One interpretation is that a subset of individuals has high returns to access to formal savings products, while for most poor individuals, accessis not the only constraint on saving. 24 What other constraints may be important in reducing savings among the poor? In this section, we discuss various behavioral factors which may play a role in reduc-ing savings, as well as behavioral tools which have been used by policy-makers toincrease savings. 4.1Commitment savings devices Commitment savings. Present bias can greatly influence savings decisions. A key prediction of the present-bias is that households accumulate few liquid savings over time, while building up substantial illiquid wealth. This prediction seems broadly consistent with savings patterns in both rich and poor countries (Angeletos et al.,2001; Banerjee and Duflo, 2007; Collins et al., 2009). For more detail, we refer the reader to Section 2of this chapter and the discussion of time preferences in Ericson and Laibson ( 2018). Present bias paired with at least some level of sophistication implies demand for commitment, as discussed in detail in Section 3.2in the context of health behavior. If present bias reduces savings, individuals might have demand for commitment devicesto increase their savings. There is evidence of such demand for commitment in thedomain of savings. In a founding paper in this literature, Ashraf et al. ( 2006) offered a commitment savings account to a random subset of study participants through a bank in the Philippines. About a quarter of respondents took up this offer, electing to restrict their future access to their savings until a savings goal was met, or until atarget date. A year later, those offered commitment savings had substantially higheraverage bank account savings than those in the control group. A subsequent literature has investigated how different types of commitments im- pact savings. An important contribution by Dupas and Robinson ( 2013b) compared 24This evidence raises the question of why the individuals with high returns to savings accounts do not borrow or save enough to pay the fees (typically a few dollars) associated with opening these accounts.4Savings 389 different types of commitment devices of varying strength. They compare the effects, relative to a control group, of providing participants with either a safe box in which to store money at home (to which the participants have the key) or instead a lock box(whose key is held by the research staff). The idea is that the former provides a softer commitment than the latter treatment. Both treatments were motivated as targeting saving to cover health expenses. A year later, the authors nd high sustained use of both products, but only the more flexible, softer commitment of the safe box led to increased spending on preventive care. The ndings of Dupas and Robinson ( 2013b) connect to a key open question surrounding the usefulness of commitment devices: the optimal tradeoff betweencommitment and flexibility (Beshears et al., 2017). A commitment that is too weak will not overcome self-control problems, while one which is too restrictive willdrive down take-up due to the real costs of commitment in uncertain environments (Amador et al., 2006; Laibson, 2015). The tradeoff between weak and strong commitment is complicated by the ex- istence of partial na\u00efvet\u00e9. John ( 2018) studies savings commitment accounts in the Philippines (in the same context as Ashraf et al., 2006) and shows that many of the individuals who demand commitment savings fail to follow through with theircommitment and incur nancial penalties. As a result, these individuals are (ex post) made worse off by being offered the commitment device. Partial na\u00efvet\u00e9 about present bias can explain this result: partially na\u00efve individuals realize that they have a self- control problem, so they will have demand for commitment. However, they mightunder-estimate the needed strength of the commitment, so they might sign up for commitment contracts that do not provide sufcient incentives to follow through. It is worth noting that savings commitments are not restricted to formal sav- ings accounts. Instead, social networks and savings groups such as ROSCAs may effectively provide commitment. Kast et al. ( 2018) show large impacts of public goal-setting and group monitoring on savings, emphasizing the potential for socialties to pay a role in motivating individuals to save. Breza and Chandrasekhar ( 2015) randomly assign \"monitors\" to savers within the same village and show that monitors cause an increase in savings of over 40% a year later, with some evidence of a social image or reputation channel driving the effects. We speculate that such socially-provided commitment might also be able to more flexibly deal with uncertainty and shocks. While it is difcult for a formal provider to contract on and verify shocks which may affect savings, others in the same social or economic network may be better placed to do so. Another potential weakness of commitment savings accounts is that they merely prevent individuals from withdrawing money that they have already deposited. How-ever, present-biased individuals might have difculties depositing money into their savings account in the rst place. Alternative designs that include automatic pay- ments into savings accounts (e.g. using M-Pesa in Kenya) could prove to be highly effective.390 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics 4.2Designing nancial products for behavioral agents Numerous behavioral factors beyond present bias can impact individuals' savings de- cisions, including mental accounting, default effects, limited attention, and memory issues. Some of the existing evidence in support of the importance of these factors for savings decisions is limited, especially in developing countries. Better understandingthese factors could uncover cheap and highly effective ways to impact savings behav-ior (Chetty, 2015). Further evidence would greatly improve policymakers' ability to design savings accounts and nancial products to better serve the poor. Mental accounting. Money from different sources and in different accounts should be fungible and is treated as such in standard economic models. However, in practicepeople may have \"mental accounts\" for different types of expenditures, which makesmoney across accounts (Thaler, 1985; Shefrin and Thaler, 2004; Hastings and Shapiro, 2013). Such mental accounts may in part be used to avoid overspending and thus deal with self-control problems. The existence of men-tal accounting implies that small details in the specic design of nancial productscan powerfully impact behavior. For instance, an individual might use unconditionaltransfers labeled as \"health resources\" primarily on health expenditures, simply be-cause the label causes these resources to become part of the individual's \"health\"mental account. Dupas and Robinson ( 2013b), discussed above, nd evidence of the importance of mental accounting. For instance, earmarking expenses for health emergencies in-creased individuals' ability to cope with health shocks. Similarly, in a horse racebetween a hard and soft commitment savings account, Karlan and Linden (2018)nd that the weaker commitment account causes stronger increases in savings foreducational supplies, which in turn increased test scores, in contrast to the strongercommitment account. The authors argue that the labeling of the resources for educa-tional purposes was a strong enough commitment while also allowing some flexibilityfor individuals. Default effects. Setting default choices is a cheap but often highly powerful option in the behavioral-economics toolbox, as shown in the context of retirement savings(Madrian and Shea, 2001) and organ donations (Johnson and Goldstein, 2004)i nr i c h countries. For instance, setting the default to automatic enrollment (wherein individu-als are enrolled unless they explicitly opt out) as opposed to a non-enrollment defaultoption can have enormous impacts on individuals' retirement choices, with impactslasting over a decade (Chetty et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2002). In a starkly different developing-country context, Blumenstock et al. ( 2018) nd similar results. They take advantage of rising nancial inclusion and show large im-pacts of setting opt-in defaults on savings behavior among workers in Afghanistanwho receive their salaries using mobile money. Moreover, the authors provide evi-dence of the underlying mechanisms driving default effects and argue that presentbias and the hassle costs of thinking through different options play an important role,while other factors such as limited memory are less important. These ndings highlight the importance of the economic environment and in- stitutions in shaping savings behaviors. In contrast to developed countries, most5Risk and insurance 391 individuals in developing countries do not have the option to automatically save for retirement (such as using 401k savings vehicles) or to have their salary paid into their bank account monthly. Instead, many workers are paid daily or even hourly, which may increase individuals' susceptibility to temptation. For instance, Casaburi andMacchiavello ( 2018) argue that farmers may prefer to sell milk to the dairy where they get paid monthly, rather than to sell it on the spot market for a higher pricebecause this creates a form of savings since they get paid at the end of the month. Memory and attention. Limited memory and attention might distort individuals' decision-making in various ways, ranging from medical adherence to savings be- havior. Memory constraints might be particularly important for the poor since low literacy levels make it difcult to effectively use of written reminders or similar tech-nologies. Karlan et al. (2016) study the impact of reminders in a eld experiment with three different banks in Bolivia, Peru, and the Philippines. Their idea is that,when making consumption decisions in the moment, individuals may forget or not attend to their future consumption of investment goals. They nd that reminder mes- sages which increase the salience of the savings goal help individuals follow throughon their weak-commitment savings plan, suggesting important interactions betweenmemory and self-control (as in Ericson, 2017). Exponential growth bias. Financial literacy can greatly impact individuals' savings choices (Lusardi, 2009). For instance, individuals may also underestimate the returns to savings due to a systematic under-estimation of the power of compound interest(Stango and Zinman, 2009). Song (2015) provides evidence consistent with exponen- tial growth bias using a eld experiment in China. A treatment group which is taughtthe principles of compound interest contributes substantially more to a governmentpension plan. New technologies. The development of new technologies such as mobile money creates great opportunities for the nancial inclusion and empowerment of the poor (Jack and Suri, 2014, 2016; Suri, 2017). Such technologies can greatly help indi- viduals with behavioral biases, for instance, through automatic payment schemes or reminders (Cadena and Schoar, 2011). A thorough understanding of the above behav- ioral biases can greatly improve the design of adequate nancial products. However,new technologies also create potential for behavioral agents to be targeted and ex- ploited, raising important questions of consumer protection (Ru and Schoar, 2016). For instance, recent increases in sports-betting using mobile phones in East Africa, and the growth of an industry making small loans at very high interest rates are im-portant topics for future research. 5Risk and insurance Risk plays a central role in the lives of the poor (Collins et al., 2009). Poor house- holds are simultaneously exposed to numerous risks, including market risks (e.g. prices), production risks (weather shocks, pests), health risks, asset risks (e.g. theft),392 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics and even political risk (e.g. civil conflict) (Hazell, 1992; Dercon, 2005). Under most plausible utility functions, the sharply diminishing marginal utility of income at very low consumption levels implies a particularly strong need for insurance. Yet, little social insurance (whether health or income insurance) is provided by governments in poor countries. Poor countries also have less well-developed markets for dealing with risk through private insurance. Instead, societies have developed non-market institutions for coping with risk (Besley, 1995; Townsend, 1994). A large literature studies informal risk-sharing in developing countries, and how risk considerations affect crop choice, migration choice, and marriage, and other decisions. Evidence on the extent of risk shar- ing within villages (or other networks, such as sub-caste networks in India) ismixed. In some cases, one cannot reject the hypothesis that consumption moves only with village-wide income shocks, not idiosyncratic shocks, but in other cases consumption and even mortality and long-run health outcomes move with idiosyn-cratic shocks (Paxson, Yang and Choi, 2007; Rose, 1999; Maccini and Yang, 2009). There is also evidence that consumption moves with health shocks, sometimes dramatically (Gertler and Gruber, 2002; Collins et al., 2009). Since people in poor countries are often exposed to weather risk, and since such risk is not generally subject to asymmetric information, it is a puzzle that rainfall in- surance is not more common. Weather risk is different from other risks (e.g. illness or death in the family) because it is not idiosyncratic, but correlated within regions, and therefore cannot be easily insured away within villages or even across villages. These reasons make rainfall insurance a particularly interesting context to study behavioralbiases, since other reasons for market failures or low take-up may be less relevant here. Weather insurance remains uncommon despite subsidies from governments and NGOs. In India, rainfall-indexed insurance was introduced in 2003, but despite mon-soons being notoriously unpredictable, and a large share of the population being dependent on rainfall, take-up has been disappointing (Stein, 2016). Several eld ex- periments have found low levels of take-up, despite heavy subsidies and signicantmarketing efforts (Gin\u00e9 et al., 2008;C o l ee ta l . , 2013). Some of this low take-up may be explained by standard reasons, e.g. basis risk (Clarke, 2016) or fear of contractual non-performance (Doherty and Schlesinger, 1991). 25 Below, we focus on potential behavioral reasons that might contribute to in- efciently low take-up levels of insurance. We rst consider existing evidence ofnon-standard preferences affecting the demand for insurance. We then investigate therole of non-standard beliefs. 25Lack of trust is more generally correlated with low levels of participation in nancial markets (Guiso et al., 2006). Low social trust may have deep historical roots and be culturally-determined, as discussed in Section 9.5Risk and insurance 393 5.1Non-standard preferences affecting insurance demand Present bias. In textbook models of insurance, resources are transferred only across states of the world. In practice, however, insurance almost always additionally entails shifting resources over time. That is, in period t, individuals need to decide whether they would like to purchase insurance that pays out in a pre-specied bad state in period t+1. This time structure of decisions and payments allows for the possibility of time preferences affecting lowering individuals' demand for insurance. Casaburi and Willis ( 2018) test this idea by offering Kenyan farmers crop- insurance in which the premium is charged only when uncertainty is resolved, thatis, at the time of harvest. Their unusual insurance product thus purely distributesresources between future states. They nd that demand for such insurance is dramat- ically higher than for standard contracts with upfront payments of insurance premia, even at highly subsidized levels. The authors argue that this result is driven by present bias. They also nd that offering farmers a commitment to purchase insurance a month later increases take-up by 21 percentage points, suggesting present bias andliquidity constraints as important inhibitors of demand for standard insurance con- tracts. The authors could enforce post-harvest premium payments due to the contract- farming setting they study. Their insight suggests a comparative advantage in in- surance provision for entities which have the power to enforce contemporaneoustransfers from those experiencing good states to those receiving bad shocks. In rich countries, governments have a major role in providing social insurance. In poor coun- tries, social groups such as kinship networks, villages, or sub-caste groups may play a key role, and formal sector jobs may be desirable in part because of the capacity of large rms to provide such insurance. Reference-dependent utility. Loss aversion can have ambiguous impacts on demand for insurance (Eckles and Wise, 2011). On the one hand, reference-dependence in- creases risk aversion over small and moderate stakes, as argued by Sydnor's (2010)study of home-owner insurance in the US. On the other hand, if up-front insurance premia are bracketed separately from insurance payouts and considered as losses, loss aversion could curb demand for insurance by making the premium payment particu-larly unattractive. In fact, loss aversion could play some role in explaining the results by Casaburi and Willis ( 2018) described above. This highlights the importance of understanding what reference-point individuals use when evaluating their insurancechoices, as well as how they bracket their decisions. Finally, Kahneman and Tversky's ( 1979) Prospect Theory argues that individu- als overweight small probability events in their evaluation of risky gambles. Suchoverweighting would tend to increase demand for insurance against low-probability but high-risk events, potentially heightening the puzzle of low insurance demand in developing countries.394 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics 5.2Non-standard beliefs affecting insurance demand Projection bias and recency effects. Individuals may exhibit projection bias when evaluating insurance products. In good states of the world, they may have dif- culty appropriately valuing bad states of the world, i.e. they may underestimate theirmarginal utility in potential bad states if the present state is good (Loewenstein etal.,2003). Relatedly, individuals might place disproportionate weight on observa- tions from the recent past or extrapolate recent trends, and thus overestimate the probability of their current state occurring in the future (Hogarth and Einhorn, 1992; Fuster et al., 2010). Such individuals value future insurance less than when they are currently in a good state (holding everything else equal), thus curbing insurance demand for indi-viduals who are currently in good states. In contrast, individuals in bad states mayovervalue insurances, but bad states are more likely to generate liquidity constraints,which could reduce take-up despite a high valuation. 26Moreover, if bad states are rare, projection bias will systematically depress demand for insurance (since demandwill typically be elicited during a good state). This is ironic because insurance offersits largest benet for low-probability high-loss events. Recent work in developing countries provides evidence that the current idiosyn- cratic state of the world does affect individuals' demand for insurance. 27Chang et al. (2018) nd that fluctuations in daily air pollution levels predict individuals' decision to purchase or cancel health insurance in China. Since these fluctuations are hardlypredictive of future pollution levels and thus the value of insurance, such effects aredifcult to reconcile with the neoclassical model. Instead, these demand patterns areconsistent with individuals over- and under-weighting future pollution-related healthrisk depending on the state of pollution on the day of their purchase or cancellationdecision. Karlan et al. ( 2014a) nd evidence consistent with recency bias in their study of agricultural decision-making among small-scale farmers in Ghana. They nd that demand for insurance is higher for farmers following a payout to themselves or some-one their network. In contrast, demand is lower for previously insured farmers whodid not receive payouts due to good rain. Such demand patterns are consistent withprojection and recency bias, and salience, though they might also be explained bylimited trust in the insurance agency, with observed payouts increasing trust. Motivated reasoning and over-optimism. As discussed in Section 3.3, motivated rea- soning could explain individuals' lack of health investments. If individuals directly derive utility from beliefs about their future wellbeing, they may seek to maintain bi-ased beliefs about their current health status or the future. Such biased beliefs might 26Bad states may also fail to come to mind or be salient when times are good, and vice versa (Bordalo et al.,2012). 27Further evidence on recency effects in insurance choices includes a body of work by Slovic et al., 1974; Kunreuther et al., 1978; and Gallagher, 2014.6Technology adoption 395 lower demand for insurance. To the best of our knowledge, no existing evidence con- siders this hypothesis. Beliefs in higher powers. Individuals' beliefs might deviate in more dramatic ways from standard probability assessments, including beliefs in higher powers, witchcraft, and magic. In a clever lab-in-the-eld study in Ghana, Auriol et al. ( 2018) nd that enrolling individuals in a commercial funeral-insurance policy lowers individuals' investment behavior in religious goods, as measured by choices between payments for themselves and contributions to church. The authors interpret their results as ev- idence of individuals perceiving the church as a source of insurance, derived frombeliefs in an interventionist god. Such beliefs could be relevant barriers to demand for formal insurance in other settings as well. 6Technology adoption The development literature has identied various instances of seemingly sub-optimal technology choices. In Pakistan, Atkin et al. ( 2017) showed that take-up of a new technology that reduced waste in the production of soccer balls was surprisingly low, despite its potential to increase prots.28Other examples of apparently non-optimal technology choice in the development literature include fertilizer use in Kenya (Duflo et al., 2008) and textile factories in India (Bloom et al., 2013). Below, we discuss two behavioral factors that could potentially either interfere with technology adoption: present bias, and limited attention. We then argue thatbehavioral social learning could produce badly distorted social outcomes. 6.1Limited attention Hanna et al. ( 2014) provide an explanation why individuals might not take advantage of apparently useful and readily available information. Given that attention is limited,individuals can only focus on and process a small subset of all the potentially avail-able information. Rational attention theories predict that individuals focus on what they think is most important, and their beliefs about what is important are assumed to be accurate (Sims, 2003, 2010). Therefore, such theories predict only limited inef- ciencies and welfare losses due to limited attention. In contrast, Schwartzstein's ( 2014) model of attention argues that current beliefs about what is important in the world guide individuals' attention and learning, whichin turn shape individuals' beliefs in the future. If individuals have incorrect beliefs about the importance of different aspects of the world, they might pay less than op- timal attention to them, and thus might never learn that their beliefs were wrong.Therefore, wrong beliefs can persist indenitely even in the presence of data which 28The authors point to the role of agency problems within the rm.396 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics would otherwise lead to revision of beliefs. In such models, inattention can create signicant inefciencies and lead to large welfare losses. Hanna et al. ( 2014) apply this insight to technology adoption among seaweed farmers in Indonesia. Given the complex production function with many possiblyimportant dimensions, the authors argue that farmers will only pay attention to the dimensions of production they think are important. Hanna et al. ( 2014) track the relationship between the size of planted seaweed pods and farmers' output, arguing that larger pods lead to greater output. Farmers, when asked, did not suggest that podsize is an important determinant of output. 86% of farmers did not even know thepod sizes they themselves planted, even though 83% of them were literate and theaverage farming experience amongst the sample was 18 years. Moreover, natural variation in pod size created numerous quasi-experiments that farmers could have learned from. Hanna et al. ( 2014) argue that despite large amounts of data being available for free on their own farms, inattention appears to have pre-vented farmers from noticing this relationship. Hanna et al.'s ( 2014) data is based on only a single season and there is signicant cross-sectional variation in optimal podsize. Since the authors did not collect impacts of their intervention on subsequentprots, some questions remain whether optimal pod sizes for given farms vary over time and whether the intervention indeed increased prots. Additional data to shed light on this issue would be valuable. If attention is limited, providing simple information with tips about optimizing production may be more effective than providing full information. In an RCT to testthe above theory of inattention, Hanna et al. ( 2014) nd that presenting farmers with summaries that draw their attention to the importance of pod sizes changed theirfarming techniques and increased output, but simply providing them with data oninitial pod size and eventual yield from each of their pods did not induce learning anddid not change farming behavior. Similarly, Bennear et al. ( 2013) nd in Bangladesh that a simpler message (pro- viding red versus green labels) about whether a well has dangerous levels of arsenicis more effective than providing more continuous information. In the Dominican Re- public, Drexler et al. ( 2014) nd that a simple \"rule-of-thumb\" training signicantly improved the nancial practices of participating rm relative to a fuller training about accounting. This evidence suggests that there are cases when limited attention maylead to sub-optimal decisions and providing well-chosen limited information may bemore effective than providing the full set of available information. There are also potential downsides of presenting simplied information. First, there may be heterogeneity in the population and some individuals may benet fromfuller information. Second, external analysts may not understand the decision prob-lem as well as the people to whom they are trying to transmit information, or theymay pursue different objectives. They may therefore offer inappropriate advice. Forexample, in an agricultural context, agricultural scientists or government departmentsmay seek to maximize agricultural production rather than prots and thus may not appropriately value farmer time.6Technology adoption 397 6.2Present bias Duflo et al. ( 2011) study the extent to which present bias influences agricultural technology adoption and how policy can mitigate its effect. In previous work with small-scale maize farmers in Western Kenya, Duflo et al. ( 2008) nd high returns to top-dressing fertilizer in Western Kenya if used at the right quantity. However, de-spite these potentially high returns at the time of the study, only about 20 percent offarmers used fertilizer in any given season, which suggests mis-optimization. Farmers have money around the time of harvest and report plans to purchase fertilizer before planting begins. However, few farmers then follow through on theirplans. Duflo et al. ( 2011) posit a model of stochastic present bias and partial na\u00efvet\u00e9. A partially na\u00efve, present-biased farmer may put off purchasing fertilizer until the lastminute, expecting to purchase the fertilizer later. Then, having underestimated howlikely she is to be impatient in the last period, the farmer may also be impatient in the last period that buying is possible, and thus end up not purchasing the fertilizer. This sort of model of decision-making has important implications for debates over fertilizer subsidies. Agriculture experts sometimes feel that farmers are using too little of particular inputs and they sometimes advocate heavy subsidies to encour-age adoption. Economists have historically been more sceptical, arguing that thismay distort input use away from the optimal level, potentially with negative envi- ronmental consequences. The model suggests that while heavy subsidies could help present-biased farmers overcome any immediate utility costs of purchasing fertilizer,they could induce overuse of fertilizer by farmers who are not present biased. Duflo et al. ( 2011) argue that the tradeoff could be improved through better pol- icy design: smaller, time-limited subsidies offered just after harvest could mitigatepresent bias while causing only second-order distortions among farmers without time inconsistent preferences. If farmers have more cash on hand in the period immedi- ately following the harvest, then offering small, time-limited subsidies could lead toan increase in fertilizer use among present-biased farmers while limiting other dis-tortions. These early discounts would only need to be large enough to overcome theutility costs of purchasing fertilizer if offered after the harvest, whereas discountsoffered later, when the farmer is poorer would also need to cover part of the out-of- pocket fertilizer costs. Based on these predictions, Duflo et al. ( 2011) designed a program to offer time- limited discounts for fertilizer that allowed farmers to purchase a voucher for fertilizer immediately after the harvest at the regular price, with free delivery around plantingtime. Time-limited discounts around the time of harvest substantially increased take-up of fertilizer. Moreover, this program was more effective than offering a 50 percentdiscount on fertilizer later in the season. This evidence suggests that time-limited discounts around times when individu- als have money available could be an efcient policy tool to increase fertilizer useor other desirable behaviors. However, as always, scaling any given policy presentschallenges. In the case of time-limited discounts for fertilizer use, a specic scaled-upversion of the program led to positive yet signicantly smaller impacts on fertilizeradoption than the original study (Schilbach, 2015).398 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics We hypothesize that present bias may also induce procrastination in learning about new technologies. If adoption requires costly experimentation and costly atten- tion, present-biased individuals might procrastinate over conducting such experimen- tation. Such individuals would benet, again, from decreasing the costs of learningthrough the provision of simplied information. Moreover, commitment devices forfuture experimentation could help overcome such procrastination problems. Agri- cultural extension services that incorporate self-help groups and encourage public commitments to attempt experimentation with new technologies may, in addition tosolving failures of social learning, help solve such self-control problems. Finally, present bias may induce non-adoption through the usual mechanism of generating liquidity constraints, as described in previous section. Lee et al. ( 2016)e x - perimentally estimate the demand curve for an electricity connection in rural Kenya and conclude that consumer surplus\u2014as revealed by willingness to pay\u2014is consider- ably lower than the cost of provision. However, liquidity constraints may contributeto their estimates of low demand. The authors present evidence that credit constraints are indeed binding, which may influence welfare calculations and induce low adop- tion of even desired technologies. 6.3Behavioral learning For individual farmers, identifying the best technologies to adopt and how to use them is challenging, given that experimentation is costly, and outcomes are noisy. Thus, learning from the experiences and knowledge of others\u2014social learning\u2014maypromote adoption of useful technologies Rasul, 2006; Conley and Udry, 2010). Behavioral economics suggests several ways in which individuals may misin- terpret information. For example, individuals may neglect the extent to which the pieces of information they hear from multiple sources are \"redundant\", in that they themselves derive from a common source (Eyster and Rabin, 2010). They may also over-generalize from small amounts of information, such as the recommendationsof a handful of neighbors (Tversky and Kahneman, 1971), and underestimate how much can be learned from a large sample, such as the aggregated recommendationsof hundreds of farmers (Benjamin et al., 2016). Below, we discuss these behavioral factors in more detail, discuss the existing evidence, and argue that theory suggests they may interact to seriously distort. 6.3.1 Barriers to sharing or seeking information On the demand side, social learning in agriculture requires farmers to actively seek,or at least be receptive to, information and recommendations from others. On thesupply side, social learning similarly requires farmers who have some information orexperience to be willing to share it with others. Certain behavioral which might make farmers hesitant to seek or share information with others. Distributional preferences. Whether and whom farmers are willing to share infor- mation with may depend on social preferences such as altruism and envy, and how6Technology adoption 399 these apply to others within the farmers' social networks. For example, if farmers' have envious or competitive preferences towards their peers, they may avoid shar-ing information to remain or become relatively more successful. Farmers might even choose to share false information to maintain an advantage. In contrast, individu- als are likely to be altruistic towards others from their own extended families, kinor ethnic groups, and might therefore be willing to provide advice to such individu-als. Existing research from Uganda provides some evidence for such differential ef- fects: agricultural extension workers target information towards farmers from theirown social group, while withholding information from others (Bandiera et al., 2018). This evidence suggests that accounting for the structure of social networks and dis-tributional preferences across those networks may help explain patterns of sociallearning and allow for the design of more efcient methods to seed and transmit information. Social-image concerns. Social-image concerns may keep farmers from asking oth- ers for information or advice, since doing so may signal ignorance or low ability on the part of the asker. An experiment conducted by Chandrasekhar et al. ( 2018)i nr u - ral India provides some evidence for such an effect. They design a eld experimentin which \"seekers\" must acquire information from a paired \"advisor\". In one arm of the experiment, the seeker's need for the information is (articially) correlated with their ability from a baseline test, such that choosing to ask for advice may signal lowability. In the other arm, ability is revealed to the advisor regardless of the seeker'schoice to ask for information, such that the signaling channel is shut down, althoughlow-ability seekers may still feel some shame from interacting with an advisor who has learned of his low ability. The authors nd that signaling is the dominant force overall and that low ability individuals do face large stigma inhibitions: there is a55% decline in the probability of seeking when the need for information is correlatedwith cognitive ability. If such mechanisms are more broadly relevant\u2014that is, if asking for information about technology signals low ability even without articially creating a correla-tion between low ability and need for information\u2014then interventions to reduce thestigma of asking for information, for instance by using technology to make accessingsuch information private, could increase the demand for social learning. Social image concerns might also affect the supply of social information. On the one hand, if acquiring the image of being a helpful community member is valued,then social-image incentives such as publicly acknowledging those who share in-formation might increase the supply of information. On the other hand, social-imagemotives might instead reduce the supply or quality of information. For instance, farm- ers may want to selectively share positive experiences that create an image of success, while suppressing their failures, thus providing biased information. Similarly, farm-ers may fear unfairly acquiring an image of being either incompetent or malicious, ifaccurate information they share leads a peer to make a decision that ends poorly dueto chance.400 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics 6.3.2 Barriers to correctly interpreting information A literature in psychology and economics documents several biases in learning and errors in probabilistic reasoning (see Benjamin, 2018 in this volume for a thorough review). Little research on these biases, however, has occurred in eld settings or indeveloping countries. Biases in learning could be important to technology adoption,causing people to put too much or too little stock in available information. This couldinfluence their willingness to experiment and take risks, potentially slowing learningand adoption of productive technologies. Redundancy neglect. Section 3.3discussed redundancy bias extensively in the con- text of health choices. Recall that redundancy neglect describes a failure of Bayesian learning wherein an individual trying to learn by observing others' actions does notaccount for the fact that other individuals are also engaged in social learning. Forinstance, an individual may observe multiple neighbors behaving in the same fash-ion. He may take those separate actions as independent signals of private informationwhereas, in fact, those neighbors might have in turn have been basing their choice ona single signal from a common source. This concept is relevant in the context of technology adoption as well. Take, for instance, the context of input adoption amongst smallholder farmers. To correctly interpret the observed behavior of their neighbors, and thereby enhance social learn-ing, farmers must correctly account for these potential \"information redundancies\"in the network structure of information in their village, for example. Failure to do socould have an outsized effect on how followers value technology. If initial farmerschoose suboptimal practice by happenstance, then this inefcient practice may growentrenched amongst those that follow, creating a situation in which a population islocked into condentially held false beliefs. Eyster et al. ( 2018) and Enke and Zimmermann ( 2019) conduct lab experiments in which subjects act in precisely this way: by failing to account for the redundancyin signals, subjects do worse than they would do without the possibility for sociallearning. Murn and Pratt ( 2019) provide eld evidence that nance professionals exhibit redundancy neglect when pricing loans, as well. Sampling and statistical biases. In Section 3.3, we discussed sampling and statisti- cal biases and that generalizing from small samples is a widespread phenomenon in avariety of contexts. 29This evidence is relevant to behavioral development economics since farmers, for instance, might form excessively strong negative opinions aboutthe value of a new technology based on a few unlucky experiences of his own. Agri-cultural outcomes have high variance, and the inference drawn from a small sampleof observations is likely to be misleading. Furthermore, over-inference from small samples might be particularly relevant in rural contexts where farmers' information is often limited to their own experience and that of their neighbors Moreover, even summary statistics about a technology's protability based on ample data might not be sufcient to remedy statistical biases: people also dis- 29This has been termed \"Belief in the Law of Small Numbers\" by Tversky and Kahneman ( 1971).7Labor 401 play a to under-infer from large samples (Grifn and Tversky, 1992; Benjamin et al., 2016). Information campaigns that provide scientic evidence sup- porting a new technology may thus have limited effect, since farmers might continue to overweight individual negative experiences or anecdotes relative to seemingly con- clusive statistical evidence that runs counter. This bias prevents farmers from growing condent when they should, meaning that their beliefs are too easily swayed by new data. Such a bias, along with other statistical errors that give undue weight to recent outcomes (e.g., base-rate neglect; see Kahneman and Tversky, 1973 and Benjamin et al., 2018), may therefore underlie why some farmers seem to switch in and out of using a new technology over time (e.g. Suri, 2011). Countering these statistical biases is potentially critical for sustained adoption. Selection neglect. Above, we highlighted several ways that farmers may selectively transmit information (e.g. due to distributional concerns or for social image motives).For those who receive this information to properly interpret its content, they must properly account for the selection process underlying when and why farmers share information in the rst place. Farmers might, for instance, be excited to tell their neighbors and friends when a newly adopted technology works well but say nothing when it works poorly. Alternatively, competitive farmers may decide to keep infor-mation about protable technologies to themselves. In each of these scenarios, rational inference requires special attention to the selection rule: in the rst case, taking recommendations at face value would lead farmers to become overly optimistic about the technology; in the latter, it would lead them to be overly pessimistic. Enke ( 2017) provides laboratory evidence that many individuals completely neglect the fact that the signals they receive are selected,especially when the environment itself is somewhat complex. However, nudging par-ticipants by drawing their attention to the bias leads to much better inference. 7Labor This section discusses behavioral issues in labor markets in developing countries. First, we highlight how work patterns in poor countries differ from those in rich countries. Instead of 9-to-5 work in the formal sector as in rich countries, labor mar- kets in developing countries are instead characterized by three features that might potentially increase the importance of behavioral biases: high levels of informality, casual labor, and self-employment. We discuss evidence on worker productivity and labor supply in developing coun- tries, including female labor-force participation; wage-setting and incentives with behavioral workers; and the selection of workers. 7.1Labor markets in developing countries Many economists assume that the natural default type of labor-force participation isfull-time employment on a regular schedule (e.g. 9 to 5, Monday to Friday), with402 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics time during those hours being devoted to work, and other time being devoted to do- mestic responsibilities. We typically assume impersonal employment norms and lawsgoverning interactions between workers and their managers during the work period. Such work patterns are far from the historical norm or the current situation in de- veloping countries, where many individuals work in family rms without a sharpdelineation of work and domestic time; and others are subject to sometimes coer-cive, multi-stranded relationships, for example, working as domestic servants or forfeudalistic landowners with de facto political authority. Some historians of the Industrial Revolution argue that it is not at all natural for people to work regular hours in factories under factory discipline, and that peas-ants had to be turned into workers through pressures like enclosures and throughdevices like factory bells and provisions to lock out workers who showed up late.Many historians and some economists (e.g., Thompson, 1967; Marglin, 1974)h a v e argued that the introduction of the new management technology of factory disciplinewas as important to the Industrial Revolution as any purely technological innovation.Such scholars tend to see factory discipline as imposed on workers by capitalists, andperhaps as made possible only by the dispossession of farmers by enclosure of the commons. Clark (1994) turns this interpretation on its head, with a much more benign view of the role of factory discipline. He argues that workers themselves preferred the introduction of factory discipline as a commitment device. He notes that under theolder putting-out system, workers \"frequently kept irregular hours, often taking off Monday ('St. Monday') and even Tuesday and working long hours on Thursday and Friday\" (Clark, 1994). Clark posits that workers valued the constraints imposed on their behavior by factory discipline because this helped mitigate their self-controlproblems. Informality and self-employment. Labor markets in developing countries are charac- terized by high levels of informality and self-employment. Most people in developingcountries are self-employed. The majority of the rural population operates a farm in most developing countries, while many additionally operate a non-agricultural business. The poor are highly likely to be self-employed entrepreneurs, potentiallyrunning multiple microenterprises or juggling casual labor and business (Banerjeeand Duflo, 2007). In contrast, only 12% of employment in OECD countries is self- employment. Some standard explanations for the lack of large rms, and the prevalence of self-employment in developing countries, are agency problems, credit constraints andpredation. A potential additional explanation is that regular employment may simplybe costlier for workers in poor countries. First, it may be harder to hold a formal job simply because of the likelihood of unpredictable demands on one's time. For exam- ple, you may have to go to the hospital with family members when they get sick toensure they receive quality care, or you may yourself be more likely to get sick. Sec-ond, preferences for work schedules may feature strategic complementarities, whichmake xed scheduled unattractive when others do not also have them.7Labor 403 In the United States, Mas and Pallais (2017) show that workers place little value on work-hours flexibility, and instead have a strong preference for Monday-Friday 9-to-5 jobs. In contrast, in developing countries, where most others are self-employedor engaged in casual day-labor, having a xed schedule may be unattractive. Socialexpectations for participation in events like weddings and funerals may be shaped by the fact that most adults have flexible schedules. This fact may partly explain why formal-sector jobs in poor countries often come with a wage premium. Such apremium may in part be a compensating differential and not simply reflect a highermarginal product of labor in the formal sector. It is also consistent with the doc-umented high absence rates of employees even in the private sector in developingcountries (Kremer et al., 2005). In standard models of development such as the Harris and Todaro ( 1970) model, factory jobs are highly desirable and provide large rents. Many economists assumethat distortionary unions, or state-owned rms, or labor legislation provide theserents. An alternative perspective is that these jobs are not particularly desirable.Blattman and Dercon ( 2018) randomly assign industrial jobs in Ethiopia and nd that workers quickly quit and move to different sectors. One implication of self-employment and informal employment is that workers of- ten set their own work hours and effort, without the structure, commitment and norms provided by formal employers. This feature makes behavioral phenomena such as limited self-control and income-targeting potentially more important in labor mar-kets in developing countries. Consistent with this hypothesis, Fafchamps ( 1993) and Baird et al. ( 2016) nd very low hours worked in agriculture in some parts of Africa: just 9.8 hours per week among young Kenyan adults employed in agriculture. Incontrast, Bick et al. ( 2018) harmonize survey evidence from 49 countries (although missing India, China and large parts of Sub-Saharan Africa) and conclude that people in poor countries work more hours on average than those in rich countries. While we do not yet have a full understanding of labor supply differences across rich and poor countries, we discuss direct evidence on self-control problems at work in Section 7.2 below. Casual labor in agricultural labor markets. The share of the population employed in agriculture is much higher in poor countries than in rich countries. While mostagricultural production in poor countries occurs on smallholder farms, with familylabor as an input, there is also a highly active agricultural labor market. Most farmsemploy outside workers for short spells using informal contracts; providing labor insuch markets is an important source of earnings, especially for the poorest amongstthe poor (Kaur, 2019). How efcient are these labor markets? At rst glance, agricultural labor markets in poor countries would appear to satisfy many of the conditions for competitivemarkets: many small buyers and sellers of labor, without formal unions or enforcedminimum wages. Yet, surprisingly, such markets exhibit several features such as wagerigidity and limited wage dispersion. We discuss these in Section 7.3below. Role of the public sector. Formal employment in developing countries is often dom- inated by the state. The public sector in poor countries is an attractive employer.404 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics It provides a large wage premium over the private sector (much more so than in rich countries), provides job security with few chances of being red, and rarely uti-lizes incentives or performance pay (Finan et al., 2017). This public sector typically does quite poorly at providing public services such as education, health, sanitationand law-and-order, relative to rich countries. A recent literature in development eco-nomics has used eld experiments to study the personnel economics of the state,including topics related to behavioral labor: the selection of prosocial workers, andthe response to monetary and non-monetary incentives. We discuss some of theseissues in Section 7.4below. While many have seen the high absence rates among government social service employees like teachers and health workers as evidence of weak incentives and pooraccountability in the public sector, it is worth noting that absence rates of teachersin private schools are also very high (e.g., 22.8% in Indian private schools, Kremeret al., 2005). One interpretation of this fact is that high absence rates are in fact part of an efcient contract because employees nd a regular 9-to-5 schedule to be verycostly. Social norms and networks. Social norms and networks play an important role in labor markets in developing countries, just as in rich countries. However, the natureof the norms and social pressures may differ. For instance, many developing countrieshave strong norms against female labor force-participation. In India, the caste systemprescribes norms regarding appropriate occupations for individuals based on theirinherited caste (although surprisingly little recent work in economics studies howthis distorts occupational choice). Given the importance of kin or caste networks inpoor countries, job search and referrals often flow along these networks, leading topotentially inefcient matching of workers with jobs (Beaman and Magruder, 2012). The barriers to the efcient allocation of workers to jobs\u2014such as due to normsagainst women or other disadvantaged groups working\u2014may have large aggregateeffects on growth, as has been studied in the case of the United States (Hsieh et al.,2018). In addition, life for workers and even employers in poor countries features many deprivations: the scarcity of money, the prevalence of environmental factors such asnoise and heat, and health issues such as chronic sleep deprivation among the urbanpoor. While we discuss these factors in detail in Section 10on the psychology of poverty, they may also have implications for worker productivity. 7.2Labor supply and worker productivity Self-control problems. One implication of informal work is that productivity may be more influenced by behavioral biases. Given the lack of direct or indirect supervi-sion by workers in informal labor markets, the consequences of workers' self-controlproblems could be particularly pronounced. Someone who is self-employed willlikely not face the same consequences of arriving late at work or of not showingup at all, for example, as someone with a xed schedule and a supervisor to reportto. The Indian rickshaw drivers and other low-income workers studied in Schilbach7Labor 405 (2019), who often work while inebriated, are only able to do so because they are self-employed. Kaur et al. ( 2010) study whether workers prefer contracts that help them commit to working more to overcome self-control problems. Such self-control problems at work may be different than in other domains because, in addition to reducing theworker's welfare, they can hurt prots. The existence of self-control problems fun-damentally changes the nature of the contracting problem, in that both parties haveinterests in incentivizing the worker to exert more effort in the future. Furthermore,whereas in other contexts commitment mechanisms will only arise if agents are so- phisticated and demand them, employers may elect to design contracts that mitigate self-control problems even if the employee is na\u00efve or does not demand them explic-itly. The authors speculate that this may be the reason why employers often imposecontracts with production minimums, such as the forty-hour work week, where em-ployees have little authority over how much they work, and instead must elect toeither work the designated amount or risk being red. Using evidence from a 13-month eld experiment in India, Kaur et al. ( 2015) investigate whether commitment contracts can help workers tackle their self-controlproblems and increase their productivity. Study participants were hired as full-timedata-entry workers and paid a piece rate for output, without restrictions on their hours,so that they could largely determine themselves how much they would produce andbe paid. Then, on randomly selected days, the experimenters gave workers the optionto set a target output level for the day. If their realized output fell below the chosen target, workers received a piece rate that was half of the usual rate; if their output exceeded the target, they receive the usual piece rate. Choosing a positive target cre-ates a dominated contract, in that the contract punishes low output but does not rewardhigh output relative to a contract with no target. Crucially, apart from potential boostsin productivity and labor supply, there is no reason for workers to choose a positivetarget since doing so can only reduce workers' pay for any given worker effort. Workers set a positive target 36% of the time when offered the option to choose a target level, thus selecting a dominated contract that incentivized reaching the tar-get. Workers also exerted more effort as the randomly assigned payday approached,suggesting high levels of worker impatience and the existence of self-control prob-lems. 30The authors argue that workers chose these dominated contracts to overcome self-control problems and commit themselves to working a certain amount. Indeed,choosing such a contract increased worker output, with an effect of the same size as an 18% increase in the piece rate. Those who had greater payday effects were more likely to choose positive targets when offered and had larger increases in output un-der these contracts relative to the standard contract. As some workers may be na\u00efveabout their level of self-control, and thus may not choose commitment despite havingself-control problems, these estimates may be a lower bound on the extent of timeinconsistency and the potential of these kinds of contracts to increase productivity. 30Although note that a standard model of present bias would not imply higher effort closer to the payday, unless workers are severely liquidity-constrained.406 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics This result is consistent with the explanation that the workers with the greatest self-control problems beneted the most from the dominated contracts. However, if there is heterogeneity among workers in the extent of self-control problems, workers who do not have strong self-control problems may be made worse off by the fact that other workers have self-control problems. This insight stands in sharp contrastto other equilibrium settings in which, for example, the gym membership settingin which agents with more standard preferences effectively benet from the rm's efforts to exploit the preferences of behavioral agents since rms are subject to a zero- prot condition in equilibrium. In this context, there is an adverse selection problemin which rms may be forced to offer contracts with draconian work rules to avoid selecting undesirable workers, even if those draconian work rules are not appropriate for most workers. Reference-dependence and income targeting. Another implication of self-employ- ment with flexible schedules is that workers may engage in various forms of incomeor effort targeting. In his book, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism ,W e - ber argued that peasants in traditional societies have what modern economists wouldlabel a backward-bending labor supply curve and contrasted this to what he saw asthe predictions of models of rational economic actors. In a static labor-supply model, there are opposing income and substitution effects, so the response to a wage increase is theoretically ambiguous. However, in a dynamicmodel in which there are high-frequency wage shocks, and individuals have a con-stant exponential discount factor, for any plausible parameter values, labor supply would increase in response to temporary wage increases (e.g., Lucas and Rapping, 1969). Backward bending labor supply could be generated under at least two be-havioral stories: reference-dependent preferences and present bias. First, we discussreference-dependent labor supply, which has received a great deal of attention in the behavioral literature. An active literature has studied whether workers such as taxi-drivers, who can set their own hours, respond to wage shocks as neoclassical models would predict (by in- crease labor supply when wages are high), or if they instead exhibit income-targeting due to reference-dependence (such that fewer hours of work are supplied when the wage is high, since the reference point/income target is attained sooner on high-wagedays). 31While there remains a debate in this literature, most evidence points towards some role for income targets and reference dependence, with negative daily wage elasticities (e.g. Thakral and T\u00f4, 2018). The literature on reference-dependent labor supply has largely been used to pro- vide sharp tests of reference-dependence in the eld, rather than because of the inherent economic importance of daily labor supply in rich countries (O'Donoghue and Sprenger, 2018 in V olume 1 of this handbook). In poor countries, given the high share of self-employment, this phenomenon could be rather more important. 31See, for instance, Camerer et al. ( 1997), Farber ( 2005, 2015), Crawford and Meng (2011), and Thakral and T\u00f4 ( 2018).7Labor 407 Economists studying developing countries have begun to apply this idea to studying labor supply (Gin\u00e9 et al., 2017; Andersen et al., 2014; Dupas et al., 2018b). Below, we discuss one such paper in detail. Dupas et al. ( 2018b) study the labor supply of Kenya bicycle-taxi drivers. They depart from the existing literature in two ways. First, instead of estimating the refer-ence point, or using the typical earnings as the reference point, they collect daily dataon the worker's \"cash needs\" for the day\u2014unexpected (until recently) expenses such as repairs or entirely anticipated needs such as a savings-club payment coming due. Second, instead of relying on instruments for the wage, they use experimental cashdrops on workers to generate variation in how quickly the cash needs for the day may be reached. The authors nd evidence of income targeting, in that labor supply responds pos- itively to cash needs, even entirely anticipated needs. However, a cash drop at thebeginning of the day does not decrease labor supply, implying that the reference point is over earned income, rather than over total daily income. 32Finally, Dupas et al. (2018b) develop a model in which being below the reference point reduces effort costs (rather than the usual assumption that being below the reference point inducesa sense of loss). The authors calibrate this model to conclude that in the absence of such income targeting, workers would earn 19% less, even in the absence of factors like present bias. Since their model does not feature the exogenous wage shocks (as opposed to cash drops) considered by the previous papers, they do not capture a po- tential opposite effect of income targeting: that income-targeters will earn less for the same total number of hours supplied, since they will work too long on low-wagedays, and too little on high-wage days. Dupas et al. ( 2018b) thus implicitly connect the literature on reference-dependent labor supply with a potential alternative or complementary explanation: liquidity con- straints caused by present bias. In a standard model, individuals should not react sharply to predictable daily expenditure needs, since they would be building up sav-ings over time. If people are severely present-biased, as discussed in Section 2, then they may hold no liquid assets and may also be incapable of saving funds from theperiod with high wages and using them in periods with lower wages. In this case,the dynamic labor supply problem approximately reduces to the static problem with opposing income and substitution effects and the theoretical impact of a temporary positive wage shock on labor supply is again ambiguous. Environmental factors. Heat and noise are ubiquitous features of developing coun- tries, especially in large cities. Dean (2018) conducts an ingenious set of experiments in Kenya with factory workers who are accustomed to working in a noisy environ- ment, recruiting them to work in an environment where the experimenter can controlnoise levels. The author shows using a randomized intervention that a 10 dB increase in ambient noise (akin to the increase in noise from running a vacuum cleaner com- pared to a dishwasher) leads to a 5% decline in output of textile workers. Using lab 32The literature studying cab-drivers has implicitly made the same assumption, since those papers only consider a single source of income.408 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics measures, he shows that the increase in noise also causes a worsening of cognitive function. Specically, executive function (also known as cognitive control), a set of higher-order cognitive functions which direct one's attention and manipulate working memory (Diamond, 2013), declines by 0.07 standard deviations. While the decline in cognitive function cannot be directly linked to the decline in the textile-production output, some alternative channels such as direct effects on health can be ruled out. Moreover, noise has no effects on a cognitively unchallenging effort task (the a-btask of DellaVigna and Pope, 2017). Importantly, Dean ( 2018) nds that workers seem unaware of the effect of noise on their productivity, despite having frequently experienced exposure to such noise.Stated beliefs about the productive effect of noise were generally inaccurate, and workers were not willing to pay more for a quiet work environment when pay de- pended on productivity compared to when pay was xed (although the latter com-parison is somewhat under-powered). This evidence suggests that while the amenity value of quiet was valued to some extent, its productive value was not appreciated. Workers are thus unlikely to take steps by themselves to sufciently insulate them- selves from noise. Adhvaryu et al. ( 2018a) show similar effects for the consequences of heat in the workplace. They work with 26 textile factories in India and show that replacing incan-descent bulbs with LED lighting reduced temperature on the factory floor, boosting output substantially, and particularly on hot days. Daily variation in temperature sim-ilarly affects output. While the authors do not formally elicit workers' or managers' beliefs about the effect of heat, they note that the managers were unaware of the productivity benets of lowering temperature, and that the change in lighting wasimplemented to reduce lighting costs. We return to this point when we discuss be- havioral rms in Section 8. 7.3Wages and behavioral workers We now turn to understanding aspects of wage and incentive-setting in labor marketsin developing countries. We discuss wage rigidity in markets for casual agricultural labor, the absence of pay dispersion across workers, and evidence on gift exchangeat work. Wage rigidity. Many analysts of labor markets in developed countries assume that features like downward nominal wage rigidity and wage compression are driven by labor market institutions such as unions, labor market regulation and the threat of union or regulatory action. Looking at sectors of the labor market of developing coun-tries where both unions and effectively enforced government regulations are close to absent, such as agricultural labor markets, suggests that behavioral factors play an important role. Kaur ( 2019) revisits nominal wage rigidity in the context of Indian agricultural labor markets. First, she documents that nominal wages appear sticky from year-to-year. Next, she nds that positive rainfall shocks, which increase the marginal productof labor temporarily, increase nominal wages. In contrast, negative shocks do not re-7Labor 409 duce wages. Moreover, transitory positive shocks lead to persistently higher nominal wages, even when the marginal product of labor has returned to a lower level. The asymmetry in response to positive and negative shocks is precisely what is predictedwith nominal rigidity. Such rigidities distort employment: agricultural employmentis 9% lower in the year following a positive shock. Consistent with the importance of fairness motives, Kaur shows survey evidence that nominal wage cuts are widely perceived as being unfair, as in the classic ndings of Kahneman et al. ( 1986) and Bewley (1998). Breza et al. ( 2018a) provide eld-experimental evidence on how such nominal wage rigidities persist in the absence of enforced minimum wages or formal insti-tutions such as unions. The authors partner with small employers to offer jobs toworkers in spot labor markets in India during the lean season, when unemploymentis high. They vary both the wage offered to the worker\u2014either the prevailing market wage, or 10% below the wage\u2014as well as the observability of the wage offer (ei- ther inside the worker's home, or on a public street). Offers below the market wageare often accepted when made in private (18%, compared to 26% acceptance at thefull market wage). However, acceptance of low offers drops to only 2% when thelow-wage offers are made publicly. In contrast, offers made at the market wage areequally likely to be accepted in the private and public conditions. Workers thus ap-pear to be subject to social pressure to prevent them from accepting job offers belowthe prevailing market wage. Nearly a quarter of workers are willing to forego a day's work to avoid being seen as a \"scab\". The authors provide indirect evidence that the wage floor is enforced through so- cial sanctions: when playing a costly punishment game in the lab, players impose large penalties on their partners when they are informed that the partner previouslyaccepted a job at below-market wages. Interestingly, players impose these punish-ments even on scabs in other villages, whose labor supply does not affect their ownoutcomes, implying that punishing scabs is an internalized social norm. The paperleaves one puzzle unanswered: why are employers not able to make such offers in private themselves, especially given the repeated nature of the employment relation- ships, and the potentially substantial efciency losses? Pay equality. An existing literature in behavioral labor studies the consequences of pay inequality in the workplace. Card et al. ( 2012) show using a eld experiment at a large employer that disclosing information on peers' salaries reduces job satisfactionamong workers with below-median salaries in their work unit and makes them morelikely to look for a new job. Breza et al. ( 2018b) build on this literature by studying how social preferences over pay inequality affect not just satisfaction and job-search,but also workers' labor supply and productivity. The authors set up a manufacturingworkshop, in which 378 workers are randomized into small units of three workerseach, for one month of full-time employment. Workers are paid a flat daily wage forattendance but select their own effort levels. Breza et al. ( 2018b) randomly assigned work units to one of four different pay structures. In the \"pay disparity\" treatment condition, each worker in the unit isassigned to a different wage ( w low,wmedium ,whigh), based on their own baseline pro-410 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics ductivity levels, with the most productive worker receiving the highest wage. The pay differences between the three levels are modest (less than 5%). In three controlconditions, all workers in a unit were paid the same\u2014either w low,wmedium ,whigh, depending on the group. This design allows the authors to compare two individualsearning the same daily wage, with one being in a group with pay inequality (the treat-ment group), and the other in a group with homogeneous pay (the control conditions).Importantly, the design allows the authors to identify the effects of pay inequalityseparately on high earners and on low earners. The key nding is that when coworker productivity is hard to observe, introduc- ing pay inequality reduces output by 0.45 standard deviations, driven largely by an18-percentage point reduction in attendance. Somewhat surprisingly, while the re-duction is largest for the workers who are paid the least in their group, even thosereceiving the high or medium pay reduce their attendance, suggesting that pay in- equality makes the workplace a less attractive environment. Overall, workers appear to give up 9% of their earnings to avoid a workplace where they are paid differentlythan their peers. Interestingly, these negative effects on worker morale vanish if thewage inequality is more clearly justied: when output is more observable, or when coworkers' baseline productivity levels are further apart, pay disparity does not re- duce output. Kaur ( 2019) and Breza et al. ( 2018a, 2018b) help explain why even decentralized informal markets in developing countries have high levels of nominal wage rigidityand little dispersion in wages across workers. Incentives in the public and non-prot sectors. Developing countries often have poor provision of public services such as education and health. An active area of research in development is thus on how to improve the productivity of workers in the public and allied non-prot sectors. Recent work has evaluated nancial incentivesfor performance, with mixed results. Some papers nd positive effects: for instance,nancial incentives for teachers can reduce teacher absence (Duflo et al., 2012) and improve student test scores (Muralidharan and Sundararaman, 2011). However, pro- viding incentives to multi-tasking agents is well known to be difcult (Holmstromand Milgrom, 1991). Indeed, some papers show that incentives are gamed when em- ployed, and argue they are of limited utility (Glewwe et al., 2010). Perhaps the bottom line is that such nancial incentive programs, whether effective or not, are often po- litically unpopular and are rarely adopted and scaled up by governments (Finan et al., 2017). One alternative, lower-cost strategy is to provide non-monetary incentives such as social recognition and awards. The idea is to increase and harness prosocial mo-tivation, to provide social-image or competitive motives to exert effort, and to align the worker's identity with the employer's goals. Despite a great deal of interest in such interventions, and evidence that social incentives broadly matter in organizations(Ashraf and Bandiera, 2018), there is relatively little evidence on their effectiveness in the eld in poor countries, especially with the public sector or over an extendedperiod.7Labor 411 An exception is Ashraf et al. ( 2014), who compare nancial and social incen- tives for the sale of condoms by agents of a non-prot organization in Zambia. The authors nd that a simple non-monetary incentive\u2014providing agents with a publicly-displayed \"thermometer\" display and awarding stars based on sales\u2014outperformseven providing them with a 90% margin on selling condoms. However, in this case,even the largest nancial incentives were modest, given the low cost and demand forthe condoms. It is unclear what role the prosocial nature of the task played in mak-ing the thermometer display effective. More research remains to be done on whethersuch non-monetary incentives are more broadly effective, on which types of suchincentives are most promising, and what the underlying mechanisms are. The samechallenges with providing incentives to multi-tasking agents that apply to nancial incentives will also likely apply to non-monetary incentives. Crowd-out of intrinsic motivation. One question that has garnered much interest in both development policymaking and in behavioral research is whether extrinsicincentives crowd out intrinsic motivations. Influential lab evidence from social psy- chology has shown that extrinsic rewards canreduce individuals' intrinsic motivation to do a task. A famous paper by Deci ( 1971) shows that after a temporary incentive for solving puzzles in the lab is withdrawn, effort in a subsequent unincentivized round islower than in a group where incentives were never offered to begin with. Several labexperiments provide similar evidence of crowd-out of intrinsic motivation, and theo-retical work in economics provides potential explanations for this phenomenon: e.g.incentives can signal information such as task difculty and extrinsic rewards canmuddy the self- or social-signaling value of a prosocial task (B\u00e9nabou and Tirole,2003, 2006). Yet, there is little eld evidence that extrinsic incentives crowd out intrinsic mo- tivation substantially. 33Lacetera et al. ( 2013) review eld studies on incentives for blood donation\u2014an example of a prosocial task in which policy makers are con-cerned about potential crowd-out\u2014and conclude that in 18 out of 19 cases, providingincentives increase donation, without evidence of long-run reductions in donationsif incentives are removed. Some papers also nd that more pro-socially motivatedworkers respond more to nancial incentives, perhaps due to the correlations of pro- sociality and other omitted variables in the underlying population (e.g. Ashraf et al., 2014). Overall, there seems little reason to think that extrinsic incentives systematically crowd out intrinsic motivation in practice in real-world situations. This result is rel-evant, for instance, for the ongoing policy debate about whether community healthworkers should be paid more. In the following section, we describe evidence thatpaying higher wages does not generally lead to increased select of less prosocialworkers. 33An exception is Gneezy and Rustichini ( 2000), who nd that introducing a small ne for late pickup of children from day-care centers in Israel increased the incidence of late pick-ups.412 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics Gift exchange. Incentives are often limited in real-world workplaces, particularly when output is multi-dimensional or hard to measure (Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1991). Theories in labor and behavioral economics suggest that workers' identities,alignment with the employers' missions, and their social preferences towards theiremployers may all play an important motivating role (Akerlof and Kranton, 2005; Besley and Ghatak, 2005). The theory of gift exchange argues that employers can benet by paying workers above market wages, since workers may respond byworking harder, even absent repeated-game motives (Akerlof, 1982). A recent eld- experimental literature in behavioral economics uses one-shot employment oppor-tunities to evaluate whether workers reciprocate by working harder (or less hard)when employers surprise them with higher (or lower) pay. The ndings are mixed,with recent studies mostly nding small, if any, gift-exchange effects, particularlyin response to pay increases (Gneezy and List, 2006; DellaVigna et al., 2016; Esteves-Sorenson, 2017). Two recent eld studies from developing countries study gift-exchange in en- tirely natural settings in real organizations, although with repeated-game incentives in play, since they consider long-term employment relationships. Both studies nd little evidence of gift exchange. de Ree et al. ( 2018) conduct a large-scale random- ized experiment with a representative sample of schools in Indonesia and nd that adoubling of base pay for teachers led to no improvement in measures of teacher effort or student learning. Jayaraman et al. ( 2016) study a government-induced contract change for tea pick- ers in an Indian plantation. For most workers, the contract changes led to increasedbase pay with constant or reduced piece-rate incentives. The authors nd that, inthe rst month after the more generous contract is introduced, output increases by20 to 80%. Yet, this effect dissipates over subsequent months, and eventually outputis reduced below the original level. The results are consistent with an initial \"behav- ioral\" response, but a longer-run adjustment to the neoclassical prediction. This result highlights one benet of studying incentives and wages in the eld with longer-runstudies, even at the risk of failing to isolate precise mechanisms. 7.4Selection of workers Given the lack of incentives, and often even accountability, in the public sector in de-veloping countries, there has been a great deal of policy interest in selecting prosocialand intrinsically motivated workers into the public sector. The optimal selection ofworkers for the public sector, or for other pro-socially oriented professions, has beena subject of a recent eld-experimental literature in development economics. One question has been whether offering higher wages, which might attract more talented workers, will negatively select on the prosocial motivation of workers. DalB\u00f3 et al. ( 2013) work with the Mexican federal government to randomize wage offers across 167 municipalities to ll 350 positions. Applicants complete a battery of testsof ability, personality traits and prosocial motivations. The authors nd that higher wage offers attract a higher-ability applicant pool in terms of fluid intelligence, better7Labor 413 personality traits, and experience. Yet this increase in applicants did not come with a cost in terms of lower public-service motivation (measured using survey questions).Ashraf et al. ( 2018) nd similar results with a eld experiment in Zambia, where they vary across locations whether job postings to recruit health workers empha-sized either career prospects or instead the possibility of helping one's community. Emphasizing career prospects led to recruiting applicants with higher high-school grades, but no lower prosocial motivation. Moreover, those recruited under the careerconcerns condition have much better job performance. In contrast, Deserranno ( 2018) nds that posting job notices with a higher implied pay attracts candidates who donate less money in dictator games, and who perceivelower social benets to the job at the time of applying. Such candidates subsequentlyhave higher turnover on the job. However, one important way this experiment differsfrom the others is that Deserranno studies applicants to an entirely new position, suchthat the advertised wages may communicate a great deal more information about theposition that will typically be the case. This feature makes it perhaps more likely thatthe theoretical mechanism of B\u00e9nabou and Tirole ( 2006) applies, but it is not clear that such an effect would persist once information about the jobs is more widelydiffused. While paying less and yet recruiting more motivated workers is no doubt an attrac- tive proposition for governments and non-prots, the bulk of the evidence suggeststhat this is unlikely to be the case. This evidence is consistent with the underlyingcorrelation of cognitive ability and pro-sociality in the population: Falk et al. ( 2018) nd in their Global Preference Survey that altruism and reciprocity are both stronglypositively correlated with cognitive ability within countries. In addition, the previoussection argued that crowd-out of intrinsic motivation is similarly not typically foundin the eld. Clearly, one should not generally expect to nd that higher wages willselect out prosocial motives. 7.5Female labor-force participation Another striking aspect of labor markets in some low-to-middle income countries isthe low rate of female labor force participation (FLFP). Only 52% of women in poor countries participate in the labor force, compared to 78% of men (Duflo, 2012b). However, there are large differences across cultures and regions. Labor force partic- ipation seems more equal by gender in sub-Saharan Africa where, in 2017, WorldBank data suggest that the labor force participation rate of women was 63%, com-pared to 74% of men (ILO, 2018). In contrast, female labor market participation is particularly low in South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. For instance, FLFP in India has hovered below30% in recent years, with some evidence of a decline since 2005, despite economicfemale education growth (Fletcher et al., 2017) .L o wF L F Pi sw o r r y i n gt op o l i c ym a k - ers, both because of the aggregate effects of likely misallocation of talented women(Hsieh et al., 2018) and because working outside the home increases female empow- erment (Heath and Jayachandran, 2016).414 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics Why is female labor-force participation so low in some countries? A standard eco- nomic answer would involve gender specialization in home and wage work, possibly due to biological reasons such as women's role in childbearing and nursing. How-ever, standard economic answers do not explain much of the variation in FLFP, evenconditional on GDP per capita. A literature in cultural economics, described also in Section 9below, provides evidence on the historical roots of FLFP. And two recent papers in behavioral economics provide evidence of specic behavioral mechanisms which depress FLFP. Self-efcacy. McKelway ( 2018) studies internal psychological constraints on women's employment in India. She implements a eld experiment with women and their families in partnership with a large rm which offers employment opportunities to women. The key treatment is an intervention to increase women's self-efcacy\u2014beliefs in one's own ability to attain one's desired outcomes. The author nds largeand sustained increases in women's employment due to the treatment. In a secondexperiment, the author randomizes job offers to women, and nds that receiving a joboffer increases self-efcacy months later. Thus, living in a setting with low femalelabor-force participation may reduce women's self-efcacy, which in turn depressed women's employment. Social norms. Bursztyn et al. ( 2018) provide evidence for the importance of social norms in suppressing female labor force participation in Saudi Arabia. The authors show that most young married men in Saudi Arabia privately support women workingoutside the home. However, these men underestimate the level of such support amongsimilar men in their neighborhoods. Correcting these beliefs\u2014that is, informing men about the true rates of private support\u2014causes men to become substantially more likely to sign their wives up for a job-search service. Four months after this intervention, the wives of treated men are more likely to have applied and interviewed for jobs outside the home. The paper thus providesevidence that social norms may suppress female labor force participation, and howthose norms may remain sticky, since individuals who support the taboo behaviormay be hesitant to reveal their views to others for fear of social sanction. However, it is not clear if there are many such situations in which second-order beliefs are biased. For instance, men in conservative communities in India might well be accurate inthinking that their neighbors will judge them harshly if their wives work outside thehome. Measuring such second-order beliefs systematically in areas where norms maybe important could be a promising avenue for future research. While the above two studies provide careful evidence on specic mechanisms constraining FLFP, they do not in themselves explain variation in FLFP across soci- eties. Preferences and cultural transmission might play an important role. Fernandez and Fogli ( 2009) show that the labor supply decisions of second-generation American women depend on the FLFP rates in the country of familial origin, despite presentlyfacing the same economic environment. This result suggests a role for cultural trans-mission of attitudes or values regarding FLFP. Alesina et al. (2011) show that regionswith a history of the use of the plough in agriculture\u2014in which men had a compara-tive advantage\u2014are associated with more gender inequality in present-day attitudes,8Firms 415 and with less female participation in the labor force. Thus, at least to some extent, FLFP appears to be driven by sticky cultural and preference factors. 8Firms Behavioral economics investigates how individual decision-making, preferences, and beliefs systematically depart from standard economic models. It is thus not surprisingthat even behavioral industrial organization (Heidhues and Koszegi, 2018) has mostly assumed sophisticated, prot-maximizing rms responding to behavioral consumers. Is it reasonable to assume that rms successfully maximize prots? There are numerous justications for this assumption. First, one longstanding argument fortreating rms as neoclassical actors is that market forces should weed out rms thatsystematically deviate from prot-maximizing behavior. Therefore, at equilibrium,surviving rms will be prot-maximizers. Second, applying the same argument to competition within rms and building on Lucas's ( 1978) span of control model, even if a signicant share of individuals exhibits behavioral biases, individuals without such biases may rise to become the key managers and decision-makers in rms. In contrast, workers with particularly severe behavioral biases might get red. Of course, forms of principal-agent problemswithin rms can attenuate this advantageous selection. Third, many important decisions in large rms are made jointly by several actors and often under intense scrutiny by stakeholders and the company's board, potentiallylimiting the scope for persistent mistakes, to the extent that groups are more rationalthan individuals (Cooper and Kagel, 2005; Charness and Sutter, 2012; Kugler et al., 2012). Moreover, workers typically receive considerable training and operate withinstructures that are designed to limit the impact of behavioral factors. 8.1Are rms in developing countries more \"behavioral\"? Given these arguments, there are several reasons to think that rms in developingcountries are more likely to deviate from the neoclassical benchmark than rms in rich countries. First, competitive pressures may be lower in poor countries. Imports are often restricted by high tariffs and the entry of new rms as well as the expansionof existing rms may be restricted for various reasons including nancing constraints,agency problems, and regulations. High travel costs, especially in rural areas, meanthat buyers may have only a limited number of rms available to choose from, pro-viding rms with some amount of local monopoly power. Prices are sometimes xedby manufacturers, preventing price competition. State ownership of large enterprisesin countries such as India and China, weak anti-trust regulations and a higher impor-tance of political connections, cronyism, and corruption may also contribute to lowerlevels of competitiveness in developing countries. Second, rms in developing economies are small. Hsieh and Olken ( 2014) nd that about 90 percent of rms in Mexico employ less than 10 workers. In India and416 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics Indonesia, the corresponding number is close to 100 percent. This rm distribution is in sharp contrast to rich countries (Tybout, 2000). Thus, rms in poor countries involve a limited span of control: decisions are often made by one person only, the owner-operator. There is little scope for within-rm competition that might cause non-behavioral agents to rise to the top of the rm via an efcient selection process. Nor are rm owners necessarily highly selected. As described in the previous section, self-employment rates are much higher in poor than in rich countries: a large share of individuals operate some sort of rm. A classic theme in development economics is the lack of separation between household economics and rm economics for smallholder farmers. Under the condi-tions for the separation theorem, family labor supply or risk preferences of household members would not affect the type of agricultural production chosen. In reality, they seem to have an impact (e.g., Lopez, 1984; Grimard, 2000;L e , 2010). Given this nd- ing in development economics, it is only natural to expect that behavioral factors, likeother household factors, would have important impacts on production in family-runrms. Behavioral issues might also be particularly powerful due to limited training and education, and limited potential to learn from co-workers or to receive on-the-job training. While new workers in a large rm are thoroughly instructed and trained, such training does not exist in small rms in developing countries. Few owner- operators have much business-training or adequate schooling, such that making opti- mal decisions might be more challenging. Some factors instead point in the opposite direction. One might argue that be- havioral issues are less likely to have bite since the stakes are a lot higher for self-employed individuals and owners of small rms\u2014their consumption is directly tied to prots. Moreover, within any given marketplace in Kenya or India, one can often observe many seemingly identical retail shops that offer nearly identical products, suggesting high levels of local competition. Yet, none of these shops appear to grow rapidly and few go out of business. Nor do behavioral issues only matter for smalldecisions: even high-stakes decisions such as retirement savings choices or decisions to take one's potentially life-saving medications seem to involve behavioral biases, as described in other chapters in this handbook. Moreover, some behavioral factors such as present bias and loss aversion could have more bite precisely because rm prots and individual consumption are so intimately linked. The topic of behavioral rms departs from an emphasis on the classic behavioral biases such as present bias, loss aversion, etc. By \"behavioral rms\", we simply meanrms that depart from prot-maximization in systematic ways. We do not yet have enough research on this to be sure if these cases are due to the same psychological factors studied in consumer behavior or if other biases and behavioral phenomena are more relevant in the case of rm decision-making. Almost surely, limited attention, salience, failures of Bayesian learning, and self-control issues can matter for rms too.8Firms 417 8.2Behavioral rms: evidence and applications Once we start considering rm decision-making, many unexplored and potentially important areas of research arise. Trust, rm structure, and missing rm growth. Behavioral economics may provide some insights into why rms in developing countries are small and typically run as a family business with little decentralization in decision-making. Standard ex- planations for small rms include taxation, regulation (e.g. labor regulation), and predation. While these factors may well play some role, many rms are even smaller than these thresholds (e.g. Hsieh and Olken, 2014), suggesting there may be addi- tional reasons for rms to fail to grow. Credit constraints again likely play some role, but even with incomplete credit markets, protable rms should grow over time andincrease their market share. Low levels of trust may play an important role in keeping rms small is. As de- scribed in detail in Section 9, developing countries have systematically lower levels of social trust than rich countries (Falk et al., 2018). Lower levels of trust have been shown to be associated with smaller rm sizes and less decentralization of decisions made within rms, both between and within countries (Cingano and Pinotti, 2012; Algan and Cahuc, 2014). Non-Western countries are also more likely to have moral values emphasizing the importance loyalty to one's group and respect for authority (Haidt, 2012). This in turn might make rm owners less likely to hire or cooperate with out-group members, and less likely to decentralize decision-making, potentiallyinhibiting rm growth. Moreover, these differences are driven at least in part by deep historical factors (Enke, 2018; Schulz et al., 2018), and might thus causally explain variation in rm size across countries. This argument echoes an existing literature on agency issues in rms in devel- oping countries. Ilias ( 2006) argues that some managers decide to hire only family members as an organizational way of dealing with agency costs. Consistent with thishypothesis, Ilias shows that there is a positive relationship between family size and rm size in the surgical-instrument industry in Pakistan. Firm founders with more brothers (and therefore a larger pool of potential managers) end up with larger rms. Similarly, Bertrand et al. ( 2008) study 93 large business families in Thailand and nd a positive relationship between family size and family involvement in the company.When the founder dies, sons play a larger role in the company, and their increased involvement following the founder's death is associated with lower rm-level perfor- mance. The authors' interpretation of these results is that the sons engage in a \"race to the bottom\" to tunnel out company resources. Bloom et al. ( 2013), discussed below, argue that the mid-sized rms they study were constrained from taking up high-return management practices due to a lack of management time. They implicate a low level of trust: rm owners do not trust non-family members to make important decisions or occupy important managerial418 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics slots. Managerial human capital even in these relatively large rms in India is thus constrained by the number of male children in the owner's family.34 Objective function. Standard producer theory assumes that a rm's goal is to max- imize expected prots. When rms are instead run as a small (family) business, theobjective function of the rm might be quite different. For instance, the owner's riskpreferences likely matter, making risk-neutrality and thus expected-prot maximiza-tion not a safe assumption. Firm owner-operators might not even desire growth, giventhe increased effort and lifestyle changes rm growth might entail. Their objectivesmay include providing employment to their family or descendants. They may operatemicroenterprises as a coping strategy to diversify risk, given the potential for shocksto other sources of household income such as agricultural output (e.g., Adhvaryuet al., 2016). Yet, at present, we have a limited understanding of what the actual objectives of rm-owners in developing countries are and the extent to which thepreferences and skills of household members affect rm decisions. Pricing. Firms might make suboptimal pricing or product choices. They may have trouble estimating consumer demand accurately, leading to suboptimal pricing orproduct choices. Even if rms perfectly understand demand, they might deviate fromoptimal pricing decisions. Recent work has begun to document substantial failuresof prot-maximization among even large and highly sophisticated rms in rich coun- tries. For instance, DellaVigna and Gentzkow ( 2017) show that a large grocery-store chain in the US prices its products uniformly within large geographical zones, despite substantial variation in the incomes of shoppers across stores. The authors calculatethat the rm gives up 7% of prot by failing to price optimally. Given that such largerms US chains leave plenty of money on the table by making suboptimal pricingchoices, it seems worth scrutinizing rms' pricing choices in developing countries.To the best of our knowledge, no such studies exist. Inventory management. A recent literature has begun to point to examples of small- business owners in developing countries leaving protable investments unexploited.Kremer et al. (2013) show that many shopkeepers in rural Kenya fail to make small inventory investments with high expected returns. First, shopkeepers often fail to takeadvantage of bulk-purchase discounts from distributors. A considerable mass of in-ventory purchase orders is for quantities which fall just below thresholds at whichadditional discounts kick in. In addition, shops frequently experience stock-outs dueto not maintaining enough inventory, even for relatively low-price goods which canbe purchased in small increments, such as phone cards. The correlation of returns toinventory across goods is also low, suggesting that shopkeepers may not be equal-izing marginal returns to inventory across goods. Inventory levels are predicted bysmall-stakes risk aversion displayed by the owners in a lab game, as well as by their math skills, but not by their self-reported credit constraints. 34This example provides another illustration of the inefciencies caused by the norms against female labor-force participation.8Firms 419 Beaman et al. ( 2014) provide another example of small rms failing to maxi- mize prots. They show that a representative sample of micro-enterprises in two Kenyan cities lose 5-8% of total prots for a surprisingly simple reason: they failto keep enough change on hand to break larger bills, and thus lose potential sales tocustomers. The authors study 508 typically small rms, with 60% having just one worker, the owner. The rms include a variety of businesses, from vegetable vendors to furniture shops, and service providers such as small restaurants, repair shops, andbarbers. Simply drawing rms' attention to the frequency of \"change-outs\" and lost sales\u2014through a randomized information intervention, or simply by asking themquestions about it\u2014led to a reduction in change-outs and an increase in sales andprots. This result parallels Hanna et al.'s ( 2014) results on inattention and technol- ogy adoption: rms may not think that change-outs are important, and they thus fail to attend to them. But once their attention is drawn to the neglected factor, or if they are directly provided with the summary information, they make the high-return in-vestment. If the change-outs were instead due to other (rational) factors such as anaversion to keeping cash on hand due to the risk of theft, providing information onthe frequency and cost of change-outs would not be expected to change behavior. Labor and capital choices. Firms might also deviate from prot-maximization in their labor and capital-investment decisions, although we have few direct tests of this. Adhvaryu et al. ( 2018b) show that even large rms may under-invest in worker skills: an experimentally introduced low-cost soft-skills training for workers in a large textile rm increased worker productivity by 20% without raising turnover, resultingin a large internal rate of return (over 250% over eight months). How could suchlarge returns remain unexploited by a large rm? One possibility is that the ownersand managers simply under-estimate the returns to soft skills among workers. Firms might also manage their staff inadequately, e.g. by providing suboptimal incentives to workers, by making inefcient hiring choices, or by discriminating cer- tain types of workers or by hiring their friends and family members. One suggestive example is from Abebe et al. ( 2017), who document that rms in Ethiopia do not un- derstand how skills among workers are correlated with barriers to applying to jobs.Specically, they show that a rm that provides a small monetary subsidy for peopleto apply to its open jobs attracts a more talented applicant pool than it can achieve byeven doubling the offered wage. The crucial nding from the behavioral perspectiveis that rms systematically under-estimate the effect of providing such a subsidy. Infact, managers on average expect applicant quality to decrease due to the subsidy. Finally, rms may fail to adopt the highest-return technologies, as discussed with numerous examples in Section 6, although these focus on agricultural technology adoption by small-scale farmers. Even larger rms may not adopt appropriate tech-nologies. For instance, Adhvaryu et al. ( 2018a) describe how managers of the 28 textile factories in their study largely neglected the effect of heat on worker productiv-ity, and thus undervalued LED-lighting technology. When LED lighting was adoptedto satisfy environmentally-motivated international buyers, the side-effect of reduc-ing temperatures led to substantial unanticipated increases in productivity. Similarly,420 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics Atkin et al. ( 2017) document organizational barriers to the adoption of a protable technology among soccer-ball manufacturers in Pakistan. They argue that employ- ees resist adoption of a new, more efcient technique due to fears that adoption will reduce their effective wages. Management practices. Bloom et al. ( 2013) investigate rms' management prac- tices by running a management eld experiment with large, multi-plant textile rms in India. Firms in this study receive free consulting on management practices to a treatment group of rms and nd that this intervention increases productivity by 17%in the rst year. Annual protability increased by over $300,000, and treatment rms grew faster and opened more production plants within three years. Given these large positive impacts, why had rms not already adopted these prac- tices? While in some cases rms were simply not aware of practices such as daily factory meetings, owners appeared to systematically underestimate the protability of simple and known practices such measuring quality defects, machine downtime, and inventory. Importantly, despite these failures to adopt high-return management prac- tices, control-group rms were not weeded out of the market. Competitive pressures, the authors argue, were restricted by high tariffs, credit constraints, and particularly by limited managerial time. As in DellaVigna and Gentzkow ( 2017), this paper pro- vides evidence that failures of prot-maximization are not restricted to small rms. A related paper by Bruhn et al. ( 2018) examines the impact of access to one year of management consulting services on the outcomes of small and medium enterprisesin Mexico. The authors randomly assigned enterprises that applied to receive subsi- dized consulting services to either receive the subsidized services or not. The authors nd that the consulting intervention increased owners' \"entrepreneurial spirit\" (an index that measures entrepreneurial condence and goal setting) and had positiveshort-run impacts on productivity and prots. While many of the studies described above mostly do not take a behavioral per- spective, the evidence they provide for failures of prot-maximization is compelling. Given this evidence, and given the arguments we presented for why behavioral rms are more likely to exist in developing countries, we believe that studying rm de- cisions in developing countries could be a promising new agenda for behavioral economics. In addition to studying standard behavioral-economic topics such as loss aversion, biased beliefs, and inattention in a new high-stakes economic setting, such an agenda might uncover new and previously understudied biases in human decision- making. Indeed, one could argue that development economics has led the way in pointing out the importance of behavioral rms, an area that may nd an increasing number of applications also to rms in rich countries. 9Social preferences, culture, and development So far in this chapter, we have considered the implications of behavioral models whiletreating the models and even parameter values as universal. In the remaining two sec-9Social preferences, culture, and development 421 tions, however, we describe arguments and recent evidence for systematic differences in psychology across rich and poor countries, and across rich and poor individuals. Section 9describes a literature studying differences in social preferences (such as trust and reciprocity) and culture across societies and then discusses its possible im-plications for development. Section 10describes the new literature on the psychology of poverty. These sections are more speculative, in part because the modern economics lit- erature on these topics is newer. However, some of the ideas in Section 9echo an older tradition of thought on economic development, which viewed development as a process involving important changes in social structure and in ways of thinking. We begin by briefly sketching a history of the views of human behavior implicit in thinking about development and growth. 9.1History of views of human behavior in economic development Historically, many social scientists, including classical economists, did not see hu- mans as rational and purely self-interested actors. As behavioral economists enjoy pointing out, Adam Smith anticipated much of behavioral economics (Ashraf et al., 2005).35 Prior to the emergence of modern economics, a long history of thought argued that what we now see as the process of economic development involves fundamental changes in economic psychology. Modern economists assume that rms maximize prots and individuals maximize utility across history and across societies, but for many Marxist writers, the \"icy water of egotistical calculation\" is a feature of capi- talism, not of pre-capitalist societies or of the human condition more broadly (Marx and Engels, 1848). Famously, Weber (1905) argued that modern capitalism and the pervasive role of rationality emerged historically in response to changes in ways ofthinking induced by Protestantism. Modernization theory, prominent in the 1950s, influenced by Weber and Durkheim, drew a distinction between \"traditional\" and \"modern\" societies, includ- ing differences between societies based on achievement versus societies based on birth; orientation towards the nuclear family versus extended kinship ties; individu- alism versus communal orientation; relations based on tradition and loyalty versus those based on rational exchange. Proponents of modernization theory thought that people in traditional societies are not necessarily motivated by the rational calcula- tion of self-interest of their modern counterparts. The process of modernization was thought of as a process of dramatic change in social structures, but also in ways of thinking. For instance, McClelland ( 1961) emphasized the \"need for achievement\" 35In his Theory of Moral Sentiments , Smith argued that behavior was determined by the struggle between what Smith termed the \"passions\" and the \"impartial spectator.\" The passions included drives, emotions, and motivational feeling. Smith viewed behavior as under the direct control of the passions but believed that people could override passion-driven behavior by viewing their own behavior from the perspective of an outsider\u2014the impartial spectator (Ashraf et al., 2005).422 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics as a psychological characteristic that was key to entrepreneurial activity and modern- ization, and Inkeles and Smith ( 1974) dened uniquely \"modern\" personality traits. After the 1950s and 1960s, modernization theory fell out of favor. In economics, Schultz (1964) argued that those in developing countries are \"poor but efcient\".36 In this view, homo economicus did not need to be created; he or she was there all along. Whereas development experts influenced by modernization theory may have seen farmers as irrationally clinging to outdated farming techniques because of an attachment to tradition and may have favored coercion or heavy subsidies to encour- age adoption of new techniques, modern development economists began with the assumption that farmers knew what they were doing. Economists studying growth and development also reacted against cultural ex- planations for differences in economic development across societies that seemed unfalsiable and therefore unscientic in the cross section, and that later turned out to be false once a longer panel data emerged: India was thought to be stuck with a low \"Hindu rate of growth\" while China's development was said to be held back by Confucian traditions (as described in Acemoglu and Robinson, 2013). In part as a reaction to this sort of claim, development economists perhaps went to the opposite extreme of presuming that people in developing countries (and else- where) are fully rational homo economicus . If Weber argued that farmers in tradi- tional societies were irrational and stuck with traditional techniques even when this was not protable, modern development economists responded by demonstrating that farmers changed their behavior in response to prices. Yet, such evidence is far from showing that farmers are fully rational or are quantitatively (and sometimes even qualitatively) well-described by standard neoclassical theory. In the past two decades, with the rise of behavioral economics, the pendulum has begun to swing back towards a more psychologically-realistic view of human behav- ior in development economics. Development economists have increasingly incorpo- rated systematic departures from pure rationality and self-interest while approaching substantive questions in development. Crucially, this approach has involved rigorous empirical tests of the underlying behavioral ideas. Perhaps the clearest sign of the new openness of development economics to ideas from behavioral economics was the publication in 2015 of the World Bank's flagship annual World Development Report, \" Mind, Society, and Behavior \", with the theme of behavioral development economics. A key difference between behavioral development economics and the older modernization-theory literature, however, is that the behavioral economics literaturehas mostly focused on universal features of human behavior, rather than on variation across individuals or societies. Recent work in cultural economics and behavioral economics, however, has begun to explore variation across societies. The rest of this section describes this new literature. 36Modernization theory also fell out of favor in sociology, but for somewhat different reasons: it was criticized as conflating features of Western society with necessary requirements for development, and was subject to criticism with the rise of dependency theory.9Social preferences, culture, and development 423 9.2Differences in social preferences across societies Behavioral economists and psychologists have argued that in addition to being moti- vated by private consumption, people have numerous social and moral motives. For instance, they often care about others' outcomes, by being altruistic (placing a posi- tive weight on others' utility) or envious (placing a negative weight on others' utility). Individuals care about the fairness of outcomes and processes, such as by preferring to split unearned money in a dictator game equally with a recipient. They care whatothers think of them, for both instrumental and hedonic reasons, and thus have social image motives. They care that others act fairly and mean well, and may incur a cost to punish others who misbehave or hurt them, an example of negative reciprocity. Peo- ple also care about conforming to social norms regarding appropriate behavior and may internalize these norms such that they are influenced by them even in private. The above broad set of frequently powerful motives have been termed social preferences in the behavioral economics literature. While these preferences may have evolved for functional reasons\u2014for example, negative reciprocity may have evolved because it helps sustain cooperation in repeated interactions\u2014the experi- mental economics literature suggests that these motives are now \"hard-wired\" andpartly unconscious rather than being simply deliberate strategic behavior. For exam- ple, individuals share money with anonymous recipients in a dictator game, even in the absence of repeated interactions or any role for reputation effects. We next discuss certain aspects of social preferences which may differ systemat- ically across societies, and which have been argued to matter for economic develop- ment. Trust and reciprocity. Trust can be broadly dened as willingness to cooperate with others. Conceptually, trust is a somewhat complex concept, involving both beliefs (particularly beliefs about whether the other party is trustworthy) as well as prefer- ences (such as \"warm glow\" from the act of cooperating, and altruism towards the other party), and potentially norms towards appropriate behavior. Reciprocity is the tendency to reward someone who cooperated or was generous (positive reciprocity), and to punish someone who defected or behaved poorly (negative reciprocity). Bothtrust and reciprocity are considered key ingredients for generating cooperative behav- ior, especially in situations requiring cooperation with those outside one's immediate family or kin group (Henrich et al., 2010a). Multiple pieces of evidence suggest that developing countries have lower levels of trust and reciprocity than rich countries. First, cross-country survey evidence from sources such as the World Values Sur- vey shows substantial variation across countries in levels of self-reported generalizedtrust in others. Generalized trust is trust towards other members of society (rather than trust towards close family or friends), including trust towards one's neighbors, co-ethnics, fellow citizens, and even trust in strangers and foreigners. 37An influential 37In surveys, generalized trust is measured with questions such as \"Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you can't be too careful in dealing with people?\"424 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics body of work shows that such measures of trust (and trustworthiness) are correlated with per-capita income and institutional features of countries: poorer countries andregions have lower levels of trust (e.g. LaPorta et al., 1997; Knack and Keefer, 1997; Tabellini, 2010). Some economists view survey measures as unreliable and prefer incentivized or revealed-preference outcomes. An innovative early paper by a team of anthropolo-gists and behavioral economists ran incentivized social-preference lab experiments in 15 small-scale societies across the world (Henrich et al., 2001). The authors report considerable variation across these societies in play in dictator games, ultimatum games, and public-goods games, although in each case outcomes deviate from self- interested choices without social preferences or fairness concerns. The author point to a correlation in their results between the degree of market integration (at the societylevel) and greater cooperation in experimental games. More recently, using the Global Preference Survey (GPS), a dataset covering 80,000 respondents who constitute nationally-representative samples from 76 coun-tries, Falk et al. ( 2018) nd systematic differences across countries in measures of social preferences. Specically, the authors nd that developing countries have lowerlevels of both trust and reciprocity. However, variation within countries substantially exceeds variation between countries. Moreover, the measure of patience is more predictive of per-capita GDP than measures of trust and social preferences, and con-trolling for patience makes the coefcient on trust non-signicant in a regression onper-capita GDP. 38 It is worth noting that there need be nothing irrational about low levels of trust. To establish some failure of rationality, one would need to show, for example, sys-tematically biased beliefs about how trustworthy others are, and separate this fromdifferences in preferences. Differences in societies across trust could, for example, be driven by differences in history or institutions or could simply reflect multiple equi- libria (e.g. Aghion et al., 2010, 2011; Alesina and Giuliano, 2015). We are not aware of systematic evidence on this question. Moral attitudes. In addition to the standard notions of social preferences in behav- ioral economics such as altruism, fairness, reciprocity, and social image concerns,psychologists have in recent years expanded our understanding of moral prefer- ences. Such authors point out that psychology has focused excessively on WEIRD\u2014Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic\u2014populations (Henrich et al., 2010b). In such populations, morality is conceptualized as being primarily about harm and fairness. Outside of these populations, for example, in developing coun-tries, and in less-educated and lower-income populations in rich countries, moralattitudes are broader than these two principles (Haidt, 2012). These conceptions of morality include not only harm and fairness, but also deeply-held beliefs in moralideals of loyalty to one's group, respect for authority, and purity or sanctity. Haidt 38As discussed in Section 2, some of the correlation between GDP and measured patience could be due to liquidity constraints affecting the measures of patience, even for hypothetical choices.9Social preferences, culture, and development 425 (2012) argues that these beliefs are extremely important to people and correlate with important political and social behaviors. The implications of these different moral frameworks for economic and political behavior are ripe for exploration. Culture. A recent literature in economics takes an even broader view of cross-society variation in values, beliefs and social preferences. Guiso et al. ( 2006) dene culture as \"those customary beliefs and values that ethnic, religious, and social groups transmit fairly unchanged from generation to generation\". Nunn ( 2012) instead denes culture as heuristics and rules of thumb that aid in decision making, with a role not just forvalues and beliefs, but also for emotions and \"gut feelings\". Nunn ( 2012) summarizes the evidence on differences in culture across soci- eties. One empirical strategy has been to compare individuals from different culturesbrought into the same environment. For instance, Fernandez and Fogli ( 2009)s h o w that the fertility and labor-force participation of second-generation US women is pos- itively correlated with historical fertility and labor-force participation in their parents' country-of-origin. Fisman and Miguel ( 2007) study national variation in a culture of corruption by documenting differences in rates of unpaid parking tickets accumulated by diplomats from different countries who are all stationed in New York City. Another strategy has been to conduct similar economic lab experiments across different societies, such as the work of Henrich et al. ( 2001) or Gneezy et al. ( 2009). More commonly, survey evidence has been used to document differences across countries in the stated importance to the respondent of family, the importance of children showing obedience and respect, the role of hard work versus luck in suc- cess, or the degree to which people prefer to be self-reliant versus integrating closelywith a group (Alesina and Giuliano, 2015). 9.3Do social preferences and culture matter for development? Since at least the work of Baneld ( 1958), Coleman (1990), and Putnam ( 2000), social scientists have argued that trust plays a crucial role in generating desirable eco- nomic outcomes. More generally, achieving cooperation\u2014including with strangers and in one-shot interactions\u2014is often argued to be central to the process of devel-opment (Algan and Cahuc, 2014). In economics, an understanding of incomplete contracts and imperfect enforcement has led some scholars to agree. For instance,Arrow (1972) emphasized the importance of trust as follows: \"virtually every com-mercial transaction has within itself an element of trust, certainly any transaction conducted over a period of time. It can be plausibly argued that much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual condence.\" This idea is consistent with the cross-country correlations described above: trust and reciprocity are positively correlated with economic outcomes. However, onemight worry that trust is simply a consequence of development. Poor countries tendto have worse contract enforcement and legal institutions, and thus it may simply be rational to distrust others more in poor countries. The process of development and growth might in turn strengthen state capacity and improve contract enforcement,thus increasing trust.426 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics In recent years, some scholars of long-run growth and of cultural economics have argued that trust and related social attitudes are not only an outcome of development, but are instead (at least in part) deeper drivers of development themselves.39 One body of work provides evidence that modern-day trust and related concepts such as trustworthiness have deep historical roots. Nunn and Wantchekon ( 2011) show that current differences in trust levels within Africa can be traced back to thetransatlantic and Indian Ocean slave trades, and that individuals who have ancestorsfrom areas that were heavily raided through the slave trade show lower levels of trustin survey data. This evidence provides a potential mechanism to explain the largedifferences in modern-day development across the same regions of Africa (Nunn,2008). Other scholars have pointed to the importance of historical kindship structure in generating variation in modern-day culture. Enke ( 2018) shows that historical tight- ness of kinship structure predicts modern-day moral attitudes and social behaviors.Enke classies societies by whether they historically had tighter kinship structures,in which people were deeply embedded in extended family networks, or converselylooser kinship structures, in which such extended family networks were less impor- tant. Groups which historically had tighter kinship have lower levels of trust, more in-group favoritism, higher willingness to cheat on and distrust outsiders, and morelocal rather than broader institutions today. Schulz et al. (2018) argue that this psychological variation arose as a response to different institutions governing kinship, descent and marriage. They propose thatthe Catholic Church's policies led to the dissolution of traditional kinship institutions in Europe, creating the specic modern-day psychology specic to Western coun- tries, including the increased importance of impartiality, universal moral principles,generalized trust, cooperation, and fairness. The above evidence suggests that present-day levels of trust, social preferences and culture more broadly are not entirely determined by present-day outcomes, mak-ing a causal role for trust on development more plausible. Other work more directly attempts to link trust causally to economic outcomes. Algan and Cahuc ( 2010)u s ea n ingenious approach to determine historical levels of trust in various countries. They examine trust levels in present-day individuals in the United States and, using varia-tion in when the ancestors of those individuals rst immigrated to the US, infer thelevels of trust in the sending country at the time of immigration. Algan and Cahuc (2010) make a key assumption, well-accepted in cultural eco- nomics, that present-day trust among individuals is correlated with the trust levelsof their ancestors. Moreover, they assume that the nature of selection into migrationby trust does not change substantially over time. The authors then relate the inferredlevel of trust in each sender country in a given year to income-per-capita in that coun-try in that year and estimate substantial causal effects of trust on per-capita income. 39Recent reviews of this literature include Algan and Cahuc ( 2014), Spolaore and Wacziarg (2013)a n d Nunn (2012).9Social preferences, culture, and development 427 In subsequent work, Algan and Cahuc ( 2014) calculate that Africa would have a 5.5 times higher per-capita income if it had the same trust levels as Sweden (Algan and Cahuc, 2014). Discussing the determinants and impact of ethnic diversity on economic, political and social outcomes is beyond the scope of this chapter, but it is worth noting that some studies using micro data suggest that, at least in some circumstances, there may be costs to diversity. Moreover, these costs may be context dependent and subject to policy influence. Hjort ( 2014) examines how inter-group preferences can affect output. He collects data from a large flower farm in Kenya and shows that workers have strong social preferences featuring an in-group bias: they act to increase the payoffs of their co- ethnics relative to members of a rival ethnic group. Workers work in small teams ofthree, with one upstream worker and two downstream workers in each team. Hjort (2014) shows that upstream workers distort their effort and direct more of the inter- mediate goods they produce towards their co-ethnics downstream, resulting in both productivity losses of 4 to 8 percent and lower earnings even for themselves. Thesedistortions worsen when ethnic divisions become more salient after electoral vio- lence, until the rm nally reacts by adoption a team-pay scheme which eliminates incentives to discriminate. The paper thus also provides an illustration of how insti-tutions (in this case, within-rm rules and incentives) can be adapted to reduce thedistortions arising from ethnic preferences. Ethnic diversity is also associated with worse local public goods. For instance, higher ethnic diversity is correlated with lower primary school funding and worseschool facilities in Kenya (Miguel and Gugerty, 2005). The authors argue that di- versity makes it more difcult to impose social sanctions, creating collective action failures. However, as discussed in Section 9.4below, such effects are not found in Tanzania, a country with a history of policies designed to reduce ethnic conflict. Not all the evidence suggests substantial individual-level ethnic prejudice. For in- stance, Berge et al. ( 2015) run lab experiments in a large sample of participants in Nairobi, Kenya, and nd no evidence of ethnic favoritism in dictator games, public- goods games, and choose-your-dictator games, in which the participant can choosewhich other individual must decide how to share some money with them. Intriguingly, Berge et al. do nd evidence of bias among recent movers to Nairobi, suggesting that living in a more cosmopolitan urban setting, with frequent interaction across eth-nic groups, may have played some role in reducing ethnic preferences. In contrastto the overall null effects on behaviors, the authors detect a small amount of ethnic \"bias\" in Implicit Association Tests. 40The incongruence in the ndings on behaviors and implicit associations echoes with an ongoing debate in social psychology over whether IATs meaningfully predict real-world behaviors (Greenwald et al., 2009; Oswald et al., 2013). 40The Implicit Associate Test (IAT) is a test developed by social psychologists to measure the extent to which certain categories (such as race or gender) are associated with stereotypes, or with generally positive or negative valence (Greenwald et al., 1998).428 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics Low levels of trust and the structure of in-group versus out-group preferences may also be related to several other important economic and political outcomes. For instance, some evidence suggests that levels of trust predict the structure ofrms: higher trust in Italian regions predicts larger rm size and more decentral-ized decision-making (Cingano and Pinotti, 2012). Firms in Asia are substantially more centralized in terms of decision-making than rms in the United States or Eu-rope and the extent of centralization is correlated with regional trust. (Bloom et al., 2012). Similarly, a sense of duty towards family and kin, and a lack of trust towards strangers may contribute to a culture of corruption and patronage in politics. 9.4The impact of contact and policies on social preferences and norms The previous discussion suggested that differences in social preferences and culture are driven at least in part by long-run historical factors. Should cultural differences and social trust or conversely social divisions therefore be thought of as xed andimmune to policy? Recent research suggests that at least some of these factors aremalleable. Policy-relevant factors such as social contact, media exposure, and educa-tion can all affect social preferences. Inter-group contact. A recent body of work in economics and psychology has pro- vided rigorous tests of Allport's ( 1954) prediction that inter-group contact will (at least under certain favorable conditions) reduce social prejudice and improve socialbehavior. Rao ( 2018) shows that the integration of rich and poor children in schools reduces social discrimination and increases willingness to socialize. Additionally, contactwith poor children increases rich children's generosity towards others in both the lab(measuring using dictator games) and the eld (volunteering for charities in school).Finally, it increases the strength of fairness preferences: rich students integrated withpoor classmates become more inequity-averse in lab games. Corno et al. (2018) ndsimilar reductions in racial prejudice using randomized roommate assignments ofuniversity students in South Africa, as do Boisjoly et al. ( 2006) in a university in the United States. Lowe ( 2018) pushes this literature forward by investigating how the precise conditions under which contact occurs improve or instead worsen prejudice and mutually-benecial economic transactions. He runs a eld experiment involving a cricket league in villages in India and shows that cooperative contact (playing onthe same team with members of a different caste) reduces caste prejudice in youngmen, while competitive contact (playing against others of a different caste) somewhatworsens attitudes. Cooperative contact also makes individuals more likely to engagein trade across caste lines and thus earn greater surplus in an innovative eld taskcreated by the author. Okunogbe ( 2018) studies the consequences of mandatory national service in Nigeria, where college graduates are required to temporarily serve in other provincesin the country. She nds that inter-ethnic exposure causes individuals to have greater9Social preferences, culture, and development 429 national pride and more positive attitudes towards Nigeria, but simultaneously in- creases the salience of one's own ethnic identity, resulting in more positive attitudestowards one's own group (but not others). These results point to the need for a nu-anced understanding of national identity and ethnic diversity: it is possible to buildnational identity without weakening ethnic identity, even in a diverse developing country. Media. Exposure to media has been shown to be a powerful driver of change in social preferences and attitudes in developing countries. For instance, exposure to Rwandan government radio propaganda, which focused on post-genocide nation-building, decreased the salience of ethnicity and increased inter-ethnic trust (Blouin and Mukand, 2017). Most intriguingly, the authors show that individuals from treated locations become less likely to use ethnicity (Hutu versus Tutsi) to categorize individ- uals, suggesting that even the salience of ethnic categories is malleable and could beinfluenced by governments or private media. Of course, such effects cut both ways:the same media tools can effectively be used to worsen social attitudes, stoke distrust,and even incite violence (Yanagizawa-Drott, 2014). Exposure to television has also been shown to change attitudes and behaviors. La Ferrara et al. (2012) nd that telenovelas in Brazil reduce fertility for the exposedcohorts in regions with access to telenovelas. Similarly, Jensen and Oster ( 2009)s h o w evidence that the arrival of cable television in villages in India changed stated genderattitudes and some measures of behavior. In contrast to the evidence on the effects of radio and television, little rigorous evidence exists on the effect of the print media on social and economic attitudes.Similarly, the rapid adoption of social media using internet-enabled cellphones in developing countries offer another important topic for future research. Education. Education is generally shown to be positively correlated with trust and measures of prosocial preferences (e.g. Falk et al., 2018). However, we have rel- atively little causal evidence on this topic. Miguel (2004) argues that Tanzanian \"nation-building\" policies, partly implemented through school curriculum, allowedethnically diverse communities in rural Tanzania to achieve considerably better lo- cal public goods outcomes than diverse communities in the nearby Kenyan region without similar policies. School curriculum changes in China have been shown to have substantially af- fected students' political attitudes, making them more skeptical of free markets andmore supportive of Chinese governance (Cantoni et al., 2017). Algan et al. ( 2013) argued that horizontal teaching practices in school\u2014wherein students work togetherin groups\u2014builds social capital. Rao (2018) similarly showed that direct personal in- teractions between students, caused by quasi-random assignment of students to study groups, reduced discriminatory behavior towards outgroup-members even outside theclassroom. Further evidence on how education affects in-group preference and moraland social preferences is a promising area for future research. This section has described the evidence on cross-society differences in social pref- erences and other aspect of culture. It has pointed to both evidence that variation inculture has deep historical roots, but also that social preferences, beliefs and values430 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics are at least somewhat malleable at the individual level and respond to a variety of interventions. 10The psychology of poverty A recent body of work suggests that living in poverty may directly affect cognitive function and economic behaviors, thus potentially exacerbating behavioral biases and deepening poverty (Haushofer and Fehr, 2014; Schilbach et al., 2016). In this section, we discuss the emerging literature on the psychology of poverty and point to both its promises and its present shortcomings. 10.1 Scarcity In an influential book, Mullainathan and Shar ( 2013) argue that poverty impedes cognitive function by capturing people's minds with thoughts of scarcity. At any pointin time, a poor person may worry about paying their rent, their children's school fees, cellphone bills, or an adverse health shock with the potential to cause nancial ruin.Everyday events such as seeing the doctor or buying groceries are also more likely totrigger thoughts about money or cost among the poor (Shah et al., 2018). One might expect this increased focus to result in better decision-making. Models of rational inattention would predict that when the stakes are higher, which they often are for the poor, individuals will pay more attention and thus make better choices.There is some evidence in support of this theory. The poor have higher awareness ofcertain prices (Mullainathan and Shar, 2013), and they pay more attention than the rich to sales taxes (Goldin and Homonoff, 2013). They also display more consistent valuations of goods across contexts, making them less likely to display biases suchas proportional thinking in money (Shah et al., 2015). 41 However, according to Mullainathan and Shar ( 2013), while some of this at- tention is intentional and productive, much of it is not. Since cognitive capacity is limited and money-related thoughts take up some of this valuable capacity, mental\"bandwidth\" available for other tasks is reduced. As a result, they argue, poverty itselfimpedes cognitive function among the poor, degrading also the quality of decision-making and lowering productivity. 41Shah et al. ( 2015) provide examples in which lower-income individuals hew more closely to a rational model than the rich do. For instance, the poor appear to engage less in proportional thinking (Tversky and Kahneman, 1981): they report being equally willing to travel 30 minutes to save $50 off a purchase, regardless of whether the item they are purchasing costs $300, $500, or $1000. In contrast, high-incomeconsumers are more willing to spend 30 minutes to save $50 on a $300 purchase than on a $1000 purchase,a classic nding in behavioral economics (Thaler, 1985). The poor also express the same willingness to pay for an item across contexts, unlike the rich. Specically, their WTP for a beer to be consumed on abeach is the same whether the beer was purchased from a hotel or a store, while higher-income consumersreport being willing to pay more for the same beer from a hotel.10The psychology of poverty 431 Mani et al. ( 2013) provide empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis. Their study features two complementary designs: a \"lab study\" in a mall in Trenton, NJ, and a eld study with farmers in India. The lab study induces thoughts about nances bymaking individuals consider a nancial scenario and then measures cognitive func-tion using tasks developed by psychologists to measure fluid intelligence (IQ) andcognitive control. Results from four different trials show a subtle but highly intriguingpicture. Performance by rich individuals, dened as those higher than median incomein the sample, is unaffected by whether the nancial scenario concerns involve largeor small amounts of money. In contrast, when asked about the high-amount scenario,the poor perform signicantly worse compared to being asked about the low-amountscenario, suggesting that induced thoughts about money lowered their cognitive func-tion. The complementary eld study in Mani et al. ( 2013) cleverly exploits within- person variation in nancial status before and after harvest among sugarcane farmersrural India. The harvest cycle for sugarcane, a cash crop, is about 18 months andfarmers have trouble evenly spreading the resources received at harvest over the en-tire cycle, possibly due to present bias. Consequently, farmers are signicantly poorer in the months before harvest compared to the months after harvest, as reflected in be- longings pawned, outstanding loans, and reported ability to cope with ordinary bills.Farmers' cognitive performance right before harvest is signicantly worse comparedto their performance right after harvest. The authors provide evidence against compet-ing channels such as nutrition or uncertainty and conclude that poverty itself impedescognitive function. The results in Mani et al. are striking and important for several reasons. First, the estimated effects are enormous. While the effect sizes in the lab study are dif-cult to interpret, the authors argue that the differences in the eld study correspondto differences of about 10 IQ points, comparable to the impacts of losing a night ofsleep or being moderately inebriated. Lower cognitive performance is known to becorrelated with lower levels of patience and willingness to accept risk (Dohmen etal.,2010), worse job performance (Kuncel and Hezlett, 2010) and even higher mor- tality (Batty et al., 2009). If these effects translate causally into worse real-world decisions and behaviors, they could help explain puzzling behaviors among the poor,such as evidence of lower parenting effort, lower medication adherence, and food-consumption patterns. If such effects indeed exist, they may make an additional casefor the effectiveness of unconditional cash transfers, reducing hassles among the poor,or subsidizing insurance to facilitate peace of mind. There is also some, albeit disputed, inconsistently measured and hard-to-interpret evidence of differences in cognitive ability across the rich and poor, and even acrossrich and poor countries (Ervik, 2003; Palairet, 2004). Previous explanations of such differences include differences in childhood nutrition (such as iodine supplements indiet), education, and other omitted variables. In contrast, Mullainathan and Shar ( 2013) offer a new perspective: poverty it- self may lower cognitive function. In fact, in the mall study of Mani et al. ( 2013), described above, the cognitive performance of the rich and the poor was indistin-432 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics guishable from each other in the absence of the nancially-stressful question. The argument is thus not one of xed differences across individuals, but of the impor-tance of the situation of poverty. This echoes the long-running debate in psychologybetween social psychology, which argues that variation in human behavior is over-whelmingly driven by variation in the situation or context (Ross and Nisbett, 1991; Bertrand et al., 2004), and personality psychology, which argues that stable individ- ual differences in personality traits explain a great deal of variation in behavior (e.g.Borghans et al., 2008). However, important gaps and shortcomings in this promising research agenda re- main. First, the existing studies have understandable methodological limitations. Forinstance, the eld study of Mani et al. is a simple pre-post comparison without acontrol group, which raises the question of potential learning effects or time trendsexplaining the results. Second, to the best of our knowledge, neither of the two stud-ies appears to have been replicated. In a related setting, Carvalho et al. ( 2016) nd no differences in cognitive function and decision-making around paydays in the US,though this nding may be in explained by the smaller differences in nancial hard-ship before and after payday in their sample relative to those among farmers in India. Third, to date, little evidence exists of impacts on economic outcomes such as pro- ductivity, preferences, or decision-making. Ong et al. ( 2018) analyze the impacts of a debt-relief program among low-income individuals in Singapore. While the authorsnd intriguing impacts on a range of cognitive and economic outcomes, the studydoes not feature a control group, causing identication concerns similar to the onesregarding Mani et al.'s (2013) eld evidence. Bartos et al. ( 2018) measure the impact of poverty on time preferences. Experimentally-induced thoughts about poverty in-creased Ugandan farmers' impatience, as measured by their preference to consumeentertainment early and instead to delay work effort. Kaur et al. ( 2018) consider the impact of poverty on productivity in a eld exper- iment with low-income piece rate workers in rural India. The authors randomly varythe timing of wage payments to workers\u2014generating variation in the timing of cashreceipt while holding overall income xed\u2014with the payment amount correspond- ing to about 2 to 3 weeks' worth of baseline earnings. Since workers are severely cash-constrained at baseline, receiving early payments signicantly alters workers'expenditure patterns following the days of the payment. Workers reduce debt over-hang and increase food purchases. The authors interpret the early-pay intervention as changing the experienced - nancial constraints among study participants. Upon receiving their early pay, workerssignicantly increase their hourly output compared to the control group, with effectsconcentrated among poorer workers. Kaur et al. ( 2018) nd evidence of decreased attentional errors in production, suggesting improved cognition as a contributingchannel for the productivity effects. The authors argue that the impacts are not drivenby gift exchange, trust in the employer, affect, or nutrition. The results provide evi-dence that the alleviation of experienced nancial constraints may have a direct link with productivity and offer suggestive support for cognition as a channel.10The psychology of poverty 433 The effects of scarcity are most likely to translate into important real-world out- comes if people are not self-aware of such effects. Individuals in both of Mani et al.'s (2013) studies were not given a choice as to when to perform the cognitive tasks. Individuals who understand the impacts of scarcity on their decision-making might choose to make important decisions at times when they are cash-rich and thus to mitigate the impacts of scarcity. To date, there is no evidence of people's (lack of) awareness of the impacts of scarcity on their cognitive function. In an experimental study on the impact of noise on cognitive function and productivity, Dean (2018) nds near-complete na\u00efvet\u00e9 regarding impairments of cognitive function and worker productivity due to noise. 10.2 Deprivations beyond lack of money Poverty entails many other deprivations and potentially detrimental situations beyond lack of money (Schilbach et al., 2016). Perhaps most well-known among these and well-studied in the development literature, the poor are often affected by malnutrition(FAO, 2018). Another recent literature has documented that poverty and negative income shocks are associated with higher levels of stress (Haushofer and Fehr, 2014), although evidence on the effects of stress on economic decision-making is mixed atbest (Haushofer et al., 2018). However, the urban poor are also disproportionately exposed to poor sleeping conditions (Grandner et al., 2010; Patel et al., 2010) as well as environmental and noise pollution and heat (Harlan et al., 2006; Dean et al., 2018). Physical labor, lack of education and limited access to medical care also lead to higher prevalence of physical pain among the poor (Krueger and Stone, 2008; Poleshuck and Green, 2008; Case and Deaton, 2015). While rigorous evidence on the underlying causal re- lationships is scarce, poverty has also been associated with hazardous alcoholconsumption patterns and other forms of substance abuse (Neufeld et al., 2005; Subramanian et al., 2005; Patel, 2007). Moreover, poverty often entails stigma, shame, and social exclusion, which could all affect cognition and decision-making (Hall et al., 2014; Ghosal et al., 2017; Chandrasekhar et al., 2018). For each of these factors, a rich literature in psychology, medicine, and other elds has studied and often established impacts on cognitive function, decision-making,and health, mostly via experimental lab studies and observational data, as summa- rized in Dean et al. (2018). A key open question is whether the known impacts on cognition and health translate into economically meaningful effects on productivity, labor supply, and decision-making. A second line of research is whether these factors can cause behavioral biases. Behavioral economics to date has primarily shown the existence and relevance of behavioral biases, mostly focusing on average parame- ter estimates, for instance, the fraction of present-biased individuals and the average degree of present bias among those individuals. Uncovering some of the underlying sources of behavioral biases could help to identify some of the determinants of varia- tion across individuals and over time. Since the poor are disproportionately exposed by these factors, they could lead to more pronounced behavioral biases among the poor.434 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics Recently completed and ongoing work has attempted to make inroads into each of these two lines of research. Studies have found signicant impacts of noise, environ- mental pollution, nutrition on worker learning, productivity, and earnings (Schoeld,2014; Chang et al., 2018; Dean, 2018; Jagnani, 2018). Many of the poor are exposed to several of these factors, such that impacts on productivity and earning might welladd up to economically large magnitudes. There could also be important interaction effects between these factors that are yet to be explored. There is less evidence on the impacts of factors surrounding poverty on prefer- ences and decision-making. Schoeld ( 2014) nds evidence of increased nutrition on effort discounting among low-income workers in India. Sleep deprivation ap- pears to make individuals less altruistic, trusting and trustworthy (Dickinson and McElroy, 2017). Similarly, Koppel et al. ( 2017) nd that acute pain makes indi- viduals less patient and more risk-seeking. Finally, Schilbach ( 2019) nds that in- centives for sobriety signicantly increased savings among low-income drivers in India, particularly among individuals without access to commitment savings. Addi- tional evidence linking the above factors to preferences and decision-making would be valuable. In an ongoing study, Bessone et al. ( 2018) study the impacts of improving sleep- ing conditions among the urban poor in Chennai, India. They nd that study par-ticipants sleep on average under 5.5 hours per night, implying severe chronic sleep deprivation, in part due to environmental irritants such as heat, noise, mosquitoes, and physical discomfort. The authors evaluate different randomized interventions (such as improving individuals' home sleep environment and offering them a place to nap at the workplace) to investigate the impacts of improved sleep on labor market out-comes as well as behavioral biases and preferences (time, risk, and social preferences, susceptibility to defaults, and inattention). 10.3 Mental health There is mixed evidence on the relationship between poverty and mental ill-health.On the one hand, income and consumption measures do not appear to strongly correlate with mental health, even when mental health is itself measured in repre-sentative surveys, such that differential rates of diagnosis are not a factor (Das et al.,2007). However, other measures and aspects of poverty, such as food insecurity, lack of education, poor housing, and self-reported nancial stress are associated withmental ill-health in numerous epidemiological studies (Patel and Kleinman, 2003; Lund et al., 2010). Regardless of the income gradients of mental health, the prevalence of mental health conditions in developing countries is high and is paired with extremely low levels of diagnosis and treatment options, especially for the poor. For instance, In- dia has only about 0.3 psychiatrists per 100,000 individuals (3,600 psychiatrists to serve a population of 1.2 billion), compared to 12.4 per 100,000 individuals in the United States. In addition to inadequate care, mental ill-health is often associated with stigma, exclusion, and shame, further reducing the propensity to seek mental health care in times of need.10The psychology of poverty 435 Major Depressive Disorder (\"depression\") is the single leading cause of disability worldwide (Friedrich, 2017). At a global level, over 300 million people are estimated to suffer from depression, equivalent to 4.4% of the world's population. Scholars in global mental health have shown that simple psychotherapy interventions can be effective in treating depression in low-income contexts (Bolton et al., 2003). These methods usually involve trained laypeople delivering psychotherapy as volunteers.Patel et al. ( 2017) use a community health approach to psychotherapy in Goa, India. A short-run evaluation of a behavioral-activation treatment delivered by lay counselors showed high effectiveness in reducing depression incidence and symptom severity three months after the end of the intervention. Baranov et al. ( 2017) show impacts of a similar intervention, delivered by com- munity health workers, on depression and female empowerment seven years after the end of the treatment. While these results are encouraging, it is too early to tell whether low-cost psychotherapy is a scalable and effective way to improve mental health in developing countries. Numerous other trials are in the eld, including eval- uations of therapy provided over cellphones and using text-messaging (Fairburn and Patel, 2017). Psychotherapies have been employed to support individuals in other ways than alleviating depression. Two trials have recently been completed in developing coun-tries. Blattman et al. ( 2017) evaluate the impact of a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention and the distribution of unconditional cash transfers on the behav-ior of high-risk young men in Liberia. The authors nd reduced criminal behavior and improved self-control and self-image among participants. McKelway (2018) evalu- ates a four-week psycho-social intervention to improve generalized self-efcacy and found large impacts on female labor supply (as discussed in more detail in Sec- tion7.5). Suicide is a particularly severe consequence of mental ill-health and one of the leading causes of death for individuals suffering from severe mental ill-health (Hawton et al., 2013). Suicides cause 800,000 deaths annually, with about three- quarters of these deaths occurring in developing countries. Stress, mental illness, and depression have been identied as major causes of suicides (Mann et al., 1999; Boldrini and Mann, 2015). While economic conditions have been linked to each of these factors, few studies have been able to provide a direct link between economic wellbeing and suicides. Using a difference-in-differences approach in Indonesia, Christian et al. ( 2018) nd that cash transfers reduced yearly suicides by 0.36 per 100,000 people, corresponding to an 18 percent decrease. While we have learned much about mental health and the impact of psychother- apies, many open questions remain. A high priority for future research is to betterunderstand the underlying mechanisms. How does depression affect preferences,beliefs, and decision-making? More generally, how should economists model de-436 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics pression?42As a rst step toward better understanding these questions, a follow-up evaluation of Patel et al. ( 2017) is underway, which will investigate the medium-run effects of this intervention on depression, earnings and consumption (de Quidt et al., 2018). Specically, the study seeks to shed light on the underlying channels of po-tential treatment effects, by measuring individuals' risk, social, and time preferences as well as beliefs in one's own ability and information processing. Numerous questions remain for future investigation. How does the effectiveness of mental health treatments interact with cash payments or available economic op- portunities (e.g. job offers)? Existing evidence shows cash transfers can improve wellbeing and mental health (Haushofer and Shapiro, 2016). But do such effects per- sist over a longer time horizon? Can we better understand determinants of entry into and exit from depression? Do cash transfers and/or mental health interventions have intergenerational effects on children's mental health? What is the relationship be-tween physical pain, mental health and substance abuse? These and many questions remain to be explored in future research on this topic. 10.4 Aspirations, hope, and religiosity We now turn to positive psychological factors, particularly hope and aspirations, which may be helpful in generating better economic outcomes and psychological well-being among the poor. We also discuss suggestive evidence on how religious beliefs and practices may, at least in some cases, provide similar benets. Aspirations and hope. Development economists have investigated the role of aspi- rations and hope in the lives of the poor at least since Sen ( 1985, 1999). Appadurai (2004) proposed that 'aspirations to the good life' are not evenly distributed in soci- ety, with lower capacity to aspire among the poor\u2014not because of any fundamentalcognitive differences, but simply due to a lack of opportunity to practice the 'explo-ration, conjecture and refutation' of possible futures. Low levels of aspirations and hope in turn can limit social mobility and even create a poverty trap (Ray, 2006; Dalton et al., 2015; Genicot and Ray, 2017). An important challenge in this literature is the denition and modeling of as- pirations. Aspirations are broadly a hope or ambition of achieving something. 43 While such broad denitions are useful and intuitive, it has proven difcult to map aspirations into existing economic frameworks. Aspirations are conceptually distinct from both beliefs about the future and preferences for outcomes. En- dogenous reference points might come closest to existing theories in behavioraleconomics. In recent years, models of aspirations and hope as reference points have made progress in this direction (Dalton et al., 2015; Genicot and Ray, 2017; Lybbert and Wydick, 2018). They are also closely related to existing models of goals 42One approach is provided by de Quidt and Haushofer ( 2016), who model depression essentially as having low beliefs about returns to effort. They show how this simple assumption can rationalize several behaviors associated with depression. 43For excellent discussions of the recent literature, see La Ferrara ( 2018)a n dD u fl o( 2012a ).10The psychology of poverty 437 as endogenously set references point, useful to motivate one's effort when facing self-control problems (Hsiaw, 2013). Dalton et al. ( 2015) propose a model of aspirations as reference points, wherein aspirations influence effort choices, and effort produces future wealth. Future wealth in turn causes aspirations to adjust, potentially producing a virtuous cycle. A key as- sumption is that individuals do not realize how their future aspirations will be affected by their current effort levels. That is, they do not internalize the future motivating or demotivating effects of their present effort choice. Since the authors additionally (rea-sonably) assume that poor individuals need to exert greater effort to reach the same nal wealth level, the model can generate poverty traps: even if they start with the same aspirations, poor individuals will exert less effort, which will cause their future aspirations to become lower, further reducing effort, and so on. Genicot and Ray (2017) provide another model of aspirations as reference points. In their model, parents have aspirations for children's future wealth levels. Parents receive a utility boost proportional to the extent to which their children exceed their parents' aspirations, creating a kink in the utility function akin to models of reference dependence. Aspirations in their model are not (necessarily) rational expectations or status-quo levels, but instead may depend upon the distribution of outcomes in soci- ety. Aspirations moderately above the individual's present level provide incentives toinvest, while avoiding frustration. A key empirical question in this literature is whether aspirations are malleable and how different policies might be able to affect them. Bernard et al. ( 2014) consider the impact of exposing individuals to documentaries showing similar individuals fromtheir community who managed to escape poverty through their own efforts in agricul- ture or business. The authors nd remarkably large ve-year impacts on aspirations as well as investments in education, livestock, and agricultural inputs. More research in this area is underway, with the goal to conrm and expand upon these striking and surprising impacts from such a light-touch intervention. Aspirations for one's children could be particularly important for economic de- velopment and poverty alleviation. Beaman et al. ( 2012) show that role models are an important aspect in shaping individuals' aspirations. The authors nd that Indian parents are less ambitious for the education and careers of their daughters than their sons. However, random exposure to female politicians at the local level (due to a reservation policy in India) sharply reduced this gender gap in aspirations as well as actual educational achievement among teenage girls. An open question is whether improving economic outcomes via cash transfers or broader programs such as the ultra-poor program fosters higher aspirations. While Banerjee et al. ( 2015b) do not report ndings regarding aspirations in their six- country evaluation of the multi-faceted \"graduation program\", Sulaiman and Barua (2013) report that changing aspirations is often cited by the implementers as the438 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics most important challenge in the ultra-poor graduation program in the context of Afghanistan.44 Religiosity. The poor often spend considerable time and money on festivals, fu- neral, pilgrimages, and other religious activities (Banerjee and Duflo, 2007). Such activities may foster social cohesion and trust in societies (Clingingsmith et al., 2009). Moreover, work going back to Adam Smith and Max Weber argues that re- ligiosity (specically, the Protestant faith) causes economic wellbeing by fosteringdiligence, thriftiness, and norms prescribing virtuous behavior (Iannaccone, 1998; Iyer, 2016). Religiosity has been linked to many aspects of lives that are favorable for individuals' economic wellbeing including human capital formation, income, sav-ings, and health (Freeman, 1986; Gruber, 2005; Ellison, 1991; Gruber and Hunger- man, 2008). 45 Despite these prominent arguments for the importance of religion and specic re- ligious traditions for economic activity, rigorously establishing causal relationshipsbetween contemporaneous religious practices and beliefs, income, and wealth has been difcult due to obvious identication challenges, particularly at the individual level. Moreover, research on the economic and psychological consequences of reli-giosity we described above mostly focuses on various denominations of Christianity. Given the diversity of religious traditions in the developing world, a potentially im- portant research agenda in behavioral development economics is to consider a widerrange of religions and contexts and their implications for the lives of the poor. Bryan et al. ( 2018) make progress toward improving our understanding of the causal impacts of religiosity by randomizing exposure to religion in the Philip-pines. They randomly assign over 6,000 poor households in 160 communities in the Philippines to receive invitations to attend an evangelical Protestant Christian values- and-theology education program consisting of 15 weekly half-hour sessions. Thistreatment signicantly increases both religiosity and income. Puzzlingly, the authors detect no effect on either total labor supply, assets, or consumption, begging the ques- tion of where the increase in income comes from and how they are spent. A partialanswer could be a shift from agricultural to non-agricultural self-employment, whichmay involve a higher implicit wage. Beyond impacts on human capital, earnings, and wealth, religion could influence individuals' hope and aspirations, as well as their expectations about the future. Asdiscussed in Section 5on insurance, beliefs in higher, interventionist powers could crowd out demand for formal or informal insurance (Auriol et al., 2018). Such beliefs 44Related evidence is provided by Laajaj (2017), who shows that an intervention providing input subsi- dies and a savings match to farmers in Mozambique increases their self-reported planning horizons. The author provides a model in which the agent's planning horizon is endogeneously determined by how brighttheir future prospects appear. The idea is that a gloomy future causes distress due to anticipatory utility,and the agent responds by avoiding thinking about the future, worsening planning and reducing long-term investments. 45Bryan et al. ( 2018) provide a more thorough review of this literature.11Conclusion 439 could also foster individuals' hopes and aspirations, and even boost mental health, as argued in a contentious literature going back as far as Freud (Levin, 2010). Cooley Fruehwirth et al. ( 2019) consider the possibility that religiosity directly impacts depression. To address endogeneity concerns, the authors exploit across- cohort variation in the religiosity of students' peers at school. They report that in- creased exposure to religious peers among US adolescents increased own religiosityand lowered depression. The authors provide evidence that the mechanism throughwhich religiosity protects against depression is not by strengthening friendships orincreasing social activities. Instead, they argue, religiosity increases psychologicalresilience and ability to deal with stressors. While this evidence is intriguing and im- portant, identication concerns remain, and more work along these lines would be valuable. 11Conclusion In this chapter, we discussed canonical topics in development economics through thelens of behavioral economics. We argued that models and ideas from behavioral eco-nomics can help explain important puzzles in development, and have applications tounderstanding preventive health behavior, savings, demand for insurance, technologyadoption, labor markets and rms. We also discussed evidence of variation in social preferences and culture across societies, and of the relationship between poverty and psychology. We have not discussed several important topics in development, due to limited existing work on these topics in behavioral development. One such topic is educa-tion. As an investment good, education may be particularly subject to behavioral biases if children and youth themselves have substantial agency over educational in- vestments (Bursztyn and Coffman, 2012). Existing evidence suggests that the time preferences of students may be malleable and important (Alan and Ertac, 2018;A l a n et al., 2018) and that students may have systematically biased beliefs about the returns to education (Jensen, 2010). Another under-explored topic for behavioral develop- ment could be the economics of the family. Social preferences and norms within the household could matter for consumption and investment decisions, as could biased beliefs. For instance, Dizon-Ross ( 2018) shows that parents do not fully understand their children's (relative) ability and returns to education. Another topic we have onlytouched on in passing is the political economy of development, where social prefer-ences, biased beliefs and norms may all be important (e.g. Finan and Schechter, 2012; Chen and Yang, 2018). We believe that these are equally important areas for future work in behavioral development economics as those we have covered in this chapter. While policy design is not the focus of our paper, we have discussed some cases of success of behaviorally-informed solutions, for instance, the use of small incentivesto encourage desirable health behaviors, and the use of mental accounts to direct sav-ings. In other cases, the solutions proposed by behavioral economics are yet to showreliable impacts on outcomes, for instance, in the case of commitment devices to ad-440 CHAPTER 5 Behavioral development economics dress self-control problems. Yet other interventions show promising initial evidence, but with much more investigation warranted, as in the case of psychotherapies to improve mental health and economic outcomes. We close by encouraging researchers in behavioral development economics to take behavioral theory seriously and ideally quantitatively, providing calibrations or estimations where possible (DellaVigna, 2018). This approach entails designing ex- periments to more precisely identify specic behavioral mechanisms and to test forthem (Ludwig et al., 2011).
