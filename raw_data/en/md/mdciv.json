Dilger, PhD Graduation was held Sunday, June 4 at the Harbor Hills Country Club. The gloomy weather prevented us from enjoying our cocktails and hors d'oeuvres on the deck overlooking Long Island Sound. But that didn't diminish the sunny and merry mood of the graduates and their families inside! The graduating CA-3 Residents were introduced by their mentors. | | Members of the Anesthesia Technology Intern Class of 2017 (Dayhana Aristizabal, BSHS; Elisabeth Bonocore, BSHS and Jasmine Lee, BSHS) wrote the following letter to Drs. Maria Lagade, Stephen Vitkun, Linda Cimino and Wesam Andraous We want to take the time to thank you, on behalf of the Anesthesia Technology Intern Class of 2017, for all of your contributions toward our education this past year. This program has changed our lives in more ways than we expected. Not only did we learn valuable clinical skills, we were able to successfully take on a transition from a classroom setting into the professional work environment. Having completed the program, we can all look back and say it was one of the best decisions we have made in our lives. We have been exposed to a variety of situations that have put our classroom knowledge to the test. From difficult intubations to traumas and Codes, we feel that we are ready to take on any strenuous situation our careers may throw at us. The challenges we faced have made us more well rounded individuals and better suited in delivering high quality patient-centered care. Dr. Lagade has not only guided us as the director of the program, but also in our future paths. She has made a tremendous impact on our lives and opened many doors. We cannot be more grateful for all she has done for each one of us. She has proven herself to be more than a professor and mentor. She is also a friend. We are so honored to have been offered this once in a lifetime experience. Our encounters with the people we have met have helped shape our future interactions with those we will meet, whether patients or healthcare professionals. We thank each and every one of you for taking time out of your busy days to teach us about the world of Anesthesia. Dental Anesthesia Residents Dr. Gina Chen and Dr. Ryan Cheung, published an article (while they still were DA-1 residents) with a dental anesthesia colleague, Dr. James Tom from USC. Congratulations!

Shiv has been a volunteer in our department for close to two years. He came to work as a Clinical Research Fellow, but his involvement in departmental and Stony Brook Medicine activities quickly expanded in several directions. He was appointed to Stony Brook Medicine's Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) and Ethics Consult Service. He was often the official photographer at departmental events. But, I know him best for his work with me on SleepTalker. He popped into my office one day asking whether I could use any help with the newsletter. I wondered if this guy was for real; during the nearly 20 years I'd been editing the newsletter, no one had ever volunteered to help. After I recovered from my shock, I said \"of course!\" I'm sure glad I did! Many of the columns you've been seeing here (including \"Monthly Muscle Chillaxant\" and \"Pocket of Positivity\") were Shiv's ideas. He said \"can we spotlight senior residents?\", \"I'm going to the ASER meeting; shall I write something about it?\", \"let's include short bios of the new residents\", \"should I take pictures at the bowling tournament?\". How could I possibly answer \"no\"? Besides, he usually laughed at my puns! Amid all of these activities, Shiv found the time to complete his MBA and get involved in pitching medical ideas to venture capitalists (his team won the Startupalooza!) and other things that I probably don't know about. After spending a month with his family in southern California, Shiv will begin working with a medical consulting firm in Boston. I am certainly going to miss him! I hope that he will become a \"foreign correspondent\" for SleepTalker. I'll always make space for his contributions! Best wishes, Shiv, in your new adventure! \"Au revoir\" - not goodbye.
