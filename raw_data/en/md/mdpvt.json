Failure to comply with this Code is a breach NZASA's Code of Profess ional Conduct. This Code will be u sed by NZASA as a standard by which a registered members ' conduct is measured . The Code may also be used by the Health and Disability Commissioner (HDC) and other agencies as a professional standa rd. Protecti on of the public is the primary aim, but by adhering to this code of safe practice the practitioner also protects themselves and the profession at large. In addition , this document provides information on working within the relevant New Zealand (NZ) legislatio n, and offers a reminder of the importance of practitioner self -care. Self -care safeg uards both consumer and practitioner, by ensuring practitioners are fit to practice and w ork sustainably with respect to their own health. Refer to the NZASA Code of Ethi cs and Profe ssional Co nduct (2020) for the following related aspects of health care provision: Duty o f Care Informed Consent Conti nuing Practitioner Development (CPD) Terminology Consumers : The term consumer is used in The Code of Healt h and Disability S ervices Cons umers' Rights 1996. To maintain consistenc y with this Code the term consumer is used within this document , however this term can be substituted for 'patient ' or 'client' where appropriate. Acknow ledgements In reviewin g and updating this document we referred to and adapted material from a number of sources . These included the British Acupunctu re Council 's Code of Safe Practice for Acupuncture , the Dental Council of New Zealand 's Standar d of In fection Prevention and Cont rol, and other international guidelines/standards as appropriate . NZASA would like to especially give thank s to the C hinese Medicine Bo ard of Australia for the use of their Infection prevention and control guidelines for acupuncture practice document. 2 NZASA Code of Safe Practice (Acupuncture ) 2020 CONTENT S Premises ................................

Please refer to the current NZ gui delines for business detailing respon sibilities as a sole trader or business , in accordance with the He alth and Safety at Work Act 2015 WorkSafe Mahi Haumaru Aotearoa. WorkSafe NZ also provide a Quick Referenc e Guide to Health and Safety at Work. It is recommended th at a standardised incide nt management system is in place to e nable clear and immediate reporting of any inci dents that oc cur at a place of work (includin g home -based clinic rooms) . WorkSafe NZ prov ides a guide for reporting of a notifiable event within the workplac e. WORK PREMISES Work pr emises must only be use d for the practice of acupun cture or similar work provid ed by health practitioner s. If the cli nic room is home -based, it mu st not be used for domestic purpos es. The premises must be up to sta ndard with re spect to fire safety regula tions and electrical appliance certification . Premise s should provide access to c onsumers with a disabilit y. A high stan dard of cleanliness of wor k premi ses should always be maint ained . Of paramount importance is a clean field (see Sect ion 2.7 to 2.10 on p.10) for the provisio n of acupuncture. DISPOSAL OF NEEDLES AND CLINICAL WASTE All used needles and clinical waste must be disposed of safely, l egally, and in accordance w ith local council regulations. Acupunctur e needles and derma l hamm ers must be single-use, p re-sterilise d, and be disposed of immediately after use in a rigid -walled sharps container which meets the requirem ents specified in AS 4031 or AS/N Z 4261.1 The pra ctitioner must dispose of sharps containers via a waste disposal provider who can collect and dispose of sharp containers safely and in compliance with a ll relevant NZ regulations . ADDITIONAL BUSINESS O BLIGATIONS I NCLUDE : Fire safe ty obligations for work premise s (Fire and Emergency NZ) . Regulati ons re electrical appliances for work pr emises. Of n ote, whilst testing an d tagging is recommended, it is not mandatory. The legal requirement is to ensure equipment is sa fe and well maintained. Provisio n of disabled access for work prem ises, according to NZ legislatio n (Building Act, 2004 ). Where disabled ac cess is not available at a clinic, the p ractitioner shoul d refe r the consum er to a colleague with a clini c that does have disabled access . Offering home visit s may also provide a solution. 1 Standards New Ze aland Stand ards. NZS 4304 :2002. Management of h ealthcare was te.

All premis es must have underg one a clinic audit to ensure the site is fit for purpose. If the pract itione r is working at multiple prem ises, e ach site must undergo a ne w clinic i nspection by NZASA. ANNUAL PRACTI CING CERTIFICATE (APC) Without a APC, the pract itioner is not eligible to prov ide acupuncture servi ces for ACC . In order to renew the APC annu ally, NZASA r equires that all registered members: provide pro of of 20 h ours ongoing education/training ev ery yea r (e.g. confe rences, workshops, peer review grou ps, online seminars etc.) The CPD requirements w ith respect to minimum/maximum hours for each C PD category a re detailed on t he NZASA website (Members Area: Ongoing E ducatio n, Events, & Semi nars); provide proof of holding a current First Aid certificat e; complete a Mandatory Declaration form detailing fitness to pra ctice, crimin al charges, fraudulent billing practices, eligibility to w ork in NZ, claims for medical negligence , and professional conduct ; and comp lete a Mandato ry Health Workfor ce Surv ey. REPORTING CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCE At all times registered members must advis e NZASA of ANY change of c ircumsta nce. This may include , but is not rest ricted to , criminal o ffences/conv ictions and any complaint process that the practitioner is made aware of. Changes to a practitioner's own health may also warrant repor ting if impactin g professional obligations (see b elow). Any change must be r eported to N ZASA within 21 worki ng days. 5 NZASA Code of Safe Practice (Acupuncture ) 2020 PRAC TITIONER HEALT H CONSIDERATIONS Practitioners shou ld be mindfu l of self -care as it relates to their own heal th and their capacity t o provide competent and professional servic es to consumers. Practitioners should not work if they have signs or symptoms of a potentially infect ious dise ase, e.g. con junctivitis or influenza2. At all times, if a practitioner feels un well, they should consider their obligati ons to both themselves and the consumer re their fitness to wor k. NZASA supports ongoing educati on with respect to s elf-care withi n CPD Category 3: Breathing and other exercises, i.e. qi gong and taiji quan that are for the benefit of the practitioner and not the consumer .

Please refe r to the Health Information Priva cy Code ,1994 for more i nformation. 7 NZASA Code of Safe Practice (Acupuncture ) 2020 2. INFECTIO N PREVENTION AND CONTROL The primary objective is to safeguard again st infection for both acupunc turist and consumer. Please also refer to the Australian Guidelines for the P revention and Cont rol of Infection in Healthcare (2019) .7 2.1 Ma naging the Clinic Physical Environment Cleaning is one of the standard precautions to achieve a basic leve l of infectio n prevention and control.7 All surfaces and equipment require regular cleaning . 2.12. Linen ne eds to be changed and l aundered regularly or when it is soiled in any manner , with extra cauti on where any blood has transferred to the linen.7,8 2.13. Used linen should be stored in a contai ner with a lid. 2.14. C lean linen should be stored in a clean, dry area/container. 2.14. A rubbish bin with a lid and a leak pr oof liner should be present in the clinic room. 2.2 Hand hygiene requirements \"Effective hand h ygiene is the single most impor tant strategy in preventing hea lthcare associat ed infections (HAIs )\". 7 p.29 The term hand hygiene include s hand washing wit h liquid soa p and the use of an alcohol- based hand rub . Washing hand s with soap a nd water is required if hand s are visibly dirty or contaminated by blood or other body fluids . If hands are visibl y clean, either product (soap and water or alcoh ol-based hand ru b) can be used . The World Hea lth Organization provides guidelines which describe the most efficient techniques for hand wash ing and alcohol -based hand rub use. Refer to Appendix A for illustration of these techniques. \"Effective han d hygiene relies on appropriate technique as much as on selection of the correct product. Inappropriate technique ca n lead to failure of h and hygi ene measures to appropriately rem ove or kill microorganisms o n hands, despite the superficial appearance of ha ving complied with hand hygiene requirements. Key factors in effect ive hand hygiene and maintaining skin integr ity includ e: - the dura tion of h and hyg iene measures ; - the e xposur e of all surfaces of hands and wrists to the preparation used ; - the use of rub bing to create friction ; and - ensuring that hands are completely dry \".7 p.32 7 National Health and Medical Researc h Council (NHMRC ). Australian Guidelines for the Preve ntion and Control of Infection in Healthcare , Canberra: Austra lian Government ; 2019 . 8 For B est Practi ce Guidelines see no. 7 and The Royal Australian C ollege of Gen eral Practitione rs. Infection prevention and control standards for gen eral practices and oth er office-based and community -based practices . 5th e d. East Melbourne , Vic: RA CGP: 2014 . 8 NZASA Code of Safe Practice (Acupuncture ) 2020 Hand hygiene must be per formed: Before touching a health consum er. Before a procedure . After a proce dure. After body fluid exposure . After touch ing a health consumer . After touching any surface touched by the health consumer . Before and after using a computer keyboar d, tablet or mobile devi ce (whilst in consulta tion or treating) . After blowing or wiping your nose , or touching your nose or mouth . After eating/handling of food/drink s. If your hands becom e visibly soiled . After visiting the t oilet. After handling lau ndry or waste . Before and after the remov al of gloves.9 2.3. Hand washing (liquid soap and water) Refer to Appe ndix A for downloadable poster for your clinic. A basin with hot running water should be located clos e to ev ery acupuncture treatment area. It is preferabl e that the basin i s fitted with no n-touch tapware . If the b asin does not have non -touch tapware, then use a clea n paper towel t o turn the tap off af ter you have com pleted your hand washing (refer to 2.1). After ha nd wash ing, dr y your hands using single -use linen or disp osable paper towels (not usin g an air-dryer). If you touch an ything else prior t o treating the consumer (e.g. door han dles) then yo u must use an alcohol-based rub to clean your hands before treatmen t. Where possible t he basin should solely be for the use of hand washing by health practitioners in the clinic. It should not be used for other purposes, such as foo d preparation . Hand washing with s oap a nd water must be used at the following times : At the beginning and end of eac h clinical se ssion (consumer contact). When your hands are visibly dirty o r contaminat ed with blood or other b ody fluids . After a toil et break. 9 NHMRC . 2019 . p.30-32. 9 NZASA Code of Safe Practice (Acupuncture ) 2020 2.4. Alcohol -based hand ru b (hand sanitiser) The use of an alcohol -based hand ru b is an appropriate method of h and hygiene in health care settings when hands are not visibly dirty.10 Refer to Appen dix A for illustrated technique . The following precautions should be ta ken w hen using al cohol-based hand rub in acupuncture practi ce: Alcoh ol-based han d rub mu st contai n between 60% and 80 % v/v etha nol or eq uivalent.11 Alcohol -based hand rub must be s tored, and used, away from heat and nake d flames . Ensure h ands are completel y dry after san itising . Be particularly mindful that all alcohol has evapo rated from your hands when using p rocedures involving exposure to a nak ed flame, such as moxibustion or cuppi ng. 2.5. Other hand h ygiene protective measures The following measures are aimed at prevent ing transmission of infection. Damaged ski n harbours higher numbers of micro -organisms th an intact skin . Consequent ly, the risk of skin infection and transmissi on of infection to oth ers increases: Practitioner s should cover any skin that is not i ntact such as cuts or skin abrasions with a waterproo f dressing, or wear disposable gl oves. Use a good hand moi sturiser reg ularly as needed to maintain skin he alth. To minimise the pre sence and growth of micro -organisms, and to allow for optimal hand hygiene : o Keep fingernails sh ort and clean. o Refrain from we aring nail polish, nail jewellery, artificial nails, and jewellery on the hands .11 2.6. Gloves Gloves do not need to be w orn if t he consumer and practitioner both have intact skin and excessive bleeding is not expected during the treatment . Wearing gloves is not a n alternative to hand hy giene techniques. In an acupunctu re practice, gloves do not nee d to be sterile but must be single use, i.e. disposed of af ter use. Use glove s to handle any item soiled with blood or body fluids. Examples of procedure s which may result in direct contact with blood in an acupunct ure practic e include when using a dermal hammer, cupping applied after de rmal hammering , or blood -letting techniques . Wash hands with soap and wa ter after removal and disposal of glo ves. 10 NHRMC . 2019 NZASA of Safe Practice (Acupuncture ) 2020 Maintain a cl ean field (a su rface that can easily be cleaned) f or th e practic e of acupuncture. 2.7. Ideally clean all surfaces at the star t and end of a clinic day. 2.8. Retain all equi pment within the clean field. 2.9. Waste disposal containe rs must not enter the cl ean field. 2.10. The clinician must ha ve followed hand hygiene proced ures before ente ring the clean field . Use and disposal of sterile, single use dispos able acupuncture needles . 2.11. It is a mandatory requirement to use CE-marked, pre-sterilised dispos able needles (including dermal hammers). All acupuncture needles and dermal hammers are for single use only. 2.12. Ensure that all pre-sterilised equipment is stored in a clean , dry environment. 2.13. Any nee dles beyon d their exp iry dat e must be dispos ed of, except for 'e xpired' needles retained for training purpos es (i.e. used on a needl e cushion) which must be labelled cl early and stored in a separate area . 2.14. Only use pre-sterilised needl es and other eq uipment when the packa ging is undamaged and shows no s igns of prior exposure to liquids. 2.15. Unused needle s from open multi -use pa cks must be disposed of at the end o f each treatment into the afor ementioned sharps box . Do not retain opened packs for use with the next cons umer or ove rnigh t. 2.16. Guide tube s must be pre-sterilised a nd come packaged with each individual needl e or set of needles . They must not be used or stored f or use after the session i n which the seal on the package is broken. 2.17. Never touch the nee dle shaft wit h bar e fingers or non-sterile equ ipment, e.g. tweezer s. If the sha ft of the needle becomes inadvertently contamin ated b efore insertion, it must be discard ed int o the sharp s container without us e. You may use sterile material (sterile cotton wool or a sterile gauze pad) to support the shaft of the needle if necessary . 2.18. At all times during th e prac tice of acupunct ure, the clinic ian must be a ware of, and make efforts to reduce , the risk of a needle -stick injury. 2.19. After use, a cupuncture needle s must be disposed of in a clearly labelled , rigid-walled sharps conta iner which complies with AS 4031 or AS/NZ 4 261. 2.20. Do not place a needle on an intermediate surfac e before or after use . After use , needles must be placed directly into a sharps container , whic h should be locate d close at han d. Needles should not be pla ced into a secondary conta iner for transfer to the sharps containe r. 2.21. The sharps contain er should be in a safe location (to a void it being knocke d over) and be located outside of the clean field. Sharps containe rs must be ke pt out o f the reach of children . 2.22. Do not overfill the sharps container. 2.23. You must dispose of sharps containers via a waste disposal provid er12 who can collect and dispose of sharp co ntainers safely and i n compliance wi th all re levan t New Zealand regulat ions. 12 Waste dispo sal providers will suppl y and dispose of sharps containers . 11 NZASA Code of Safe Practice (Acupuncture ) 2020 Procedure for dealing with a sharp s injury 2.24 The practice of acupuncture carries the ri sk of a needle stick injury. If it is suspected that a needle sti ck injury has occurr ed, the following imme diate protocol is recomm ended: If the skin een pene trated , allow the wou nd to bleed, and c lean it thoroughly with soap an d water. Alcoh ol-based hand rub can be used to clean the area if soap and w ater is unavai lable. There is no benefit in squeezin g the affected area. It is recommended that you s eek immediate medical attention . Prophylactic post- exposu re treatment may be recommended . Note: this is most effective if implemented soon after the incide nt. It is recommended that the practitioner comp letes an incident report, as per Wor kSafe NZ guide lines (see Workplace Health and Safety in NZ on p.3). \"If a sharps injury happens to you, you can b e reassured that only a small proportion of accidental exposures resu lt in infection. Taking imme diate act ion will lower the risk even further \".13 p.54 Routine skin preparation 2.25. Ensure that the co nsumer 's skin at the needl e site is clean prior to t reatm ent and not covered by clothing. If the consum er's skin is visibly cl ean, t here is no need to use an alcohol swab or other antiseptic before insertin g needl es.14 2.26. If the skin is visibly soiled , an antiseptic (such as 70% isopropyl alcohol skin wipes) must be used to cle an the area prior and the sit e allowed to dry prior t o needl ing.13 If heav ily soiled, it may be neces sary to ask the consumer to wash the area to be treated with soap and water before using isopropyl alcoho l skin wipes . 2.27. If the area has been pre -treated with massage oil or balm, or other topical preparatio ns applied by either the clinician or th e consumer, it should be cleaned with an antiseptic (such as isoprop yl alcohol skin wip es) and allowed to dr y prior to needle inserti on. If swabbing with an antisepti c, a clean, single -use swab must be used . 2.28. Extra care should be taken for those consumers who are /or potentially are immunocompromised . It is recommended that the treatmen t area be cleaned using an antiseptic such as a 70% isopropyl alcohol skin wipe .15,16 Ensure the skin is dry before inserting a needl e. Do not re -palpate after cleaning the area to be needl ed. It is recommended that the consumer be made aware of the risk of infection and to seek medical t reatm ent if the area needled become s red or inflamed post -treatment. 2.29. If a semi -permanent needl e such as a press needle is to be use d (e.g. in the ear) , the area must be cleaned with an antiseptic (such as a 70% isoprop yl alcohol skin wipe ) before insertion. Prope r advice m ust be given to the consumer regarding ongoing management , including when to remove the se types of needles . NOTE: NZASA reco mmends that r etained needles are not used in patients with that have had a heart val ve replacement. 13 National Health and Medical Research Counc il.

Perform hand hygiene immediate ly prio r to r emoving needles. 2.31. A clean, dry , cotton wool ball (or an alcohol wipe) should be pla ced over the site of needle withdrawal i mmediately after , applying gentle pressur e, in order to control a ny superficial bleedin g which may be evident, whether or not gloves have b een u sed. Care must be taken to avoid contact wit h the consume r's blood should bleeding occur. The cotton wool bal l should be disposed of into an appropriate co ntainer marked \"Contaminated Material\" to be incinerated or disposed of according to Local Health Autho rity practice. 2.32. After needling, do no re-palpat e the point unless you have performed hand hygiene. 2.33. Massage should not be applied to a site which has just received acupuncture due to the potentia l for an increased risk of in fectio n at the site .17 Reproc essin g of r eusabl e instrument s and equ ipmen t These standard s are aligned w ith the requirements o f the New Zealand standards on reprocessing of reusable medical equipment and instruments . 18, 19 Specific guidance on acupuncture pract ice is align ed with Chinese Medicine Board of Australia . Infection pr evention and control guidelines for ac upuncture pract ice. 2013.17 2.35. Acupunc ture needles and dermal hammers must not b e reproces sed. These are sterile, single use items only and must be disposed of immediatel y after use in a sharps co ntainer (as defined earlier). 2.36. Cups, gua sha eq uipment and other equipment that have been in conta ct with blood or non - intact skin are to be treated as contaminated . Blood expos ure ma y occur, for example when cups are applie d followin g derm al hammeri ng, or other needling in the same area. If cups (glass, plastic, or silicone) have been in contact with blood or non-intact skin, they are considered 'critical items ' and must only be reprocessed and reused if a docum ented sterilisation process is in place th at complies with Standard s New Zealand AS/NZ S 4187:2014 and AS/NZS 4815:2006. If such a documented steril isation process is not i n place, these contami nated items must b e treated as single -use items an d be dispos ed of. RECOMMENDATION : It is highly unlikely that t hese materials would withstand the high temperature s of the sterilisation process es. Practitione rs can choose to deal with this problem by using single -use disposable cups to be disposed after use in a biohazard waste disposal bucket or bag (available via your waste disposal company). Practitioners choosi ng this option should arrange for a pick-up se rvice of this hazardous waste. 2.37. Cups (made of glass , plastic , or silicone ), scraping spoons, gua sha tools , and any ot her equipm ent which h as been in con tact with intact skin only , are considere d 'non-critical' items and can be reprocessed by cleaning a nd/or di sinfec ting according t o NHMRC20 Guidelines (see Reference s). 2.38. Bamboo cup s are unsuitable for cl eanin g, disinfecting, or steril ising in accordance with these guidelines and must be discard ed aft er use. 17 Chinese Medicine Board of Australia .

CONTRAINDICATIONS A ND PRECAUTIO NS NZAS A ered with contraindi cations and precaut ions. The follo wing is not in tended to be an exhaustive list. The onus is on practitione rs to be aware of any and all risk s associated with their practice , e.g. cho ice of acupunctu re points , work premises , and individua l consumers. Prohibited Needling Scalp umbilic us. Vulnerable Poi nts Vulner able points are to be needled with extreme c are, and the risk must be disc ussed with the consumer as part of an informed consent process. (Refer to the latest 2020 versions of the NZASA Code of Ethics and Professiona l Conduct and the NZASA Guidelines for Informed Consent (2020 ). Vulnerable poin ts inc lude: 3.1. Orbit 1, Chengqi ST 1, neck points: Tiantu CV 22 (front neck ), Futu LI 18 (side of neck over great vessels ), Tianrong SI 17 (near barorecept ors at side of neck ), Yamen G V 15 (over spina l cord ), Fengfu GV 16 (over bra in stem ). 3.3. Points over lung tissue unprotected by bone or cartila ge: e.g. Zhongfu LU 1, Jianjing GB 21. 3.4. Penetrat ion of joints an d over major ner ves, blood vessel s, and internal organs. Remember: This is not an e xhaustive list . Practitione rs should use caution and pro fessional judgment depen dent on each individual cas e. Special ca re should be t aken whe n treating consu mers with th e following cond itions 3.5. Pregnancy : Certain acupuncture points are to be avoided or used with caution during pregnancy , such as LI 4 Hegu, SP 6 Sanyi njiao, GB 21 Jianjing, B L 60 Kunlun and BL67 Zhi yin. Howev er, these point s may be useful for the purpose of encour aging the o nset of labour or during labour itself . In addition, cauti on must be used with any point s on the abdomen located below the umbilicu s or on the lumbo -sacral region. After the firs t trimester , cautio n is also required for any abdo minal points above the umbi licus. 3.6. Diabeti cs: care should be ta ken due to the danger of poor peripheral circulation. 3.7. Pacemakers : do not treat con sumers with pa cemake rs using the modality of electro acupunctu re. 14 NZASA Code of Safe Practice (Acupuncture ) 2020 3.8. Confuse d/mental ly disturbed /children: great ca re must be taken with consu mers who are unable to understand t he procedu re and therefore to gi ve informed consent. Parental conse nt should b e obtained for ch ildren. The use of a consumer advo cate is ad vised. 3.9. Unstabl e epilepti cs: care should be taken with n eedling. If a seizure occurs during an acupuncture treatment, the needles should be immediatel y removed . Protect the consumer from injury and apply appropriate first aid manag ement . If the s eizure does not stop a fter 5 minut es, or a second seizure follows , call for an ambulance .21 3.10. High blood pressure : whilst acupunc ture treatment i s commo nly used f or treatment of h igh blood pressure , some care should be ta ken. 3.11. Bleedin g disorders and those on anticoagula nt medication: care with insertion and removal . Apply p ressure (using a clean cotton wo ol pad) after needle removal. 3.12. Consumers under the in fluence of alcohol or drug s: generally, consumers who are under the influence o f alcohol or drugs should n ot be need led. A specific scenari o where this may be allowable i s in an ad dictio n trea tment sett ing. 3.13. Consumers taking Western medic ation: p ractition ers should be aware of the action of common Western drugs from a West ern and Chi nese perspective. 3.14. General c are should also be exercised when needling the following types of consumers : elderly, palliative consumer s, low body mass inde x (BM I), respiratory con ditions, emotionally upse t (or in a state of shock ), immunocompromi sed consume rs, or consumers who a ppear acutely u nwell . 21 St w.stjohn.org.nz NZASA Code of Safe Practice (Acupuncture ) 2020 4.
