Copyright Published by Jo hn Wiley & Sons, Ltd. A B S T R A C T Background Venous leg ulcers are open skin wounds on the lower leg which can b e slow to heal, and are both painful and costly. The point preva lence of open venous leg ulcers in the UK is about 3 cases per 10,000 peo ple, and many people experience recurrent episodes of prolong ed ulceration. First-line treatment for venous leg ulcers is compr ession therapy, but a wide range of dressings and topical trea tments are also used. This diversity of treatments makes evidence-based decision-making challenging, and a clear and current overview of all the evidence is required. This review is a network meta-analysis (N MA) which assesses the probability of complete ulcer healing as sociated with alternative dressings and topical agents. Objectives T o assess the effects of (1) dressings and (2) topical agents for h ealing venous leg ulcers in any care setting and to rank treatme nts in order of effectiveness, with assessment of uncertainty and ev idence quality. Search methods In March 2017 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Regist er; the Cochrane Central Register and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as we ll as reviews, meta-analyses, guidelines and health technolo gy reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions wit h respect to language, date of publication or study setting. We updated this search in March 2018; as a result several studies are awaiting cl assication. Selection criteria We included published or unpublished randomised controlled t rials (RCTs) that enrolled adults with venous leg ulcers and com pared the effects of at least one of the following interventions wit h any other intervention in the treatment of venous leg ulcers : any dressing, or any topical agent applied directly to an open venous leg ulcer and left in situ. We excluded from this review dressings attach ed to external devices such as negative pressure wound therapies, s kin grafts, growth factors and other biological agents, larva l therapy and treatments such as laser, heat or ultrasound. Studies were re quired to report complete wound healing to be eligible. 1 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Data collection and analysis T wo review authors independently performed study selection , 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. We conducted th is NMA using frequentist meta-regression methods for the efcacy out come; the probability of complete healing. We assumed that tre atment effects were similar within dressings classes (e.g. hydrocollo id, foam). We present estimates of effect with their 95% conden ce intervals (CIs) for individual treatments focusing on comparisons with w idely used dressing classes, and we report ranking probabili ties for each intervention (probability of being the best, second best, etc treatment). We assessed the certainty (quality) of the body of e vidence using GRADE for each network comparison and for the network as whole. Main results We included 78 RCTs (7014 participants) in this review. Of these , 59 studies (5156 participants, 25 different interventions) were included in the NMA; resulting in 40 direct contrasts which infor med 300 mixed-treatment contrasts. The evidence for the network as a whole was of low certainty. Thi s judgement was based on the sparsity of the network leading t o imprecision and the general high risk of bias in the included st udies. Sensitivity analyses also demonstrated instabilit y in key aspects of the network and results are reported for the extended sens itivity analysis. Evidence for individual contrasts was main ly judged to be low or very low certainty. The uncertainty was perpetuated when the results were conside red by ranking the treatments in terms of the probability tha t they were the most effective for ulcer healing, with many treatment s having similar, low, probabilities of being the best treat ment. The two most highly-ranked treatments both had more than 50% probabi lity of being the best (sucralfate and silver dressings). Howev er, the data for sucralfate was from one small study, which means that t his nding should be interpreted with caution. When exploring the data for silver and sucralfate compared with widely-used dress ing classes, there was some evidence that silver dressings may increase the probability of venous leg ulcer healing, compared with non adherent dressings: RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.74 (moderate-cert ainty evidence in the context of a low-certainty network). For all other combinations of these ve interventions it was unclear whethe r the intervention increased the probability of healing; in each cas e this was low- or very low-certainty evidence as a consequence of o ne or more of imprecision, risk of bias and inconsistency. Authors' conclusions More research is needed to determine whether particular dress ings or topical agents improve the probability of healing of v enous leg ulcers. However, the NMA is uninformative regarding which int erventions might best be included in a large trial, largely be cause of the low certainty of the whole network and of individual compar isons.The results of this NMA focus exclusively on complete hea ling; whilst this is of key importance to people living with venous l eg ulcers, clinicians may wish to take into account other patient-i mportant outcomes and factors such as patient preference and cost. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Dressings and topical agents (gels, ointments and creams) f or treating venous leg ulcers What is the aim of this review? The aim of this review is to nd out which dressings and topical a gents (gels, ointments and creams) are most effective for treat ing a type of wound known as venous leg ulcers. These are long-term wo unds in the lower leg caused by problems with blood flow back up the leg through the veins. Researchers from Cochrane found 78 r elevant studies (randomised controlled trials) to answer thi s question. Randomised controlled trials are medical studies where patie nts are chosen at random to receive different treatments. This type of trial provides the most reliable evidence. We evaluated these stud ies using a method known as network meta-analysis (NMA), which al lowed us to compare treatments across different studies and to rank t hem in terms of complete ulcer healing. Key messages We cannot be certain which dressings and topical agents are most e ffective for healing venous leg ulcers: over all studies there were not enough participants per treatment and there was high risk of b ias; this means that many of the studies were conducted or repor ted in a way that means we cannot be sure if the results are accurate. The main treatment for venous leg ulcers is compression bandages o r stockings and the choice of additional dressings or topical trea tments should take into account the review ndings and their un certainty, alongside factors such as patient preference and cost. 2 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.What was studied in the review? Venous leg ulcers are open wounds caused by poor blood flow throu gh the veins of the lower leg. Increased pressure in the leg vei ns may cause damage to the skin and surrounding tissues, leading to a n ulcer. Venous leg ulcers can be slow to heal and are painful and co stly to treat. The main treatment is compression bandages or stocking s but these are often combined with dressings (e.g. foam or nona dherent dressings) and topical creams, gels or ointments. We wished to know which of these additional treatments are most effective w hen it comes to ulcer healing. What are the main results of the review? We found 78 studies relevant to this question, dating from 19 85 to 2016. The studies involved 7014 participants (a majority were women, and average age ranged from 46 to 81 where reported). Ou r NMA included 59 studies (5156 participants) and compared 25 different treatments such as hydrocolloid and silver-impregn ated dressings and a variety of creams and gels. Silver dressings may increase the probability of venous leg u lcer healing compared with nonadherent dressings. However, i n the light of the rest of the NMA evidence, we cannot be very condent about any conclusion, and the network as a whole represents low-certainty evidence. This was due to the small numbers of people involved across all included studies, the small number of studies focusi ng on each treatment, and the high risk of bias. We cannot therefore b e certain which are the most effective treatments for venous leg ulcers, or even which treatments it would be best to compare in future tr ials. How up to date is this review? We searched for studies published up to March 2017. 3 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.B A C K G R O U N D Description of the condition Venous leg ulcers are common and recurring complex wounds that heal by secondary intention (that is by the growth of new tissue rather than by primary closure). Problems with the leg v eins (such as damage to the valves, or blockages) reduce the efcient return of blood to the heart and increase the pressure in the ve ins (Ghauri 2010 ), which may result in venous leg ulcers. The precise chain of events that links high venous pressures (chronic venou s hypertension) with skin breakdown and a chronic wound is not fully understood ( Coleridge Smith 1988 ;Valencia 2001 ). Venous leg ulcers commonly occur on the gaiter region of the lower leg (from just below the ankle up to mid-calf ). A venous leg ulcer is dened as any break in the skin that has either been present for longer than six weeks or occurs in a person with a history of veno us leg ulceration. Differential diagnosis of the type of leg ulce r (i.e. the underlying cause) is made by taking a clinical history, phys i- cal examination, laboratory tests and haemodynamic assessm ent (RCN 2013 ;SIGN 2010 ). T rue venous ulcers are moist, shallow and irregularly shaped and lie wholly or partly within the ga iter area of the leg. Leg ulcers can be associated with venous disease in combination with vascular disease, which impairs arterial blo od supply; in these they are said to have a 'mixed' aeti ology (to have more than one cause). Open skin ulceration due solely to limb ischaemia from vascular disease is less common. Accurate, current estimates of leg ulcer prevalence are hard to id en- tify because most surveys do not differentiate between causes of leg ulceration, or do so per limb but not per person ( Moffatt 2004 ; Srinivasaiah 2007 ;Vowden 2009b ). Estimates of the prevalence of open leg ulceration (any cause) range from 4 to 48 cases per 10,000 ( Graham 2003 ;Johnson 1995 ;Walker 2002 ), with the point prevalence of venous leg ulceration in Australian and Eu - ropean studies being between 10 per 10,000 and 30 per 10,000 (Nelzen 2008 ). A recent estimate suggests that venous ulceration has a point prevalence of 2.9 cases per 10,000 in the United King - dom (UK), whilst mixed arterial/venous leg ulceration has a poi nt prevalence of 1.1 per 10,000 ( Hall 2014 ). Venous disease is a chronic condition which can be characterised by periods of ulceration (i.e. an open wound) followed by heali ng and then recurrence. An early cross-sectional survey reported th at half of current or recent ulcers had been open for up to nine months and that 35% of people with leg ulcers had experienced four or more episodes ( Callam 1987b ). This picture was supported by a subsequent cross-sectional study ( Nelzen 1994 ). More recent analysis of almost 1200 people with venous leg ulcers document ed a 24-week healing rate of 76% and a recurrence at one year of 17% ( Gohel 2005 ). Venous ulcers are painful, can be malodorous and prone to in- fection, and may severely affect people's mobility and qualit y of life. The presence of leg ulceration has been associated with pa in,restriction of work and leisure activities, impaired mobilit y, sleep disturbance, reduced psychological well-being and social isolat ion (Herber 2007 ;Maddox 2012 ;Persoon 2004 ). In severe cases, ul- ceration can lead to limb amputation, although this may be more common in people with comorbid arterial insufciency ( Dumville 2009 ;Nelzen 1997 ;Valencia 2001 ). Recent research suggests that people with complex wounds, including those with venous leg ul - cers, commonly see complete wound healing as the most impor- tant outcome to them ( Cullum 2016 ;Madden 2014 The nancial cost of treating an unhealed leg ulcer in the UK has most recently been estimated at around GBP 1700 per year (price year 2012) ( Ashby 2014 ). An earlier evaluation estimated the average cost of treating a venous leg ulcer in the UK (based on costs for material for dressing changes) as between EUR 814 and EUR 1994 and, in Sweden as lying between EUR 1332 and EUR 2585 (price year 2002), with higher costs associated with larger and more chronic wounds ( Ragnarson 2005 ). In Bradford, UK, GBP 1.69 million spent on dressings and compression ban- dages, and GBP 3.08 million on nursing time (estimates derive d from resource use data for all wound types) during the nancial year 2006 to 2007 ( Vowden 2009a ). Data from a German study, which estimated total costs including those classied as indire ct or intangible costs, estimated mean annual costs of leg ulcers a s EUR 9060 per patient (price year 2006). This gure is higher than other estimates because it includes non-health service costs to t he patient and to society ( Augustin 2012 ). These data are all derived from high-income countries and thus may not be a true reflection of costs elsewhere, which may be higher or lower. Description of the intervention The review includes all dressings and topical agents applied d irectly onto or into wounds and left in situ. This contrasts with produ cts used to irrigate, wash or cleanse wounds and that are only in contact with wounds for a short period. First-line treatment fo r venous leg ulcers is compression therapy in the form of bandage s, stockings or mechanical devices ( Nelson 2014 ;O'Meara 2012 ). This application of external pressure around the lower leg as sists venous return and reduces venous reflux ( Woo 2013 ). We therefore anticipated that wound dressings would commonly be used in combination with compression therapy. Dressings are widely used in wound care with the aim of protecti ng the wound and promoting healing by influencing the local wound environment ( Bradley 1999 ), typically by physical means, such as thermal insulation, absorption of exudate and physical pr otec- tion. Dressings may also have agents include hydrogel gels, oint ments and creams that are placed in contact with the wound and left in situ. Dressings 8 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.The classication of dressings usually depends on the key mate rial used in their construction, and whether additional substances are added to the dressing. Several attributes of an ideal wound d ress- ing have been described ( BNF 2016 ), including the ability of the dressing to: absorb and contain exudate without leakage or strike- through, in order to maintain a wound that is moist but not macerated; achieve freedom from particulate contaminants or toxic chemicals left in the wound; provide thermal insulation, in order to maintain the optimum temperature for healing; allow permeability to water, but not bacteria; optimise the pH of the wound; minimise wound infection and avoid excessive slough; avoid wound trauma on dressing removal; accommodate the need for frequent dressing changes; provide pain relief; and be comfortable. There is a wide range of types of dressings available which may be used for treating wounds including venous leg ulcers; some of these and their properties are described below ( BNF 2016 ). Impregnated dressings may have a range of bases, such as foams or alginates. Absorbent dressings are applied directly to the wound and may be used as secondary absorbent layers in the management of heavily exuding wounds. Examples include Primapore (Smith & Nephew); this can be lifted off at dressing removal, or removed by irrigation. Bonding to a secondary viscose pad increases ab- sorbency. Examples an of hy- drophilic bres held between two dressings are permeable to water vapour and oxygen, but not to water or micro-organisms. Exam- ples include T egaderm (3M) transparent lm and OpSite (Smith & Nephew). Foam dressings contain hydrophilic polyurethane foam and are designed to absorb wound exudate and maintain a moist wound surface. There are a variety of versions and some include addit ional absorbent materials, such as viscose and acrylate par ticles of superabsorbent polyacrylate, which are silicone-coated for n on- traumatic removal. Examples include: Allevyn (Smith & Nephew ), Biatain (Coloplast) and dressings. Honey-impregnated dressings contain medical-grade honey that to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory prop - erties and can be used for acute or chronic wounds. Examples in- clude: Medihoney (Medihoney) and Activon T ulle of an absorbent a vapour-permeable lm or that resemble alginates also been developed: Aquacel (ConvaT ec). Iodine-impregnated dressings release free iodine, which is thought to act as a wound antiseptic when exposed to wound exu- date. Examples include Iodoflex (Smith & Nephew) and Iodozyme (Insense). Low-adherence dressings andwound contact materials usually consist of cotton pads that are placed directly in contact with the wound. They can be non-medicated (e.g. parafn gauze dress- ing, saline gauze dressing) or medicated (e.g. containing povi done iodine or chlorhexidine). Examples include parafn gauze dres s- ing, BP 1993 and Xeroform (Covidien) dressing - a nonadher- ent petrolatum blend bismuth tribromophenate on ne mesh gauze. Odour-absorbent dressings contain charcoal and are used to ab- sorb wound odour. Often this type of wound dressing is used in conjunction with a secondary dressing to improve absorbency. An example is CarboFLEX (ConvaT ec). Other antimicrobial dressings are composed of a gauze or low- adherent dressing impregnated with an ointment thought to h ave antimicrobial properties (e.g. chlorhexidine gauze dressing (Smith & Nephew)). Alternatively, a dressing such as Cutimed Sorbact (BSN Medical) uses a hydrophobic layer to bind micro-organisms to the dressing surface, allowing them to be removed from the wound when the dressing is changed. Protease-modulating matrix dressings alter the activity of prote- olytic enzymes chronic wounds. Examples include: Promogra n (Systagenix). Silver-impregnated dressings are used to treat infected wounds, as silver ions are thought to have antimicrobial properties. Sil- ver versions of most dressing types are available, including silver impregnated dressings (e.g. silver hydrocolloid etc). Example s in- clude: Acticoat (Smith & Nephew) and Urgosorb Silver (Urgo). Soft polymer dressings are composed of a soft silicone polymer held in a nonadherent layer; these are moderately and Urgotul (Urgo). T opical agents The following types of topical agents are considered as interv en- tions in this review. Cadexomer-iodine paste consists of a water-soluble, modied starch polymer containing iodine. It releases free iodine whe n ex- posed to wound exudate. The free iodine acts as an antiseptic o n the wound surface, and the cadexomer absorbs wound exudate and encourages de-sloughing. Examples include: Iodosorb (Smit h & Nephew) ointment and powder. Collagenase-containing ointment is an enzymatic debriding ointment. Collagenase is thought to digest collagen in necrot ic tissue and to contribute to granulation and epithelialisati on (the nal stage of wound healing). 9 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Hydrogels consist of a starch polymer and up to 96% water. They can absorb wound exudate or rehydrate a wound depending on the wound moisture levels. Hydrogels are often considered to be dressings, but are also topical in nature. They are supplied i n either flat sheets, an amorphous hydrogel or (Covidien). Topical is thought to promote wound healing by a number of mechanisms, including stimulation of broblast pro - liferation, facilitation of collagen deposition and antibact erial ac- tivity. Silver sulfadiazine cream is a topical antimicrobial cream that is used to treat and prevent infection in wounds by damaging bacterial cell membranes. Examples include Flamazine (Smith & Nephew) and Silvadene (Pzer). We did not consider studies evaluating any products containing growth factors, platelet-rich plasma or other platelet-derive d prod- ucts and colony-stimulating factors. How the intervention might work Animal experiments conducted over 40 years ago suggested that acute wounds heal more quickly when their surfaces are kept mois t rather than left to dry and scab ( Winter 1962 ;Winter 1963a ; Winter 1963b ). A moist environment is thought to provide opti- mal conditions for the cells involved in the healing process wit h faster revascularisation ( Dyson 1992 ), and development of gran- ulation as well as allowing autolytic de- bridement (removal of dead tissue by natural processes), which i s thought to be an important part of the healing pathway ( Cardinal 2009 ). The desire to maintain a moist wound environment is a key driv er for the use of wound dressings and related topical agents. Whil st a moist environment at the wound site has been shown to aid the r ate of epithelialisation in supercial wounds, excess moisture a t the wound site can cause maceration (breakdown) of the surrounding skin ( Cutting 2002 ), and it has also been suggested that dressings that permit fluid to accumulate might predispose wounds to in- fection ( Hutchinson 1991 ). Wound treatments vary in their level of absorbency, so that a very wet wound can be treated with an ab- sorbent dressing (such as a foam dressing) to draw excess moistu re away and avoid skin damage, whilst a drier wound can be treated with a more occlusive dressing or a hydrogel to maintain a moist environment. Some dressings are now also formulated with an 'active' ingre dient (e.g. silver, honey or protease modulators). Why it is important to do this review Venous leg ulcers are a relatively common type of complex wound that have a negative impact on people's lives and incur high cost s for health services and society. Leg ulcers are painful, someti mesmalodorous, prone to infection, and may severely affect peopl e's mobility and quality of life, and in severe cases, there is a ri sk of limb amputation. There are a number of treatments for venous leg ulcers, but many ulcers prove hard to heal, although healin g is a key outcome for patients. We conducted an open consultation with consumers to ask them which treatments for treating venous leg ulcers they would lik e to see considered. Respondents self-selected through their resp onse to a short questionnaire posted on the Cochrane Wounds websit e and Facebook page. Although some identied compression as the main consideration, others mentioned specic types of dressi ngs. These included many of the dressing types listed in Description of the intervention , including charcoal-containing (odour-absorb- ing) dressings, dressings designed to reduce formation and p res- ence of biolms (bacteria which grow on a surface to form a lm of cells) and dressings with antimicrobial properties and deb riding actions. Also specically identied as being of interest was Un na's boot; a specialised dressing which consists of gauze wraps impr eg- nated with zinc oxide and calamine, sometimes in combination with other agents. The diversity of dressings and related materials available to health professionals for treating venous leg ulcers makes evidence-b ased decision-making difcult when determining the optimum treat- ment regimen for a particular patient ( NICE 2016a ). With in- creasingly sophisticated technology being applied to wound car e, practitioners need to know the relative effectiveness and cost -effec- tiveness of these sometimes expensive dressings. Even wher e cost is not an issue, the most effective treatment may not be availa ble (e.g. in some developing countries) or may be difcult or to use, so that information on the second and third best treatments is important too ( Salanti 2011 ). There are a number of existing or ongoing evidence syntheses on venous leg ulcer treatments, including Cochrane reviews of different types of dressings or topical treatments ( Briggs 2012 ; O'Meara 2013 ;O'Meara 2014 ;O'Meara 2015 ;Ribeiro 2013 ; Ribeiro 2014 ;Westby 2016 ). There are also wider reviews of par- ticular types of treatment for all wound types which include dat a on venous leg ulcers for treatments such as honey, silver, aloe Vera, and phenytoin ( Dat 2012 ;Jull 2015 ;Shaw 2007 ;Vermeulen 2007 ). Other reviews on non-healing or chronic ulcers have also in- cluded a substantial number of relevant trials ( Greer 2013 ;AHRQ 2013 ), and there are also older general reviews (e.g. Bouza 2005 ; O'Donnell 2006 ). Guidance drawing on reviews available at the time has also bee n published ( Robson 2006 ;SIGN 2010 ). The SIGN 2010 guide- line recommended that low-adherent dressings be used routine ly but that alternative dressings (hydrocolloids, alginates or hydro- gels) may be considered to assist with pain, exudate and sloug h respectively. Earlier guidance ( Robson 2006 ), recommended that maintaining a moist wound environment be prioritised in dre ssing choice. Most recently the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issued advice on the use of advanced and 10 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.antimicrobial dressings for chronic wounds including venous l eg ulcers ( NICE 2016b ). This updated the SIGN 2010 guidance to include the ndings of the most recent systematic reviews. However, despite the existence of high-quality recent systema tic reviews, there is insufcient evidence to support the use of an y particular type of advanced or antimicrobial dressing or treat ment as the direct evidence is of low certainty and no network meta- analysis (NMA) has previously been undertaken in this area. D e- cision-makers currently have to consider the ndings of a pletho ra of pairwise randomised controlled trials (RCTs) simultaneou sly and to make qualitative judgements across these in the face of u n- certainty, when considering the evidence on dressing use. NMA is the simultaneous comparison of linked, multiple, com- peting treatments in a single statistical regression model ( Caldwell 2005 ;Lu 2004 ;Salanti 2008 ). NMA utilises evidence from both 'direct' (head-to-head or 'pairwise') comparisons (e.g. trials d irectly comparing treatments A and B) and 'indirect' comparisons (e.g. the combination of trials comparing A with C and trials compar- ing B with C). If both direct and indirect estimates are availabl e, they can be meta-analysed, preserving within-trial randomisa tion (Grant 2013 ;Thorlund 2012 ;T u 2012 ). Where there are relevant common comparators, NMA produces a set of effect estimates for each treatment linked into the netw ork, relative to every other, whether or not they have been compare d in head-to-head trials: thus, NMA is a method of obtaining estima tes for comparisons for which there is no (direct) trial evidence. Eve n when direct evidence is available there may not be much of it, so pooling it with data from indirect comparisons generally gi ves more robust evidence and reduces uncertainty in the estimates o f effect ( Higgins 1996 ;Thorlund 2012 ). It is also possible to cal- culate the probability of one treatment being the best for a sp e- cic outcome, reflecting the precision surrounding the estimate s (Caldwell 2014 ;Salanti 2011 ). A glossary of NMA terms is given in Appendix 1 . This review comprised a network meta-analysis (NMA) for the outcome of venous leg ulcer healing, for alternative dressing s and topical agents for the treatment of venous leg ulcers. We drew o n methods previously used in related work ( Soares 2014 ;Westby 2017 ). The NMA was expected to enable us to determine which (if any) dressing or topical agent is the most effective for heal ing venous leg ulcers, taking into account direct and indirect eviden ce simultaneously. We also presented uncertainty around treat ment estimates, and explored assumptions being made in the analy sis. O B J E C T I V E S T o assess the effects of (1) dressings and (2) topical agents for h eal- ing venous leg ulcers in any care setting and to rank treatments in order of effectiveness, with assessment of uncertainty and ev idence quality.M E T H O D S Criteria for considering studies for this review T ypes of studies We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of language of report. We only inclu ded cross-over trials that reported outcome data at the end of the r st treatment period and prior to cross-over. We excluded studies u s- ing quasi-random methods of allocation (such as alternation). We highlighted trials in which three or more interventions were ran- domised and included all relevant arms. T ypes of participants We included trials recruiting adults (aged at least 18 years) de - scribed as having venous leg ulcers, managed in any setting. We accepted study authors' denitions of venous leg ulcers. Where wounds were described only as \"leg ulcers\" without informatio n as to aetiology, we assumed that they were venous in origin. T rials in which a minority of leg ulcers are described as having a mixed or arterial pathology were included provided that these were fewer than 25% of participants. T rials including other types of mixe d wound populations were not included. We included participants at any stage of their treatment process - for example, particip ants with or without ulcers described as being hard to heal or clinical ly infected. T ypes of interventions The interventions evaluated are all those that can be directly ap- plied as dressings or topical agents to open venous leg ulcers. We presented results for these interventions and included them in summary tables. In the context of a network of competing treat- ments, there are no 'comparators'. We used the term 'compariso n' to mean two interventions compared in a single study and the te rm 'contrast' to mean two interventions compared across all studi es with that comparison. A contrast may be represented by a single study, a simple direct meta-analysis or by the NMA. We considered trials for which at least one of the intervention s was (1) any dressing, including impregnated dressings or saline-m oist- ened dressings or combination dressings*, or (2) any topical ag ent applied directly to an open venous leg ulcer and left in situ. Th e treatment of interest had to be the only systematic differen ce be- tween treatment groups. We did not take into account secondary dressings. We also considered 'no dressing' as a valid interv ention, where the wound is left open/covered only by compression ban- daging. * 'combination dressings' means two or more dressings applie d sequentially over time (e.g. hydrocolloid for four weeks foll owed by alginate for four weeks), or a product containing two or more 11 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.types of dressing material (e.g. a multilayer product comprisi ng silicone polymer and hydrocolloid). Some of the interventions we considered are as follows; we use d the categories listed below as the basis for grouping the trea tments used in individual studies: basic wound contact dressings (includes low-adherence (including parafn gauze) or absorbent dressings (of any absorbency)); saline-moistened gauze (all degrees of moistness); hydrogel dressing (includes sheet or hydrogel application (amorphous) hyaluronate); vapour-permeable and membranes adhesive lm (semi-permeable) lm with absorbent soft (with/without absorbent pad or cellulose); hydrocolloid (with/without topical honey; dressings; oxide; no dressing (wound left exposed); and other treatments considered by the review team (with additional clinical advice where required) to be dressings or topical agents applied directly to the wound and left in situ. The following interventions were excluded from evaluation: treat- ments in which dressings were attached to external devices such as negative pressure wound therapies, skin grafts, growth f actor treatments, platelet gels and larval therapy. We also exclud ed in- terventions which, although topical, are not delivered as a ph ysical presence (liquid or solid) on the wound surface such as oxygen, ultrasound, laser or radiant heat therapies. These treatme nts were considered to be outside the scope of a review focused on dressin gs and topical treatments used in place of dressings. Where studie s compared an eligible with an ineligible intervention we inclu ded them if they usefully linked the network of studies evaluati ng two eligible treatments. Data from these linking studies were f ully ex- tracted and they were assessed for risk of bias. Studies which e val-uated only one eligible intervention and did not perform thi s link- ing function were treated as excluded studies and are clearly id en- tied in the list of excluded studies ( Characteristics of excluded studies ). Where studies used a placebo comparator for an eligible intervention, we included them and treated the placebo as bein g the vehicle used to deliver it; for example as an emollient crea m, an inactive powder or a hydrogel. For example, a comparison of a cream containing an antibiotic with a placebo would be treated a s a comparison of topical antibiotic with an emollient cream. We grouped together dressings in the same class, for example, all hydrocolloid dressings were grouped together regardles s of whether they were adhesive or non-adhesive ( BNF 2016 ). This grouping was regardless of a particular brand's stated absor bency, size, concentration of active component or degree of moistness. Thus, where studies only compared two dressings from the same class (for example, two alginates or two foam dressings), we ex- cluded them from the review as they contributed no information about the effectiveness of the class. We considered an impregna ted dressing to be in a different class from a non-impregnated dres s- ing. Judgements about whether particular dressings belonge d to the same class were made on the basis of British National Formu - lary (BNF) classications ( BNF 2016 ), and clinical expert advice where there was remaining uncertainty. Evidence from compar- isons between dressings of the same class can be found in the ind i- vidual Cochrane reviews of particular types of dressings. T ri als of this type are also identied as such in the list of excluded stud ies. We anticipated that the great majority of participants would b e treated with concurrent compression therapy and noted the type of compression therapy used. We also included any RCT in which other concurrent therapies were given (e.g. antibiotics, debri de- ment), provided that these treatments were delivered in a sta n- dardised way across the trial arms of the individual trial (such that the treatment of interest is the only systematic difference). We did not treat separately comparisons with and without concurre nt therapies, that is, we considered intervention 1 + concurrent t her- apy versus intervention 2 + concurrent therapy to be the same as intervention 1 versus intervention 2. We assumed that the interventions are exchangeable, that is, par- ticipants in the network could, in principle, be randomised to any of the treatments being compared. For example, that a pers on with a venous leg ulcer could be equally likely to be randomised to a silver dressing, a polyurethane foam dressing, honey or saline gauze. Depending on the wound requirements for the dressing (e.g. highly absorbent), this may not always be a good assumpti on for individual wounds, but may be reasonable across the popul a- tion in the trials. T ypes of outcome measures We reported outcome measures at the last time point available (assumed to be at the end of follow-up if not specied) and the time point specied in the methods as being of primary interes t (if this was different from latest time point available). Init ially, 12 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.we noted when studies reported results at other time points, or whether they included Kaplan-Meier plots, or both. Primary outcomes The primary outcome for this review is complete wound healing. We regarded the following as providing the most relevant mea sures of outcome for the analyses: the proportion of wounds healed (frequency of complete healing: arm-level data); time to complete healing (survival data: study-level data reported as a hazard ratio (HR) with standard error (SE)). We accepted the authors' denitions of what constitutes a heale d wound. Secondary outcomes We did not consider any secondary outcomes here, however they are considered in other relevant reviews ( Briggs 2012 ;O'Meara 2013 ;O'Meara 2014 ;O'Meara 2015 reviews Ribeiro 2013 ;Ribeiro 2014 ). Search methods for identication of studies Electronic searches We searched the following electronic databases to identify re ports of relevant randomised clinical trials: Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register (searched 29 March 2017); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled T rials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2) (searched 29 March 2017); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 29 March 2017); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, to 29 March 2017); Ovid Embase (1974 to 29 March 2017); EBSCO CINAHL Plus (1937 to 29 March 2017). The search strategies for the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Reg- ister, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus can be found in Appendix 2 . We combined the Ovid MEDLINE search with the Cochrane Highly Sensi- tive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in ME D- LINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximising version (2008 re - vision) ( Lefebvre 2011 ). We combined the Embase search with the Ovid Embase lter developed by the UK Cochrane Centre (Lefebvre 2011 ). We combined the CINAHL searches with the trial lters developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guide lines Network ( SIGN 2018 ). There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.An updated search was conducted on 16 March 2018; these results have been added to Studies awaiting classication andOngoing studies , and will be incorporated into the review at the next update. Searching other resources We tried to identify other potentially eligible trials or an cillary publications by searching the reference lists of retrieved incl uded studies as well as relevant systematic reviews, meta-analys es, guide- lines and health technology assessment reports. We used any a d- ditional unpublished data for included studies obtained by p re- vious reviews, contacting review authors where appropriate, and undertook cross-checking to ensure that all relevant studies wi th evaluable outcome data were included. Data collection and analysis Data collection and analysis were carried out according to method s stated in the published protocol ( Norman 2017 ), which were based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011a ). Selection of studies T wo review authors independently assessed the titles and ab stracts of the citations retrieved by the searches for relevance. After this initial assessment, we obtained full-text copies of all studi es consid- ered to be potentially relevant. T wo review authors indepen dently checked the full papers for eligibility; disagreements were r esolved by discussion and, where required, the input of a third review au- thor. Where required and possible, we attempted to contact stud y authors where the eligibility of a study was unclear. We record ed all reasons for exclusion of studies for which we had obtained f ull- text copies. We completed a PRISMA flowchart to summarise this process ( Liberati 2009 ). Where studies were reported in multiple publications/report s we sought to obtain all publications. Whilst the study was include d only once in the review, we extracted data from all reports to en sure maximal relevant data were obtained. Data extraction and management We extracted the following information from each included stud y: interventions being compared, including any ineligible interventions randomised to additional trial groups; duration of the intervention; details of any co-interventions; unit of randomisation (e.g. participant or ulcer); number of ulcers per person; unit of analysis (including any selection methods for people with multiple ulcers); number of participants in each arm; 13 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% condence interval (CI) (or any data that will allow its calculation ( Parmar 1998 ;Tierney 2007 )) for comparisons between arms); number of participants who healed in each arm, both at the latest time point and (if different) at another time specied a s of primary interest in the study's methods section; all other follow-up times reported; if a Kaplan Meier plot is displayed; missing data rates per arm, and reasons for 'missingness', including the number of people dying. Data on potential effect modiers We are not aware of any population-specic effect modiers for this research question: there is no existing evidence to sugge st that one type of dressing works better than another for certai n subgroups, such as different baseline ulcer characteristics (e.g . size and duration of ulcer), although it may be the case that some dressings are evaluated only in particular groups (e.g. those classed as having 'hard-to-heal' ulcers). However, we extracted from each included study data that may act as effect modiers (in this context): type of funding (e.g. industry, academic, government); this was grouped into not-for-prot and other where reported; risk of bias; this was classed as low or unclear, high or very high. We did not give more weight to any individual domains of the 'Risk of bias' assessment. Other data We also extracted the following baseline and study data, repo rting separately for each intervention arm if possible: care setting; age of participants; duration of leg ulcer(s); size of venous leg wound status (e.g. sloughy, necrotic, infected, 'hard-to- heal'). Assessment of risk of bias in included studies We assessed risk of bias for each included study, and calculated separately the overall risk of bias for each direct pairwise me ta- analysis for the complete healing data. T wo review authors in de- pendently assessed included studies using the Cochrane tool f or assessing risk of bias ( Higgins 2011b ); a third review author was consulted where consensus could not be reached. The Cochrane risk of bias tool addresses six specic domains: sequence gene ra- tion, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, i n- complete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other is - sues ( Appendix 3 ). We then summarised data for the key biases reflected by these domains: selection bias, detection bias, att ritionbias, reporting bias and other bias. We also noted the compara bil- ity of participant characteristics at baseline across the two gro ups, including whether an adjusted analysis was conducted. We used these data to help inform decisions on the risk of selection bia s. For the category of \"other bias\" we paid particular attention to un it of analysis errors since they are highly prevalent in wounds res earch. We recorded all problems of unit of analysis, for example, whe re participants with multiple wounds were randomised and each of their wounds contributed outcome data. We interpreted the overall risk of bias for each contrast of the network meta-analysis, drawing on both indirect and direct dat a (see the section on Quality Assessment of Evidence ( GRADE 2013 ), below). Overall risk of bias and linking to GRADE assessment In order to link these Cochrane risk of bias ratings to the GRAD E assessment for study limitations (downgrading 0, 1 or 2 times ), we used a two-stage process. Firstly, we obtained an all-domain (overall) risk of bias classication for each study and then we us ed this to produce an overall risk of bias for each contrast. All-domain risk of bias for each study We summarised data for each of the key domains of selection bias , detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other bia s, assign- ing one of four ratings: low, unclear, high and very high. For e x- ample, selection bias was informed by sequence generation, al lo- cation concealment and comparability of baseline characteristics . In an adaption of the GRADE approach ( Guyatt 2011 ), we pro- duced an all-domain bias, with four ratings dened as: 'very high' - two or more key domains with a high risk of bias or a single domain with very high levels of uncertainty (e. g. very high degree of differential missing data); 'high' - high risk of bias for any one domain or 'almost high' risk of bias across more than one domain; 'low' - low risk of bias for each of the key domains; 'unclear' - insufcient information for at least one key domain (with the other domains being at low risk of bias). We included this all-domain risk of bias in the summary 'Risk of bias' gure, by adding additional columns to the 'Risk of bi as' gure for each study. For the purposes of the GRADE assessment , we then grouped together studies with low and unclear all-doma in risks of bias. Overall risk of bias for a direct comparison (the comparison of two intervention in one or more trials) Where a single study contributed to a comparison, the overall ri sk of bias was that of the all-domain risk of bias assigned to that study. Where more than one study contributed to a comparison, we as- signed an overall comparison risk of bias by calculating a weigh ted average based on the inverse variance-derived weights from th e 14 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.meta-analysis, and using this in conjunction with the overall r isk of bias (where numerical values were assigned to the all-domain ratings for each study: low/unclear (1), high (2) and very high (3)). We aligned comparison 'Risk of bias' assessment with the GRAD E categories of no limitations (not downgraded for risk of bias), se- rious limitations (downgraded once), and very serious limitat ions (downgraded twice) ( Guyatt 2011 ;Salanti 2014 ). We presented the overall risk of bias associated with each direct estimate in a network diagram using colours to represent different rating s. Overall risk of bias in the network Each direct contrast in the network contributed differently to t he estimation of each NMA summary effect (each NMA compar- ison). The contribution of each piece of indirect evidence to a mixed treatment contrast depends on its point estimate, preci sion and relative location within the network, and on that of any di - rect evidence or other indirect evidence ( Chaimani 2013 ;Salanti 2014 ). A recently published tool, Krahn 2013 , allows the contri- bution of each direct estimate to be determined for each contrast in the network informed by mixed evidence (direct and indirect), or when multiple loops of indirect evidence inform the same lin k. We used the CINeMA web tool ( CINeMA 2017 ) to calculate the percentage contribution of each direct contrast to each network estimate. The overall risk of bias for each NMA comparison es- timate is a composite measure of the risks of bias for all the di - rect contrasts contributing to that NMA comparison and was de- termined by calculating a weighted average risk of bias using t he percentage contributions and the all-domain risks of bias for a ll the direct contrasts. We acknowledge that this approach returns approximate weights. Measures of treatment effect Relative treatment effects We were not able to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) for the majori ty of studies, and therefore presented the risk ratio (RR) (95% CI ) for the proportion of people healed. In order to conduct these anal yses (seeData synthesis ), we used outcome data reported in individual studies, as raw data at the latest time point, unless otherwi se stated. If there had been sufcient data, we had planned to calculate the HR with 95% CI and to model time-to-event data. Unit of analysis issues We expected the main unit of analysis issues to occur when partici - pants had more than one wound per person. We treated the parti c- ipant as the unit of analysis when the number of wounds assess ed appeared equal to the number of participants (e.g. one wound per person). This included studies in which participants were ra n- domised to treatments and there was more than one wound perperson, but results were reported for one selected wound; we co n- sidered whether there was risk of bias in the selection process . Where studies randomised at the participant level, we used the allocated treatment on multiple wounds per participant, and m ea- sured and analysed outcomes at the wound level, (e.g. wound hea l- ing), there were unit of analysis issues if the data were not cor - rectly analysed. In these cases, we assessed whether it was pos sible and appropriate to approximate the correct analyses in accordan ce with Chapter 16 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions , using information adapted from Higgins 2011c . Where this was not possible, we made a decision about inclusion of data in the analysis, and recorded these studies as being at high risk of bias if the number of participants and the mean number o f wounds per person were judged to warrant this. If cluster-randomised trials had been identied, we would hav e decided the analytical approach based on the type and volume of cluster data. We accounted for the correlation between the effect sizes from multi-arm studies in the analysis. Dealing with missing data It is common to have data missing from trial reports. Excluding participants post-randomisation, or ignoring those particip ants who withdraw from the trial or are lost to follow-up, compro- mises the randomisation and potentially introduces bias int o the trial. Where there were missing data for the primary outcome of proportion of ulcers healed, we assumed participants did not h ave the outcome (i.e. they will be considered in the denominator but not the numerator). We considered examining this assumption in a sensitivity analysis but decided this was not necessary gi ven the small numbers of trials with differences in attrition bet ween treatment groups. Assessment of heterogeneity Assessment of clinical and methodological heterogeneity within treatment comparisons We assessed the presence of clinical heterogeneity within each p air- wise comparison (i.e. the degree to which studies vary in terms o f participant, intervention and outcome characteristics) by compa r- ing data extracted for included studies. We focused on key vari- ables that are potential effect modiers, such as whether stud ies were at high risk of bias in key domains and the source of fundin g for the study. We also considered the generalisability of our nd- ings with reference to participant characteristics such as ulcer si ze and duration. Assessment of transitivity across treatment comparisons 'T ransitivity' refers to the situation in which an intervent ion effect measured using an indirect comparison is valid and equivalent to the intervention effect measured using a direct comparison. Th us, 15 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.where there are differences in effect modiers across compariso ns, the transitivity assumption may not be met and there will be i n- consistency in the network ( Grant 2013 ;Jansen 2013 ). We did not identify any potential effect modiers from the literatu re, and therefore had to assume that there is transitivity with resp ect to known effect modiers across the pairwise comparisons. There a re also limited underlying theoretical reasons to consider effe ct mod- ication for these treatments - however, in preparing the net work we explored the effect of differences in risk of bias as possibl e effect modiers across the network. We investigated inconsistency in the network (see Data synthesis ). We had also planned to investigate the effect of funding source as a potential effect modier. However although many studies rep orted funding by a manufacturer of one of the assessed intervention s, a substantial number of studies did not report the funding sou rce. Only a minority of trials clearly reported a third sector or pub lic funding source; a much smaller number reported non-industry funding or a mixture of industry and non-industry sources. In view of this imbalance and the high level of uncertainty around trials which did not report funding sources we did not attempt this analysis. Assessment of reporting biases We assessed the presence of reporting bias using a contour-en- hanced funnel plot, ( Peters 2008 ;Salanti 2014 ). Data synthesis General methods We performed pairwise meta-analyses in a frequentist framew ork using the suggested that there were likely to be insufcient data for us to model the impact of follow-up dur a- tion on estimates of effect. We therefore conducted analyses ba sed on binary data, analysed using risk ratios (RRs). We had planne d to extract or calculate HRs where possible using established me th- ods ( Parmar 1998 ;Tierney 2007 ), and would have considered the hazard However, We used STATA 13 ( STATA 2011 ) to calculate the contribu- tions matrix for the network and used the results of this toge ther with the evaluation of risk of bias (see Assessment of risk of bias in included studies ) to inform a GRADE evaluation for the en- tire network ( Salanti 2014 ). We summarised the ndings ;Sch\u00fcnemann 2011a ; Sch\u00fcnemann 2011b ). Where there were zero events in any trial arm, we followed the general approach taken by STATA and added 0.5 to the numerator and 1 to the denominator for each arm in the trial.Methods for standard meta-analysis We performed pairwise meta-analyses in a frequentist framew ork Review or STATA 13 ( STATA 2011 appropriate, using inverse variance weighting and a ran- dom-effects model, and only analysing trials reporting that p air- wise comparison. We also presented the data for these direct com - parisons from the network in forest plots ( Sch\u00fcnemann 2011a ); for reasons of space we did not present all possible comparison s. While we report treatment effects for all data (see appendices), w e focus on discussing selected comparisons chosen for their clinical relevance. Methods for network meta-analysis We used STATA 13 to produce a network diagram based on all included studies in order to inform the analysis plan ( Chaimani 2013 ). We excluded from the analysis two-arm studies in which one of the interventions could be described as 'standard care' o r 'mixed care'. These are treatment arms where the 'interventi on' involves the choice of more than one treatment: they are unlike ly to be consistently applied. We had anticipated that such interv en- tions might have been acceptable for a grouped sensitivity ana lysis (see section on Sensitivity analysis ), but experience ( Westby 2017 ) led us to conclude that this was unlikely to be informative; such studies are therefore summarised in Appendix 4 , but not consid- ered further. We also excluded from the main analysis studies that had one intervention of direct interest (e.g. hydrocolloid) com - pared with one ineligible intervention (e.g. ultrasound), un less we found, after examining the network diagram, that the inelig ible intervention linked two or more interventions of direct inte rest; such interventions were included in a sensitivity analysis lo oking at an expanded base-case. We performed multivariable network meta-analysis using STA TA 13. We used the 'mvmeta' command and adopted a random-ef- fects approach and a consistency model. We used per-arm data (see Data extraction and management ) throughout. The STATA rou- tine took into account correlations between the effect sizes fro m multi-arm studies. The NMA results were reported for all 'mix ed treatment contrasts', which means the meta-analysis involved both direct evidence and indirect evidence from across the whole net- work. The output was reported as pooled RRs, with their 95% CIs. If there were sufcient data we had also planned to perfor m an analysis of time-to-event data using the log HR with its standa rd error (SE). We carried out analyses for network comparisons (where indirect evidence alone, or both direct and indirect evidence contributes ) in a frequentist framework as above. Where required, we accounted for correlations induced by multi-arm studies. We also present ed the data in forest plots. We obtained a treatment hierarchy using the surface under the cu - mulative ranking curve (SUCRA) and mean ranks ( Salanti 2011 ) for each treatment. Both these measures are based on an assess - 16 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.ment of the probability of each treatment being best, second be st, etc. in terms of being the most likely to heal venous leg ulcers (when compared with all other evaluated treatments). We used th e STATA methods described by Chaimani 2013 . We had planned to present two different networks: one for ind i- vidual treatments and a sensitivity analysis in which interv entions were grouped in broader clinically relevant categories. In pra ctice, there were many different dressings and a wide range of topica l agents too, and we decided, post-hoc, to restrict the main analys is to treatments that were considered most important and widely used. Selection of treatments for analysis was decided by two r e- view authors working independently, with guidance from a clin ical review author who had not seen the data.This set of intervent ions was termed the 'base-case network'. Interventions which were in the base-case sulfadiazine (SSD ), sucralfate, silver and zinc oxide. Only one of these - phenyto in - could not subsequently be joined into the network. Sensitiv ity analyses explored the impact of extending the number of treat - ments included or further restricting it (see Sensitivity analysis ). Comparisons of two eligible interventions not joined into t he network remained in the review and we reported the direct evi- dence.These included comparisons between a specied interven- tion such as cadexomer iodine, silver or honey and \"standard car e\" as well as comparisons between two individual interventions where one or both were only partly relevant to the network or could no t be joined to the network. There was a very large number of contrasts in the NMA and we decided to focus our reporting of the analysis rstly on result s for the network as a whole, and then in the 'Summary of ndings' ta - ble to report the treatment effect data for some specic treatm ent comparisons. This was done in order to maximise the clinical uti l- ity of the NMA and the accessibility of the review. We decided, post-hoc to focus on the two treatments with the highest probab il- ities for being one of the best treatments and to examine in de tail the results of their comparisons with three of the most common and widely used treatments (foam, hydrocolloid and nonadhere nt dressings). The results for all contrasts are also shown in for est plots. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity Assessment of statistical heterogeneity We assessed the presence of heterogeneity within each pairwis e comparison using the I\u00b2 statistic that measures the percentag e of variability that cannot be attributed to random error ( Higgins2003 ). We also took into account the overlap of condence inter- vals and the variability in the point estimates. We regarded effect estimates where an I\u00b2 was less than 50% as having low levels of heterogeneity, given the potential for wide condence interv als in pairwise comparisons within a network, which we had anticipate d may be sparse. Assessment of statistical inconsistency We assessed inconsistency in two main ways: determining local inconsistencies (around particular contrasts in the network) an d assessing inconsistency for the network as a whole. These test s are often underpowered so we carried out the assessment using the 90% signicance level. Local approaches to evaluating inconsistency T o evaluate the presence of inconsistency locally we used two mai n approaches. Firstly, we considered a loop-specic approach. Thi s method evaluates the consistency assumption in each closed loop of the network separately as the difference between direct and indi- rect estimates for a specic comparison in the loop (inconsistency factor, IF). Then, the magnitude of the inconsistency factors and their 90% CIs can be used to make inferences about the presence of inconsistency in each loop. We assumed a common heterogene- ity estimate within each loop. Secondly, we considered a 'node splitting' approach ( Dias 2010 ; Salanti 2014 ). This method was applied, singly, to each direct con- trast (called a 'node' by Dias 2010 ). A STATA routine was used to calculate an indirect estimate using the rest of the network, by running the NMA after excluding the direct evidence for that contrast. The indirect estimates were then compared with the re - spective direct estimates. For both approaches a ratio of risk ratios (RoRR) with its 90% CI was calculated for each contrast. If the CI excluded 1, there is statistically signicant inconsistency. We also considered whe ther the CI included 2 or more (or 0.5 or less). This would mean that the direct estimate could be twice as large (or half as big) as the indirect estimate, which is an indication of potential inconsis tency (Chaimani 2013 ). Where we detected serious inconsistency, either in the direct evi - dence or between the direct and indirect evidence for a contrast, we downgraded the evidence for that contrast. Global approaches to evaluating inconsistency We evaluated consistency in the entire network simultaneousl y, by extending the analysis to include an inconsistency model tha t omits consistency equations ( Dias 2013 ). This used a design-by- treatment interaction model, which allows for different tria l de- signs ( Higgins 2012 ;White 2012 ). This approach produced a set of inconsistency parameters. After tting the inconsistency mo del we tested the null hypothesis of consistency by globally testi ng the 17 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.set of inconsistency parameters using a global Wald test. This test may lack power and we considered a signicance level of P < 0.1. Inconsistency in the entire network was considered a reason for downgrading the certainty of the evidence which the network, as a whole, represented. Investigation of heterogeneity and inconsistency Where sufcient studies were available, we planned to perform network meta-regression (data permitting) or subgroup analy ses using funding source and risk of bias as possible sources of in- consistency or heterogeneity, or both. In the event we were abl e to perform an analysis using risk of bias as a possible source o f heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis We re-analysed the network with studies removed if they were considered to be at high risk of bias for any one or more of select ion, attrition or detection bias ( Appendix 3 ). We considered a sensitivity analysis to assess the possible i mpact of missing outcome data on the network estimates, via assessm ent of risk of attrition bias (as dened in Appendix 3 ), testing the assumption of imputation of no event for missing data. Where one or more studies were clearly outliers (i.e. in terms of direction or size of relative treatment effect, or both, or as fl agged in inconsistency testing), we had planned to conduct a sensitivit y analysis where the study was removed from the network, as lon g as the network was still analysable; in the event we did not ne ed to do this. We had planned to conduct a sensitivity analysis, in which dress - ings interventions were grouped in broader categories, with clini- cal guidance, but this was not conducted. Instead, we conducted two post-hoc sensitivity analyses for the base-case network: o ne restricted the dataset to a narrower set of clinically appropri ate in- terventions; the other included additional treatments outs ide the base-case, which reinforced the network with more links. The re- duced network excluded the following interventions which were included in the base-case: gentian violet, hyaluronic-acid with povidone iodine, nytoin and sucralfate. The expanded base-case added nine trials and th e following supplementary interventions to the base-case decis ion set: blood and growth factor (non-eligible intervention). We conducted this sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of strengthe ning the network through indirect evidence provided by comparisons of key decision set interventions such as saline gauze and hydrog el with these supplementary interventions. Quality assessment of evidence (GRADE) generated from the network meta-analysis (NMA)We summarised the ). The quality and cer- tainty of the data included in any synthesis model are key to de ter- mining the validity of the results and of inferences made. We e x- plored the application of GRADE methodology to NMA, focus- ing on the approach of Salanti 2014 . We assessed evidence quality in two main ways, for each contrast and separately, for the netw ork as a whole, in order to assess the quality of the ranking order . We assessed individual GRADE factors as follows. Risk of bias: contributions for each particular contrast were considered, and used to assess the overall risk of bias for tha t contrast. We assessed overall risk of bias per contrast and als o for the network as a whole (see Assessment of risk of bias in included studies ). Indirectness: this was assessed as without limitations because we did not identify any effect modiers. Inconsistency: at the level of the contrast, we considered both heterogeneity in the direct evidence for that comparison and inconsistency related to different routes of analysis for the comparison (e.g. direct versus indirect evidence). We noted that inconsistency can only be assessed where there is both direct and indirect evidence. GRADE inconsistency was assessed as a serious limitation if there was heterogeneity in the direct e stimate or inconsistency in the network with respect to that comparison. Very serious limitations were attributed to the comparison i f there was severe heterogeneity or severe inconsistency or limitations with both heterogeneity and inconsistency. At th e level of the network, we considered the global Wald test for inconsistency (see Data synthesis ;Assessment of heterogeneity ). T ests of this nature are typically underpowered, so a P value l ess than 0.1 was considered signicant. Additionally, if several contrasts showed direct and indirect results that would have le d to different clinical decisions, we considered inconsistency to b e present. Imprecision: at the level of the contrast, we assessed imprecision for each pairwise comparison using the GRADE default minimally important difference (MID) values of 1.25 and 0.75 for the RR. For contrasts that were not part of the 'core' of the network, we also took into account the number of events informing the direct evidence and considered it in relat ion to the optimal information size. At the level of the network, we assessed the overlap of the rankograms and the magnitude of t he SUCRA estimates. Publication bias: was assessed for each pairwise comparison using standard GRADE (where there were 10 or more studies); we used contour-enhanced funnel plots where appropriate to examine publication bias in the network as a whole. 'Summary of Findings' tables We presented the main results of the review in a 'Summary of ndings' table, reporting the results for a representative set of con- trasts, with one row for each contrast. We focused on interven- 18 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.tions which the SUCRA suggested were likely to be high ranked and the comparisons between these and commonly-used types of intervention. This table presents key information concernin g the certainty of the evidence, the magnitude of the effects for the co n- trasts examined, and the sum of the available data ( Schnemann 2011a ). The 'Summary of ndings' table also includes an overall grading of the evidence using the GRADE approach. For calculating absolute risk differences for the probability of heal- ing we used a 'control group risk', calculated as the median of the risks for the comparator across all direct evidence studies w ith these comparators.R E S U L T S Description of studies Results of the search Electronic searches identied 1836 records after deduplicatio n. Of these, we excluded 1024 after initial screening of title and ab stract. Full-text screening of 812 records led to the identication of 12 7 relevant reports of 78 studies (see Figure 1 ). 19 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.We included studies that compared two eligible interventions (see criteria for inclusion - interventions ( Types of interventions ). We also included studies that assessed only one eligible interv ention, but which provided linking for the network of eligible studie s. Therefore there were three types of included study: studies which compared two eligible interventions and which were included in the NMA; studies which compared two eligible interventions but which could not be joined into the NMA; studies which compared an eligible intervention with one or more ineligible interventions but which strengthened the network by linking other two or more eligible interventions . A total of 78 studies with 7014 randomised participants was in - cluded in one or more of these categories. An updated search in March 2018 retrieved 100 additional record s. Of these 23 required consideration in detail. T wo records were added as additional publications to studies already identi ed as excluded studies in the review. T en studies (11 records) could be clearly excluded (see excluded studies) and nine studies were ad ded toStudies awaiting classication . One study was added to ongoing studies (see Characteristics of ongoing studies ). Included studies There were 47 studies that we joined into the network with two relevant interventions as outlined in Data synthesis : (Armstrong 1997 ;Backhouse 1987 ;Banerjee 1997 ; Charles 2002 ;Dimakakos 2009 ;Fogh 2012 ;Gottrup 2008 ; Hanft 2008 ;Vanscheidt 2012 ;Vin 2002 ;Zuccarelli 1992 ). A further 13 studies ( Alvarez 2012 ;Beckert 2006 2012 ; Solovastru 2015 ;Tarvainen 1988 ), all assessed comparisons be- tween two eligible treatments, which could be linked to the net - work but where one or both interventions was considered to be only partly relevant and therefore only the direct evidence wa s considered, or the trial was included only in a sensitivity ana ly- sis. These interventions included dextranomer, A. Pinchinsensis ex- tract, sulphate a nd cel- Summaries of are provided in Appendix 4.There were a number of studies that evaluated relevant inter ven- tions but which could we could not connect into the network. This included the following studies that compared a particular treatment with 'standard care' (which was either not specied or included a range of different dressings or topical treatmen ts): Arnold 1994 ;Brown 1986 ;Michaels 2009 ;Steele 1986 . Other studies not joined into the network were Hokkam 2011 , which compared two interven- tions which did not otherwise link to the network: phenytoin w ith no treatment and Salim 1992 , which compared sulphadryl pow- ders to inactive powder. Summaries of these comparisons are al so provided in Appendix 4 . We included nine studies that had only one relevant intervent ion in an expanded base-case to strengthen the network ( Arenbergerova 2013 ;Biland 2011 ;Stacey 1997 ). These were all two-arm trials with one relevant intervention from t he base-case or partly relevant interventions such as emollient cr eam or an ineligible intervention. Summary details of all trials in the review are shown in Table 1 ; a summary of the status of individual studies within the revie w and the networks is shown in Table 2 , which clearly denotes which trials are included in the base-case and the sensitivity analys es and which are included only in the review and not in the network. Interventions Included studies evaluated a wide range of dressings and topi cal treatments. A total of 20 different types of dressings were e valu- ated; this included dressings which were impregnated with age nts such as ibuprofen, silver, povidone iodine or zinc oxide. Six teen different topical treatments were included. Although the maj ority of trials compared two dressings or two topical treatments (and most of these compared two dressings), some compared a dressing with a topical treatment (e.g. a hydrocolloid dressing compared with silver sulfadiazine (SSD)). A minority of trials compared a rms which included more than one treatment option and these in- cluded both dressings and topical treatments. The number and types of Interventions are fully detailed in t he effects of interventions section ( Effects of interventions ) and in supplementary tables ( Table 2 ;Table 3 ;Table 4 ), which also show the status of each trial in the review and network analyses. Characteristics of participants in included studies SeeCharacteristics of included studies for full details Most studies included only people with venous leg ulcers; six s tud- ies also included some participants with mixed aetiology or ar terial ulcers (although we excluded those with more than 25% of such 21 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.participants); in 10 studies it was not clear whether a minority of people with non-venous ulcers were included. The mean or me- dian age range reported for participants ranged between 46 an d 81 years. Almost all studies enrolled a majority of women; th ere were no single sex studies. The mean sizes of ulcers at baselin e varied by up to a factor of 10 but were typically between 5 cm\u00b2 and 10 cm\u00b2. The mean duration of ulceration at enrolment ranged between one month and 75 months. Many studies excluded par- ticipants with either any type of infection or with a specied se ver- ity of infection (typically requiring systemic antibiotics); on ly one study specied that the participant must have an infected ulcer at baseline ( Dimakakos 2009 ). Reporting of other types of ulcer characteristics such as level of slough or exudate was limited. A ll studies reported some use of compression although the method s and the specicity of the reporting of this varied. Characteristics of studies Where funding was reported, it was often industry funding by a manufacturer of one of the assessed interventions (30 studie s). However, a substantial number of studies reported no fundin g or did not report the funding source. A minority of trials report ed a third sector or public funding source. Most studies used part ic- ipants as the unit of both randomisation and analysis, only t wo reported data at the ulcer or leg level Caprio 1992 ;Stacey 1997 ), while a small number appeared to randomise at the level of the person but analyse at the level of the ulcer; in each case these we re dealt with in the \"Risk of bias' assessment. Follow-up ranged be- tween four weeks and 12 months but most trials had follow-up of three months or less. For more details on study characteristics see Table 1 . Excluded studies A large number of records were rapidly excluded after reading t he full-text. A list of these studies is available on request fro m the authors (see Figure 1 ). Some studies were excluded after more de- tailed consideration. These studies are listed with reasons for their exclusion in Characteristics of excluded studies . An additional ten studies were excluded from records retrieved by an update sear ch in March 2018. T wo studies are awaiting classication ( Belcaro 2011 ;Polignano 2010 ) from the original search. A further nine studies are awaitin g classication following an update search in March was identied in the update search ( Jull 2018 ).Risk of bias in included studies Allocation Risk of selection bias is assessed based on generation of rand omi- sation sequence and allocation concealment. Many studies were a t unclear risk of bias for one or both of these, most commonly for allocation concealment. High risk of bias for randomisation wa s documented for only one study where errors were noted to have compromised the process. However only a minority (20 studies) were considered to have a low risk of bias. The remainder did no t report the processes used clearly enough for us to determine th e risk of bias. The number of studies considered to be at low risk for allocation concealment was even lower, with only 12 considered to be clearly at low risk of bias. Blinding Many studies were at high or unclear risk of performance bias. A l- though only a minority (18 studies) were clearly at high risk, m any more had an unclear risk. Only 10 studies were considered to be at low risk. For detection bias, we observed a similar pattern al- though more studies clearly had outcomes determined by blinde d observers; 20 were considered to be at low risk of detection bia s. Incomplete outcome data T wenty-six studies were considered to be at high risk of attrit ion bias. However, a larger number had a low risk of bias and only t en were considered to be at unclear risk. Selective reporting Only four studies were at high risk of selective reporting bia s; a further 16 had an unclear risk in this domain; the remainder we re considered to be at low risk of bias. Other potential sources of bias Thirteen studies were considered to be at high risk from other forms of bias, mostly due to issues with the analysis. A furth er 27 had an unclear risk of bias, again primarily related to the rep orting of the analysis. All-domain risk of bias All-domain (overall) risk of bias was assessed for each study. I n total 51 studies were considered to have a high or very high all - domain risk of bias ( Figure 2 ) and 27 studies were considered to be at unclear or low overall risk of bias (these were grouped toget her for analysis purposes). No study was at low overall risk of bia s since all studies had an unclear rating for one or more domains. 22 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Effects of interventions See:Summary of ndings for the main comparison NMA evidence: proportion with complete healing Interventions and comparisons: base-case network and sensitivity analyses The base-case network comprised 47 studies assessing 22 interv en- (SSD ), su- cralfate and oxide). One study a three-arm trial ( Hansson 1998 ; hydrocolloid, nonadherent and cadexomer iodine). The to- tal number of comparisons was 49, encompassing a total of 4026 participants, who experienced a total of 1479 events (complete healing). The sensitivity analysis using an extended base case containe d 59 studies assessing 25 interventions in 5156 participants wit h 1925 events; added interventions were blood product, emollient cr eam and growth factor. This explored the impact of strengthening t he network with more links by including trials which contained an eligible intervention compared to one of three ineligible in terven- tions. An additional sensitivity analysis looked at a narrower set of 17 in- terventions assessed in 41 studies that included 3435 partici pants with 1331 events; removed povidone iodin e, octenidine and sucralfate. This explored the impact of restrict ing the network to a narrower set of interventions which excluded i n- terventions that are not widely used in clinical practice. In the base-case network, there were 31 different direct contras ts and 12 triangular loops; the extended base-case sensitivity a nalysis had 40 direct contrasts, 15 triangular loops and six quadratic loops; and the narrower network had 26 direct contrasts and 12 triangu lar loops. We carried out network meta-analysis for the base-case and the two sensitivity analyses ( Appendix 5 ). The extended base-case sen- sitivity analysis identied instability in the base-case res ults for contrasts of some treatments and in the rank order of treatmen ts. Additionally, in the extended base-case, the point estimates and condence intervals (CIs) for contrasts with sucralfate were of- ten considerably reduced compared with the base-case; and the direction of effect was reversed for most contrasts with hydrog el. This instability for some treatments is likely to occur because , in the base-case, the direct evidence (from single small studies) ha d an important contribution. As a consequence, we placed more re- liance on the extended base-case sensitivity analysis and ther efore report the results for this sensitivity analysis in the rest of the re- sults section. Full details and results for the base-case and bo th sensitivity analyses are given in Appendix 5 . The network diagram for the extended base-case is shown in Figure 3 . We weighted node (circle) size by the number of studies reporting each intervention and weighted the thickness of the edge lines according to the inverse variance of the treatment ef fect estimates for the direct evidence contrast ( Chaimani 2013 ). 24 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Network diagram - extended network, by risk of bias (3 categories)Key: green = low/unclear; yellow = high; red = very high overall risk of bias for the cont rast. The number of studies for each contrast is given in . Most treatments in the extended base-case were part of at least one loop ('core interventions') and eight interventions were 'ha nging' treatments ibuprofen dressing, octenidine, povidone iodine, s ucralfate and zinc oxide). Risk of bias for the extended base-case network We report risk of bias in three ways (see Methods: Assessment of risk of bias in included studies ): for each study, as the all-domain risk of bias - taking into account selection bias, detection bias, attrition bias, report ing bias and other bias; for each direct comparison of two interventions, as an overall risk of bias - taking into account the all-domain risk of bias for the studies (1 above) and the weighting in the meta- analysis for that comparison; for each contrast in the network (any pair of interventions in the network) as the overall risk of bias - taking into account the risk of bias for each direct comparison (2 above) and theirpercentage contributions to the network estimate. We also calculated the overall risk of bias in the network as a whole. All-domain risk of bias for each study is shown in Figure 2 . For the extended base-case network , we judged no included studies to be at low risk of bias and 21 at unclear risk of bias ( Backhouse 1987 ;Bishop 1992 ;Zuccarelli 1992 ). T welve were at very high risk of bias ( Arenbergerova 2013 ;Banerjee 1997 ; Callam 1992 1994 ;Sopata 2016 ;Taddeucci 2004 ; Thomas 1997 ), and the rest we assessed to be at high risk of bias. We grouped the low and unclear categories together. We have indicated the overall risk of bias for each direct compar- ison in the network diagram in Figure 3 , using colour for three risk of bias ratings: low/unclear (green), high (yellow), very hi gh 25 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.(red). There is a substantial amount of direct evidence at high or very high risk of bias. For selected contrasts in the network, w e calculated the overall risk of bias as described in Appendix 6 . Network meta-analysis results We examined the results in two ways: as risk ratios (RRs) with their 95% CIs for each intervention compared with every other intervention in the network (NMA effect estimates); and for the network as a whole, giving the rank order for the interventio ns in the network and the probability that a particular interventi on is the best, second best, etc treatment. There are 300 mixed treatment contrasts in the extended netwo rk, so we report results for the rank order rst, and then, for the NMA effect estimates, we focus on contrasts involving the top two treatments and three common and widely used treatments. InAppendix 5 , we report results for all contrasts in the extended network, and give the full rank orders for the base-case and the two sensitivity analyses. Extended base-case network The NMA generated results for 300 mixed treatment contrasts (i.e. all possible pairwise combinations of the intervention s). There were 40 direct contrasts, of which 32 were informed by only one study and the average number of events per mixed treatment con - trast was around six (1925/300). The data were sparse and there was uncertainty around the estimates. As a consequence of the sparseness in the network, only 55 of 300 contrasts had precise estimates. The majority of CIs were wide orvery wide, crossing at least one default minimally important differ- ence (MID); i.e. the value of 0.75 or 1.25 was included in the CI (seeSensitivity analysis , GRADE assessment). Fifty-four contrasts with precise estimates had the whole of the CI above the defaul t MID (i.e. the whole condence interval lay above 1.25), but 21 of these involved treatments for which the direct evidence com- prised one study and had small numbers of events in at least on e arm ('fragility'): this applied to contrasts with sucralfate. O verall, 89% of the contrasts were considered to have imprecise results: the exceptions (ignoring contrasts with ineligible intervention s) were silver versus each of the following: nonadherent, alginate, iodine, paste bandage, P MM and PMM silver. Ranking of treatments The NMA produced a large number of estimates. An alternative way of presenting and interpreting data from the whole NMA wa s to summarise using rankograms: data for each intervention we re shown as the probability that each intervention is the best, s econd best, third best treatment, etc. These probabilities are bas ed on uncertainty, reflecting the effectiveness from the network cont rasts and the precision around the estimates. The closer the probabi lity of a rank to 100% (or 0%) and the narrower the distribution acros s different ranks, the greater the condence in the ranking. Res ults are given in Figure 4 ,Figure 5 andAppendix 5 and summarised here, but must be interpreted in the light of the uncertainty a nd sparseness in the network. 26 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Numerically, sucralfate had by far the highest probability of be- ing the best treatment (93%), and saline gauze was most likely t o be the worst treatment (33%). However, the sucralfate ranking i s likely to be articially high: sucralfate is connected to the core of the network via hydrogel and the direct evidence for sucralfate ver- sus hydrogel involves one study with 43 (of 50) healing events for sucralfate and ve healing events for hydrogel. The NMA resul ts for all comparisons with sucralfate have very wide CIs and larg e point estimates. Consequently, sucralfate (versus other int erven- tions) has a high probability of having a very large effect est imate (at the upper condence limit), in turn leading to an articially high probability of being the best treatment. Silver also ha d a high probability of being among the most effective treatments (50% at rank 2). Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values were generally between 0.3 and 0.8, but one treatment had a SUCRA value of 1 or 0 (sucralfate was 1), with another two treatments having values of 0.9 or 0.1 (silver 0.9 and saline g auze 0.1). The rankograms for many treatments are broad and uninformat ive (Figure 4 ,Figure 5 ). Of the eligible interventions in the extended network, only ve had a maximum probability above 20%. Themean ranks for these treatments were: sucralfate 1.1, silver 2.7, hyaluronic acid plus povidone iodine 5.3, paste bandage 5.4 a nd saline gauze 23.0. Certainty/quality assessment of the evidence across the wh ole network Further details of information used for GRADE assessment can be found in Appendix 5 ,Appendix 6 andAppendix 7 . The risk of bias across the extended base-case network was esti- mated to be high ( Appendix 6 ). There appeared to be little incon- sistency in the network ( Appendix 7 ) and there were relatively few contrasts with conflicting results for direct and indirect or NMA estimates, so across the network we did not downgrade for incon - sistency. We downgraded the evidence once for imprecision: in addition to the sparseness (and probably as a consequence of it), there is some overlap of the individual rankograms (see Appendix 5). A contour-enhanced funnel plot is shown in Figure 6 . There does not appear to be a small-studies effect. Overall, we classe d the evidence for the whole network as being of low certainty (down- graded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). 29 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Figure 6. Contour-enhanced funnel plot for the extended bas e-case network showing comparison-specic pooled effect 25=zinc oxide Results and quality assessment for selected individual comparisons Here we focus on the treatment effect data for some specic treat - ment combinations to provide further insights into the resul ts of the NMA. We considered comparisons of sucralfate, silver, foam , hydrocolloid and nonadherent dressings. These represent th e two with the highest probabilities for ranks 1 to 3 in Figure 4 . (su- cralfate and silver) and three common and widely used treatmen ts (foam, hydrocolloid and nonadherent dressings). These widely used treatments were selected by authors who did not have know l- edge of the precise results of the network. The results for the ex- tended base-case are shown in Table 5 . We calculated absolute risk differences using the median risk for the comparator, whi ch was obtained from the risks for that comparator in all direct ev - idence studies. For all four comparators, the risk varied wide ly across studies. We report GRADE assessment of selected contras tsinSummary of ndings for the main comparison . Most of the evidence for these individual contrasts was of low or very low ce r- tainty. For the contrast of the two interventions with the highest mea n ranks - sucralfate and silver dressing - it is unclear whether t here is a difference in the probability of venous leg ulcer healing (RR 2. 80, 95% CI 0.88 to 8.97; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision). Silver dressings may increase the probability of venous leg u lcer healing, compared with nonadherent dressings (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.74; moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded for ris k of bias). This corresponds to an absolute risk difference of 346 more people healed per 1000 (95% CI 140 to 663 more), for a nonadherent median probability of healing of 242 per 1000. Although this contrast was assessed as itself representing m oderate- certainty evidence, it sits in the context of a network which was, overall, judged to represent low-certainty evidence, and shou ld 30 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.therefore be considered with appropriate caution. We also not e that many of the trials which contributed to the contrast (and the direct comparison) were at an unclear risk of bias. Therefor e, although there is no clear high risk of bias, there is also a lack of clarity about the true risk of bias. For each of six contrasts the low certainty of the evidence means it is unclear whether the intervention increases the probabil ity of healing; for two more the certainty of the evidence was very low : sucralfate versus foam dressing (RR 5.94, 95% CI 1.96 to sucralfate 95% CI 2.24 20.7); silver dressing versus foam dressing (RR 2.12; 95% CI 1.46 to 3.07); silver dressing versus hydrocolloid dressing (RR 2.32; 95% CI 1.58 to 3.41); foam dressing versus nonadherent dressing (RR 1.15; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.44); foam dressing versus (RR 1.10; 95% CI (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.29). In each of these six contrasts, the evidence was graded as low certainty; downgraded either once for imprecision and once for risk of bias (sucralfate erent) or twice for inconsistency (silver versus foam); or once for risk of bias and once for inconsistency (silver versus hydrocolloid). It is unclear whether there is a difference in the probability o f healing for the remaining two contrasts because the evidence is of very low certainty (downgraded for risk of bias (twice) and impre - cision (once) or for risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency): foam versus hydrocolloid; and hydrocolloid versus nonadhere nt dressing. The contrasts with sucralfate were informed by one s tudy with 100 participants in the direct evidence, with 43/50 events for sucralfate and ve events for hydrogel; we therefore downgra ded further for imprecision to allow for the fragility this invok ed. Comparison of results from the NMA with the direct evidence Of the eight contrasts with more than one study, ve had an I\u00b2 of 0%; the remaining three were downgraded for inconsistency; one was downgraded twice for inconsistency. Details are given i n Table 3 . D I S C U S S I O NSummary of main results We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) of dressings and topical agents for healing venous leg ulcers. The network inclu ded 59 studies with 5156 participants. The systematic review tha t un- derpins the NMA includes 78 RCTs involving a total of 7014 par- ticipants, comparing different dressings or topical agents or com- binations of treatments for the healing of venous leg ulcers. This included a range of treatments from the most widely-used cate- gories of dressings to experimental treatments assessed by a single research study. We treated each topical agent as a separate intervention, but grouped dressings by class as described in the BNF 2016 (e.g. alginates, hydrocolloids). There were many interventions, o ften involving small single studies with atypical or experimenta l treat- ments. In order to simplify and rationalise the NMA, we produ ced a list of important and more widely-used treatments with clini cal direction and input from review authors who had not seen the results. This led to the 'base-case' NMA, which we extended fol- lowing sensitivity analysis, adding three linking 'inelig ible' inter- ventions to obtain greater robustness. Alongside the analysis, we have applied a new method of GRADE assessment ( Salanti 2014 ), which allows us to view the results in the light of the certainty of their ndings. Using this approa ch, we found the evidence for the network as a whole was of low cer- tainty (downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision). The netwo rk presents results derived from 59 studies of 25 intervention s eval- uating 40 direct comparisons: we highlight the results from con - trasts involving the two treatments with the highest mean ra nks (sucralfate and silver): the majority of the evidence for indivi dual contrasts was of low or very low certainty, and was mainly down- graded for risk of bias and imprecision; there was a limited de gree of inconsistency for some contrasts (see Quality of the evidence ). In summary: overall ndings reflect the uncertainty of the component evidence and the sparseness of the network. For the network as a whole, the evidence was of low certainty. With so many interventions that appeared to have similar efcacies, there was considerable uncertainty in the middle ranks, but numerically two treatments had more than 50% probability of being the bes t (sucralfate and silver dressings); - see also Quality of the evidence . for the head-to-head comparison of these two treatments with the highest mean ranks, it is very uncertain whether ther e is a difference between sucralfate and silver dressing in the probability of venous leg ulcer healing (very low-certainty evidence); silver dressings may increase the probability of venous ulcer healing, compared with nonadherent dressings: RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.74 (moderate-certainty evidence in the context of a low-certainty network); in the other contrasts between these treatments with the highest probability of being best and the most widely-used dressing classes, it was unclear whether the intervention incr eased 31 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.the probability of healing; in each case this was low- or very lo w- certainty evidence characterised by wide condence intervals; one of the sensitivity analyses highlighted some instabili ty in key aspects of the network; this instability is likely to be due to sparseness. As a consequence, we reported the results of the extended sensitivity analysis. Overall completeness and applicability of evidence The studies included in the review do not represent all the stu dies which have been conducted on relevant interventions; substant ial numbers of studies were excluded because they did not report th e outcome of complete wound healing. However, this was an issue across treatments and did not appear to impact disproportiona tely on any particular treatment or comparison. As discussed below w e believe that this approach was the appropriate one for the pur pose of the review. The populations represented in the included studies appear r ep- resentative of the people who present with venous leg ulcers i n clinical practice in terms of age, gender and ulcer characteristics a t enrolment. However, although many studies specied character is- tics such as ulcer dimensions, duration and infection in inclusio n criteria or reported these in participant details, they were m uch less likely to specify or describe wound characteristics such as le vels of slough, exudate or necrosis. We identied a wide range of eligible interventions, and incl uded both dressings and topical treatments; specic dressing type s such as impregnated dressings and modern 'advanced' dressings we re well represented. We conducted sensitivity analyses in order to assess the stability of the network and the impact of decreasin g the number of included interventions to a smaller clinically-de - ned set, or expanding it in order to increase the amount of evidence available for key interventions which were particula rly poorly linked into the network. The review included a substantial number of studies not includ ed in the network; in particular, studies which compared specic in - terventions such as honey with standard care or choices of multi- ple treatments. The inclusion of these studies in the review m eans that they are easily identiable for researchers who may wish to conduct alternative analyses using this type of data. We belie ve that the choices we have made concerning data to include in the network meta-analysis are likely to maximise its relevance to clini- cal decision-making, but acknowledge that this is balanced again st the availability of only direct evidence for some comparisons. Quality of the evidence A high proportion of the included studies were considered to be at high risk of bias for one or more domains and a substantial num ber were at very high risk of overall bias. The principal reasons f or astudy to be considered at high risk of bias were lack of blinding of one or more groups of participants, professionals and outco me assessors, and attrition bias. However, many studies which w ere not considered to be at high risk of bias had unclear risks of bia s for several or even all domains. Therefore, even when a contrast h as not been downgraded due to high risk of bias in the contributio ns matrix, this does not mean that we are condent that there is a low risk of bias pertaining to the contrast, but merely that th ere is no known high or very high risk of bias. Many comparisons (the majority) were informed by a single tria l, and most trials were small and underpowered. Only a few com- parisons - between some of the most widely-used dressing type s - were represented by multiple trials and substantial numbe rs of participants and events. This is reflected in the wide condence intervals and therefore the imprecision of most contrasts in t he NMA. Some contrasts were also judged to be affected by inconsis- tency. These factors, together with high risks of bias, meant t hat many key contrasts were judged to be low or very low certainty while the network as a whole was judged to represent low-certai nty evidence. The inclusion criteria and the nature of the evidence included meant that we did not downgrade for indirectness and we also found no evidence of publication bias. Potential biases in the review process Although all the included studies were reported in English, w e ordered a number of full-texts in languages other than Englis h; including Polish, German, Portuguese, Dutch, Norwegian, Chi - nese, Italian and Spanish. These were ultimately excluded as they did not meet the inclusion criteria, but would clearly have been included if they had proved eligible. We searched a number of databases and checked the references of reviews and included studies; time constraints meant that t he planned searches of trials registers were not conducted. We fou nd no evidence of publication bias, and our focus on the single out- come of healing means that trials identied from registers we re unlikely to have data which would have led to their inclusion in the network. We found a relatively small number of unobtaina ble records; close examination of the records for these led us to con- clude that the studies they represented were unlikely to have been included in the review. This NMA and review focused on the outcome of complete heal- ing. The impact of including only studies reporting healing in this way was considerable; lack of these data was the single most com- mon substantive reason for excluding a study. Complete heali ng is the outcome which is most important to people living with venou s leg ulcers and therefore we believe that the decision to focus th e network on this outcome was the right one. Other reviews includ e studies that focused on other outcomes considered important to people with lived experience of the condition; this review sta nds alongside those syntheses and does not seek to replicate them . 32 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.There is potential for bias in our choice of base-case and sensiti v- ity analysis and also our choice of studies with only one eligib le intervention for the expanded base-case sensitivity analysi s. We made a post-hoc decision to focus on a base-case of interventions which were likely to be used in clinical practice. Clearly post-hoc decisions of this nature could be a source of bias in their impact on which interventions were included. However, no interventi ons were excluded from the review on the basis of this decision: com- parisons including interventions judged to be partly releva nt are included in the review and the direct evidence is available to th e reader. The decisions on which interventions should be include d in the base-case and the narrow sensitivity analysis were made on clinical grounds rather than on the basis of known results; the y were made independently by two authors, one of whom had no access to the extracted data at that point, and who were in almost complete agreement when the decisions were compared; where there was a disagreement a more inclusive approach was adopted . The effect of the approach adopted was to remove some of the noise in what was a sparsely-populated network and to increase our ability to examine the relative effectiveness of treatme nts rel- evant to clinical practice. Our updated search in March 2018 identied nine studies, which may be eligible for inclusion but which have not yet been incor- porated into the review. None of these was large in absolute t erms but the results of these studies may nevertheless have some i mpact on our sparse network. Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews We have been unable to identify any other NMAs examining dres s- ings and topical agents for healing venous leg ulcers. The high level of uncertainty around contrasts between most dressings reflect s that in the most recent NICE guidance ( NICE 2016a ) and the most recent report by the AHRQ ( AHRQ 2013 ); these reflect in part the ndings of a number of Cochrane reviews of individual types of dressing (see Why it is important to do this review ). The 2010 guidance by SIGN ( SIGN 2010 ) recommended the use of nonadherent dressings possible alternatives being hy drocol- loids, alginates or hydrogels. The results of the NMA do not co n- flict with this advice, suggesting broadly comparable efcacy for complete healing in these dressing categories. The nding that silver dressings may increase the number of ul - cers healed does not take account of the largest trial available for silver ( Michaels 2009 ). This is because both arms of this trial con- tained more than one treatment class (specically, silver-contai n- ing dressings and silver sulfadiazine (SSD)), and hence could not be integrated into the NMA. Michaels 2009 found no difference in overall healing between the silver and non-silver arms of t his study (an RR of 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06 at one year's follow- up), but we note that the 'silver' arm included 39% of participan ts receiving SSD, which may have substantially changed the effect i nthis study. Nevertheless, the data from this trial should be borne in mind when considering the results and when planning any furth er research on these treatments. A U T H O R S ' C O N C L U S I O N S Implications for practice The results of this network meta-analysis (NMA) are mostly nd - ings of low-certainty evidence for key comparisons. Although th ere was some evidence that silver dressings may increase the prob- ability of venous leg ulcer healing, compared with nonadheren t dressings, this needs to be seen in the context of the low certai nty of the network as a whole. We do not therefore believe that thi s evidence is a sufcient basis for treatment decisions. It is pos sible that the results may be affected by the studies which are awaiti ng classication and have not yet been incorporated into the revie w. The results of this NMA focus exclusively on complete healing; whilst this is of key importance to people living with venous l eg ulcers, clinicians may wish to take into account other patient-im- portant outcomes reported in other reviews on this subject, wh ilst cost considerations will also be a factor for decision makers. Implications for research There is a lack of high-quality research evidence relating to whe ther particular wound dressings or topical treatments have a bene cial impact on healing of venous leg ulcers. This is despite the exis tence of a large number of trials relating to a range of treatments. The poor or uncertain quality of the evidence is problematic given the impact on the lives of individuals of living with chronic wound s and the substantive healthcare implications of caring for them . The NMA's ndings of low-certainty evidence make clear the generall y poor quality of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of venous leg ulcer treatments, suggesting a need for radical improvements in the planning, conduct and reporting of trials in this eld. There was uncertainty surrounding most of the interventions eval- uated when we look at the rankings of their relative effective ness. Therefore, any future evaluations of interventions should focus - as this NMA does - on those most widely used in clinical practice; they may wish to look in particular at silver-containing dressi ngs. Where trials are conducted, they should be adequately powered t o assess differences in complete wound healing, which should ide - ally be reported as time-to-event data. Choice of secondary out- comes should be informed by consultation with people with live d experience of leg ulcers. T rials should adhere to internation al guid- ance on design, conduct and reporting of randomised trials. In particular, they should undertake and report adequate rando misa- tion and allocation procedures and blinded outcome assessment s, while losses to follow-up should be fully accounted for. 33 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Glossary of network meta-analysis (NMA) terms Arm-specic outcomes/arm-level data: raw outcome data (e.g. mean (SD) or risk) for each arm of the trial (s ee also treatment contrast ). Assumptions for NMA: in common with all meta-analysis, the true treatment effect acro ss trials is assumed to be described by a xed- effect orrandom-effects model .Additionally, transitivity is assumed and, concurrently, exchangeability andconsistency . Baseline risk: the absolute risk of the outcome in the 'control' group. This is affected by the presence of prognostic factors . Some authors have used the baseline risk as a proxy effect modier , but in general the effect estimate (RR/OR/HR) is independent of the baseline risk; on the other hand, the absolute risk differen ce depends on baseline risk. Bayesian approach: the explicit quantitative use of external evidence in the desi gn, monitoring, analysis, interpretation of a health- care evaluation. In the Bayesian paradigm, prior beliefs about parameters in the models are specied and factor ed into the estimation. Posterior distributions of model parameters are then derived from the prior informat ion and the observed data. In NMA, it is common to use non-informative priors for effect estimates. Coherence/consistency: the direct effect estimate (e.g. mean difference or log odds rati o) is the same as the sum of the indirect effect estimates. Connected network: a group of linked interventions, such that every trial in the n etwork has at least one intervention in common with at least one other trial. Sometimes individual comparis ons are not connected to the rest of the network (disconnected netw ork) and can sometimes be joined in by extending the network to inclu desupplementary interventions. Contour-enhanced funnel plot: contour-enhanced funnel plots show areas of statistical signi cance, and they can help in distinguishing publication bias from other possible reasons for asymmetry. In a network of interventions, each study estimates the relat ive effect of different interventions, so asymmetry in the funnel plot cannot be judg ed. T o account for this, an adaptation of the funnel plot can be used, in which the standard error is plotted against an adjust ed effect size for each study: the adjusted effect size for a compa rison is the study-specic effect size minus the mean for the meta-analysis f or that comparison. Contrast/study-level data: outcome data for the comparison (e.g. mean difference, odds rati o). Decision space/decision set: the interventions in the decision set are the focal treatments of interest to systematic review authors. Deviance Information Criterion (DIC): the DIC is a measure of the balance between model t (the posteri or mean deviance) and model complexity (the leverage ) and calculated as the sum of these two; the smaller the DIC, the better the model. DIC is often used to compare models, for example, comparing xed-effect and random-e ffects models. If there is an important difference in DIC betwe en models, there is evidence of heterogeneity. Direct evidence/direct comparison : head-to-head comparison of two treatments, for example, A ver sus B (see also indirect evidence ). Edge: line representing a direct comparison on a network diagram . Effect modier: effect modication occurs when the effect of A versus B (as the RR/OR /HR for binary outcomes) is signicantly different in two or more subgroups, and this leads to heterogeneity , either within trials or between trials, or both. Factors tha t give rise to subgroup effects are called effect modiers, and it is import ant to identify potential effect modiers and allow for them i n the analysis. The identication of signicant effect modiers may lead to str atication (separate analyses for each subgroup) or to a decisio n not to combine data from different trials in a meta-analysis. In gene ral, trials have different distributions of effect modiers (e.g. proportion of people with and without diabetes), leading to inconsistency between trials in the treatment effect. This is often magnie d when there is a network of different comparisons. 260 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Exchangeability: it is assumed that treatments in a NMA are exchangeable, so, if treatment B had been given to patients in the indirect A versus C trials and if A had been given in the B versus C indire ct trials, then the true AB differences in these indirect studie s would be identical to the true AB difference in direct A versus B trials, o r at least from the same common distribution. Furthermore, if patients in other trials within the wider linked network (e.g. D versus E trials) were given A and B, the AB differences would also be th e same or from the same distribution. This assumption breaks down w hen there are effect modiers . Fixed-effect: the true treatment effect is assumed to be constant across trial s (xed-effect) - see also random-effects andtransitivity . Global inconsistency: inconsistency across a network is described as global inconsiste ncy. It can be evaluated statistically by tting models that allow and do not allow for inconsistency. A 'leave-o ne comparison-out' approach, often called 'node splitting,' can also be applied, with each direct comparison being excluded from the net work and then estimating the difference between this direct ev idence and the indirect evidence from the network. Heterogeneity in a NMA: patients are not randomised to different trials. Therefore , there may be systematic differences in study characteristics or the distribution of patient characteristics a cross trials. If these characteristics influence the treatment ef fects (i.e. are effect modiers ), then there are systematic differences in treatment effects a cross trials, which is called between-trial heterogeneity. There may also be within-trial heterogeneity if there are sub groups of an effect modier for which results are reported sepa rately. In a NMA, the term, ' heterogeneity ' applies to variation in effect modiers within a single comparison (e.g. A versus B); the term, 'inconsistency ' refers to the imbalance in modiers between comparisons. Heterogeneity variance parameter ( \u00b2):in for each pairwise compa rison (e.g. A versus B) with variance ( \u00b2AB), but in a NMA we often assume that there is a common heterogenei ty amongst all the comparisons in the network; this common heterogeneity has a variance ( \u00b2), which is called the 'heterogeneity variance parameter'. It can be compared with empirical distributions of heterogeneity values typica lly found urner 2012 ). Inconsistency/incoherence: this occurs when the effect estimate derived from an indirect comp arison is not the same as the effect estimate derived from a direct comparison. For example, in a ne twork of three interventions, there is inconsistency if d AB(direct) dAB(indirect), where d AB(indirect) = d AC(direct) - d BC(direct); the effect estimates are given as mean differences or lo g (odds ratios/ risk ratios/hazard ratios). Note that in order to investigat e inconsistency there must be both indirect and direct evidence (lo ops in the network). See also global inconsistency . Inconsistency factor: this is the absolute difference between the direct and indirect estimates on the log scale (or the logarithm of the ratio of the two odds/hazard ratios) for one of the compari sons in a loop. A statistically low-powered z-test and a 95% CI of the inconsistency is computed to determine whether this difference is signicant. Indirect evidence/indirect comparison: comparison of two treatments, for example, A versus B, obtain ed from combinations of other comparisons (e.g. trials comparing A versus C and trials compari ng B with C) (see also direct evidence ). Indirect comparison meta-analysis: meta-analysis of a set of treatments that are linked via common comparator(s), but none are compared directly; evidence is combined in a single internally co nsistent model. Leverage: this is the effective number of parameters of the model, which i s calculated differently for xed-effect and random-effects models, with the latter having greater complexity. Likelihood (function): the likelihood function is a tool for inferring the underlyin g distribution of the observed data. T o do this, we propose a model to represent the data - often a parametric distribution is as sumed (e.g. binomial) - and unknown parameters of that distribution are determined, given the data, by maximising the likelihood (the larger the likelihood, the closer the mode l t). Loop (of evidence): combination of direct and indirect evidence, such that the interv entions in the network diagram can be linked to form a closed loop. Meta-analysis: a statistical synthesis of the results from two or more separa te studies. Methods involve calculating a weighted average of effect estimates from the separate studies. Mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis: another name for network meta-analysis . Model: a statistical model is a (simplied) mathematical representat ion of the system we wish to learn about, and which generates our observed data. The model will usually depend on some know n factors, such as other variables measured alongside the data , and some unknown parameters that we wish to determine. Then havi ng determined the unknown parameters, the model should be ab le to simulate data that are an approximation of the real data, all owing us to make inferences from the data. Multi-arm trial: individual trial that compares more than two interventions. It is important to take into account correlations within these trials in the analysis. Network: trials must be linked in a network of interventions, such that every trial in the network has at least one intervention in common with at least one other trial. Network diagram: graphical representation of the interventions in the networ k. It consists of nodes representing the interventions andedges representing the comparisons. The amount of available infor mation can be presented by 'weighting' the nodes and edges 261 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.using different node sizes and line thicknesses according to th e number of studies reporting that treatment or comparison re spectively. Other types of weighting are discussed in Chaimani 2013 . Network meta-analysis (NMA): NMA is the simultaneous combination of data from randomised co mparisons of multiple competing treatments (A versus B, A versus C, A versus D, B versus D, and so on), to deliver an internally consistent set of estimates whil e respecting the randomisation in the evidence. The use of indir ect estimates can provide information on comparisons for which n o trials exist. It can also improve the precision of the direct estimate b y reducing the width of the CIs compared with the direct evidence a lone. Node: intervention represented on a network diagram, usually by a circle of weighted size. Pairwise meta-analysis: meta-analysis of one or more trials of direct comparisons (e.g. A versus B) - see direct evidence . Prognostic factors: population or study characteristics that affect the risk of the o utcome. In a sufciently large randomised trial that is free from bias, prognostic factors are distributed evenly between intervention groups and do not affect the effect estim ate (RR/OR/ HR for binary outcomes) unless they are effect modiers , but they do affect the baseline risk and absolute risk difference. Random-effects: trial-specic treatment differences are assumed to be from a com mon distribution - see also xed-effect andtransi- tivity . Ranking: ordering of treatments according to their relative effectiven ess. Sparse data: data with wide condence intervals because of few events as a cons equence of small studies or short follow-up periods. Study-level data: seecontrast . SUCRA: Surface Under the Cumulative RAnking. This is a measure of the probability that the given treatment is the best. Thus, a SUCRA would be 1 (or 100%) when a treatment was certain to be the b est and 0 (0%) when a treatment was certain to be the worst. Supplementary set (of interventions): interventions added to the network to provide additional ev idence on relative treatment effects of the decision set . This may be to connect an otherwise unconnected network of treat ments, to increase the precision of the treatment effect estimates or to help address between-trial heterogene ity. Transitivity: NMA requires a transitivity assumption, such that there is no imbalance in the distribution of effect modiers across the different types of treatment comparisons (see also exchangeability ). 'Unadjusted' meta-analysis : meta-analysis of all the treatment arms for a particular trea tment (e.g. all A arms). This breaks the randomisation and should not be done.

Assessing risk of bias 1. Was the allocation sequence randomly generated? (Part of 'Selection bias') Low risk of bias The investigators describe a random component in the sequence g eneration process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling car ds or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots. High risk of bias The investigators describe a non-random component in the seque nce generation process. Usually, the description would involv e some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence genera ted by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rul e based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number. Unclear Insufcient information about the sequence generation proces s provided to permit a judgement of low or high risk of bias. 2. Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed? (Par t of 'Selection bias') Low risk of bias 268 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equ ivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central ing telephone, web-based and ce; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. High risk of bias Participants or investigators enrolling participants could p ossibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bia s, such as allocation based on: use of an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list o f random numbers); assignment envelopes without appropriat e safeguards (e.g. envelopes were unsealed, non-opaque, or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of bi rth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure. Unclear Insufcient information provided to permit a judgement of lo w or high risk of bias. This is usually the case if the method of co ncealment is not described, or not described in sufcient detail to allow a denite judgement, for example if the use of assignment enve lopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequ entially numbered, opaque and sealed. 3. Blinding - was knowledge of the allocated interventions a dequately prevented during the study? (Performance bias for blinding of participants and caregivers; detection bias fo r outcome assessors) Low risk of bias Any one of the following. No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome measurement are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding. Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, an d unlikely that the blinding could have been broken. Either participants or some key study personnel were not blin ded, but outcome assessment was blinded and the non-blinding o f others unlikely to introduce bias. High risk of bias Any one of the following. No blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or outcome m easurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding. Blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken. Either participants or some key study personnel were not blin ded, and the non-blinding of others likely to introduce bias. Unclear Either of the following. Insufcient information to permit judgement of low or high ri sk of bias. The study did not address this outcome. 4. Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? (Att rition bias) Low risk of bias Any one of the following. No missing outcome data. Reasons for missing outcome data are unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias). Missing outcome data are balanced in numbers across interventi on groups, with similar reasons for missing data across group s. 269 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcom es compared with the observed event risk is not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect est imate. For continuous outcome data, a plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes is not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the observed effect size. Missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods. High risk of bias Any one of the following. Reason for missing outcome data are likely to be related to the true outcome, with either an imbalance in numbers or reasons fo r missing data across intervention groups. For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcom es compared with the observed event risk is enough to induce clinically relevant bias in the intervention effect estimate. For continuous outcome data, a plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes is enough to induce a clinically relevant bias in the obs erved effect size. 'As-treated' analysis done with a substantial departure of t he intervention received from that assigned at randomisatio n. Potentially inappropriate application of simple imputatio n. Unclear Either of the following. Insufcient reporting of attrition/exclusions to permit a ju dgement of low or high risk of bias (e.g. number randomised not stated, no reasons for missing data provided). The study did not address this outcome. 5. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective ou tcome reporting? Low risk of bias Either of the following. The study protocol is available and all of the study's prespeci ed (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the prespecied way. The study protocol is not available but it is clear that the publ ished reports include all expected outcomes, including those th at were prespecied (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon). High risk of bias Any one of the following. Not all of the study's prespecied primary outcomes have been r eported. One or more primary outcomes is/are reported using measureme nts, analysis methods, or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not prespecied. One or more reported primary outcomes was/were not prespecie d (unless clear justication for their reporting is provided, s uch as an unexpected adverse effect). One or more outcomes of interest in the review is/are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis. The study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study. Unclear Insufcient information provided to permit a judgement of lo w or high risk of bias. It is likely that the majority of studie s will fall into this category. 270 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.6. Other sources of potential bias (Outcome reporting bias) Low risk of bias The study appears to be free of other sources of bias. High risk of bias There is at least one important risk of bias. For example, the study: had a potential source of bias related to the specic study desi gn used; or has been claimed to have been fraudulent; or had some other problem. Unclear There may be a risk of bias, but there is either: insufcient information to assess whether an important risk of bias exists; or insufcient rationale or evidence that an identied problem w ill introduce bias. Appendix 4. Summary of comparisons not included in the network Comparisons for which there is only direct evidence Standard care versus honey One trial compared honey with a range of other dressing types. Jull 2008 randomised 368 people to honey or standard care which included a number of different options. The risk ratio (RR) for complete healing was 1.12 (95% condence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.3 6). This was very low-certainty evidence, downgraded twice for risk of bias and once for imprecision. Standard care versus cadexomer iodine Three trials compared cadexomer iodine with groups treated wi th a variety of other treatments. Harcup 1986 ;Lindsay 1986 and Steele 1986 randomised a total of 157 people to either cadexomer iodine or a range of other treatments which could be classed as standard treatment. The pooled random-effects RR for healing was 5.16 (95% CI 1.56, 17.10; I2=0%). This is low-quality evidence, downgraded twice for imprecision due to wide condence interval s and low numbers of participants. Phenytoin versus no treatment One study Hokkam 2011 randomised 104 participants to phenytoin or no treatment (in a ddition to compression). The RR for complete healing was 1.25 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.74). There may be litt le or no difference between groups; this was low-certainty evid ence, downgraded twice for low numbers of participants and events an d wide condence intervals which include the possibility of harm as well as benet or no effect. Hydrocolloid versus either nonadherent or iodine One study randomised participants to either a hydrocolloid or a nonadherent or povidone iodine-based dressing. Arnold 1994 ran- domised 70 people. The RR was 0.79 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.48). This was very low-certainty evidence, downgraded twice for risks of bias and twice for imprecision. 271 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Sulphadryl versus inactive powder One study randomised participants to one of two sulphadryl po wders or to a third inactive powder group. Salim 1992 randomised 168 participants. The RR was 1.31 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.56). This was low-ce rtainty evidence downgraded once for imprecision and once for attrition bias. Silica gel bre versus either mepitel or mepilex One trial randomised participants to either silica gel bre dr essing or to treatment with either nonadherent or foam dress ings. Brown 2014 randomised 121 people. The RR was 0.63 (95% CI 0.31 to 1.26). Thi s is low- (or very low-) quality evidence, downgraded for lack of blinding (detection bias and maybe also performance bias ) and imprecision. Comparisons which were considered to be partly relevant clin ically and were not included in the network Cellulose versus nonadherent One trial randomised 48 participants to either a cellulose dre ssing or a nonadherent dressing ( Alvarez 2012 ). The RR was 0.92 (95% CI 0.38 to 2.22). This is very low-certainty evidence, downgrade d once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision. Shale oil versus hydrogel One trial randomised 119 participants to either shale oil or a hydrogel without the shale oil ( Beckert 2006 ) The RR was 1.49 (95% CI 0.82 to 2.68). This is low-certainty evidence, downgraded twice f or imprecision. Hydrocolloid versus collagen One trial randomised 96 participants to either a hydrocolloid dressing or a lyophilised collagen dressing ( Caprio 1992 ).The RR was 0.77 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.18). This is low-certainty evidence, downgr aded twice for imprecision. Papain versus hydrogel T wo trials randomised a total of 70 participants to either pap ain or hydrogel ( De Araujo 2016 ;Luiza 2015 ). De Araujo was a three-arm trial with a total of 63 participants which also randomised 21 p articipants to an ineligible intervention, a blood product; t he comparison between this and hydrogel was included in the expanded base-cas e sensitivity analysis. The RR for the comparison of papain wi th hydrogel was 0.94 (95% CI 0.25, 3.49; I2= 16%). This is very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for i nconsistency and twice for imprecision. Hydrocolloid versus magnesium sulphate One trial randomised 110 or magnesium sulphate ( Greguric 1994 RR was (95% CI 0.37 to 132.40). This is very low-certainty evidence, down graded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision. Hydrocolloid versus dextranomer One trial randomised 108 participants to hydrocolloid dressing or dextranomer treatment ( Kalis 1993 ). The RR was 0.77 (95% CI 0.37 to 1.60). This was very low-certainty evidence, downgrad ed twice for risk of bias and twice for imprecision. Silver versus non silver One trial randomised 208 participants to either a silver-base d or a non-silver-based dressing ( Michaels 2009 ). The RR was 1.05 (0.94 to 1.16). This was low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for ri sk of bias and once for imprecision 272 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Cadexomer iodine versus dextranomer T wo trials randomised participants to either cadexomer iodin e or dextranomer treatments ( Moss 1987 ;Tarvainen (95% 0.64 to 2.75; I2= 0%). This was very low-certainty evidence, downgraded twice for risk of bias and twice for imprecision. Ozonated oil versus emollient cream One trial randomised 29 participants to either ozonated oil o r an emollient cream without the ozonated oil ( Solovastru 2015 RR to 170.96). This was low-certainty downgraded twice for imprecision. A. Pichinchensis versus alginate One trial randomised 34 participants to treatment with eithe rA. Pichinchensis extract or an alginate topical treatment ( Romero-Cerecero 2012 ). The RR was to 2.70). This was low-certainty evid ence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision. Comparisons with tripeptide copper One three-armed study randomised participants to tripeptide copper, silver sulfadiazine (SSD) or an emollient cream withou t either active ingredient. The comparison between SSD and emollient cr eam is included in the expanded base-case network; the other two comparisons are summarised here. Tripeptide copper versus SSD Bishop 1992 randomised a total of 86 participants, of whom 57 were relevan t to this comparison. The RR was 0.07 (95% CI 0.00 to 1.26). This was low-certainty evidence, downgraded twice for imp recision. Tripeptide copper versus emollient cream Bishop 1992 randomised a total of 86 participants, of whom 58 were relevan t to this comparison. The RR was 0.33 (0.01 to 7.86). This was low-certainty evidence downgraded twice for imprecisio n. Appendix 5. Base-case and sensitivity analyses We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) for the base-case and th en carried out sensitivity analyses; one examined risk of bia s and the others investigated a restricted network and an exten ded network. For each network, we examined the results in two w ays: as risk ratios (RR) with their 95% CIs for each intervention comp ared with every other intervention in the network (NMA effect estimates); and for the network as a whole, giving the rank ord er for the interventions in the network and the probability t hat a particular intervention is the best, second best, etc treatment. 5.1 Base-case network The base-case NMA included 22 treatments , sucralfate and zinc oxide) and generated results for 231 mixed treatmen t contrasts (i.e. all possible pairwise combinations of the int erventions). There were 31 direct contrasts of which 24 were informed by only o ne study and the average number of events per mixed treatment contrast was around six (1479/231). Data were sparse and there w as uncertainty around the estimates. The network diagram is s hown inFigure 7 . 273 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Figure 7. Network diagram for the base-case, coded by risk of bias (3 categories)Key: green = low/unclear; yellow = high; red = very high overall risk of bias for the cont rast. The number of studies for each contrast is given in We summarised results for the base-case NMA as a whole using ran kograms: data for each intervention are shown as the probabil ity that each intervention is the best, second best, third best tre atment, etc. These probabilities are based on uncertainty, re flecting the effectiveness from the network contrasts and the precision aro und the estimates. The closer the probability of a rank to 100% (or 0%) and the narrower the distribution across different ranks, th e greater the condence in the ranking (see Figure 8 andTable 6 ). There was some overlap of the individual rankograms, illustrated in Figure 9 , which shows both the confusion, together with some indication that sucralfate, hydrogel and silver dressings may be the best tre atments and that the worst treatments may be saline gauze and hyaluronic acid. Across all treatments there was some uncertainty in the mi ddle ranking of treatments, although the mean rank of one tre atment (sucralfate) was close to 1 and the worst treatment was 21 (out of 2 2). Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values were generally between 0.2 and 0.8, but two treatments had a S UCRA value of 1 or 0 (sucralfate - 1, and saline gauze - 0), with ano ther treatment having values of 0.9 or 0.1 (silver 0.9). 274 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Figure 8. Rankograms for the base-case network showing the p robability that each intervention is the best, second best, third best treatment, etc. 275 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Figure 9. Rankograms for all treatments in base-case networ k showing the probability that each intervention is the best, second best, third best treatment , etc. Numerically, sucralfate had by far the highest probability of being the best treatment (91%), and saline gauze was most likel y to be the worst treatment (69%). However, the sucralfate ranking is like ly to be articially high: sucralfate is connected to the core of th e network via hydrogel and the direct evidence for sucralfate versus hydr ogel involves one study with 43 (of 50) healing events for sucra lfate and ve healing events for hydrogel. The comparison linking sucra lfate to the core of the network (hydrogel versus nonadherent) has two and one events respectively in a very small study (24 participan ts). The NMA results for all comparisons with sucralfate have ve ry wide CIs and large point estimates. Consequently, sucralfate (ver sus other interventions) has a nite probability of having a very large effect estimate (at the upper condence limit), in turn leading to an art icially high probability of being the best treatment. Examination of the results for each of the individual contrast s in the base-case NMA revealed that the majority of CIs were wid e or very wide, often crossing at least one default minimally impo rtant difference (MID); i.e. the value of 0.75 or 1.25 was include d in the CI (see Sensitivity analysis , GRADE assessment). Results for a representative set of contr asts are given in Table 5 , showing the three mostly highly-ranked treatments in the base-case networ k (sucralfate, hydrogel and silver dressings) and three common ly used treatments (foam, hydrocolloid and non-adherent dressings). S everal of the contrasts with sucralfate and silver had the whol e of the CI 276 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.above the default MID (i.e the whole condence interval lay abov e 1.25). In the case of sucralfate, the relevant direct evidence al so had small numbers of events in at least one arm, and was based on da ta from one direct study ('fragility'). We examined inconsistency in the base-case network as a whole, com paring consistency and inconsistency analyses. There was no signicant inconsistency (P = 0.566) ( Appendix 7 ). There may be inconsistency at a local level for one loop (foam-hyd rocolloid-silver) and for four contrasts: paste bandage versus alginate; paste bandage versus foam; silver hydrocolloid silver v ersus foam (Appendix 7 ). 5.2 Pre-specied sensitivity analyses We conducted the planned sensitivity analysis according to risk of bias, restricting the network to those studies at low or uncl ear risk of bias. Only 15 studies with eight interventions (nonadhere nt, alginate, foam, hyaluronic acid plus PMM, saline gauze and silver dressings) remained, but they w ere joined in a network. For most contrasts, the point estimates showed a smaller effe ct and the CIs were wider (data not shown). The exceptions to this w ere comparisons with nonadherent dressing, for which the point es timates were larger. Mean ranks were in the order (highest rs t): silver (mean rank 2.3), hyaluronic acid plus povidone iodine (2.7), PMM (4 .0), hydrocolloid (4.2), foam (4.3), alginate (4.6), nonadherent (6.4), saline gauze (7.5). Rankograms were broad with the excepti on of saline gauze. The sensitivity analysis reinforced the ndings of the base-case network, but with less precision, although effect estimates appeared smaller. We did not conduct the second pre-specied sensitivity analysis (a ssuming an available case analysis rather than imputing no ev ent for missing values) because more than two thirds (32/47) of studie s were not judged to be at high risk of attrition bias, and few o f those that were had differential missing data. We then carried out two post-hoc sensitivity analyses, describ ed below. 5.3. Sensitivity analysis: narrow dataset The narrow dataset included 41 studies (of 47 in the base-case) in 3435 participants with 1331 events. This encompassed 17 pov idone iodine, SSD, and zinc oxide) in 26 direct contrasts and these informed 1 36 mixed treatment contrasts; only six contrasts were informe d by more than one study. There were 12 triangular loops. Rankograms for the narrow dataset sensitivity analysis are shown in Figure 10 and the mean rank and SUCRA value, probability at the maximum and rank at the peak in Table 6 . There was slightly more of a distinction between interventi ons, but still overlap of rankograms and only saline gauze had a SUCRA value of 0 or 1. Ev en in the absence of sucralfate, the mean rank order was the same as that for the base-case. 277 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Figure 10. Rankograms for the narrow sensitivity analysis s howing the probability that each intervention is the best, second best, third best treatment, etc. The results for the same set of individual contrasts as the bas e-case are given in Table 5 . These are very similar to those for the base-case. In the narrow network as a whole, there signicant incons istency (P-value 0.273, c.f. base-case 0.566). At the local level, th e same four contrasts suggested inconsistency as in the basecase, with identical RoRRs. Again the foam-hydrocolloid-silver loop had inconsistency, with the same RoRR as the base-case ( Appendix 7 ). There was little asymmetry in the funnel plot. 5.4 Sensitivity analysis - extended base-case The extended base-case dataset included three additional trea tments to give more links via ineligible and partly relevant interventions (blood product, emollient cream and growth factor), in order to con vert 'hanging' treatments to 'core' treatments (especially hy drogel and saline gauze), thus reinforcing the network. The network d iagram for the extended base-case, including 'Risk of bias' jud gements is shown in Figure 3 . There were 59 studies (c.f. 47 in the base-case) in 5156 participa nts with 1925 events. This encompassed 25 different interventions in 40 direct contrasts and these info rmed 300 mixed treatment contrasts; only eight contrasts were informed by more than one study. There were 15 triangular loops and six qu adratic loops. Results for individual mixed treatment contrasts in the exte nded base-case are shown in Figure 11 ;Figure 12 ;Figure 13 ;Figure 14 ; Figure 15 ;Figure ;Figure ;Figure 18 ;Figure 19 ;Figure 20 ;Figure 21 . The results for the same set of contrasts as the base-case are given in Table 5 and some differences were found. In particular, all contrasts w ith sucralfate (except sucralfate versus hydrogel, which was unchanged) showed considerably smaller point estima tes in the extended base-case and much narrower condence interva ls. Secondly, contrasts with hydrogel had point estimates favour ing the comparator, rather than hydrogel as found for the base -case; the exception to this was the contrast hydrogel versus silver, whi ch had a point estimate more in favour of silver in the extended base-case. CIs for contrasts with hydrogel were much smaller for the exten ded base-case. The other contrasts in Table 5 had very similar results for the extended base-case as the base-case. 278 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Rankograms for the extended base-case sensitivity analysis a re shown in Figure 4 and the mean rank, SUCRA value and peak probability and its rank in Table 6 . The combined rankograms chart is shown in Figure 5 : the distinction between interventions was similar to that of the base-case, but the silver treatment had a higher probabi lity at the maximum (50% versus 38%) and saline gauze and hydro gel had approximately half the peak probabilities of the base-case (33 % and 20% respectively). Sucralfate had a SUCRA value of 1, but no other treatment had a value of 1 or 0. Importantly, the extended bas e-case showed that the mean rank for hydrogel was considerably l arger than for the base-case (16.9 compared with 8.9) and hydrogel no lo nger had a peak probability of being the second best treatment , instead it was most likely to be ranked 20th best. Otherwise t he mean rank order was the same as that for the base-case. This in stability for some treatments is likely to occur because in the base-case the direct evidence (from small studies) had an important contribut ion. In the extended base-case network as a whole, there was no signi cant inconsistency (P value 0.326, c.f. base-case 0.566). For node- splitting, the same four contrasts suggested inconsistency as for the basecase, with very similar RoRRs. Again the foam-hydr ocolloid- silver loop had inconsistency, with the same RoRR as the base-cas e (Appendix 7 ). There was little asymmetry in the funnel plot ( Figure 6). In view of the instability in the base-case network and its depe ndence on small studies in critical positions, we decided to repo rt the results of the extended base-case sensitivity analysis in the main text and the 'Summary of ndings' table. Appendix 6. Risk of bias in the network The percentage contributions to the mixed treatment contrasts from each direct contrast are shown in Table 7 for the extended base- case network contrasts comparing all combinations of silver, su cralfate, non-adherent, foam and hydrocolloid, these were obt ained by applying the CINeMA web tool ( CINeMA 2017 ). We calculated the risk of bias for each contrast in the NMA (based on the direct evidence); risk of bias for each mixed treatment contra st is shown in the last row of Table 7 (seeAssessment of risk of bias in included studies ). The contributions to the whole network from each direct contrast were not available from the web tool, but we estimated the ris k of bias for the whole network to be high, based on a chart showing co ntributions to all the mixed treatment contrasts ( Figure 22 ).

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Appendix 7. Inconsistency in the base-case network and sensitivit y analyses 7.1 Inconsistency in the network as a whole We conducted both consistency and inconsistency analyses. The lat ter gave the following results for the base-case network and th e two sensitivity analyses. Base-case network: the P value for the 10 inconsistency paramete rs all being zero was 0.566 and Chi2(10) was 8.64 (i.e. no signicant inconsistency). Restricted base-case network: the P value for the 10 inconsisten cy parameters all being zero was 0.273 and Chi2(10) was 12.19 (i.e. no signicant inconsistency). Extended base-case network sensitivity analysis: P value for 17 inconsistency parameters all being zero was 0.3259 and Chi2(17) was 19.05 (i.e. no signicant inconsistency). 7.2 Inconsistency for each contrast in the extended base-ca se (local inconsistency) We report local inconsistency for the extended base-case only. Fi rstly, we examined inconsistency factors, comparing results fr om the direct evidence with those from the indirect evidence for each cont rast informed by a loop. We report results as the ratio of risk ratios (RoRR), with its 90% condence interval (CI) for the 15 triangular loops and six quadratic loops ( Table 8 ), assuming a common heterogeneity estimate within each loop (the rst set of resul ts inTable 8 have the same values as the base-case). At the 90% signicance level, there appeared to be inconsistency in the foam-hydrocoll oid-silver loop (RoRR 2.44, 90%CI 1.23 to 4.84). The results als o suggested some non-signicant potential inconsistency in all o ther loops (because the 90% CI crosses 2 or 0.5 or both). Secondly, a node-splitting approach was taken. The results fol lowing node-splitting for indirect and direct NMA estimates fo r the extended network are shown in Table 9 , together with the ratio of risk ratios (RoRR) (indirect/direct ) with its 90% CI (the 90% signicance level was chosen for this test because of its lack of po wer). The 'indirect' estimate is the result when the NMA is run i n the absence of the direct evidence for that contrast. This is only mea ningful if the two interventions in the contrast are joined in directly through the rest of the network; therefore, we report node sp litting results for only 28 (of 40) direct contrasts. We made the following observations: Results for four contrasts suggested inconsistency at the 90% ndence level: paste (RoRR 1.97, 90% CI to 3.55); silver versus hydrocolloid (RoRR 2.50, 90% CI 1.26 to 4.95) and silver versus foam (RoRR 0.40, 90% CI 0.20 to 0 .79). There was potential for inconsistency for eight other contrast s (with the CI including either 0.5 or 2, or both): hydrobre vers us nonadherent (RoRR 1.09, nonadherent CI 0.39 to 8.7 ). The contrasts linked to ineligible interventions also show ed potential for inconsistency (see Table 9 ). However, all the CIs were wide and there was uncertainty aroun d whether there was inconsistency or not. 287 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.

D I F F E R E N C E S B E T W E E N P R O T O C O L A N D R E V I E W The following decisions were made which represent differences between the review and the published protocol ( Norman 2017 ). Establishment of a narrower base-case of interventions for th e main network: after mapping the network of eligible interv entions we made the decision to restrict the network to interventions i n use in clinical practice rather than primarily research contexts . This both increased the clinical relevance of the results of the analy sis and rendered it more amenable to analysis. The number of i ncluded interventions remained high, and was further increased by a s ensitivity analysis using an expanded data set to examine th e stability of the network. Studies which were not included in the network r emained in the review and are summarised by direct evidence. We additionally conducted a sensitivity analysis using a narrow er set of interventions which were more widely used. We also made the decision to treat as excluded studies those tri als which included only one relevant intervention and which did not perform a linking function in the network; we had planned to li st these as included studies with limited data extraction. Thi s was a pragmatic decision made because of the large number of these st udies; they are instead clearly identiable in the list of excl uded studies. We had considered performing a grouped analysis which would ha ve looked at wider groupings of dressing types. Experience ( Westby 2017 ) suggested that this was unlikely to provide useful additio nal information so we did not conduct this. We had planned for the potential to conduct various sensitivit y analyses which were not in practice appropriate, full details of these are nevertheless provided in the methods. We had planned to search trials registers and to contact review g roups working on ongoing relevant reviews. Time constraints due to the very large number of identied studies meant that this wa s not undertaken; however a full update search was conducted and all other reference cross-checking was undertaken. 289 Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.
