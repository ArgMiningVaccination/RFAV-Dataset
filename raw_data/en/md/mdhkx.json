Available: [42 Birds](https://42birds.com/collections/yoga-accessories) HOW WE CHOSE ECO FRIENDLY YOGA ACCESSORIES Props are meant to keep your body safe and supported when attempting poses you may not be ready to do unassisted. Outside of functionality, this is what we looked for in these eco friendly yoga accessories: Materials: Many of the props that help you perfect your daily ashtanga practice can be made with [sustainable fabrics](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-fashion/sustainable-fabrics/), like fabric](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-fashion/what-is-hemp-fabric/), and recycled or [organic cotton](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-fashion/why-organic-cotton/). For foam-based blocks, EVA and ABS are two non-toxic varieties, but they still don't have nearly as good end-of-life prospects as cork blocks. For pillows and bolsters, we looked for recycled fibers or natural materials, like organic cotton, buckwheat hulls, and plant seeds. Since materials are key with this particular product line, we also sought out third-party certifications to ward against [greenwashing](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-living/what-is-greenwashing/). Textile Standard Recycle Standard (GRS)](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/global-recycle-standard/) Supply chain & labor practices: Many of these brands use traditional crafting techniques, locally sourced materials, and small supply chains through which they provide employment opportunities for disadvantaged folks, rural artisans, and women. For larger brands, we look for transparency in the form of factory locations and statements regarding the fair treatment and safe working conditions for their employees. For those whose manufacturing details were a little lacking, we'll reach out to learn more. - Certifications: [Fair trade](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-living/what-is-fair-trade/), [SGS](https://www.sgs.com/en/knowledge-solutions/certification) Green business practices: Going beyond sustainable materials really helps us find zen. That's why we sought brands providing an option for repairing or upcycling old yoga mats, shipping eco friendly yoga props plastic free, and accounting for their impact by supporting [carbon offset programs](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-living/best-carbon-offset-programs/). Inclusivity: We always feel extra empowered (by which we mean more thigh burn) in goddess pose knowing our practice is aided by women-owned and operated companies. Community & charitable giving: We (hand)stand behind brands that are all about karma. Yoga [brands that give back](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-living/brands-that-give-back/) are staying true to the practice and its spiritual roots. Many of these companies donate products or time to various environmental and social organizations. FINAL THOUGHTS ON ECO FRIENDLY YOGA PROPS If you're in need of a block, bolster, or blanket, avoid those that stretch the limits of our planet's resources. Especially since it's so easy to replace plastic and foam with natural alternatives. Did we help awaken your chakras? Or rather provide some degree of enlightenment on what makes a sustainable yoga prop? If you're not all the way there yet, that's okay\u2014just like yoga, [sustainable living](https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-living/what-is-sustainable-living/) is a journey that's all about doing what you can. If you know anyone else who could benefit from namastaying away from unsustainable props, feel free to spread the word at your next yoga class. "}
