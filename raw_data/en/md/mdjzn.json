The word homeopathy means \"like suffering\" and is based on the natural law of like cures like. Homeopathic remedies are made from natural substances that if taken in toxic doses cause the same symptoms (mental, emotional and physical) that they cure. Most people think that Hippocrates was the father of allopathic medicine, but it was he who said in 500 BC, \"Through the like, disease is produced and through the application of the like it is cured.\" Unlike allopathic medicine that tends to mask or manage symptoms, homeopathy works by stimulating our own innate ability to heal ourselves. It brings the body back into balance so it can no longer sustain the illness. Even Louis Pasture, after his discovery of bacteria said, \"The micro-organism is nothing, the terrain is everything.\" Homeopathy works in almost every condition of man (and animal). It is very effective in chronic disease, such as cases of chronic sinusitis, ear infections, bronchitis, headaches, irritable bowel, MS, Lupus, chronic fatigue, PMS, menopause, and many other chronic conditions, homeopathy not only restores health, but also prevents the reoccurrence of the condition. Homeopathy also works well for mental and emotional conditions such as grief, depression, ADD, ADHD, Autism, anxiety, and panic attacks. Homeopathy's success comes from addressing the underlying cause of why one is susceptible to becoming ill in his or her unique way. The choice of remedy is based on the whole individual. Even if a person has many complaints only one remedy is chosen to address the totality of symptoms. Often when we see our physician with many complaints we are told that there is no connection. To the homeopath it is that very connection that leads us to the correct remedy for that particular person, and the ONE remedy that is chosen addresses ALL the symptoms. What can you expect from a homeopathic consultation? Because a homeopath must consider the totality of the case, and look at patterns and connections that reveal the remedy, the initial consultation takes 1\u00bd to 2 hours. Typically the first follow-up is 4 to 6 weeks later. Western New York is fortunate to have a homeopathic pharmacy at the Himalayan Institute at 841 Delaware Ave. in Buffalo, so remedies are easily obtainable. If you are discouraged by your present state of health and are looking for a change, try homeopathy- an old system of medicine for a new millennium. "}
