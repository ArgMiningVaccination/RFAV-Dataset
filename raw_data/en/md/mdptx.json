Our goal is to identify the source of the problem and not just treat symptoms. We are dedicated to the use of innovative and current evidence-based methods for preventative care and the diagnosis and treatment of health conditions. In our plan of care, we pay attention to multiple aspects of each individual's lifestyle such as environment, sleep, exercise, nutrition, stress. Integrative medicine allows us to use several different methods for the prevention and management of health conditions. These include vitamins, supplements, herbs, essentials oils and prescription medicines when required. EXPERIENCED PROVIDERS IN INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE What is Integrative Medicine? Integrative Medicine is a field of medicine that emphases care for the whole person (mind, body and spirit). In addition one of the primary goals is to foster a collaborative relationship between provider and patient. Integrative Medicine is also the meshing of both conventional and complementary and alternative care, also known as CAM. These forms of care can be used separately or in combination of each other to impact health in the best way possible for each individual patient. How are we different? Columbus Integrative Family Medicine Center, or CIFMC, offers an integrative approach to health and wellness. Our physician and nurse practitioner are board certified and have many years of experience in health care. Please see their bios for more details listed under [Our Team](https://cifmcenter.com/our-team/). More About Integrative Medicine Integrative Medicine is a term that describes physicians who utilize mainstream medical nutritional and complementary medicine. Depending on the patient's individual needs, Dr. Ruslana Kurpita and her team utilize both nutritional supplements and pharmaceuticals in the management of our patients. Columbus Integrative Family Medicine Center offers an \"integrative\" approach to health and wellness. Our practitioners are board-certified in traditional and alternative medicine. Dr. Kurpita has been in practice as a holistic physician for over twenty years and is a pioneering figure in alternative and anti-aging medicine. As integrative medicine physicians, our approach uses the best and most effective modalities from both the conventional Western allopathic medical model and alternative systems of practicing medicine, and seeks to determine the root cause(s) of illness, rather than merely focusing on relieving symptoms. We view health as a positive and vital state, not just as the absence of disease, and believe that each patient must be viewed as a unique individual who exists in a \"matrix\" of their history and genetics; psychological, emotional, and spiritual states; and their physical and social environments. Integrative medical doctors place primary importance on this patient-centered approach. We seek to listen to and understand each patient in our care, and firmly believe in the importance and healing efficacy of a strong, mutually respectful doctor-patient relationship. Among the many health issues, we address are: hormone balancing and natural bio-identical hormone replacement therapy; immune and autoimmune disorders; heavy metal toxicities in the body; assessment and treatment for depression, anxiety, and insomnia; nutrition and weight management; chronic gastrointestinal disorders; chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia; and adjuvant supportive therapies that can be given during cancer treatment. As experienced providers in Integrative Medicine, holistic medicine and anti-aging medicine, we place a strong emphasis on prevention of disease, particularly those associated with what has been perceived as the \"normal\" aging process, and maintaining optimal wellness of mind, body and spirit throughout all stages of life. Our goal is to help each patient achieve vibrant wellness by promoting healing on all levels: physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. "}
