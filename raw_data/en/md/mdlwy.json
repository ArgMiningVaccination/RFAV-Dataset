While it is not surprising that practitioners of alternative or complementary medicine accept this concept, even some quantum physicists acknowledge the existence of an electromagnetic field generated by the body's biological processes. Scientists accept that the human body generates electricity because living tissue generates energy.\" - Caroline Myss Because all matter is energy, there are a variety of evolving techniques that can be used and applied in medical practice. Health is based on an ebb and flow of energy. Molecules have unique vibrational energy states as do all the organs and tissues of the body. Chinese medicine has been applied this way for thousands of years through the Acupuncture meridian system and the practice of Qi Gong & Tai Chi.

There are a variety of diagnostic systems that are evolving. One of these involves assessing the acupuncture meridian system. If we can detect disturbances in the etheric body before physical disease develops, then we have the basis for a whole new level of preventive medicine, which we have never really "}
