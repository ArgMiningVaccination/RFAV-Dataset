A user asked the spiritual guru as part of his fitness series Ask Deepak Q & A series the reason behind the urge to sleep during meditation. \"If you fall asleep consistently in every meditation, it means that you are sleep deprived and your body is taking advantage of this opportunity to get the rest it needs. Usually, this situation sorts itself out after a week or two of meditating,\" says Deepak Chopra. Chopra says the instant solution is to go to bed earlier and get a full night's sleep on a regular basis. The spiritual guru says there is no need to worry about sleeping while meditation as that might be what an individual's body requires at the moment. \"In the meantime, don't worry about sleeping in meditation. It is what your body needs right now, so that is what is a priority. Once the backlog of sleep deprivation is cleared away, you will be ready for an alert meditation experience,\" he says.
