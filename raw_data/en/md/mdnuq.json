Located in the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains near Thousand Oaks, this nurturing oasis provides a great respite from the city and is just 20 minutes from Malibu. A Shiatsu Massage is both relaxing and energizing, as the therapist applies acupressure (finger pressure), along the body's meridian channels to release blocked energy and to stimulate the body's natural healing processes and restore overall well-being. This Japanese healing therapy combines acupressure, stretching and compression as well and is performed with the guest wearing loose clothing (provided by the spa in your treatment room).

The Huntington Spa is the only luxury hotel spa in Los Angeles to offer treatments based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) at its spa within, Chuan Body + Soul, which is based on the five life elements (fire, earth, water, metal and wood) and Chinese healing principles. This holistic approach begins by having you fill out a questionnaire to determine which life element is out of balance, and which essential oils, incense, candles, teas and juices are used in your treatment. The Tao of Detox is a total rejuvenating package that cleanses, increases your energy flow and leaves you with a greater sense of well-being. The treatment begins with a luxurious full body exfoliation to stimulate blood and lymph circulation. After rinsing off, a laminara algae wrap infused with aromatherapy oils is applied and you are cocooned to intensify the detox process, while your therapist gives you an invigorating scalp massage. After another rinse off, tension is eased throughout your body with an acupressure massage to release energy blocks. You'll then have a few moments to hydrate in the Dream Room and enjoy cucumber water, teas and snacks, before being whisked away for a Sea & Senses Facial. This unique facial uses hot and cold marine stones in combination with a mineralizing marine algae mask.
