The Division of Integrative Medicine operates largely through the [UA Center for Integrative Medicine](http://integrativemedicine.arizona.edu/). Designated a \"Center of Excellence\" by the Arizona Board of Regents in 2008, the Center is internationally recognized for its innovative educational programs, clinical practice model, and research that substantiates the field of integrative medicine and influences public policy. Since the Center's creation as the Program in Integrative Medicine by integrative medicine pioneer Andrew Weil, MD, in 1994, its vision of making integrative care available to all is being realized worldwide: Center graduates are now guiding more than four million patients to take a greater role in their health and healing.
