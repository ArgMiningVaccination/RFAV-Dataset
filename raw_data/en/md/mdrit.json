What People Are saying If you are wondering whether you should try this out, do it! \"Not only does it work wonderfully, but I feel great knowing that it's safe for all the members of my household. There's nothing more satisfying than knowing a single bottle can tackle any of your cleaning needs...Wash your face, then your fruit, then your sink, then your laundry all with the same soap. The switch was so easy and I never have to worry about 50 different chemical cleaning products all under my sink again.\" alicia s. My only complaint is that I haven't started using the products SOONER! \"No one should be comprising their health with chemical-laden products. For anyone hesitant about the price, think of this as an investment! Yes, one bottle of \"cheap\" cleaner SEEMS like the better value, but then you are constantly repurchasing various cleaning products, whereas Branch Basics is an all-in-one solution and will likely last you many months! Try the Starter Kit you will not be disappointed!\" Monika Completely safe and outrageously effective. \"I've used Branch Basics for 2 years now and I'm never going back. I love supporting a company with an ethical core. Marilee, Kelly, and Allison are incredible educators and advocates! You learn so much through their content and social media. Branch Basics cleaner is just one step to a healthier lifestyle, one that these women explain and demystify for the average consumer.\" Kristina Honestly I cannot rave about these products enough! \"I am not one to write reviews, but this deserves 10000 reviews over. I've been looking for great natural cleaning products for over 5 years, have tried pretty much every product on the market (including making my own), and nothing compares. I literally use them for everything now, and the best part is I don't have to have a million and one different products (my minimalist/OCD-ness LOVES that lol!). Honestly could not recommend these enough!\" Maddy Branch Basics is AMAZING!... I'm just so thankful that a company GETS IT! \"Wow! Just WOW! I became chronically ill about 12 years ago. When I say I'm VERY picky about what I bring into my home I'm serious. I've had the hardest time even with the \"healthy\" products out there. Branch Basics is seriously AMAZING! Our clothes are soo much brighter! There's no smell which is important, but it still smells clean. Overall I'm just so thankful that a company GETS IT!! Thank you for creating truly great products that are healthy and WORK!!\" Lexi Life-changing. Literally. \"I've tried every green cleaning product I could get my hands on. I found exactly ZERO that cleaned well. The final straw was when I was scrubbing my bathroom nearly in tears because I had such a bad headache. I started researching, and wondered how many chronic headaches have been due to nasty chemicals in my house. Total house purge going on currently, and I've purchased the Branch Basics starter kit. I've tested on all sorts of messes, and let me tell you: this. stuff. works.\" Rachel No longer put on gloves and make the kids leave the room to clean! \"These have changed the way I view my housekeeping. I no longer put on gloves and make the kids leave the room to clean! I can easily keep my home tidy without fear of the effects of harsh chemicals. Not to mention this works better than any products I've tried!\" Robin Women on "}
