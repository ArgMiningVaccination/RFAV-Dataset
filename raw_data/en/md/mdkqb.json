{"title": "Understanding the duration and mechanisms of long-lasting protection of nasal vaccines in rainbow trout", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Mucosal vaccines provide many advantages over injected vaccines. However, for a mucosal vaccine to be commercialized, long lasting protection need to be elicited Additionally, the mucosal vaccine should stimulate both mucosal and systemic immunity. Teleost fish are constantly exposed to bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic pathogens. Disease outbreaks limit the sustainability and productivity of the sector. Prevention through vaccination practices is the most environmentally friendly and safe way to control these outbreaks. Yet, the implementaiton of mucosal vaccines in aquaculture is very limited due to the lower efficacy and shorter protection of oral and bath vaccines compared to injected vaccines.Our laboratory has pioneered the discovery of nasal immunity in fish and the development of nasal vaccination for use in aquaculture. Over the past years we have demonstrated the high efficacy (equal or better than injected vaccines) of nasal vaccines in salmonids. Whereas it is clear that nasal vaccination in trout elicits extremely potent and rapid innate immune responses both in the nasal environment as well as systemically, we require a deeper understanding on the duration and immunological basis of specificity. Thus, this project aims to understand the adaptive immune responses at the B and T cell receptor levels that take place following nasal vaccination in trout. These studies will be able to reveal how specific adaptive immunity is established in the nasal environment as well as in far away mucosal sites (gut) or systemically. By comparing immune responses genetically identical fish (isogenic) we decrease inter individual variability in the B and T cell receptor responses, allowing us to perform cleaner comparisons among treatments. Once this is done, comparisons with hatchery outbred fish will be performed, a key step to translate these findings to the real world and the aquaculture industry.", "sitename": null, "date": "2017-01-08", "cleaned_text": "Progress 08/01/17 to 07/31/21 Outputs Target Audience:We have reported our results to the entire scientific community via peer review publications and conference presentations as well as the general public via social media @DrSalinaslab Changes/Problems: Nothing Reported What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?Under this reporting period, Dr. Ma, postdoctoral researcher at the Cain laboratory, University of Idaho, has had the opportunity to develop data analysis and manuscript writing skills through mentoring by Dr. Salinas and Dr. Cain.

Further, she developed a new course for UNM Biology, DIseases of Aquatic Organisms, that she taught again in Spring 2021 and includes apect of fish vaccinology. Finally, under this award, graduate student Amir Mani has received training in fish immunology. Dr. Salinas also organized the 2nd Virtual North American Comparative Immunology Workshop in June 2021. How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?Dr. Salinas has not attended in person conferences due to the pandemic but she has presented results from this award via virtual seminars. First, she gave a 1 hour seminar for the University of Arizona School of Animal and Comparative Biomedical Sciences Seminar Series in March 2021. We have one manuscript under review and one in preparation that will be submitted to Developmental and Comparative Immunology. Dr. Salinas also shares results via her Twitter account @DrSalinaslab with more than 2500 followers. What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals? Nothing Reported Impacts What was accomplished under these goals? We have completed all goals of this proposal. We have the last manuscript to write where we will report the responses in the gut to nasal vaccination. We have found that the responses depend on the type of vaccine, with ERM triggering stronger gut responses than IHN. Another important accomplishment has been the determination of how long the protection lasts following nasal vaccination with two different types of vaccines. Our results are currently under review and show how the live attenuated IHNV vaccine generates longer lasting immunity than ERM vaccine when delivered intranasally. Finally, overall, our project has been instrumental at generating baseline knowledge on salmonid repertoires, including the annotation of the B cell repertoire of newly published trout genome and a new nomenclature for the entire community.

Changes/Problems: Nothing Reported What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?The PD has largely benefited from this award because it helped her receive the Reagents Lecturer Award at the University of New Mexico. This is a 3 year award that is given to 2 Associate Professors in the entire College of Arts and Science to recognize excellence in research. Additionally, a postdoctoral researchers at the University of Idaho have been involved in data analysis and manuscript writing. At the University of New Mexico, one graduate student has received academic training under this award. He has completed the first year of his PhD program and will advance to candidacy in the next few months. Finally, a visiting PhD student from China who came to the PD's lab with her own fellowship, has benefited from this project by receiving training on nasal vaccines. How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?We have disseminated results via: - Peer reviewed pulbications - Two conference presentations - Two Invited talks/seminars - Social media via de PD's Twitter account @DrSalinaslab What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals?We are currently analyzing all the repertoire datasets that have already been sequenced. These datasets will be used to produce at least two manuscripts: one of TCR repertoire and one on BCR repertoire. The analyses will include repertoire changes in distant mucosal sites in response to nasal vaccination using the two vaccine models proposed in the grant. This is something completely unknown thus far since we currently have no idea about protection of other mucosal regions following nasal vaccine delivery. Impacts What was accomplished under these goals? We have completed all the fish experiments as planned, all tissues have been collected, RNA isolated and Illumina libraries prepared. We only need to complete the bioinformatics and statistical analysis to be able to compare gut and nasal B and T cell repertoire responses.

How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?As mentioned before: - Invited talks given by the PD (Irene Salinas) - Conference presentations (ISDC) - Formation of a salmonid B and T cell repertoire annotation and nomenclature consortium led by Dr. Susana Magadan (funded by this project) in collaboration with Dr. Mary-Paule LeFranc, Pierre Boudinot and Aleksei Krasnov. This group is continiously curating the trout and salmon repertoire genes database which is publicly available to IMGT What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals?We will continue to analyze the remaining of the repertoire sequencing data as planned. All libraries have been sequenced so we need to analyze the data and produce one or two more manuscripts. Additionally, we are currently writing a paper with Dr. Cain's laboratory summarizing the results from the long term vaccination trials. Impacts What was accomplished under these goals? In the last year we have made great progress towards the main goals of this project. Our long-term vaccination trials have been finalized and we have reached the following conclusions: - IHNV Nasal vaccination provides significantly higher protection than injections vaccination after 6 months of primary immunization - ERM Nasal vaccinations provides poorer protection than injeciton vaccination after 6 months of primary immunization - IgM specific titers in serum for IHNV and ERM are poor correlates of vaccination protection. Titers decrease from 6 months to 12 months.

We have submitted an abstract for the 14th ISDCI Congress and we will be giving an oral presentation there in June 2018. Changes/Problems: Nothing Reported What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?PhD student Ali Sepahi was able to visit Dr. Cain's laboratory, learn about large aquaculture facilities and trained the Cain lab on how to perform nasal vaccinations. How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?We presented our results at GIS2018 in Portugal as described before. We have also submitted abstracts to the 14th ISDCI Congress in Santa Fe, June 2018. What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals?We will continue with all three aims as planned. For AIM 1, we will challenge fish in June and collect all serum and mucus samples (6 months post vaccination). Then we will do a final sampling at 12 months post-vaccination to finalize this aim. We wil also collect tissue samples in RNA in order to confirm VH usage and clonotype expansions identified in isogenic fish (AIMS 2 and 3). The bioinformatics analysis of IgM repertoire are almost complete so we will focus on submitting our first publication in sumer of 2018. Meanwhile, we will continue with IgT and TCR VH analyses and data interpretation. Impacts What was accomplished under these goals? AIM 1: We have performed all vaccination trials proposed in this Aim with Dr. Cain at the University of Idaho. Ali Sepahi from the PD's laboratory visited Dr. Cain's laboratory in December 2017. Rainbow trout were vaccinated with each of the nasal vaccination preps (IHNV and ERM vaccines) according to procedures outlined previously (Tacchi et al, 2014). Since vaccination in December, all fish have been kept on a maintenance ration (approximately 1.25-1.50%BW/d) and have appeared healthy with minimal losses. To determine long-term immunity, fish will be challenged in June 2018 (six months post immunization), and protective immunity determined. Additional subgroups will be maintained out to 12 months to determine if specific antibody titers are maintained. AIM 2: We have performed two separate vaccination trials using isogenic fish fromt the Swanson line developed by G Thorgaard. We have performed all samplings and collected all tissues as proposed. We have performed all the RACEs, PCRs and Illumina Sequencing proposed for both IHNV and ERM vaccination via the nasal and injection routes. Illumina sequencing included B cell V domains specific for IgM and IgT. We have completed the IgM analysis comparing the diversity of the repertoire in NALT and spleen in control, intranasally and intraperitoneally vaccinated trout. We are preparing a manuscript at the moment with all our findings to be submitted to Plos Pathogens in summer 2018. The analysis of the IgT sequences is more problematic than that of IgM due to the presence of high numbers of sterile transcripts or incomplete V's and also due to the fact that most clones identified are not very big (not expanded). Additionally, annotation of IgT V domains is not as accurate as that of IgM because the lack of annotation of these Vs in the current version of the trout genome and in IMGT. However, the sequencing protocol has worked properly and there are no issues regarding the lab technique that need to be fixed. In order to solve the problem, we are going to reanalyze the data using the second version of the trout genome that soon will be released and also we are going to collaborate with Dr. Tom Kepler at Boston University. He is able to infer germline configurations of V genes based on trasncriptomic data and he has agreed to do this using our datasets. AIM 3: As explained in AIM 2, all animal experimentation has been completed. We have used the RNA samples from the same two vaccination trials and developed the deep sequencing protocol specific for TCRa and TCRb. We will be analyzing the results once the analysis for the B cell repertoire (aim 2) has been completed. The TCRa locus is not well annotated in IMGT and therefore we will have to perform some annotation work prior to being able to analyze our results.
