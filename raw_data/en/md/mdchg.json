There are nine Ratnas and eight uparatnas (sub-gems) mentioned in Ayurvedic treatise. Definition (yurvedapraka, 5/2) The thing which attracts people who wish to become rich, is called Ratna or Gem stone. We can find references to various Ratnas in textbooks of rasashastra. kenpi no likhyate | A gemstone or gem (also called a precious or semi-precious stone, or jewel) is a piece of attractive mineral, which-when cut and polished-is used to make jewelry or other adornmentsThe gems are precious stones, having a special kind of shining. In Hindu belief, the ratnas mitigate the bad effects of Navagrahas. The 9 gems The nine Ratnas mentioned in our classics are associated with the nine Grahas.

The effect of respective gems to specific Grahas is already explained in the table above. Every cell in the human body is ultimately made up of electrons and nucleus. Just like the electrons orbit round the nucleus, so do the planets revolve around the Sun.

These gems can draw energy from their particular Graha and channelize them into the wearer's body. Thus they correct the deficit aura and help to subside the disease. If this method of Dharana (Wearing) of Ratnas can be such a boon to cure diseases, it has another facet of mitigating and rejuvenating the body through internal administration as well.

Significance of Pishti Ratnas are well known to be of Sheeta guna and are heat sensitive. In order to preserve their Sheetatva , Anagni puta is given by triturating them in liquid media and exposing to Sun till the required Lakshanas are obtained. By this method, not only is its potency preserved but one can convert them into nanoparticle size which is desired for better absorption and assimilation. Types - Khanija Trunakanta mani, Sangemusha.
