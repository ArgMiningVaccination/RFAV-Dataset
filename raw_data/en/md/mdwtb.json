Background Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a major public health care issue worldwide and one of the principal causes of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is easily transmissible through perinatal, percutaneous, and sexual exposure {World Health Organization (WHO) 2015b}. Following acute HBV infection, 5% to 10% of adults and up to 90% of children fail to produce an immune response adequate to clear the infection; these individuals become chronic carriers of the virus {Zuckerman 1996}. Individuals who develop CHB are at substantial risk of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and HCC, which will afflict 15% to 40% of patients with CHB in the absence of effective treatment {World Health Organization (WHO) 2015a}, {Ratnam 2006}. Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths globally, with the highest burden of disease found in regions where HBV is endemic {Global Burden of Disease Cancer Collaboration 2015}. Recent reports estimated that 250 to 350 million individuals were living with HBV (ie, are hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]- positive) in 2010, representing a worldwide prevalence of 3.6%, with considerable geographic variability {Schweitzer 2015}, {World Health Organization (WHO) 2015c }. In 2015, an estimated 654,000 deaths were due to HBV infection and associated complications, placing it among the top 20 causes of mortality worldwide {G. B. D. Mortality Causes of Death Collaborators 2016}. The loss of HBsAg, accompanied by seroconversion to anti-HBsAg, is the accepted endpoint for anti-HBV therapy endorsed by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, the European Association for the Study of the Liver, and the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver allowing for cessation of therapy {European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) 2017}, { European Association for the Study been associated with improvements in liver histology, including the reversal of cirrhosis, a decreased risk of HCC, and prolonged survival, and is considered evidence of a functional cure {Benias 2011}, for CHB treatment, providing durable suppression of viral replication that results in long-term clinical benefits with a reduced risk of liver complications {Dienstag 2003}, {Liaw 2011}, {Lok 2013}. However, treatment with rarely results in clearance of HBsAg {Kwon 2011}. Thus, new treatment options that enhance rates of HBsAg clearance are needed; such treatments will allow patients to discontinue life-long oral antiviral (OAV) therapy and provide a finite-duration treatment option for a functional cure. A finite therapy is expected to be applicable to a broader population of those chronically infected with HBV, including immunotolerant patients who are currently untreated. The host immune response to HBV infection plays a pivotal role in whether acute infection is resolved or becomes chronic. Individuals who are able to clear HBV infection spontaneously following an acute infection display a vigorous, polyclonal, HBV-specific cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ and In contrast, CHB is Selgantolimo d Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Gilead Sciences, Inc. Final Original associated with a limited and dysfunctional CD8+ T-cell response, as well as impaired natural killer (NK) cell antiviral function {Peppa 2010}, {Rehennann 2005}. Suppression ofHBV DNA with NUC analogues has been associated with overall improveme nts in the ability of the immune system to respond to HBVantigens {Evans 2008}, {Mizukoshi 2004}, {Sherman 2013}. The suppression also results in the reduction of regulato1y T-cells, an increase in HBV-specific CD8+ T cells and reduction in exhaustion markers (such as programmed cell death protein 1 [PD-1]) on CD8+ T cells {Evans 2008}, {Shennan 2013}. These improveme nts, however, are modest and do not result in durable immune control with loss of HBsAg in the majority of treated subjects. However, further control of HBV viral antigens with HBV DNA suppression and the enhancement of vims-specific immune responses, may theoretically enhance rates of durable control ofHBV. 1.2. General Information About Study Drugs 1.2.1. General Information About Selgantolimod CONFIDENTIAL Page 27 04 March 2021 Selgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Gilead Sciences, Inc. - 1.2.2. General Information About Nivolumab Original Nivolumab (Opdivo\u00ae, BMS), an anti-PD-I immunoglobulin (Ig)G4 antibody, is approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and is under development for other malignancies including lung cancer and HCC. The clinical dose of nivolumab is 3 mg/kg intravenously (IV) eve1y 2 weeks, though initial dose ranging studies in melanoma demonstrated equivalent receptor occupancy of peripheral lymphocyte PD-1 at doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg {Topalian 2012}. In those studies, clinical effect for melanoma subjects was observed at all doses tested. The lowest doses of 0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg were not associated with Grade 3 or 4 serious adverse events (SAEs) or Grade 3 or 4 AEs of special interest (including autoimmune AEs) and had lower rates of treatment-related Grade 3 or 4 AEs compared with higher dose groups. CONFIDENTIAL Page 28 04 March 2021 Selgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Gilead Sciences, Inc. Final Original Nivolumab has also been studied in a single dose study in hepatitis C vims (HCV) (N = 45) with dose ranges of 0.03 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg { Gardiner 2013}. The majority of AEs were Grade 1 or 2 with a single Grade 4 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation in the highest dose evaluated . All immune-related AEs were mild to moderate and resolved without intervention. Reductions in HCV RNA were modest and seen in 5/45 (11 % ) of treated subjects at doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg, although the highest dose of 10 mg/kg induced a> 4 log10 reduction in HCV RNA in 3 subjects (n = 20 total at this dose). Nivolumab has also been evaluated for HCC (related to HCV, HBV or neither), where a subpopulation of 66 HBV-infected subjects with HCC were dosed with nivolumab at doses of 0.1 mg/kg to 3.0 mg/kg IV eve1y 2 weeks. No subjects with HBV in either the dose escalation phase or in the expansion phase discontinued treatment due to study drng toxicity. Among the HBV-infected subjects with HCC who received 3.0 mg/kg IV eve1y 2 weeks (n = 51), no subjects experienced Grade 3 or 4 ALT/aspaiiate aininotran sferase (AST) increases and 6% (n = 3) experienced a Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse event (AE) {El-Khoueiiy 2017}.

Risk/Benefit Assessment for the Study Final Original Chronic hepatitis B remains a global health concern with significant morbidity worldwide. The loss ofHBsAg with seroconversion is the gold standard endpoint for anti-HBV therapy and allows for cessation of treatment {European Association for the Study of the Liver 2012}, {Lok 2009}. Loss of semm HBsAg is associated with improvement in both the rates of liver cinhosis and the development of HCC in patients with CHB, and in is the ultimate goal of treatment, it occurs at a ve1y low rate and over several years: less than 1 % of patients treated with nucleoside analogues achieve clearance of HBsAg. Thus, new treatment options that enhance rates of HBsAg loss with seroconversion are needed. Selgantolimod Selgantolimod treatment alone have been evaluated in multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies in both healthy volunteers and subjects with CHB. The longest duration of treatment were evaluated in 2 Phase 2 studies, GS-US-389-2024 (NUC-suppressed subjects with CHB) and GS-US-389-2025 (treatment-naive subjects with CHB), that administered placebo, SLGN 1.5 mg, or 3 mg once weekly with a NUC for 24 weeks to 93 subjects with CHB. Selgantolimod up to 3 mg once weekly was safe and well tolerated in 102 subjects with CHB ( 48 subjects in study GS-US-389-2024 and 54 subjects in study GS-US-389-2025) . Based on pooled safety review of the SLGN studies, 3 potential AD Rs related to SLGN of nausea, v01niting, and iridocyclitis were identified . Majority of these ADRs reported have been Inild or moderate in CONFIDENTIAL Page 33 04 March 2021 Selgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Original CONFIDENTIAL Page 34 04 March 2021severity. To mitigate the impact of ADR of nausea and vomiting for SLGN, the use of antiemetic (eg, ondansetron) is allowed in the study. A Grade 2 iridocyclitis (in the SLGN 1.5-mg dose group) was the only SAE reported that was considered related to SLGN by the investigator and led to early study drug discontinuation. This occurred in a subject who tested positive for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 haplotype, a genetic risk factor associated with various immune disorders including anterior uveitis. No Grade 3 or 4 AEs considered related to SLGN treatment have been reported in the studies, except for 1 Grade 3 AE of rhinorrhea considered possibly related by the investigator that was reported in study GS-US-389-2025. Additional safety results can be found in the IB for SLGN. Nivolomab Nivolumab treatment alone have been well characterized and listed in the approved product label for nivolumab {OPDIVO 2021}. These risks generally result from off-target immune responses and occur in a dose-dependent manner with higher doses and longer durations of treatment leading to higher rates of AEs. In this study, nivolumab will be dosed at 1/10th of the clinically approved oncology dose used and only 1 infusion every 4 weeks over 24 weeks. Reducing the amount of drug and frequency given is expected to lead to a lower risk for AEs. This has been demonstrated in 2 Phase 1 studies in subjects with CHB, GS-US-330-1938 and GS-US-493-5342 (ongoing), for a single and multiple IV dose(s) of nivolumab 0.3 mg/kg every 4 weeks for 12 weeks, respectively. The IV dose(s) of nivolumab 0.3 mg/kg was safe and well tolerated in 22 subjects with single dose and 12 subjects with multiple doses. No Grade 3 or 4 AEs or laboratory abnormalities were observed or reported. The only nivolumab-related AEs as determined by the investigator were fatigue, headache, and cough in subjects administered a single dose and nausea and dysgeusia in subjects administered multiple doses; all were reported in 1 subject each. VIR-2218 VIR-2218 is an siRNA that targets a specific sequence in the HBV virus. The safety and tolerability of VIR-2218 has been evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1/2 study, VIR-2218-1001, that evaluated single doses of VIR-2218 up to 900 mg administered subcutaneously in healthy subjects (Part A) and a regimen of 2 doses administered 4 weeks apart at doses up to 200 mg in subjects with CHB (Part B/C). In Part A, 59.5% of VIR-2218 subjects (22 of 37) and 50% of placebo subjects (6 of 12) had at least 1 AE, each of which was Grade 1 or 2 in severity with the exception of a single Grade 3 AE of respiratory tract infection (considered not related to study drug). The most common AEs in VIR-2218 subjects were headache (24.3%; 9 of 37 subjects), and upper respiratory tract infection, contact dermatitis, injection site bruising, and injection site pain (8.1% each; 3 of 37 subjects). Three VIR-2218 subjects (8.1%) had AEs considered related to study drug by the investigator, including headache, injection site pain, and abdominal pain, each of which was Grade 1 in severity. Seven VIR-2218 subjects (18.9%) had injection site reactions (ISRs). All ISRs were Grade 1 in severity and resolved within 12 days of onset. In Part B/C, 54.2% of VIR-2218 subjects (13 of 24) and 25% of placebo subjects (2 of 8) had at least 1 AE, each of which was Grade 1 or 2 in severity with the exception of 1 Grade 3 nonserious AE of hypophosphatemia (considered not related to study drug), a known ADR of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) with which the subject was receiving treatment. The most Selgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Original CONFIDENTIAL Page 35 04 March 2021common AEs in VIR-2218 subjects were headache (25.0%; 6 of 24 subjects), and dizziness, fatigue, and myalgia (8.3% each; 2 of 24 subjects). Five subjects (20.8%) had AEs considered related to study drug by the investigator, including headache, injection site pain, and pyrexia, each of which was Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Two VIR-2218 subjects (8.3%) each had 1 ISR. All ISRs were Grade 1 in severity and resolved within 3 days of onset. Injection site reactions were reported in the 50-mg and 100-mg dose cohorts. One treatment-emergent (TE) SAE was reported in Study VIR-2218-1001 in a subject administered 100 mg VIR-2218. The SAE of headache was Grade 2 in severity and considered related to study drug by the investigator, but the sponsor determined that the constellation of concurrent symptoms (fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and dehydration) were more consistent with a viral syndrome than a drug reaction and assessed the event as not related to study drug. Two subjects had a non-TE SAE considered not related to study drug by the investigator; 1 subject had depression and 1 subject (outcome of death). The death occurred approximately 9 months after last study drug administration. Selgantolimod + Nivolumab In an ongoing Phase 1b study, GS-US-493-5342, the combination of SLGN 3 mg oral once weekly plus nivolumab 0.3 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks for 12 weeks have been evaluated in 12 subjects with CHB. The combination treatment for 12 weeks was generally safe and well tolerated. The most common (> 1 subject) AEs considered possibly related to study drugs by the investigator were nausea (n = 6), vomiting (n = 5), headache (n = 2), diarrhea (n = 2), and fatigue (n = 2). To mitigate the risk of nausea and vomiting, the use of antiemetics (eg, ondansetron) is allowed during the study. No Grade 3 or 4 AEs were reported, and no Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities were observed. A single Grade 4 laboratory abnormality of elevated lipase was reported in 1 asymptomatic subject at posttreatment Week 4 that resolved to below upper limit of normal (ULN) 12 weeks later. Selgantolimod + Nivolumab + VIR-2218 The risk of SLGN plus nivolumab with VIR-2218 is unknown. In nonclinical studies, the primary finding for both SLGN and nivolumab was inflammatory cell infiltrates of various organs and tissues; an anticipated pharmacological effect of each of the single agents. With SLGN at 3 mg/kg/week in the mouse, nonadverse findings included mononuclear cell infiltrates in multiple tissues. Effects became adverse at 30 mg/kg in the kidney, esophagus, lacrimal gland. These findings were partially reversed and/or not observed following the 4-week recovery period. In the monkey, SLGN-related nonadverse microscopic findings of inflammatory cellular infiltrates were observed in the liver and stomach; All effects exhibited reversibility at the end of the recovery phase. The NOAEL in mice and monkeys for SLGN was 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg orally once weekly for 26 weeks and 13 weeks, respectively, and for nivolumab was 50 mg/kg IV twice weekly for 13 weeks. These doses were associated with exposures (AUC) that were 192, 37 and 21 higher, respectively, than the human exposure after a single oral 3 mg dose of SLGN (selgantolimod IB) and 3 mg/kg dose every 2 weeks IV of nivolumab (Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Pharmacology Review 4 Dec 2014). For VIR-2218, the liver (rats), kidney (rats), and injection site (rats and monkeys) were identified as potential target PPD PPD-Selgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Original CONFIDENTIAL Page 36 04 March 2021tissues in the pivotal 6-month (rat), and 9-month (monkey) repeat-dose toxicity studies, typical findings of the siRNA class. In rats, nonadverse microscopic liver findings included hepatocellular hypertrophy, vacuolation, increased mitoses, single cell necrosis, and basophilic granules in Kupffer cells. Basophilic granules were also observed in renal tubular epithelial cells. These changes were accompanied by minimal increases in bilirubin (female rats at high dose in 4-week study) or minimal to mild increases in ALT and AST (male rats at mid dose in 6-month study). The microscopic changes were partially reversible and the clinical pathology changes were fully reversible at the end of the 13-week recovery period. In rats and monkeys, nonadverse microscopic findings at the injection sites and draining lymph nodes were noted at all dose levels in both sexes and were only partially reversible at the end of the recovery period. The NOAELs were 150 mg/kg (rats) and 300 mg/kg (monkeys); the highest doses tested. At the proposed clinical dose of 200 mg in this study, the estimated AUC last in humans is approximately 48-fold lower compared to the NOAEL in the 6-month rat study, and 187-fold lower compared to the NOAEL in the 9-month monkey study Based on the large exposure margins in the toxicology studies for the single agents, the risk for an exaggerated inflammatory response from the combination of these agents at the proposed doses in this Phase 2 clinical study is considered low. The potential for unpredicted off-target effects with the combination is considered negligible since nivolumab as a monoclonal antibody is specific for its intended target and off-target activity has not been observed with SLGN even at very high exposure margins. While the liver and kidney were identified as target organs for VIR-2218, effects were observed at high exposure margins and exaggerated toxicity with SLGN at clinically relevant doses is low. Combination toxicity study of the 3 agents were not conducted since the potential risks of combining the 3 agents are predictable with low probability of occurrence at the proposed doses in this study. Therefore, the nonclinical studies of the single agents are considered sufficient for supporting this Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of the combination of 3 mg SLGN orally once weekly and 0.3 mg/kg nivolumab IV once every 4 weeks and VIR-2218 every 4 weeks. Overall Risk Benefit Based on available information, the benefit/risk balance for this study is considered positive. All subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 will be switched from their prescribed antiviral to TAF (25 mg) in order to ensure consistency of treatment. Additionally, to further mitigate risk, subjects enrolled in this study will be required to have adequate hematologic function at study entry and sufficient hepatic reserve (F0-F2). The protocol will follow subjects closely with frequent virtual or in-clinic visits to monitor AEs, laboratory abnormalities, ophthalmologic examinations, and vital sign changes, routinely. The study also allows for more frequent monitoring visits based on investigator's discretion for safety monitoring. In addition, specific parameters that would lead to dose modification, interruption, or discontinuation are included in Section 6.9.1. Based on historic enrollment rates (internal data), subjects with CHB in this study will be enrolled in a staggered fashion over the course of at least 8 to 12 months. Enrollment in Cohorts 1 and 2 will be enrolled in parallel. Enrollment in Cohort 3 will begin once Cohort 2 has completed enrollment. In summary, potential risks of the novel HBV treatment regimens evaluated in this study have been minimized by dose selection, study design, and inclusion criteria.

Original CONFIDENTIAL Page 75 04 March 20217. ADVERSE EVENTS AND TOXICITY MANAGEMENT 7.1. Definitions of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 7.1.1. Adverse Events An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered an study drug, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not the AE is considered related to the study drug. Adverse events may also include pretreatment or posttreatment complications that occur as a result of protocol-specified procedures or special situations (Section 7.1.3). An AE does not include the following: Medical or surgical procedures such as surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, and transfusion. The condition that led to the procedure may be an AE and must be reported Preexisting diseases, conditions, or laboratory abnormalities present or detected before the screening visit that do not worsen Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (eg, hospitalization for elective surgery, social and/or convenience admissions) Overdose without clinical sequelae (Section 7.1.3) Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date before the ICF is signed and not related to a protocol-associated procedure is not an AE but rather considered to be preexisting and should be documented as medical history. Preexisting events that increase in severity or change in nature after study drug initiation or during or as a consequence of participation in the clinical study will also be considered AEs. 7.1.2. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is defined as an event that, at any dose, results in the following: Death A life-threatening situation (Note: The term \"life-threatening\" in the definition of \"serious\" refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.) In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalizationSelgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Original CONFIDENTIAL Page 76 04 March 2021Persistent or significant disability/incapacity A congenital anomaly/birth defect A medically important event or reaction: Such events may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes constituting SAEs. Medical and scientific judgment must be exercised to determine whether such an event is a reportable under expedited reporting rules. Examples of medically important events include intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; and development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 7.1.3. Study Drugs and Gilead Concomitant Therapy Special Situations Reports Special situation reports (SSRs) include all reports of medication error, abuse, misuse, overdose, occupational exposure, drug interactions, exposure via breastfeeding, unexpected benefit, transmission of infectious agents via the product, counterfeit of falsified medicine, and pregnancy regardless of an associated AE. Medication error is any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, preparation for administration or administration of a study drug while the medication is in the control of a health care professional, patient, or consumer. Medication errors may be classified as a medication error without an AE, which includes situations of missed dose, medication error with an AE, intercepted medication error, or potential medication error. Abuse is defined as persistent or sporadic intentional excessive use of a study drug by a subject. Misuse is defined as any intentional and inappropriate use of a study drug that is not in accordance with the protocol instructions or the local prescribing information. An overdose is defined as an accidental or intentional administration of a quantity of a study drug given per administration or cumulatively which is above the maximum recommended dose as per protocol or in the product labelling (as it applies to the daily dose of the subject in question). In cases of a discrepancy in drug accountability, overdose will be established only when it is clear that the subject has taken the excess dose(s). Overdose cannot be established when the subject cannot account for the discrepancy, except in cases in which the investigator has reason to suspect that the subject has taken the additional dose(s). Occupational exposure is defined as exposure to a study drug as a result of one's professional or nonprofessional occupation. Drug interaction is defined as any drug/drug, drug/food, or drug/device interaction. Unexpected benefit is defined as an unintended therapeutic effect where the results are judged to be desirable and beneficial. Selgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Original CONFIDENTIAL Page 77 04 March 2021Transmission of infectious agents is defined as any suspected transmission of an infected agent through a Gilead study drug. Counterfeit or falsified medicine: Any study drug with a false representation of (a) its identity, (b) its source, or (c) its history. 7.2. Assessment of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The investigator or qualified subinvestigator is responsible for assessing AEs and SAEs for causality and severity, and for final review and confirmation of accuracy of event information and assessments. 7.2.1. Assessment of Causality for Study Drugs and Procedures The investigator or qualified subinvestigator is responsible for assessing the relationship to study drug using clinical judgment and the following considerations: No: Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug. For SAEs, an alternative causality must be provided (eg, preexisting condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, concomitant medication). Yes: There is reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the study drug. It should be emphasized that ineffective treatment should not be considered as causally related in the context of AE reporting. The relationship to study procedures (eg, invasive procedures such as venipuncture or biopsy) should be assessed using the following considerations: No: Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study procedure. Yes: The AE occurred as a result of protocol procedures (eg, venipuncture). 7.2.2. Assessment of Severity The severity of AEs will be graded using the GSI Toxicity Grading Scale, Version 5. For each episode, the highest grade attained should be reported as defined in the Toxicity Grading Scale (Appendix 5). 7.3. Investigator Reporting Requirements and Instructions 7.3.1. Requirements for Collection Prior to Study Drug Initiation After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study medication, the following types of events must be reported on the applicable eCRFs: all SAEs and AEs related to protocol-mandated procedures.Selgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Original CONFIDENTIAL Page 78 04 March 20217.3.2. Adverse Events Following initiation of study medication, collect all AEs, regardless of cause or relationship, until the end of the study including the posttreatment FU visit and report them on the eCRFs as instructed. All AEs should be followed until resolution or until the AE is stable, if possible. Gilead may request that certain AEs be followed beyond the protocol-defined FU period. 7.3.3. Serious Adverse Events All SAEs, including deaths regardless of cause or relationship, that occur after the subject first consents to participate in the study (ie, signing the ICF) and throughout the duration of the study, including the posttreatment FU visit, must be reported on the applicable eCRFs and to Global Patient Safety (GLPS) as instructed below in this section. This also includes any SAEs resulting from protocol-associated procedures performed after the ICF is signed. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek SAEs after the protocol-defined FU period; however, if the investigator learns of any SAEs that occur after the protocol-defined FU period has concluded and the event is deemed relevant to the use of study drug, the investigator should promptly document and report the event to Gilead GLPS. Instructions for reporting SAEs are described in Section 7.4.1. 7.3.4. Study Drug Special Situations Reports All study drug SSRs that occur from study drug initiation and throughout the duration of the study, including the posttreatment FU visit, must be reported to Gilead GLPS (Section 7.4.2). Adverse events and SAEs resulting from SSRs must be reported in accordance to the AE and SAE reporting guidance (Section 7.3). 7.3.5. Concomitant Therapy Reports 7.3.5.1. Gilead Concomitant Therapy Special Situations Report Special situation reports involving a Gilead concomitant therapy (not considered study drug), that occurs after the subject first consents to participate in the study (ie, signing the ICF) and throughout the duration of the study, including the posttreatment FU visit, must be reported to Gilead GLPS utilizing the paper SSR (Section 7.4.2.2). 7.3.5.2. Non-Gilead Concomitant Therapy Report Special situations involving non-Gilead concomitant medications does not need to be reported on the SSR form; however, for special situations that result in AEs due to a non-Gilead concomitant medication, the AE should be reported on the AE form. Selgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Original CONFIDENTIAL Page 79 04 March 2021Any inappropriate use of concomitant medications prohibited by this protocol should not be reported as \"misuse,\" but may be more appropriately documented as a protocol deviation. All clinical sequelae in relation to these SSRs will be reported as AEs or SAEs at the same time using the AE eCRF and/or the SAE report form. Details of the symptoms and signs, clinical management, and outcome will be reported, when available. 7.4. Reporting Process for Serious Adverse Events and Special Situation Reports 7.4.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Process For fatal or life-threatening events, copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other documents are also to be transmitted by email or fax when requested and applicable. Transmission of such documents should occur without personal subject identification, maintaining the traceability of a document to the subject identifiers. Additional information may be requested to ensure the timely completion of accurate safety reports. Any medications necessary for treatment of the SAE must be recorded onto the concomitant medication section of the subject's eCRF and the SAE narrative section of the Safety Report Form eCRF. 7.4.1.1. Electronic Serious Adverse Event Reporting Process Site personnel will record all SAE data on the applicable eCRFs and from there transmit the SAE information to Gilead GLPS (or to the designated CRO) within 24 hours of the investigator's knowledge of the event from ICF signature throughout the duration of the study, including the protocol-required posttreatment FU period. Detailed instructions can be found in the eCRF completion guidelines. If for any reason it is not possible to record and transmit the SAE information electronically, record the SAE on the paper SAE reporting form and transmit within 24 hours to: Gilead GLPS Email: Safety_fc@gilead.com or Fax: 1-650-522-5477 As soon as it is possible to do so, any SAE reported via paper must be transcribed on the applicable eCRFs according to instructions and within the timelines outlined in the eCRF completion guidelines. If an SAE has been reported via a paper form because the eCRF database has been locked, no further action is necessary. If the database is not locked, any SAE reported via paper must be transcribed as soon as possible on the applicable eCRFs and transmitted to GLPS.Selgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc.

Pregnancy Reporting Process The investigator should report pregnancies in female study subjects and/or female partners of male subjects who are identified after initiation of study drug and throughout the study, including the posttreatment FU period, to Gilead GLPS using the pregnancy report form within 24 hours of becoming aware of the pregnancy. Contact details for transmitting the pregnancy report form are as follows: Gilead GLPS Email: Safety_fc@gilead.com or Fax: 1-650-522-5477 The pregnancy itself is not considered an AE, nor is an induced elective abortion to terminate a pregnancy without medical reasons. All other premature terminations of pregnancy (eg, a spontaneous abortion, an induced therapeutic abortion due to complications or other medical reasons) must be reported within 24 hours as an SAE, as described in Section 7.4.1. The underlying medical reason for this procedure should be recorded as the AE term. A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as described in Section 7.4.1. Furthermore, any SAE occurring as an adverse pregnancy outcome after study completion must be reported to the Gilead GLPS. The subject should receive appropriate monitoring and care until the conclusion of the pregnancy. The outcome of the pregnancy/partner pregnancy should be reported to Gilead GLPS using the pregnancy outcome report form. If the end of the pregnancy/partner pregnancy occurs after the study has been completed, the outcome should be reported directly to Gilead GLPS. Gilead GLPS contact information is as follows: fax: +1 (650) 522-5477.

Gilead Reporting Requirements Depending on relevant local legislation or regulations, including the applicable US FDA Code of Federal Regulations, the EU Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC) and relevant updates, and other country-specific legislation or regulations, Gilead may be required to expedite to worldwide regulatory agencies reports of SAEs, serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs), or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs). In accordance with the EU Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC), Gilead or a specified designee will notify worldwide regulatory agencies and the relevant IEC in concerned Member States of applicable SUSARs as outlined in current regulations.Selgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Original CONFIDENTIAL Page 82 04 March 2021Assessment of expectedness for SAEs will be determined by Gilead using reference safety information specified in the IB or relevant local label as applicable. All investigators will receive a safety letter notifying them of relevant SUSAR reports associated with any study drug. The investigator should notify the IRB or IEC of SUSAR reports as soon as is practical, where this is required by local regulatory agencies, and in accordance with the local institutional policy. 7.6. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Laboratory abnormalities without clinical significance are not to be recorded as AEs or SAEs. However, laboratory abnormalities (eg, clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis) that require medical or surgical intervention or lead to study drug interruption, modification, or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE, as well as an SAE, if applicable. In addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessments (eg, ECG, x-rays, vital signs) that are associated with signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE as described in Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a syndrome, record the syndrome or diagnosis (eg, anemia), not the laboratory result (ie, decreased hemoglobin). Severity should be recorded and graded according to the GSI Grading Scale. Reference table at link in Appendix 5. Toxicity Grading Scale, Version 01 April 2015. For AEs associated with laboratory abnormalities, the event should be graded on the basis of the clinical severity in the context of the underlying conditions; this may or may not be in agreement with the grading of the laboratory abnormality. 7.7. Toxicity Management All clinical and clinically significant laboratory toxicities will be managed according to uniform guidelines detailed in Appendix 6. Grade 3 and 4 clinically significant laboratory abnormalities should be confirmed by repeat testing within 3 calendar days of receipt of results and before investigational medicinal product (IMP) discontinuation, unless such a delay is not consistent with good medical practice Clinical events and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will be graded according to the Table for GSI Grading Scale for Severity of Adverse Events and Laboratory Abnormalities (Appendix 5) When restarting IMP following resolution of the AE, the IMP should be restarted at full dose or modified dose that is dependent upon discussion with the medical monitor Any recurrence of the IMP-related Grade 3 or 4 clinical or clinically significant laboratory AE following dose interruption mandates permanent discontinuation of IMPSelgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Original CONFIDENTIAL Page 83 04 March 2021Administration of study drug(s) may be discontinued due to a clinical or laboratory event. The medical monitor should be consulted prior to dose discontinuation of study drug(s) unless the investigator believes that immediate action is warranted to ensure the continued safety of the subject Any questions regarding toxicity management should be directed to the medical monitor. 7.7.1. Grades 1 and 2 Laboratory Abnormality or Clinical Event Continue IMP at the discretion of the investigator 7.7.2. Grade 3 Laboratory Abnormality or Clinical Event For Grade 3 laboratory abnormality or clinical event, IMP may be continued if the event is considered to be unrelated to IMP For a Grade 3 clinical event, or clinically significant laboratory abnormality confirmed by repeat testing within 3 calendar days , that is considered to be related to IMP, IMP should be withheld until the toxicity returns to Grade 2 If a laboratory abnormality recurs to Grade 3 following rechallenge with IMP and is considered related to IMP, then IMP should be permanently discontinued and the subject managed according to local practice. Recurrence of laboratory abnormalities considered unrelated to IMP may not require permanent discontinuation 7.7.3. Grade 4 Laboratory Abnormality or Clinical Event For a Grade 4 clinical event or clinically significant Grade 4 laboratory abnormality confirmed by repeat testing within 3 calendar days, the IMP should be permanently discontinued and the subject managed according to local practice. The subject should be followed as clinically indicated until the laboratory abnormality returns to Day 1 of treatment or is otherwise explained, whichever occurs first. A clinically significant Grade 4 laboratory abnormality that is not confirmed by repeat testing should be managed according to the algorithm for the new toxicity grade Investigational study product may be continued without dose interruption for a clinically nonsignificant Grade 4 laboratory abnormality (eg, Grade 4 CK after strenuous exercise or triglyceride elevation that is nonfasting or that can be medically managed) 7.7.4. ALT Elevation or Flare Management on Treatment and Treatment-Free Follow Up On-Treatment ALT Management Subjects with on-treatment serum ALT elevation > 2 \u00d7 nadir or > 2 \u00d7 baseline value and 5 \u00d7 ULN, with or without associated symptoms should be managed according to the guidance below. Selgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Original CONFIDENTIAL Page 84 04 March 2021All elevated serum ALT should be confirmed as soon as possible and ideally within 3 days of receipt of results.

Original CONFIDENTIAL Page 106 04 March 2021Appendix 2. Pandemic Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plan During an ongoing pandemic, potential risks associated with subjects being unable to attend study visits have been identified for this study. These risks can be summarized as follows: 1) Study drug supplies to subjects and sites: a) Subjects may be unable to return to the site for a number of visits to get the study drug, or the site may be unable to accept any subject visits. Without study drugs, the subject would not be able to stay on the study drug as planned per protocol. Mitigation plan: Study drug supplies may be provided to the subject from the site without a clinic visit, once it is confirmed that the subject may safely continue on study drug as determined by the principal investigator (PI). A virtual study visit, via phone or video conferencing, must be performed prior to remote study drug resupply. At the earliest opportunity, the site will schedule in-person subject visits and return to the protocol's regular schedule of assessments. A qualified courier may be utilized to ship the study drug from sites to study subjects if permitted by local ethic committee (EC)/institutional review boards (IRB)/Regulatory Authority as applicable and with sponsor's approval. b) Shipments of study drug could be delayed because of transportation issues. Without study drug subject would not be able to stay on the study drug as planned per protocol. Mitigation plan: The sites' study drug inventory should be closely monitored. Site staff should notify the sponsor or delegate if they foresee shortage in study drug inventory or if there is any interruption in local shipping service. The sponsor will continue to monitor inventory at the study drug depot and study sites. Manual shipments will be triggered as necessary. 2) Subject safety monitoring and FU: a) Subjects may be unable or unwilling to come to the study site for their scheduled study visits as required per protocol. Mitigation plan: For subjects who may be unable or unwilling to visit the study site for their scheduled study visits as required per protocol, the PI or qualified delegate will conduct a virtual study visit, via phone or video conferencing, to assess the subject within target visit window date whenever possible. During the virtual study visit, the following information at minimum will be reviewed: i) Confirm if subject has experienced any adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs)/special situations (including pregnancy) and FU on any unresolved AE/SAEs. ii) Review current list of concomitant medications and document any new concomitant medications.Selgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Original CONFIDENTIAL Page 107 04 March 2021iii) If applicable, confirm subjects study drug supply is sufficient to last until the next planned visit date. If study drug resupply is needed it will be provided as described above in (1). iv) If applicable, remind subject to maintain current dosing and to keep all dispensed study drug kits for return at the next on-site visit. b) Subjects may be unable or unwilling to travel to the site for planned assessments (eg, safety blood draws); hence samples may not be sent for central lab analyses. Mitigation plan: Local labs may be utilized as appropriate to monitor subject safety until the subject can return to the site for their regular FU per protocol. Any laboratory assessments conducted at a local lab due to the pandemic will be documented accordingly. Pregnancy testing may be performed using a home urine pregnancy test if local lab pregnancy testing is not feasible. c) Subjects may be unable or unwilling to attend the study visit to sign an updated informed consent form (ICF) version. Mitigation plan: The site staff will follow their approved consent process and remain in compliance with local EC/IRB and national laws and regulations. Remote consent will be allowed if has been approved by the local EC/IRB. The consent process will be documented and confirmed by normal consent procedure at the earliest opportunity. 3) Protocol and monitoring compliance: a) Protocol deviations may occur, in case scheduled visits cannot occur as planned per protocol. Mitigation plan: If it is not possible to complete a required procedure, an unscheduled visit should be conducted as soon as possible when conditions allow. The situation should be recorded and explained as a protocol deviation. Any missed subject visits or deviation to the protocol due to the pandemic must be reported in the eCRF and described in the clinical study report. Any virtual study visits that are conducted in lieu of clinic visits due to the pandemic will be documented as a protocol deviation related to the pandemic. b) Monitors may be unable to carry out source data review (SDR) or source data verification (SDV), or study drug accountability or assess protocol and GCP compliance. This may lead to delays in SDV, an increase in protocol deviations, or under reporting of AEs. Mitigation plan: The study monitor is to remain in close communication with the site to ensure data entry and query resolution. In compliance with Gilead policy, a remote SDV should not be arranged). The study monitor is to reference the Study Monitoring Plan for guidance on how to conduct a remote monitoring visit. The study staff is to save and document all relevant communication in the study files. The status of sites that cannot Selgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Original CONFIDENTIAL Page 108 04 March 2021accept monitoring visits and/or subjects on site, must be tracked centrally and updated on a regular basis. 4) Missing data and data integrity: a) There may be an increased amount of missing data due to subjects missing visits/assessments. This could have an impact on the analysis and the interpretation of clinical study data. Mitigation plan: Implications of a pandemic on methodological aspects for the study will be thoroughly assessed and documented, and relevant actions will be taken as appropriate (ie, modification of the statistical analysis plan) and in compliance with Regulatory Authorities' guidance. Overall, the clinical study report will describe the impact of the pandemic on the interpretability of study data. Risks will be assessed continuously, and temporary measures will be implemented to mitigate these risks as part of a mitigation plan, as described above. These measures will be communicated to the relevant stakeholders as appropriate and are intended to provide alternate methods that will ensure the evaluation and assessment of the safety of subjects who are enrolled in this study. Since these potential risks are considered mitigated with the implementation of these measures, the expected benefit-risk assessment of [VIR-2218, nivolumab and TAF] in study subjects remains unchanged.Selgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc.

Pregnancy Precautions, Definition for Female of Childbearing Potential, and Contraceptive Requirements 1) Definitions a. Definition of Childbearing Potential For the purposes of this study, a female born subject is considered of childbearing potential following the initiation of puberty (Tanner stage 2) until becoming postmenopausal unless the subject is permanently sterile or has medically documented ovarian failure. Women are considered to be in a postmenopausal state when they are > 54 years of age with cessation of previously occurring menses for > 12 months without an alternative cause. In addition, women < 54 years of age with amenorrhea of 12 months may also be considered postmenopausal if their follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level is in the postmenopausal range and they are not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. Permanent sterilization includes hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy in a female subject of any age. b. Definition of Male Fertility For the purposes of this study, a male born subject is considered fertile after the initiation of puberty unless the subject is permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy or medical documentation. 2) Contraception Requirements for Female Subjects a. Study Drug Effects on Pregnancy and Hormonal Contraception Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) Data from clinical pharmacokinetic interaction studies of TAF have demonstrated that there is no reduction in the clinical efficacy of hormonal contraception. Nonclinical toxicity studies in animals (rats and rabbits) of TAF have demonstrated no adverse effect on fertility or embryo-fetal development. However, there are no clinical studies of TAF in pregnant women. Please refer to the latest version of the IB for additional information. Nivolumab There are no data on the use of nivolumab in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown embryofetal toxicity. Nivolumab is not recommended during pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception for at least 5 months following the last dose of nivolumab. It is unknown whether nivolumab is secreted in human milk. Because many medicinal products, including antibodies, can be secreted in human milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Please refer to the latest version of nivolumab product information for additional information.Selgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Original CONFIDENTIAL Page 127 04 March 2021Selgantolimod There is no clinical data available on SLGN treatment in pregnant women. Nonclinical studies in rabbits showed no adverse effect on fertility but did show a possible risk of teratogenicity/fetotoxicity during embryo-fetal development. Therefore, the use of highly effective contraception will be required for participation in this study. Nonclinical studies showed no genotoxicity. Nonclinical studies demonstrate low induction potential with once weekly dosing of SLGN. Based on this data, no reduction in the exposure of hormonal contraception is expected. Please refer to the latest version of the IB for additional information. VIR-2218 There are no available data on the use of VIR-2218 in pregnant women to evaluate a drug- associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse effects on pregnancy or embryo-fetal development related to VIR-2218 were observed in rats and in rabbits. No studies have been conducted in animals on the effect of VIR-2218 on fertility and pre/postnatal development. Nonclinical studies showed no genotoxicity. Women of childbearing potential are required to use highly effective contraception during the study and should continue using contraception for a least 1 month following the last dose of VIR-2218. Please refer to the latest version of the VIR-2218 IB for additional information. There is no metabolic enzyme (or transporter) induction effect that is expected from either Nivolumab nor VIR-2218. Therefore, because Selgantolimod is not an inducer, none of the drugs used in this trial either alone or in combination are expected to yield a reduction of exposure of hormonal contraception. Because many medicinal products can be secreted in human milk, a risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. b. Contraception Requirements for Female Subjects of Childbearing Potential The inclusion of female subjects of childbearing potential requires the use of highly effective contraceptive measures with a failure rate of < 1% per year. They must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative pregnancy test at the screening visit prior to randomization. Pregnancy tests will be performed at monthly intervals thereafter until the end of contraception requirement. Duration of required contraception for female subjects in this clinical trial should start from screening visit until 30 days after the last dose of TAF, SLGN, or VIR-2218 or for 5 months after the last dose of nivolumab whichever contraception ending date is latest. If a subject requires a commercially approved nucleos(t)ide analog treatment, the investigator will provide Selgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Original CONFIDENTIAL Page 128 04 March 2021contraception requirements according to the local label for the specific marketed product and again taking into consideration whichever contraception ending date is latest. Female subjects must agree to one of the following contraceptive methods: Complete abstinence from intercourse of reproductive potential. Abstinence is an acceptable method of contraception only when it is in line with the subject's preferred and usual lifestyle. Or Consistent and correct use of 1 of the following methods of birth control listed below: Hormonal or nonhormonal intrauterine device (IUD)Subdermal contraceptive implant Bilateral tubal occlusion (upon medical assessment of surgical success) Vasectomy in the male partner (upon medical assessment of surgical success) Or Female subjects who wish to use a hormonally-based method must use it in conjunction with a barrier method, preferably a male condom. Hormonal methods are restricted to those associated with the inhibition of ovulation. Hormonally-based contraceptives and barrier methods permitted for use in this protocol are as follows: Hormonal methods (each method must be used with a barrier method, preferably male condom) Oral contraceptives (either combined or progesterone only) Injectable progesterone Transdermal contraceptive patch Contraceptive vaginal ring Barrier methods (each method must be used with a hormonal method) Male condom (with or without spermicide) Female condom (with or without spermicide) Diaphragm with spermicide Cervical cap with spermicide Sponge with spermicideSelgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Original CONFIDENTIAL Page 129 04 March 2021Inclusion of methods of contraception in this list of permitted methods does not imply that the method is approved in any country or region. Methods should only be used if locally approved. Female subjects must also refrain from egg donation and in vitro fertilization during treatment and until the end of contraception requirement. 3) Contraception Requirements for Male Subjects It is theoretically possible that a relevant systemic concentration of study drug may be achieved in a female partner from exposure of the male subject's seminal fluid and poses a potential risk to an embryo/fetus. Therefore, male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must use condoms during treatment until 30 days after the last dose of TAF, SLGN, or VIR-2218 or for 5 months after last dose of Nivolumab whichever contraception ending date is latest. If a subject requires a commercially approved nucleos(t)ide analog treatment, the investigator will provide contraception requirements according to the local label for the specific marketed product and again taking into consideration whichever contraception ending date is latest. If the female partner of childbearing potential is not pregnant, additional contraception recommendations should also be considered. Male subjects must also refrain from sperm donation during treatment and until the end of contraception requirement. 4) Unacceptable Birth Control Methods Birth control methods that are unacceptable include periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method. A female condom and a male condom should not be used together. 5) Procedures to be Followed in the Event of Pregnancy Female subjects will be instructed to notify the investigator if they become pregnant or suspect they are pregnant at any time from start of the study to the end of the study. Nivolumab, SLGN and VIR-2218 must be discontinued immediately. Interruption of other drugs should be considered upon discussion with the medical monitor. Male subjects whose partner has become pregnant or suspects she is pregnant from start of study to the end of the contraception requirement must also report the information to the investigator. Instructions for reporting pregnancy, partner pregnancy, and pregnancy outcome are outlined in Section 7.4.2.3.Selgantolimod Protocol GS-US-465-4439 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc.
