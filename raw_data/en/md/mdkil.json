A large goal of AEC is to prepare and illustrate to our student members what engineers do, where they do it, and how it is done in the real world where there isn't a textbook to guide the way. Another main goal is to research and discover new ways of efficiently producing, saving, and storing energy for all industries which include transportation, industrial, private homes, and many more. Faculty Advisor: David Alexander Members participate in a solar powered boat race against other schools each May in Rancho Seco, California. The boat is designed, manufactured, and tested by members with the help of our faculty advisor, and Association of Energy Engineers mentors. [ Click to Join Now!
