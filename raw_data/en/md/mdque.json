Other General Warnings Talk to your doctor if - You are taking medication for any disease - You are taking medicines not prescribed by a doctor - You are allergic to immunoglobulins or have low levels of IgA in the blood - Your BMI (body mass index) is equal to or greater than 30 - You have had a vaccination recently - You will need to take blood tests for different purposes after this vaccination - You feel unwell or observe any unusual reactions after taking this injection Mode of Action of Anti D 300 MCG/ML How Does It Work? The Anti D injection is given to individuals that lack the Rh factor type D (Rhesus factor) in their red blood cells. If an Rh negative person is given Rh positive blood, it can prove to be very harmful for the person since the body considers these Rh positive red blood cells as 'foreign' and attacks them by producing antibodies. These individuals are given the Anti D immunoglobulins so that on exposure to Rh positive blood in the future, the body is ready to combat them immediately. This is very important especially when a pregnant woman and her child have Rh positive and negative RBCs. If the Rh positive RBCs from the child pass through the placenta into Rh negative blood of the mother, her body may produce antibodies that can be passed to the child. It can result in haemolytic disease of the new-born child....

Content Details WRITTEN BY REVIEWED BY Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Who should not take Anti D injection? A: The injection is not recommended for use in Rh positive individuals or those who have been immunised against Rh (D) antigen. Q: What are the chances that an Rh negative woman will carry an Rh positive child? A: If both the father and the mother are Rh negative, the child will be Rh negative. However, even if one of them is Rh positive, there are chances that their child will be too. Q: If the body can produce these antibodies by itself, why is there a need for a separate injection? A: Human body develops specific antibodies only after exposure to the antigen. The production of antibodies takes up to three weeks, hence, if an individual (Rh negative) has been exposed to Rh antigen, the damage will be done till the time that the antibodies are formed. Hence there arises a need for external injection of antibodies. Q: When does a pregnant woman have to take the Anti D injection? A: You should talk to a doctor in this regard. Rh antigens have been identified on foetal red blood cells as early as 38 days after gestation. Therefore, based on the risk of exposure, the doctor will decide when the injection should be given.
