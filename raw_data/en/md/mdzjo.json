The stones used are either semi-precious or precious, in the form of crystals, polished or rough. The reference stones in lithotherapy are : black tourmaline, obsidian, labradorite, rock crystal and many others like amethyst. Focus on their uses and their benefits: BLACK TOURMALINE OBSIDIAN LABRADORITE ROCK CRYSTAL AMETHYST To take advantage of the benefits of lithotherapy, you can wear the stones as a pendant or bracelet, put them in your pocket or place them on a painful area. Don't forget : the stone needs to be purified and recharged after each use. After using your stones, soak them in a bowl of tap water for several hours. They will thus discharge the energies accumulated in contact with the body. "}
