AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA (Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (Split Virion)) Product Monograph Page 4 of 24 PART I: HEALTH PROFESSIO NAL INFORMATION 1 INDICATIONS AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA is indicated for the active immunization of adults and children aged 5 years or older for the prevention of influenza disease caused by influenza virus types A and B contained in the vaccine. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) provides additional guida nce on the use of the influenza vaccine in Canada. Please refer to the published Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for the current season. 1.1 Pediatrics Pediatrics (5 to < 18 years) : Based on the data submitted and reviewed by Health Canada, the safety and efficacy of AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA in pediatric patients has been established in children 5 years of age and older; therefore, Health Canada has authorized an indication for pediatric use. (See 7.1.3 Pediatrics, 8.2.1 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions - Pediatrics and 1 4.2 Study Results). Clinical data have not been evaluated for use of AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA in children under 5 years of age. 2 CONTRAINDICATIONS AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA is contraindicated in individuals with known severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine, or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine. For a complete listing, see 6 DOSAGE FORMS, STRENGTHS, COMPOSITION AN D PACKAGING . 4 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTR ATION 4.2 Recommended Dose The recommended dosage schedule for AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA is presented in Table 1. Table 1: AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA Recommended Dosage, by Age Group Age Group Dose Number of Doses 5 to < 9 years 0.5 mL 1 or 2a 9 years 0.5 mL 1 a Previously unvaccinated children 5 to < 9 years of age should be given 2 doses at least 4 weeks apart. 4.4 Administration Vaccination should be carried out by intramuscular injection, preferably into the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. The vaccine is a slightly opaque liquid with some white particulate sediment that resuspends upon shaking to form a homogenous suspension. Immediately before use, shake the syringe or vial thoroughly to uniformly distribute the sed iment and inspect visually. Do not use if extraneous particulate matter and/or discolouration is observed. When using the multi -dose vial, the vial should be thoroughly shaken and inspected prior to withdrawing each dose. Use a separate sterile needle and syringe for each dose withdrawn from the multi -dose vial. It is recommended that small syringes (0.5 mL o r 1 mL) be used to minimize any AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA (Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (Split Virion)) Product Monograph Page 5 of 24 product loss. The multi -dose vial must be used within 28 days from removal of the first dose, and between uses, should be returned to the recommended storage conditions between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C. The number of needle punctures s hould not exceed 10 per multi -dose vial. Please refer to the Canadian Immunization Guide, Public Health Agency of Canada, for general information regarding vaccine administration practices. 4.5 Missed Dose Children 5 years to less than 9 years of age who have not been previously vaccinated against Influenza should receive a second dose after 4 weeks. In case the second dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible. 5 OVERDOSAGE No specific information is available for overdose with AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA. For management of a suspected drug overdose, contact your regional poison control centre. 6 DOSAGE FORMS, STRENGTHS, COMPOSITION AND PACK AGING To help ensure the traceability of vaccines for patient immunization record -keeping as well as safety monitoring, health professionals should record the time and date of administration, quantity of administered dose (if applicable), anatomical site and route of administration, brand name and generic name of the vaccine, the product lot number and expiry date.

The syringe barrel is designed with a Luer- Lok adaptor to allow the attachment of a commercially available needle prior to administration. The syringe and stopper components are latex -free. AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA is considered safe for use in persons with latex allergies. AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA is supplied in cartons containing ten single -dose pre -filled syringes, without needles. Multi -dose Vial Multi -dose type 1 glass vial. The multi -dose vial is closed with a stopper and sealed with an aluminium crimp and plastic tear- away cap. Once removed, the cap cannot be re -affixed to the vial. The vial stoppe r does not contain latex. AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA is considered safe for use in persons with latex allergies. One vial is packed into a water resistant carton. 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUT IONS General AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. The pre -filled syringes are single use only. Prior to administration of any dose of AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA, the vaccine recipient should be asked about their personal history, family history and recent health status, including immunization history, current health status, main allergies and any adverse event associated with previous immunizations. Before the injection of any biological, the person responsible for administration should take all precautions known for the prevention of allergic or any other reactions. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following administration of the vaccine. Immunization with AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA should be postponed in patients with febrile illness or acute infections. As with any vaccine, immunization with AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA may not protect 100% of individuals against influenza disease. Hematologic As with other intramuscular injections, administration of AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA requires careful consideration in patients with clinically significant bleeding disorders. Immune AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA (Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (Split Virion)) Product Monograph Page 7 of 24 In immunocompromised patients the antibody response may be lower. Neurologic If Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syn drome has occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of prior influenza vaccine, the decision to give AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks. Reproductive Health: Female and Male Potential Fertility AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA has not been evaluated for possible effect on fertility. A reproductive study of female rats vaccinated with a similar trivalent influenza vaccine manufactured by Seqirus revealed no impairment of fertility. 7.1 Special Populations 7.1.1 Pregnant Women There are no data for AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA administered to pregnant women to inform vaccine -associated risks in pregnancy. Available data on a similar trivalent influenza vaccine manufactured by Seqirus administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine -associated risks in pregnancy. An animal reproductive toxicity study has been conducted with a similar trivalent influenza vaccine manufactured by Seqirus. This study did not demonstrate any maternal or fetal developmental toxicity (see 1 6: NON -CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY ). NACI considers influenza vaccination safe during pregnancy. NACI recommends influenza vaccination in pregnant women with high -risk conditions at any stage during pregnancy. 7.1.2 Breast -feeding The safety and effectiveness of AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA has not been established in nursing mothers. No human or animal data are available to assess the effects of AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. 7.1.3 Pediatrics Pediatrics (< 5 years) : No data are available to Health Canada; therefore, Health Canada has not authorized an indication for use in children less than 5 years of age. 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS 8.1 Adverse Reaction Overview The safety of AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA has been studied in two Phase 3 clinical studies; one study in adults aged 18 years and above (N = 1721) and one in children aged 5 to < 18 years (N = 1621). In adults 18 to < 65 years, the most commonly reported injection -site adverse reaction observed in clinical studies with AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA was pain ( 40%). The most comm on systemic adverse events observed were myalgia and headache ( 20%). In adults 65 years of age, the most commonly AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA (Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (Split Virion)) Product Monograph Page 8 of 24 reported injection -site adverse reaction observed in clinical studies with AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA was pain ( 20%). The erse event observed was myalgia ( 10%). In children 5 to < 18 years of age, the most commonly reported injection -site adverse reactions observed in clinical studies with AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA were pain (51.4%), redness (17.1%), and swelling (13.8%). The most common systemic adverse events were headache (15.5%) and myalgia (13.1%). 8.2 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions - Adults Clinical trials are conducted under very specific conditions . The adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials ; therefore, may no t reflect the rates observed in practice and should not be compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug . Adverse reaction information from clinical trials may be useful in identifying and approximating rates of adverse drug reactions in real- world use. Clinical safety data for AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA in adults have been collected in one clinical trial, Study CSLCT - QIV-13-01, a randomized, double -blind, active -controlled trial conducted in the U. S. in 3449 subjects aged 18 years and o lder. Subjects in the safety population received one dose of either AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA (N=1721) or one of two formulations influenza vaccine (TIV -1 N=864 or TIV -2 N=864) each containing an influenza type B virus that corresponded to on e of the two B viruses in AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA (a type B virus of the Yamagata lineage or a type B virus of the Victoria line age), respectively. The mean age of the population was 58 years, 57% were female, and racial groups consisted of 82% White, 16% Black, and 2% other; 5% of subjects were Hispanic/Latino. The age sub - groups were 18 to < 65 years and 65 years and older with mean ages of 43 years and 73 years, respectively. (see 14 CLINICAL TRIALS). Local (injection -site) adverse reactions and systemic adve rse events were solicited for 7 days post - vaccination (Table 3). Injection site cellulitis, cellulitis -like reactions (defined as concurrent Grade 3 pain, redness, and swelling/lump), and Grade 3 swelling/lump were monitored for 28 days post - vaccination. Unsolicited adverse events were collected for 28 days post -vaccination. Serious adverse events (SAEs), including deaths, were collected for 180 days post -vaccination.

No subject experienced a cellulitis -like reaction or cellulitis at the injection site in any of the three vacci ne groups during the study. In CSLCT -QIV- 13-01, headache (3.8%) was the most commonly reported unsolicited adverse event in subjects 18 years of age administered AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA. Other commonly reported unsolicited adverse events (reported by 1% of sub jects) were oropharyngeal diarrhoea (1.3%) and rhinorrhoea (1.0%). For 18 to < 65 years receiving AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA, commonly reported unsolicited adverse events were headache oropharyngeal pain (2.5%), back pai n (1.9%), diarrhoea (1.6%), cough (1.3%) and nausea (1.1%). For subjects > 65 years, commonly reported unsolicited adverse events were headache (2.3%), rhinorrhoea (1.3%), Influenza Vaccine (Split Virion)) Product Monograph Page 10 of 24 In the 180 days following vaccination, 2.3%, 1.6%, and 1.5% of all TIV -1, and TIV -2, respectively, six deaths, five in the AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA group and one in the TIV -2 group. The majority of SAEs occurred after Study Day 28 an d in subjects 65 years of age who had co -morbid illnesses. No SAEs or deaths appeared related to the study vaccines. 8.2.1 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions - Pediatrics Clinical safety data for AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA in children and adolescents have been collected in one clinical trial, Study CSLCT -QIV-13-02, a randomized, double -blind, comparator -controlled trial conducted in the U.S. in 2278 subjects aged 5 to less than 18 years. Subjects in the safety popula tion (N=2252) received either -licensed comparator quadrivalent influenza vaccine (N=560). Study subjects were scheduled to receive either a single vaccination or two vaccinations 28 days apart based on their previous vacc ination history. Subjects were stratified into one of two age cohorts of 5 to less than 9 years or 9 to less than 18 years (51.2% and 48.8% of the study population, respectively). The mean age of the population was 9.5 years, 52.1% were male, and racial groups consisted of 73.3% White, 20.7% Black, 0.8% Asian, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander; 23.8% of subjects were Hispanic/ Latino (see 14 CLINICAL TRIALS). Local (injection -site) adverse reactions and system ic adverse events were solicited for 7 days post - vaccination (Table 4). Cellulitis -like reactions (defined as concurrent Grade 3 pain, redness, and swelling/lump) at the injection site were monitored for 28 days post -vaccination. Subjects were instructed to report and return to the clinic within 24 hours in the event of a cellulitis -like reaction. Unsolicited adverse events were collected for 28 days post -vaccination. SAEs, including deaths, were collected for 180 days post -vaccination.

One subject experienced a cellulitis -like reaction (defined as concurrent severe pain, redness and swelling) at the injection site after vaccination with AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA. In CSLCT -QIV- 13-02, cough (2.1%) was the most commonly reported unsolicited adverse event in subjects 5 to < 18 years of age administered AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA. Other commonly reported unsolicited adverse events (reported by 1% of subjects) were oropharyngeal pain (1.3%), pyrexia (1.3%) and upper respiratory tract infectio n (1.1%). The most commonly reported unsolicited adverse events among subjects who received AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA in ages 5 to < 9 years following the first or second dose included cough (2.8%), pyrexia (2.1%), headache illness (1.0%), and oropharyngeal pain (1.0%). For subjects ages 9 to < 18 years who received AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA, the most common unsolicited adverse events included oropharyngeal pain (1.6%), cough (1.3%), and upper re spiratory TETRA (Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (Split Virion)) Product Monograph Page 12 of 24 No deaths were reported in pediatric study CSLCT -QIV-13-02. In the 180 days following vaccinations, AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA and comparator vaccine recipients experienced similar rates of SAEs. None of the SAEs appeared related to the study vaccines except for one case of influenza B infection (considered a vaccine failure) in an AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA recipient. 8.3 Less Common Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions See 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS, Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions - Adults . 8.3.1 Less Common Clinical Tria l Adverse Reactions - Pediatrics See 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS, Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions - Pediatrics . 8.5 Post -Market Adverse Reactions Administration of Seqirus' 2010 Southern Hemisphere trivalent influenza vaccine (AFLURIA \u00ae, manufactured by CSL, now Seqirus Pty Ltd) was associated with increased rates of fever and febrile convulsions, predominantly in children below the age of 5 years as compared to previous years. Febrile events were also observed in children 5 to < 9 years of age. Following a comprehensive investigation into the 2010 Southern Hemisphere adverse events, Seqirus has modified the manufacturing conditions. A clinical program has subsequently been conducted with AFLURIA TETRA in adults and children. Fever rates in chi ldren 5 to < 9 years of age for AFLURIA TETRA in Study CSLCT -QIV- 13-02 were lower than those observed in several clinical studies for AFLURIA \u00ae (trivalent formulation) conducted prior to 2010 (see 8.2 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions - Adults and 8.2.1 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions - Pediatrics ). The results indicate that the safety profile of AFLURIA TETRA in children 5 years of age and older is similar to a U.S. -licensed comparator vaccine. The adverse events spontaneously reported during post approval use of AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA are presented below. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders Thrombocytopenia Immune System Disorders Allergic or immediate hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic shock Nervous System Disorders Neuralgia, para esthesia, convulsions, dizziness, neuritis - Barr\u00e9 syndrome Vascular Disorders Vasculitis which may be associated with renal involvement Musculoskeletal and Connectiv e Tissue Disorders Musculoskeletal pain and pain in the extremity Skin and Subcutaneous tissue disorders Pruritus, urticaria and rash General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Influenza -like illness, injected limb mobility decreased, pyrexia, in jection site erythema and injection site reaction AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA (Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (Split Virion)) Product Monograph Page 13 of 24 9 DRUG INTERACTIONS 9.2 Drug Interactions Overview No interaction studies have been performed on interaction between influenza vaccines in general and other vaccines or medications. 9.4 Drug -Drug Interactions Interactions with other drugs have not been established. 9.5 Drug -Food Interactions Interactions with food have not been established. 9.6 Drug -Herb Interactions Interactions with herbal products have not been established. 9.7 Drug -Laboratory Test Interactions Interactions with laboratory tests have not been established. 10 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOG Y 10.1 Mechanism of Action Influenza illness and its complications follow infection with influenza viruses. Global surveillance of influenza identifies yearly antigenic variants. For example, since 1977 antigenic variants of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and influenza B viruses have been in global circulation. Since 2001, two distinct lineages of influenza B (Victoria and Yamagata lineages) have co -circulated worldwide. Specific levels of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers post -vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine have not been correlated with protection from influenza virus. In some human studies, antibody titers of 1:40 or greater have been associated wi th protection from influenza illness in up to 50% of subjects. Antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibody to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect again st a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual change to one or more new strains in each year's influenz a vaccine. Therefore, inactivated influenza vaccines are standardized to contain the HA of four strains (i.e., typically two type A and two type B) representing the influenza viruses likely to be circulating during the upcoming winter. 10.2 Pharmacodynamics Seroprotection is generally obtained within 2 to 3 weeks. Annual revaccination with the current vaccine is recommended because immunity declines during the year after vaccination and circulating strains of influenza virus change from year to year. 10.3 Pharmacok inetics Not applicable. AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA (Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (Split Virion)) Product Monograph Page 14 of 24 Duration of Effect Protection against influenza post -vaccination is expected throughout the influenza season for which the vaccine is indicated.

Pharmaceutical standard: The vaccine is standardized according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and NACI requirements for the [ 2022 - 2023 ] influenza season. Product Characteristics AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA is a sterile, slightly opaque liquid with some white particulate sediment th at resuspends upon shaking to form a homogeneous suspension. AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA is an inactivated influenza vaccine prepared from virus grown in the allantoic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs, purified by zonal centrifugation, inactivated by beta -propiolactone and disrupted by sodium taurodeoxycholate. 14 CLINICAL TRIALS 14.1 Trial Design and Study Demographics The immunogenicity and safety of AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA has been studied in two Phase 3 clinical studies; one study in adults aged 18 years and above (Study CSLCT -QIV- 13-01) and one in children aged 5 to < 18 years (Study CSLCT -QIV-13-02). Table 5: Summary of patient demographics for clinical tr ials with AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA for the active immunization of adults and children aged 5 years or older for the prevention of influenza disease caused by influenza virus types A and B contained in the vaccine Study # Trial design Dosage, route of administration and duration Study subjects (n) Mean age (Range) Sex CSLCT - QIV- 13- 01 Phase 3, Randomized , Double Multicenter, Comparator Controlled study to demonstrate Immunogenicity, Non -Inferiority, Safety and Tolerability 0.5 mL dose, IM N = 3484 58 years (18 - 102 years) M = 43% F = 57% AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA (Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (Split Virion)) Product Monograph Page 16 of 24 Study # Trial design Dosage, route of administration and duration Study subjects (n) Mean age (Range) Sex CSLCT - QIV- 13- 02 Phase 3, Randomized , Observer -Blinded, Comparator Controlled study to demonstrate Immunogenicity, Non -Inferiority, Safety and Tolerability 0.5 mL dose, IM (unprimed subjects 2 x 0.5 mL dose, IM injection, 28 days apart). N = 2278 9.5 years (5 - 17 years) M = 52% F = 48% CSLCT double -blind, active comparator- controlled trial conducted in the U.S. in adults aged 18 years and older. Subjects received one dose of either QIV (N=1691) or one of two formulations of comparator trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV -1 N=854 or TIV -2 N=850), each containing an influenza type B virus that corresponded to one of the two B viruses in QIV (a type B virus of the Yamagata lineage (TIV -1) or a type B virus of the Victoria lineage (TIV -2)), respectively and the same influenza A subtype viruses. The comparator TIV was licensed in the U .S. and manufactured by Seqirus using a similar process to AFLURIA \u00ae treatment randomization 1:TIV -2). The age sub -groups were 18 to < 65 years and 65 years with mean ages of 43 years and 73 years, respectively. Post- vaccination immunogenicity was evaluated on sera obtained 21 days after administration of a single dose of QIV or TIV. The co -primary endpoints were HI Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) ratios (adjusted for baseline HI titers) and the difference in seroconversion r ates for each vaccine strain, 21 days after vaccination. Pre - specified non -inferiority criteria required that the upper bound of the 2 -sided 95% CI of the GMT ratio (TIV/QIV) did not exceed 1.5 and the upper bound of the 2 -sided 95% CI of the seroconversi on rate difference (TIV minus QIV) did not exceed 10% for each strain. CSLCT -QIV- 13-02 was a randomized , observer -blinded, comparator -controlled trial conducted in the U.S. in children 5 to < 18 years of age. Subjects received either one or two doses of ei ther QIV (N=1605) or a U. S.-licensed comparator QIV (N=528, manufactured by another company) in a 3:1 randomization treatment schedule. Subjects 5 to < 9 years of age were eligible to receive a second dose at least 28 days after the first dose depending on their influenza vaccination history. Approximately 25% of subjects in each treatment group in the 5 to < 9 years of age sub -group received two vaccine doses. Post -vaccination immunogenicity was evaluated by HI assay on sera obtained 28 days after the last vaccination dose. Baseline serology prior to vaccination was also collected for HI assessment. The co -primary endpoints were HI Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) (adjusted for baseline HI titers and other covariates) and seroconversion rates for each vaccine strain, 28 days after the last vaccination. Pre-specified non -inferiority criteria required that the upper bound of the 2 -sided 95% CI of the GMT ratio (Comparator QIV/QIV) did not exceed 1.5 and the upper bound of the 2 -sided 95% CI of the seroconversio n rate difference (Comparator QIV minus QIV) did not exceed 10% for each strain. AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA (Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (Split Virion)) Product Monograph Page 17 of 24 14.2 Study Results Adults: Serum HI antibody responses to QIV were non -inferior to both TIVs for all influenza strains, for subjects 18 years of age and older. Additionally, non -inferiority was demonstrated for both endpoints in both age sub -groups, adults aged 18 to < 65 years and 65 years (Table 6), for all strains. Antibody responses were lower in adults aged 65 years. Superiority of the immune response to each of the influenza B strains contained in QIV was shown relative to the antibody response after vaccination with TIV formulations not containing that B lineage strain for subjects 18 years of age and older. Superiority against the alternate B strain was also demonstrated for each of the influenza B strains in both age sub - groups; 18 to < 65 years and 65 years. Post- hoc analyses of immunogenicity by gender did not demonstrate significant differences between males and females. The study population was not sufficien tly diverse to assess differences between races or ethnicities.

General Toxicology: In the repeat dose toxicity study, m ale and female rats (10/sex/group) received a clinical dose (60 mcg HA/0.5 mL dose) of AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA via intramuscular injection on 3 occasions, 2 weeks apart. There was no evidence of systemic toxicity and the vaccine was locally well tolerated. Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology : In the reproductive and developmental toxicity study conducted with a similar trivalent influenza vaccine manufactured by Seqirus. Female rats received 2 intramuscular injections (0.5 mL per occasion, divided) of trivalent vaccine 21 and 7 days before mating and 1 or 2 additional injections during gestation on day 6, or days 6 and 20, respectively. On a body weight basis, each dose administered to rats was approximately 200 times the human AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA dose. Th ere was no maternal toxicity and fertility was not affected. No vaccine -related foetal malformations or variations and no adverse effects on pre -weaning development were observed in the study.

This leaflet is a summary and will not tell you everything about this drug. Talk to your healthcare professional about your medical condition and treatment and ask if there is any new information about AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA . What is AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA used for ? AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA is indicated for active immunization of persons aged 5 years and older against influenza disease caused by the influenza virus types A and B contained in the vaccine. AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA vaccine helps prevent influenza, often called \"the flu.\" Influenza is caused by infection with specific influenza viruses. New types of influenza viruses can appear each year. AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA vaccine contains fragments of four different types of influenza virus. Each year the World Health Organization decides which four types of viruses are most suitable to include in the vaccine. For this season (202 2 - 2023 ) the viruses A/ Victoria and B/Phuket/3073/2013 -like virus. You cannot catch influenza from the vaccine, as the virus in the vaccine has been killed and split into small non -infectious particles. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) encourages annual influenza vaccination for all Canadians who are able to have the vaccine. Vaccination against influenza is recommended every year, for anyone wanting to lower their chance of catching influenza. How does AFLURIA\u00ae TETRA work? AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA vaccine works by helping your body to protect itself against infection by the types of influenza viruses that are in the vaccine. The vaccine stimulates the body to make substances called antibodies. Antibodies fight the influenza virus. If you have been vaccinated, when you come into contact with the influenza viruses in the vaccine, your body is usually able quickly to destroy the virus, which may prevent you from getting influenza. Your body takes a few weeks after vaccination to fully develop effective protection against the influenza virus. Protection against influenza generally requires one dose of AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA vaccine. Some people including children who have not received influenza vaccination before may require two doses. Most people make satisfactory antibodies against the influenza virus. However, as with all vaccines, 100% protection cannot be guaranteed. The chance of having a severe unwanted reaction after having AFLURIA \u00ae TETRA vaccine is very small. Whereas, the risks of not being vaccinated against influenza may be very serious.
