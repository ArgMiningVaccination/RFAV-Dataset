The Department will publish a meeting agenda twenty -four (24) hours in advance indicating the order of its scheduled items at: http://www.scdhec.gov/Agenda . The Department publishes a Monthly Regulation Development Update tracking the status of its proposed new regulations, amendments, and repeals and providing links to associated State Register documents at http://www.scdhec.gov/Agency/RegulationsAndUpdates/RegulationDevelopmentUpdate/ . 4 Statement of Need and Reasonableness The following presents an analysis of the factors list ed in 1976 Code Section s 1-23-115(C)(1) -(3) and (9) - (11): DESCRIPTION OF REGULATION: 61-79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations Purpose: The purpose of these amendments is to maintain state consistency with the following EPA regulation published in the Federal Register: \"Management Standards for Hazardous Waste Pharmaceuticals and Amendment to the P075 Listing for Nicotine \" rule , published on February 22, 2019, at 84 FR 5816 -5950. Legal Authority: 1976 Code Sections 44-56-10 et seq. Plan for Implementation: The Department's Regulation Development Update (accessible at http://www.scdhec.gov/Agency/RegulationsAndUpdates/RegulationDevelopmentUpdate/) provides a summary of and link to this propose d amendment . Additionally, printed copie s are available for a fee from the Department's Freedom of Information Office. Upon taking legal effect, Department personnel will take appropriate steps to inform the regulated community of the amendment and any associated information. DETERMINATION OF NEED AND REASONABLENESS OF THE PROPOSED REGULATION BASED ON ALL FACTORS HEREIN AND EXPECTED BENEFITS: The Department proposes adopting the \"Management Standards for Hazardous Waste Pharmaceuticals and Amendment to the P075 Listing for Nicotine \" rule, published on February 22, 2019, at 84 FR 5816 -5950 . This rule creates new standards for the management of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals by healthcare facilities and reverse distributors in lieu of the existing generator regulations and reduces regulatory bur dens for over -the-counter FD A-approved nicotine replacement therapies. Adoption of this rule is required to comply with federal law and will bring R.61 -79 into conformity with the federal regulations. DETERMINATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS: The EPA estimates that the annualized cost to industry to comply with the requirements will be off -set by the cost -savings resulting from streamlined management standards for healthcare facilities and regulatory relief with regards to FDA -approved over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy products (Federal Register, Vol. 84, No. 36, page 5818) . The provisions of the final rule are expected to improve regulatory clarity and reduce regulatory burden. Additionally, to the extent that the rule reduces conce ntrations of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals in surface and drinking waters, this rule may result in improved ecosystems and human health outcomes. UNCERTAINTIES OF ESTIMATES: There are no uncertainties of estimates relative to the costs to the state or its political subdivisions. EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH: The proposed revisions to R.61 -79 will provide continued protection of the environment and human health in accordance with updates to federal law. 5 DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH IF THE REGULATION IS NOT IMPLEMENTED: If the Department does not adopt these amendments, the EPA's delegation of authority to the state to implement environmental protection programs would be compromised. As a delegated state program, the EPA requires South Carolina's regulations be at least as stringent as the federal regulations. Adoption of these proposed revisions will ensure equivalency with federal requirements. Text: Indicates Matter Stricken Indicates New Matter 61-79. Hazardous Waste Management Regulations.

[Comment: Unless the residue is being beneficially used or reused, or legitimately recycled or reclaimed; or being accumulated, stored, transported or treated prior to such use, re -use, recycling or reclamation, the Department considers the residue to be intended for discard, and thus, a hazardous waste. An example of a legitimate re -use of the residue would be where the residue remains in the container and the container is used to hold t he same commercial chemical product or manufacturing chemical intermediate it previously held. An example of the discard of the residue would be where the drum is sent to a drum reconditioner who reconditions the drum but discards the residue.] 6 Revise the entries in 261.33(e) Table to read: Section 261.33(e) Lists of Acute Hazardous Wastes (amended 11/90; 12/92; 5/96) Hazardous waste No. Chemical Wastes (amended 11/90; 12/92; 5/96) Hazardous waste No. Hazardous Wastes (amended 11/90; 12/92; 5/96) Hazardous waste No. Chemical Acute Hazardous Wastes (amended 11/90; 12/92; 5/96) Hazardous waste No. Acute Hazardous Wastes (amended 11/90; 12/92; 5/96) Hazardous waste No. Chemical 54-11-5 Nicotine listing does not include patches, gums , and lozenges that are FDA acetate 11 Lists of Acute Hazardous Wastes (amended 11/90; 12/92; 5/96) Hazardous waste No. Hazardous Wastes (amended 11/90; 12/92; 5/96) Hazardous waste No. Chemical does not include patches, gums , and lozenges that are Lists of Acute Hazardous Wastes (amended 11/90; 12/92; 5/96) Hazardous waste No. Chemical than 0.3% P001 1 81-81-2 Warfarin, & salts, Acute Hazardous Wastes (amended 11/90; 12/92; 5/96) Hazardous waste No. of Acute Hazardous Wastes (amended 11/90; 12/92; 5/96) Hazardous waste No. Chemical Hazardous Wastes (amended 11/90; 12/92; 5/96) Hazardous waste No. Chemical cyanide Ni(CN)2 17 Section 261.33(e) Lists of Acute Hazardous Wastes (amended 11/90; 12/92; 5/96) Hazardous waste No. Chemical abstracts No. Substance P075 1 54-11-5 Nicotine , & salts (this listing does not include , and lozenges that are - (S)-, does not include patches, gums , and lozenges that are Hazardous Wastes (amended 11/90; 12/92; 5/96) Hazardous waste No. Chemical abstracts salt 19 Section Lists of Acute Hazardous Wastes (amended 11/90; 12/92; 5/96) Hazardous waste No. Chemical of Acute Hazardous Wastes (amended 11/90; 12/92; 5/96) Hazardous waste No. 262.10(m) to read: (m) All reverse distributors (as defined in Section 266.500) are subject to part 266 , subpart P for the management of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals in lieu of this part.

ATTACHMENT B DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL CHAPTER 61 Statutory Authority: 1976 Code Sections 44 -56-10 et seq. Notice of Drafting: The Department of Health and Environmental Control (\"Department\") proposes amending R.61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations. Interested persons may submit comment(s) on the proposed amendment to Joe Bowers of the Bureau of Land and Waste Management; S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control, 2600 Bull Street, Columbia, S.C. 29201; bowersjb@dhec.sc.gov. To be considered, the Department must receive comments no later than 5:00 p.m. on May 26, 2020, the close of the Notice of Drafting comment period. Synopsis: Pursuant to R.61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations, the Department has the authority to manage hazardous wastes in the state of South Carolina. The Department proposes adopting the rule titled \"Management Standards for Hazardous Waste Pharmaceuticals and Amendment to the P075 Listing for Nicotine,\" published on February 22, 2019, at 84 FR 5816 -5950. This rule, published in the Federal Register by the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), creates new standards for the management of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals by healthcare facilities and reverse distributors in lieu of the generator regulations in Part 262 of R.61 -79. To better protect drinki ng and surface water, this rule establishes prohibitions on facilities from disposing of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals down the drain. This regulation also maintains the household hazardous waste exemption for pharmaceuticals collected during pharmaceuti cal take -back programs and events, while ensuring their proper disposal and codifies EPA's prior policy on the regulatory status of nonprescription pharmaceuticals going through reverse logistics. In addition, under this new rule, U.S. Food and Drug Admini stration -approved, over -the-counter nicotine replacement therapies (i.e., nicotine patches, gums and lozenges) will no longer be considered hazardous waste when discarded. This final rule also establishes a policy on the regulatory status of unsold retail items that are not pharmaceuticals and are managed via reverse logistics. Pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, S.C. Code Ann. Section 1 -23-120(H)(1), this proposed amendment is exempt from General Assembly review because it is necessary to maint ain compliance with federal law. (x) ACTION/DECISION ( ) INFORMATION Date: August 13 , 2020 To: S.C. Board of Health and Environmental Control From: Bureau of Land and Waste Management Re: Notice of Proposed Regulation Amending R.61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations I. Introduction The Bureau of Land and Waste Management (\"Bureau \") proposes the attached Notice of Proposed Regulation amending R.61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations , for publication in the August 28, 2020 , South Carolina State Register (\"State Register \"). Legal authority resides in the South Carolina Hazardous Waste Management Act, S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 44-56-10 et seq ., which authorizes the Department of Health and Environmental Control (\"Department\") to promulgate hazardous waste management regulations, proced ures, or standards as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment. The Administrative Procedures Act, S.C. Code Section 1 -23-120(A), requires General Assembly review of these proposed amendments . II. Facts 1.The Bureau proposes amending R.61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations , to adopt Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") interim final rule \"Safe Management of Recalled Airbags,\" published on November 30, 2018, at 83 FR 61552 -61563. This rule provides a conditional exem ption from the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\") hazardous waste requirements for entities, including but not limited to , automobile dealerships, automotive salvage and scrap yards, independent repair facilities , and collision centers that co llect airbag modules and inflators (\"airbag waste\") from automobiles as long as certain conditions are met. This rule enables expedited removal of defective airbag inflators. 2. The Bureau also proposes amending R.61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations , to adopt EPA final rule \"Universal Waste Regulations: Addition of Aerosol Cans ,\" published on December 9, 2019, at 84 FR 67202 -67220. This rule adds hazardous waste aerosol cans to the universal waste program under the federal RCRA regulations . Adopting the rule will reduce regulatory burdens on retail stores and other establishments that generate, manage , and dispose of aerosol cans by providing a clear, protective system for handling waste aerosol cans. This will promote the collec tion and recycling of aerosol cans and encourage the development of municipal and commercial programs to reduce the amount of aerosol can waste going to municipal solid waste landfills or combustors. 3.The EPA has given authorized states , including South Carolina, the discretion to adopt these rules, as they will make existing standards less stringent and provide more flexibility to the regulated community. 4. The proposed amendments also include changes such as corrections for clarity and readability, grammar, punctuation, codification, and other such regulatory text improvements. 5. The Bureau had a Notice of Drafting published in the April 24, 2020 , State Register . A copy of the Notice of Drafting appears herein as Attachment B. The Bur eau receive d no comments during the public comment period.1 ATTACHMENT A STATE REGISTER NOTICE OF PROPOSED REGULATION FOR R.61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations August 13 , 2020 Document No. _____ DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL CHAPTER 61 Statutory Authority: 1976 Code Sections 44-56-10 et seq. 61-79. Hazardous Waste Management Regulations. Preamble : The Department of Health and Environmental Control (\"Department\") proposes amending R.61 -79 to adopt two Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") rules published in the Federal Register. The EPA has given authorized states , including South Carolina , the dis cretion to adopt these rules as they will make existing standards less stringent and provide more flexibility to the regulated community. The \"Safe Management of Recalled Airbag s\" interim final rule, published on November 30, 2018, at 83 FR 61552 -6156 3 will create a conditional exemption from Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\") requirements for certain entities that collect airbag waste from automobiles. The \"Universal Waste Regulations: Addition of Aerosol Cans\" final rule publis hed on December 9, 2019, at 84 FR 67202 -67220 will reduce regulatory burdens on businesses that generate, manage , and dispose of aerosol cans. The Department also propos es corrections for clarity and readability, grammar, punctuation, codification, and oth er such regulatory text improvements. The Administrative Procedures Act, S.C. Code Section 1 -23-120(A), requires General Assembly review of these proposed rules . The Department had a Notice of Drafting published in the April 24, 2020 , South Carolina State Register . Section -by-Section Discussion of Proposed Amendment the definition of \"Universal waste\" to include aerosol can as described in section 273.6. 260.10(2)( i). Insert language into section ( i) to ensure that those who treat, dispos e or recycle universal waste under the provisions of parts 273.13(e) and 273.33(e) are considered Universal Waste Handlers. 261.

To be considered, the Department must receive the comment(s) by 5:00 p.m. on September 28 , 2020, the close of the comment period. The S.C. Board of He alth and Environmental Control will conduct a public hearing on the proposed amendments during its November 12 , 2020 , 10:00 a.m. meeting. Interested persons may make oral and/or submit written comments at the public hearing. Persons making oral comments s hould limit their statements to five (5) minutes or less. The meeting will take place in the Board Room of the DHEC Building, located at 2600 Bull Street, Columbia, S.C. 29201. Due to admittance procedures, all visitors must enter through the main Bull S treet entrance and register at the front desk. The Department will publish a meeting agenda twenty -four (24) hours in advance indicating the order of its scheduled items at: http://www.scdhec.gov/Agenda . The Department publishes a Monthly Regulation Development Update tracking the status of its proposed new regulations, amendments, and repeals and providing links to associated State Register documents at http://www.scdhec.gov/Agency/RegulationsAndUpdates/RegulationDevelopmentUpdate/ . 4 Preliminary Fiscal Impact Statement The proposed amendments have no substantial fiscal or economic impact on the state or its political subdivisions. Implementation of this regulation will not require additional resources beyond those allowed. There is no anticipated additional cost by the D epartment or state government due to any requirements of this regulation. Statement of Need and Reasonableness The following presents an analysis of the factors listed in 1976 Code Section s 1-23-115(C)(1) -(3) and (9) - (11): DESCRIPTION OF REGULATION: 61-79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations Purpose: The purpose of these amendments is to realize the benefits of and maintain state consistency with the following EPA regulations published in the Federal Register: \"Universal Waste Regulations: Addition of Aerosol Cans,\" published 2019, at 84 FR 67202 -67220 , and \"Safe Management of Recalled Airbags,\" November 30, 2018, at 83 FR 61552 -61563 . Legal Authority: 1976 seq. Plan for Implementation: The Department's Regulation Development Update (accessible at http://www.scdhec.gov/Agency/RegulationsAndUpdates/RegulationDevelopmentUpdate/) provides a summary of and link to this proposed amendment. Additionally, printed copies are available for a fee from the Departm ent's Freedom of Information Office. Upon taking legal effect, Department personnel will take appropriate steps to inform the regulated community of the amendment s and any associated information. DETERMINATION OF NEED AND REASONABLENESS OF THE PROPOSED REGULATION BASED ON ALL FACTORS HEREIN AND EXPECTED BENEFITS: The Department proposes amending R.61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations , to adopt EPA interim final rule \"Safe Management of Recalled Airbags,\" published on November 30, 2018, at 83 FR 61552 -61563. This rule provides a conditional exemption from the RCRA hazardous waste requirements for entities, including but not limited to , automobile dealerships, auto motive salvage and scrap yards, independent repair facilities , and collision centers that collect airbag modules and inflators (\"airbag waste\") from automobiles as long as certain conditions are met. This rule enables expedited removal of defective airbag inflators. The Department further proposes amending R.61 -79 to adopt the EPA final rule \"Universal Waste Regulations: Addition of Aerosol Cans ,\" published on December 9, 2019, at 84 FR 67202 -67220. This rule adds hazardous waste aerosol cans to the univer sal waste program under the federal RCRA regulations. Adopting the rule will reduce regulatory burdens on retail stores and other establishments that generate, manage , and dispose of aerosol cans by providing a clear, protective system for handling waste a erosol cans. This will promote the collection and recycling of aerosol cans and encourage the development of municipal and commercial programs to reduce the amount of aerosol can waste going to municipal solid waste landfills or combustors. DETERMINATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS: There is no anticipated increased cost to the state or its political subdivisions resulting from this proposed revision. The EPA estimates that the \"Safe Management of Recalled Airbags \" interim final rule will result 5 in industry savings between $1.7 million and $13 million (Federal Register, Vol 83, No. 231, page 61561) . Similarly, the EPA estimates annual industry cost savings for the \"Universal Waste Regulations: Addition of Aerosol Cans \" final rule to be between $5.3 million and $47.8 million (Federal Register Vol. 84, No. 236, page 67203). UNCERTAINTIES OF ESTIMATES: There are no uncertainties of estimates regarding costs to the state or its political subdivisions. EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH: The proposed revision s to R.61 -79 will provide continued protection of the environment and public health, as indicated above . DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH IF THE REGULATION IS NOT IMPLEMENTED: If the regulation is not implemented, there will be detrimental effect s on the environment and public health because South Carolina would not be implementing or realizing the benefits of the EPA's \"Universal Waste Regulations: Addition of Aerosol Cans\" final rule and the \"Safe Man agement of Recalled Airbags\" interim final rule described above . Statement of Rationale: Below is the Statement of Rationale pursuant to S.C. Code Section 1 -23-110(h): The Department proposes amending R.61 -79 to adopt two EPA rules published in the Federal Register. The EPA has given authorized states, including South Carolina , the discretion to adopt these rules as they will make existing standards less stringent and pr ovide more flexibility to the regulated community. The \"Safe Management of Recalled Airbags\" interim final rule, published on November 30, 2018, at 83 FR 61552 - 61563 will create a conditional exemption from RCR A requirements for certain entities that colle ct airbag waste from automobiles. The \"Universal Waste Regulations: Addition of Aerosol Cans\" final rule published on December 9, 2019, at 84 FR 67202 -67220 will reduce regulatory burdens on businesses that generate, manage, and dispose of aerosol cans.

Notice of Drafting: The Department of Health and Environmental Control (\"Department\") proposes amending R.61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations. Interested persons may submit comment(s) on the proposed amendment to Joe Bowers of the Bureau of Land and Waste Management; S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control, 2600 Bull Street, Columbia, S.C. 29201; bowersj b@dhec.sc.gov. To be considered, the Department must receive comments no later than 5:00 p.m. on May 26 , 2020, the close of the Notice of Drafting comment period. Synopsis: Pursuant to R.61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations, the Department has t he authority to manage hazardous wastes in the state of South Carolina. The Department proposes amending R. 61 -79 to adopt two final rules published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"). Because these two rules make standards less s tringent than the standards authorized states have been enforcing, the EPA has made adoption optional. The two final rules are summarized as follows: 1. The Department proposes adopting the rule titled \"Safe Management of Recalled Airbags,\" published on November 30, 2018 , at 83 FR 61552 -61563 . This rule provides a conditional exemption from the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( \"RCRA \") hazardous waste requirements for entities , including automobile dealerships, automotive salvage and scrap yards, independent repair facilities and collision centers, that collect airbag modules and inflators ( \"airbag waste \") from automobiles as long as certain conditions are met . This rule will help facilitate a more expediated removal of defective airbag infl ators. 2. The Department proposes adopting the rule titled \"Universal Waste Regulations: Addition of Aerosol Cans,\" published on December 9, 2019, at 84 FR 67202 -67220. This rule adds hazardous waste aerosol cans to the universal waste program under the f ederal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\") regulations. This change is expected to reduce regulatory burdens for retail stores and other establishments that generate, manage and dispose of aerosol cans by providing a clear, protective system fo r handling waste aerosol cans. This will promote the collection and recycling of aerosol cans and encourage the development of municipal and commercial programs to reduce the amount of aerosol can waste going to municipal solid waste landfills or combustor s. The Department may also include changes such as corrections for clarity and readability, grammar, punctuation, codification, and other such regulatory text improvements. The Administrative Procedures Act, S.C. Code Section 1 -23-120(A), requires General Assembly review of these proposed amendments. (x) ACTION/DECISION ( ) INFORMATION Date: August 13, 2020 To: S.C. Board of Health and Environmental Control From: Bureau of Air Quality Re: Notice of Proposed Regulation Amending Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards . I. Introduction The Bureau of Air Quality (Bureau) proposes the attached Notice of Proposed Regulation amending R.61 - 62, Air Pollution Control Regu lations and Standards, for publication in the August 28, 2020 , South Carolina State Register (State Register ). Legal authority for these amendments resides in the South Carolina Pollution Control Act, S.C. Code Sections 48 -1-10 et seq . (Pollution Control A ct), which authorizes the Department to adopt emission control regulations, standards, and limitations, and take all actions necessary or appropriate to secure to the state the benefits of federal air pollution control laws. The Administrative Procedures A ct, S.C. Code Section 1 -23-120(H)(1), exempts these amendments from General Assembly review, as the Department promulgates these amendments for compliance with federal air pollution control laws. II. Facts 1.Pursuant to the Pollution Control Act and th e federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 7410, 7413, and 7416, the Department must ensure national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards are achieved and maintained in South Carolina. No state may adopt or enforce an emission standard or limitation less stringent than these federal standards or limitations pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 7416. 2.The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgates amendments to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) throughout each calendar ye ar. Recent federal amendments to 40 CFR Parts 60 , 63, and 68 include revisions to New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) mandated by 42 U.S.C. Section 7411 ; federal National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Source Categories mandated by 42 U.S.C. Section 7412 ; and Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions mandated by 42 U.S.C. Section 7412(r) . 3.The Department proposes amending R.61 -62.60, South Carolina Designated Facility Plan and New Source Performance Standards ; R.61 -62.63, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Source Categories ; and R.61 -62.68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions , to incorporate federal amendments promulgated from January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2019. 4.The Department also proposes amending R.61 -62.60 to add Subpart UUUUa, which will include provisions for facilitating implementation of the EPA's \" Performance Standards and Compliance Times for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Electric Utility Gen erating Units,\" also known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, as published in the Federal Register on July 8, 2019 (84 FR 32520). This proposed amendment is to ensure compliance with federal law. 5.The Department also proposes amending R.61 -62.60 to delete Subpart B - \"Adoption and Submittal of State Plans for Designated Facilities.\" This subpart incorporates by reference EPA implementing regulations found at 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart B, which is directly applicable to EPA and states. These Attachments: A. Notice of Proposed Regulation B. Notice of Drafting published in the February 28, 2020 , State Register 1 ATTACHMENT A STATE REGISTER NOTICE OF PROPOSED REGULATION FOR R. 61 -62, AIR POLLUTION CONTROL REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS August 13, 2020 Document No. _____ DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL CHAPTER 61 Statutory Authority: 1976 Code Sections 48 -1-10 et s eq. 61-62. Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards. Preamble: Pursuant to the South Carolina Pollution Control Act , S.C. Code Sections 48 -1-10 et seq., and the federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 7410, 7413, and 7416, the Department of Hea lth and Environmental Control (Department) must ensure national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards are achieved and maintained in South Carolina. No state may adopt or enforce an emission standard or limitation less stringent than these fe deral standards or limitations pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 7416. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgates amendments to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) throughout each calendar year. Recent federal amendments at 40 CFR Parts 60, 63, and 68 include revisions to New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Source Categories, and Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. The Department proposes amending R .61-62.60, South Carolina Designated Facility Plan and New Source Performance Standards; R.61 -62.63, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Source Categories; and R.61 -62.68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, to incorp orate federal amendments promulgated from January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2019. The Department also proposes amending R.61 -62.60 to add Subpart UUUUa, which will include provisions for facilitating implementation of the EPA's \" Performance Standards and Compliance Times for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Electric Utility Generating Units,\" also known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule , as published in the Federal Register on July 8, 2019 (84 FR 32520). This proposed amendment is to ensure compliance with federal law. The Department also proposes amending R.61 -62.60 to delete Subpart B - \"Adoption and Submittal State Plans for Designated Facilities.\" This subpart incorp orates by reference EPA implementing regulations found at 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart B, which is directly applicable to EPA and states. These implementing regulations have been updated through EPA's promulgation of 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart Ba, which is also directly applicable to EPA and states and need not be incorporated by reference by the Department. The Department therefore proposes to delete R.61 -62.60, Subpart B for simplicity and to maintain compliance with federal law. The Department also proposes ot her changes to R.61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards , as deemed necessary to maintain compliance with federal law. These changes include corrections or other changes for internal consistency, clarification, reference, punctuation, codifi cation, formatting, spelling and overall improvement of the text of R.61 -62 as necessary. 2 South Carolina industries are already subject to national air quality standards and NSPS, NESHAP, and Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions as a matter of federal law. The Department must incorporate amendments to the federal regulations because the EPA has delegated South Carolina authority for implementation and enforcement of these federal regulations. Federal law also requires South Carolina's adoption of a stat e plan for compliance with EPA's ACE rule. Thus, there will be no increased cost to the state or its political subdivisions resulting from adoption of these federal amendments beyond those mandated by federal law . South Carolina is already reaping the envi ronmental benefits of these amendments . The Administrative Procedures Act, S.C. Code Section 1 -23-120(H)(1), exempts these amendments from General Assembly review because the Department proposes promulgating the amendments to maintain compliance with fede ral law. As such, neither a preliminary assessment report nor a preliminary fiscal impact statement is required. The Department had a Notice of Drafting published in the February 28, 2020 , South Carolina State Register.

The Department publishes a Monthly Regulation Development Update tracking the status of its proposed new regulations, amendments, and repeals and providing links to associated State Register documents at http://www.scdhec.gov/Agency/RegulationsAndUpdates/RegulationDevelopmentUpdate/ . Statement of Need and Reasonableness The following presents an analysis of the factors listed in 1976 Code Section s 1-23-115(C)(1) -(3) and (9) - (11): DESCRIPTION OF REGULATION: Amendment of R.61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, and the South Carolina Air Quality Implementation Plan (SIP). Purpose: The EPA promulgated amendments to national air qu ality regulations in 2019. The recent federal amendments include clarification, guidance, and technical revisions to requirements for NSPS mandated by 42 U.S.C. Section 7411, and for federal NESHAP for Source Categories mandated by 42 U.S.C. Section 7412. The Department, therefore, proposes amending R.61 -62 to incorporate these amendments to federal standards promulgated from January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2019. Additionally, t he Department proposes amending R.61 -62.60 to add Subpart UUUUa, \" Performance Standards and Compliance Times for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Electric Utility Generating Units,\" to facilitate implementation of the federal ACE rule and ensure compliance with federal law . The Department also proposes amending R.61 -62.68 to adopt amendments to the corresponding federal regulations at 40 CFR Part 68 to ensure compliance with those regula tions . The Department proposes to make corrections for internal consistency, clarification, and codification, to improve the overall text as necessary to maintain compliance with federal law. Legal Authority: 1976 Code Sections 48 -1-10 et seq . Plan for Implementation: Upon taking legal effect, Department personnel will take appropriate steps to inform the regulated community of the amendments and any associated information. The DHEC Regulation Development Update (accessible at http://www.scdhec.gov/Agency/RegulationsAndUpdates/RegulationDevelopmentUpdate/ ) provides a 13 summary of and link to these proposed amendments. Additionally, printed copies are available fo r a fee from the Department's Freedom of Information Office. DETERMINATION OF NEED AND REASONABLENESS OF THE PROPOSED REGULATION BASED ON ALL FACTORS HEREIN AND EXPECTED BENEFITS: The EPA promulgates amendments to its air quality regulations throughout e ach calendar year. Federal amendments in 2019 included revised NSPS rules and NESHAPs for Source Categories. South Carolina is mandated by law to adopt these federal amendments. These amendments are reasonable as they promote consistency and ensure complia nce with both state and federal regulations. The proposed amendments also include amending R.61 -62.60 to add Subpart UUUUa, \" Performance Standards and Compliance Times for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Electric Utility Generating Units,\" to facili tate implementation of the federal ACE rule and ensure compliance with federal law . The proposed revisions also include amending R.61 -62.68 to adopt amendments to the corresponding federal regulations at 40 CFR Part 68, to ensure compliance with those regu lations. The Department also proposes to make corrections for internal consistency, clarification, and codification, to improve the overall text as necessary to maintain compliance with federal law. DETERMINATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS: There is no anticipated increase in costs to the state or its p olitical subdivisions resulting from these proposed revisions. The NSPS, NESHAP, and Chemical Accident Prevention standards to be adopted are already in effect and applicable to the regulated community as a matter of federal law, thus the amendments do not present a new cost to the regulated community. The Department must incorporate amendments to the federal regulations because the EPA has delegated South Carolina authority for implementation and enforcement of these federal regulations. Federal law also r equires South Carolina's adoption of a state plan for compliance with EPA's ACE rule. The Department proposes the addition of Subpart UUUUa to R.61 - 62.60 to facilitate required implementation of the ACE rule. Costs to the regulated community resulting from this amendment attributable to and required by the federal ACE rule. The proposed amendments incorporate revisions to the EPA regulations, which the Department implements pursuant to the authority granted by Section 48 -1-50 of the Pollution Control Act. The proposed amendments will benefit the regulated community by clarifying and updating the regulations and increasing their ease of use. UNCERTAINTIES OF ESTIMATES: There are no uncertainties of estimates relative to the costs to the state or its political subdivisions. EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH: Adoption of the recent changes in federal regulations through the proposed amendments to R.61 -62 will provide continued protection of the environment and public health. DETRIMENTAL EFF ECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH IF THE REGULATION IS NOT IMPLEMENTED: The state's authority to implement federal requirements, which are beneficial to the public health and environment, would be compromised if these amendments are not adopted.

ATTACHMENT B ( ) INFORMATION Date: August 13, 2020 To: S.C. Board of Health and Environmental Control From: Bureau of Environmental Health Services Re: Notice of Proposed Regulation amending R.61 -56, Onsite Wastewater Systems ; and repealing R.61 -55, Septic Tank Site Evaluation Fees , R.61 -56.1, License to Construct or Clean Onsite Sewage Treatment and Disposal Systems and Self-Contained Toilets , and R.61-56.2, Licensing of Onsite Wastewater Systems Master Contractors . I. Introduction The Bureau of Environmental Health Services (\"Bureau\") proposes the attached Notice of Proposed Regulation amending R.61 -56, Onsite Wastewater Systems . The Bureau further proposes amending requirements of R.61 -56.1, License to Construct or Clean Onsite Sewage Treatment and Disposal Systems and Self -Contained Toilets , and R.61 -56.2, Licensing of Onsite Wastewater Systems Master Contractors , merging R.6 1-56.1 and and R.61 and adding their provisions, as amended, to R.61 -56. Additionally, the Department proposes merg ing R.61- 55, Septic Tank Site Evaluation Fees, into R.61 -56. This will ent ail repealing R.61 -55 and adding its provisions, as amended, to R.61 -56. The Bureau proposes these amendments and repeals for publication in the August 28, 2020, South Carolina State Register (\"State Register \"). Legal authority resides in S.C. Code Sectio ns 44 -1-140(11), 44 -1-150, 44-55-825, 44-55-827, and 48 -1-10 et seq ., which enable the Department of Health and Environmental Control (\"Department\") to promulgate regulations related to the disposal of sewage and establish fees. The Administrative Procedu res Act, S.C. Code Section 1 -23-120(A), requires General Assembly review of these amendments. II. Facts 1. Pursuant to R.61 -56, the Department provides oversight for safe treatment and disposal of domestic wastewater to protect the health of families and communities . In accordance with Department issu es onsite wastewater contractor licenses, permits to construct , and approvals to operate for individual onsite wastewater treatment systems (septic systems) . 2. The Department proposes amend ing R.61-56, Onsite Wastewater Systems, to add new system standards, clarify and amend definitions , and clarify and update selected sections . The amendments will modernize the regulation and streamline permitting procedures to address needed updates in administering the Onsite Wastewater program. 3. The Department also pr oposes amending provisions of R.61 -56.1 and R.61 -56.2 into R.61 -56 to improve efficiency and clarity for regulated entities and the public. This will entail repealing R.61 -56.1 and R.61 -56.2 and simultaneously adding th eir provisions, as amended, to R.61 - 56. The proposed amendments include changes to licensing requirements for pumpers and haulers currently under R.61 -56.1. The proposed amendments will revise provisions currently contained in R.61 -56.2 to implement a tier ed licensing program to establish improved competency of onsite wastewater system contractors/installers. This approach includes new requirements for examination and continuing education. In addition, because R.61 -56.1 and R.61 -56.2 are being combined with R.61 -56, previously separate enforcement provisions will also be consolidated and updated for clarity and to improve administration of the Onsite Wastewater program. 4.The proposed revisions would expand existing site evaluation options and allow more streamlined permit processing by allowing an applicant to submit a proposed system layout from a licensed Professional Soil Classifier (\"PSC\"). Under the proposal, applicants desiring to install systems for a subdivision would be required to submit third -party soils work from a PSC. The PSC would then have the option to either submit a proposed system layout under one of the system standard s established within R.61 -56 or give the soils report to a Registered Professional Engineer to design a specialized septic system through the 610 S tandard. Subdivision permit applicants may incur additional costs for the third -party work performed by a PSC under this process. Outside of the subdivision context, applicants for conventional systems will retai n the option to use a PSC or allow the Department to conduct a soil evaluation and prepare a system layout. The expanded options and enhanced involvement of third -party PSCs will serve to streamline and expedite the permit process for the Department and th e regulated community. 5.In the interest of efficiency, the Department proposes repealing R.61 -55 and add ing its provisions to R.61 -56. The proposed amendments related to R.61 -55 include amendments to definitions and other changes as necessary to facili tate merging this regulation into R.61 -56. 6. The Department also proposes other corrections for clarity and readability, grammar, punctuation, codification, and regulation text improvement. 7.The Department had a Notice of Drafting published in the Mar ch 27, 2020, State Register . A copy of the Notice of Drafting appears herein as Attachment B. The Department received only one public comment by the April 27, 2020, close of the public comment period. Attachment C presents a summary of the public comment r eceived and the Department 's response. 8.The Bureau held twenty -two (22) separate meetings between August 2, 2017, and July 1, 2020, to solicit stakeholder input, including open -invitation public meetings, in person and virtually, and individual interest group discussions. A total of three hundred and seventy -five (375) stakeholders attended. The Bureau utilized the Department's website and agency calendar to advertise these meetings , as well as mailed invitation cards and emailed invitations to identifie d stakeholders. The Bureau received f avorable feedback from these meetings. 9.Appropriate Department staff conducted an internal review of the proposed amendments on July 8, 2020. III. Request for Approval The Bureau respectfully requests the Board to grant approval of the attached Notice of Proposed Regulation for publication in the August 28, 2020 , State Register . _________________________ _________________________ Renee Shealy Myra Reece Bureau Chief, Bureau of Environmental Director, Environmental Affairs Health Services Attachments: A.

Preliminary Fiscal Impact Statement There is no anticipated additional cost to the Department or state government due to any requirements of this amendment. Statement of Need and Reasonableness The following presents an analysis of the factors listed in 1976 Code Sections 1 -23-115(C)(1) -(3) and (9) - (11): DESCRIPTION OF REGULATION: 61-55, Septic Tank Site Evaluation Fees; 6 1-56, Onsite Wastewater Systems; 61 -56.1, License To Construct Or Clean Onsite Sewage Treatment And Self -Contained Toilets; and 61-56.2, Licensing Of Onsite Wastewater Systems Master Contractors 18 Purpose: The Department proposes amend ing R.61-56, Onsite Wastewater Systems, to add new system standards, clarify and amend definitions , and clarify and update selected sections . The amendments will modernize the regulation and streamline permitting procedures to address needed updates in administering the Onsite Wastewater program. The Department also proposes amending provisions of R.61 -56.1 and R.61 -56.2 -56.2 into R.61 -56 to improve efficiency and clarity for regulated entities and the public. This will entail repealing R.61 -56.1 and R.61 -56.2 and simultaneously adding their provisions, as amended, to R.61 -56. The proposed amendments include changes to licensing requiremen ts for pumpers and haulers currently under R.61 -56.1. The proposed amendments will revise provisions currently contained in R.61 -56.2 to implement a tiered licensing program to establish improved competency of onsite wastewater system contractors/installer s. This approach includes new requirements for examination and continuing education. In addition, because R.61 -56.1 and R.61 -56.2 are being combined with R.61 -56, previously separate enforcement provisions will also be consolidated and updated for clarity and to improve administration of the Onsite Wastewater program. In the interest of efficiency, the Department also proposes repealing R.61 -55 and add ing its provisions to R.61 -56. The proposed amendments related to R.61 -55 include amendments to definitions and other changes as necessary to facilitate merging this regulation into R.61 -56. The Department also proposes other corrections for clarity and readability, grammar, punctuation, codification, and regulation text improvement. Legal Authority: 1976 Cod e Section(s) 44-1-140(11), 44 48-1-10 et seq. Plan for Implementation: Upon taking legal effect, Department personnel will take appropriate steps to inform the regulated community of the new amendments and repeals and any associated information. The DHEC Regulation Development Update (accessible at http://www.scdhec.gov/Agency/RegulationsAndUpdates/RegulationDevelopmentUpdate/) provides a summary of and link to these proposed amendments and repeals . Additionally, printed c opies are available for a fee from the Department's Freedom of Information Office. DETERMINATION OF NEED AND REASONABLENESS OF THE PROPOSED REGULATION BASED ON ALL FACTORS HEREIN AND EXPECTED BENEFITS: The proposed amendments and repeals are needed and reasonable , as they will provide clarification regarding the requirements and standards contained in R.61 -56 and consistency with the latest scientific , industrial , and technological changes in onsite wastewater system design, construction , and installatio n. Furthermore, the proposed amendments will simplify the licensure of those operators that clean or pump sewage treatment and disposal systems and, for organization and clarity, provide a tiered structure for the licensure of operators that construct or install these systems. The proposed amendments will also serve to modernize the regulation and streamline permitting procedures to improve overall effectiveness of the Department's administration of the regulation. DETERMINATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS: Internal Costs: Implementation of these amendments will not require additional resources. There is no anticipated additional cost to the Department or state government due to any inherent requirements of these revisions. External Costs: The proposed revisions do not increase any fees charged by the Department under the current regulations. The proposed revisions would expand existing site evaluation options and allow more streamlined permit processing by allowing an applicant to submit a proposed system layout from a licensed Professional Soil Classifier (\"PSC\"). Under the proposal, applicants desiring to install systems for a subdivision would be required to submit third -party soils work from a PSC. The PSC would then have the option to either submit a proposed system layout under one of the system standard s established within R.61 -19 56 or give the soils report to a Registered Professional Engineer to design a specialized septic system through the 610 S tandard. Subdivision permit applicants may incur additional costs for the third -party work performed by a PSC under this process. Outside of the subdivision context, applicants for conventional systems will retain the option to use a PSC or allow the Department to conduct a soil evaluation and prepare a system layout. The expanded options and enhanced involvement of third -party PSCs will serve to streamline and expedite the permit process for the Department and the regulated community. Benefits: These amendments upgrade overall quality and pra cticality, improve clarity and consistency, reflect changes in design, construction, and installation of onsite wastewater system nomenclature and technology, separate the licensing of pumper/haulers and installers, provide for tiered licensure, streamline permitting, clarify existing definitions, and add new definitions and standards for site and system requirements . UNCERTAINTIES OF ESTIMATES: None . EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH: There is no anticipated negative environmental or public health effect resulting from the proposed amendments and repeals of these regulations. Positive benefits include fostering increased installer competency through new continuing education requirements and the tiered system of licensure according to system complexity . The additions also enable the Department to focus efforts on ensuring installations are performed in accordance with the issued permit while allowing additional input in the soil evaluation and system layout stages from professionally ce rtified persons. DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH IF THE REGULATION IS NOT IMPLEMENTED: The negative effect on the environment and public health if the proposed amendment of this regulation is not implemented would be less efficie ncy and clarity for industry and reduced effectiveness and efficiency in the Department's oversight of the disposal of septage and sewage. Statement of Rationale: Here below is the Statement of Rationale pursuant to S.C. Code Section 1 -23-110(A)(3) (h): The Department proposes amend ing R.61-56, Onsite Wastewater Systems, to add new system standards, clarify and amend definitions , and clarify and update selected sections . The amendments will modernize the regulation and streamline permitting procedures to address needed updates in administering the Onsite Wastewater program. The Department also proposes amending provisions of R.61 -56.1 and R.61 -56.2 -56.2 into R.61 -56 to improve efficiency and clarity for regulated entities and the public. This will entail repealing R.61 -56.1 and R.61 -56.2 and simultaneously adding their provisions, as amended, to R.61 -56. The proposed amendments include changes to licensing r equirements for pumpers and haulers currently under R.61 -56.1. The proposed amendments will revise provisions currently contained in R.61 -56.2 to implement a tiered licensing program to establish improved competency of onsite wastewater system contractors/ installers. This approach includes new requirements for examination and continuing education. In addition, because R.61 -56.1 and R.61 -56.2 are being combined with R.61 -56, previously separate enforcement provisions will also be consolidated and updated for clarity and to improve administration of the Onsite Wastewater program. In the interest of efficiency, the Department also proposes repealing R.61 -55 and add ing its provisions to R.61 -56. The proposed amendments related to 20 R.61 -55 include amendments to de finitions and other changes as necessary to facilitate merging this regulation into R.61 -56. The Department also proposes other corrections for clarity and readability, grammar, punctuation, codification, and regulation text improvement.

Purposes and Scope . (1) A major factor influencing the health of individuals where public wastewater treatment facilities are not available is the proper onsite treatment and disposal of domestic w astewater. Diseases such as dysentery, cholera, infectious hepatitis, typhoid , and paratyphoid are transmitted through the fecal contamination of food, water, and the land surface largely due to the improper treatment and disposal of domestic wastewater. For this reason, every effort should be made to prevent such hazards and to treat and dispose of all human domestic wastewater through the practical application of the best and most cost affective effective technology available. (2) Safe treatment and disposal of domestic w astewater is necessary to protect the health of families and communities , and to prevent the occurrence of public health nuisances. Domestic wastewater can be rendered ecologically safe and public health can be protected if such waste s are disposed of so that: A. (a) They will not contaminate any drinking water supply. B. (b) They will not give rise to a public health hazard by being accessible to insects, rodents, or other possible carriers, which may come into contact with food or drinking water. C. (c) They will not give rise to a public health hazard by being accessible to children or adults. 23 D. (d) They will not violate federal and state laws or regulations governing water pollution or sewage disposal. E. (e) They will not pollute or contaminate any waters of the state. F.(f) They will not give rise to a public health nuisance. (3) Where the installation of an onsite wastewater system is necessary, the basic principles of design, construction, installation, operation and maintenance shall be followed. 101 DEFINITIONS AND REFERENCES 101.

Notice of Drafting: The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (\"Department\") proposes amending R.61 -56, Onsite Wastewater Systems. The Department also proposes amending requirements of R.61 -56.1, License to Construct or Clean Onsite Sewage Treatment and Disposal Systems and Self -Contained Toilets, and R.61 -56.2, Licensing of Onsite Wastewater System Master Contract ors, and merging R.61 -56.1 and R.61 and R.61 and adding their provisions, as amended, to R.61 -56. Additionally, the Department proposes to merge R.61 -55, Septic Tank Site Evaluation Fees, into R. 61-56. This will entail repealing R.61 -55 and adding its provisions, as amended, to R.61 -56. Interested persons may submit comment(s) on the proposed amendments and repeals to David R. Vaughan, Director, Division of Onsite Wastewater Management, Rabies Prevention, and Enforcement, S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control, 2600 Bull Street, Columbia, S.C. 29201 or via email at vaughadr@dhec.sc.gov . To be considered, the Department must receive comment s no later than 5:00 p.m. on April 27, 2020, the close of the drafting comment period. Synopsis: Pursuant to R.61 -56, the Department helps to ensure the safe treatment and disposal of domestic wastewater to protect the health of families and communities . In accordance R.61 -56.2, the Department issues onsite wastewater contractor licenses, permits to construct, and approvals to operate for individual onsite wastewater treatment systems (septic systems). The Departme nt proposes amending R.61 -56, Onsite Wastewater Systems, to add new system standards, clarify and amend definitions, and clarify and update selected sections. The amendments will modernize the regulation and streamline permitting procedures to address need ed updates in administering the Onsite Wastewater program. The Department also proposes amending provisions of R.61 -56.1 and R.61 into R.61 -56 to improve efficiency and clarity for regulated entities and the publ ic. This will entail repealing R.61 -56.1 and R.61 -56.2 and simultaneously adding their provisions, as amended, to R.61 - 56. The proposed amendments will include changes to licensing requirements for pumpers and haulers currently under R.61 -56.1. The propos ed amendments will revise provisions currently contained in R.61 - 56.2 to implement a tiered licensing program to establish improved competency of onsite wastewater system contractors/installers. This approach includes new requirements for examination and c ontinuing education. In addition, because R.61 -56.1 and R.61 -56.2 are being combined with R.61 -56, previously separate enforcement provisions will also be consolidated and updated for clarity and to improve administration of the Onsite Wastewater program. In the interest of efficiency, the Department proposes repealing R.61 -55 and adding its provisions to R.61 - 56. The proposed amendments related to R.61 -55 will include amendments to definitions and other changes as necessary to facilitate merging this regu lation into R.61 -56. 166 The Department may also include corrections for clarity and readability, grammar, punctuation, codification, and regulation text improvement. The Administrative Procedures Act, S.C. Code Section 1 - 23-120(A), requires General Assembly review of these proposed amendments and repeals. 167 ATTACHMENT C SUMMARY OF PUBLIC COMMENTS AND DEPARTMENT RESPONSES R.61-56, Onsite Wastewater Systems As of the April 27, 2020 , close of the Notice of Drafting c omment period: Name Section Department Response Michael S. Traynham R.61 -56.102.5(3) New section 103.1.(5)(c) Both the existing R.61 -56 and proposed revisions to the regulation require financial assurances for operation, maintenance, and replacement of systems components for community or cluster systems owned by a private entity or person. Financial assurance agreements are entered into in tandem with the Department's Bureau of Water (\"BOW\") using established procedures. The Department has determined that this approach continues to be effective for ensuring satisfactory financial assurance. Comment: As you may be aware, our firm frequently represents parties with significant interests in the application of Department Regulations, including Regulation 61 -56. We are writing to address one issue not squarely addressed in the Notice of Drafting, which I believe requires immediate attention to appropriately \"modernize the regulation and streamline permitting procedures\" for systems under the purview of the Onsite Wastewater program. Specifically, we believe the current ambiguous language addressing financial assur ance for community treatment systems should be revised to align with financial assurance language and requirements in other environmental regulatory programs managed by the Department. The current language of S.C. Code Ann. Regulation 61 -56 provides only that \"[a]n onsite wastewater system serving more than one (1) piece of deeded property shall be considered as a community or cluster collection and treatment system and ... [i]f the project is owned by a private entity or person, the Department shall requ ire financial assurances for the operation, maintenance, and replacement of the tank(s) and subsurface wastewater infiltration area system and relevant collection/pumping components.\" R.61 -56.102.5(3). No further guidance is provided to the staff here or elsewhere in Regulations as to what forms of financial assurance will be deemed 168 acceptable for these systems. As a matter of practice, the Department has required system owners to enter into complex financial assurance agreements and make cash deposits with the State Treasurer's Office in accounts to be overseen by the Department. These arrangements and the strict cash requirement for financial assurance are unnecessarily constraining for property owners and developers, and administratively burdensome on the Department. Moreover, these financial agreements are not presented to the applicants in a timely manner and often further delay the permitting process. By contrast, the Department Solid Waste Regulations allow a solid waste landfill permittee to fulfill its obligation for financial assurance through several enumerated methods including: a trust fund, surety bond, letter of credit, insurance, corporate financial test, certificate of deposit, other state approved mechanism, or any combination thereof. See, S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 61 -107.19 Part I(E)(4). As a general principle, solid waste landfills would likely present a more significant environmental and financial risk than a small subdivision community wastewater system. It would seem reasonable that the finan cial assurance instruments appropriate to address the risks of landfills could also be employed in other situations where financial assurance is required by the Department. We would request that the Department consider adoption of financial assurance lan guage in R.61 -56 that is similar to that utilized in R. 61 -107.19.

Tuberculin Skin Test Requirements. Within three months prior to initial application and annually thereafter, midwives and apprentices shall have a tuberculin skin test, unless a previously positive reaction can be documented. The intradermal (Mantoux) method, using five tuberculin units of stabilized purified protein derivative (PPD) is to be used. Persons with tuberculin test reactions of 10mm or more of induration should be referred to a physician for app ropriate evaluation. The two- step procedure (one Mantoux test followed one week later by another) is required for initial testing in order to establish a reliable baseline. a. Persons with reactions of 10mm and over to the initial application tuberculin test, those who have previously- documented positive reactions, those with new positive reactions to the skin tests, and those with symptoms suggestive of TB (e.g., cough, weight loss, night sweats, fever, etc.), shall be given a chest X-ray to determine w hether TB is present. If TB is diagnosed, the person shall be referred to a physician for appropriate treatment and contacts examined. b.

Preventive treatment of personnel with new positive reactions is essential, and shall be considered for all infected applicants who have patient contact, unless specifically contraindicated. Persons who complete treatment may be exempt from further routine chest X -rays unless they have symptoms of TB. Routine annual chest X -rays of persons with positive reactions do little to prevent TB and theref ore are not a substitute for preventive treatment. 18 h. Post exposure skin tests should be provided for tuberculin negative persons within 12 weeks after termination of contact for any suspected exposure to a documented case of TB. 7. Delinquency Period. Delinquency in renewal of licensure of 30 days after the license expiration date shall result in a delinquency fee of $25 in addition to the licensure fees noted in Section B.4.

Notice of Drafting: The Department of Health and Environmental Control (\"Department\") proposes amending R.61- 24, Licensed Midwives. Interested persons may submit comment(s) on the proposed amendments to the Bureau of Health Facilities Licensing; S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control, 2600 Bull Street, Columbia, S.C. 29201; healthregcomm@dhec.sc.gov. To be considered, the Department must receive comments no later than 5:00 p.m. on March 30, 2020 the close of the draft comment period. Synopsis: Pursuant o R.61- 24, Licensed Midwives, the Department is responsible for regulating the general licensing, certification, inspection, education requirement s, and training procedures for midwives. The Department proposes amending R.61- 24 to update and revise definitions and requirements regarding obtaining licensure, inspections, violations, training, responses to medical emergencies, required physician approvals, client records and care, record maintenance and retention, and licensure standards. The Department may add language to incorporate current provider -wide exceptions applicable to midwifery. The Department may also include stylistic changes, which may include corrections for clarity, readability, grammar, punctuation, codification, and overall improvement of the text. 47 ATTACHMENT C SUMMARY OF PUBLIC COMMENTS AND DEPARTMENT RESPONSES R.61-24, Licensed Midwives As of the March 30, 2020, close of the Notice of Drafting c omment period: NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1. Lori Gibson, CPM, LM, MBC - Chair of Midwifery Advisory Council on behalf of MAC General Partially Adopted. PALM's recommendations were considered in the development of the regulation. Adapting these PALM suggestions into the regulations will be integral for the assurance of best practices for our South Carolina Licensed Midwives serving in community birth settings. The revisions and additions reflect the national standards and include skills developed and required during training. Licensed Midwives are the only midwives exclusively trained to work in out of hospital, low technology settings such as homes or birth centers. Our state regulations must reflect those skills to ensure that the families they serve are receiving the highest quality of care. The Midwifery Advisory Council believes that the PALM proposed revisions will help further the integration of midwifery care into our state system . This will serve to allow more and smoother access to midwifery skills without delay, especially in areas where birthing families are underserved by the medical system. MAC is available to the Health Regulations Committee to serve for the purpose of revi ewing and advising the Department regarding matters pertaining to the training, practices, and regulation of midwives in South Carolina. Please contact us through out this process of revising Regulation 61- 24 so that we may, as a Council, partner with the Health Regulations Committee to bring these regulations up to date with current and evidence based additions and changes pertaining to midwifery. Sincerely, Lori Gibson, CPM, LM, MBC - Chair of Midwifery Advisory Council on behalf of MAC: Joanne Gottscha ll, CPM Lisa Judy Fry, CNM Jessica Day, CNM Dr. Rachel Hall Geoffrey Chambers, Consumer Member 48 NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 2. Nicole Lavallee CPM, SCLM General Partially Adopted. Midwives are required to meet NARM requirements and be certified by NARM and within the scope of practice. This regulation does not require the oversight by a physician. Any changes to Regulation 61 -24 should align with the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM) standards of care, certification, and scope of practice and be approved by the Midwifery Advisory Council (MAC). Under no circumstances should the level of physician oversight that DHEC tried to push in 2015 be repeated, as that would shut down the legal homebirth route in SC, and result a protest similar to December 2015 protest at Bull St. NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 3. Cyndi Rosenblatt General Partially Adopted. Suturing - Adopted, 400.C.1; Starting an IV - Adopted, 400.C.2; National Standards - Partially Adopted, Midwives are required to meet NARM requirements and be certified by NARM and within the scope of practice .

Hello, I am a Certified Professional Midwife currently licensed in South Carolina. I moved recently from Texas, where I was also a Licensed Midwife. I would like to propose that in the interest of providing quality care which meets the basic standard of care for maternity and newborn services for low risk patients the South Carolina midwifery laws be amended to include the following: After training and c ertification standard for other health professions (EMT, for example), a midwife should be allowed to place an IV line and give the patient fluids in labor as needed and to give IV prophylaxis for Group B Streptococcus. In keeping with the standard of care recommended by the CDC and ACOG for the treatment of GBS positive patients in the prevention of Early -Onset Group B Streptococcal Disease, the medications necessary for IV GBS prophylaxis should be added to the medications the midwife is allowed to consistent with NARM standards, the midwife should be allowed to suture first and second degree lacerations of the vagina and perineum. In keeping with national and international standard of care for the prevention of Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding (VKDB), the midwife should be allow ed to administer intramuscular (IM) vitamin K injections for the newborn after training in intramuscular injections. (https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages -stages/prenatal/delivery -beyond/Pages/Where -We- Stand -Administration -of-Vitamin -K.aspx) I look forward to serving the women of South Carolina and hope you will consider these revisions to your regulations so that I can provide quality care at the national standard level. 50 NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 6. Carla Billings General Partially Adopted. Suturing - Adopted, 400.C.1; Starting an IV - Adopted, 400.C.2; IV Fluids - Adopted, 1200.B.8. Catheters - Not Adopted, it is not within the scope of practice due to the fact that it is a medical procedure with risk for infection. VBAC - Not Adopted, due to prior memo published December 15, 2010 titled \"Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC) at South Carolina Licensed Birthing Centers\". To who it may concern: I'm a mother of five, three of which were delivered by a licensed midwife. I help women through the birthing process as their doula. I see the need for midwives and think they need to remain autonomous practitioners, able to use our entire skill set and training which includes but it not limited to sutures, IV fluids, a nd intermittent catheters. Being able to attend women who are having vaginal births after cesarean if they fall into other criteria showing they are healthy and low risk. I'm hoping there will be more well trained and advanced midwives available to my four daughters. Thank you NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 7. Sheila Dell General Partially Adopted. PALM's recommendations were considered in the development of the regulation. PALM and MAC are the organizations that represent the LM community and they should be Center Stage in the recommended changes not OBGYNs or even MFM. We value our license it is our lively hood. We are educated/trained professionals. I have reviewed the proposed changes by PALM and agree. Our outcomes are way better than hospitals. View the real stats and you will see. We transfer appropriately. Please value our input. Thank you. NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 8. Heidi Johnson General Partially Adopted. The comment regarding the process by which DHEC revises the regulation is not a comment regarding revision of the regulation text but rather the process. This regulation does not require the oversight by a physician. The third comment is outside the scope of this regulation. Please allow the Midwifery Advisory Counsel (MAC) to actively participate in regulation revisions. In order to maintain community birth options and safety in South Carolina, it's important that: 1) DHEC recognize the MAC authority and expertise as, \"for the purpose of reviewing and advising the Department regarding matters pertaining to the training, practices, and regulation of midwives in South Carolina.\" 2) Midwives retain their autonomy to practice independently without direct supervision by other professions, such as physicians. 3) That hospital regulations give equal access to midwife patients for streamlined care when higher resources become necessary. 51 NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 9. Lisa Byrd General Partially Adopted. Suturing - Adopted, 400.C.1; Starting an IV - Adopted, 400.C.2; IV Fluids - Adopted, 1200.B.8. Medication for GBS - Adopted, 400.C.2, 1200.B.7. National Standards - Partially Adopted, Midwives are required to meet NARM requirements and be certified by NARM and within the scope of practice. PALM's recom mendations - Partially Adopted, PALM's recommendations were considered in the development of the regulation. As a member of the SC Licensed Midwife community since 2004 and a member of The Midwifery Advisory Counsel (MAC), I would like to go on record saying that I fully support the changes to regulation 61- 24 as proposed by the Palmetto Association of Licensed Midwives (PALM). Historically, South Carolina has been a front runner in the regulation of community level Midwives and as such, should improve regulation 61- 24 to come in line with the national standards as outlined by NARM, MANA and NACPM, the professional organizations for certified professional midwives throughout the nation. Large issues that I believe warrant careful consideration and revision are the topics of 1) suturing minor lacerations in the home and 2) the ability to follow the national standard of care in rare cases that need IV Fluids for Blood volume expansion or IV Antibiotics for GBS prophylaxis, in collaboration with our medical consultant. Licensed Midwives should be able to provide the standard of care that is expected by the medical community and by our patients. I ask that DHEC align itself with National standards for the purpose of patient safety and reduction of risk . NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 10. Emily Graham General Not Adopted. The regulations were amended as required by statu te for five year reviews . The regulations are sufficient as they are. No changes are required to 61 -24 However, I propose amending the memo regarding LMs attending VBACs (vaginal births after cesarean) at home or in birth centers. The literature referenced in the memo is outdated and many other states allow for at least some women planning VBACs to use the midwifery m odel of care to plan their out -of-hospital births with good outcomes. Refusing to alter this memo results in many women with a previous cesarean (even those with a history of uncomplicated vaginally births) to have their birth options drastically limited t o hospital birth or unattended homebirth. NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 11. Alexandra Wagner General Partially Adopted. PALM's recommendations were considered in the development of the regulation. I am in full support of the recommended changes that my professional organization, Palmetto Association of Licensed Midwives (PALM) has prepared and submitted. 52 NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 12. Kristyn Leonard General Partially Adopted. Informed Consent - Partially Adopted, Informed Consent has been added, Section 1000. The risk status is defined in 101.V and in the Scope of Practice, in Section 400, and also in Sections 900, 1100, and 1300. I would like to see regulations that respect the autonomy of the patient and informed consent of both the expecting family and the midwife. Midwives should not be forced to take on clients they deem too risky for their own comfort, but families have the right to choose their birth setting and the risks they are comfortable taking, recognizing that all births carry risks. There may be a more experienced midwife that is comfortable with taking care of a family that a less experienced midwife may not be. That doesn't mean the family should be forced out of all midwifery care. Risk stat us is something that should be taken into consideration by both the family and the midwife they are considering hiring. There are already regulations in place that require a second opinion, by another medical provider, on risk status. If all parties are in agreement and comfortable with the risks being taken, regulations alone should not prohibit midwifery services or out of hospital birth. This is something that would be easily accomplished if DHEC would listen to the MAC. No regulations should be put into place without input from those impacted by the regulations. In this case I mean practicing midwives and childbearing consumers. All proposed regulations should first be presented to the MAC for approval before final implementation. 53 NAME SECTION DEPARTM ENT RESPONSE 13.

To whom it may concern, I am a student -midwife.

CPM's are trained and proficient in many skills but according to the current regulations are not able to perform. Some examples of the updat es that need to be made - S.

Out of state physicians - Adopted, 1300.A To Whom it May Concern: As a midwife these are the things right away that I see that need to be updated and changed. I have also attached PALM's recommendations as I am in agreement with these changes as well and they have spent an enormous amoun t of time putting this together. 1. Midwives should be allowed to administer medications without having to consult a doctor for control of postpartum hemorrhage. We lose precious time if we have to consult over a mom who is in need of medication that has already been prescribed to them by a physician. 2. Midwives should be allowed to administer an IV to moms in labor if they need it or in case of an emergency. 3. Midwives should be able to suture 1st and 2nd degree tears if needed postpartum, potenti ally saving them a trip to the hospital. 4. Midwives should be able to administer a Vitamin K shot if a mom requests it. 5. Midwives should be able to consult healthcare providers (not just a doctor) in our state as well as neighboring states as many of us live right near the border and may want or need to use services in other neighboring states. 55 NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 15.

To whom it may concern, I am a home birth mother and a stakeholder in midwifery care. I completely trust my midwife's judgement. In my previous experience she was extremely knowledgeable, professional, thorough and never careless while supporting me and my decisions. I always felt confident that she had my and my child's safety at the forefront of our care. The care I received exceeded my expectations. However, there are instances where she was not able to offer me the best care due to DHEC regulations. For example, I was not able to receive suturing from my midwife post delivery which was a complete inconvenience and stress on me and my family. In the time that I should have enjoyed and bonded with my baby, I was consumed with making arrangements to transfer for a procedure that could have easily been done in the comfort of my home as I know my midwife has been thoroughly trained to do this procedure. As many can imagine, transferring in the delicate condition of needing sutures is uncomfortable and unnecessary.

All comments received were considered and addressed as being adopted, not adopted, or partially adopted . To Whom it May Concern: I am writing as a Georgia Nurse Midwife to support my fellow Licensed Midwives in South Carolina. I'm sure all midwives and legislatures are vested in providing all mothers with the best care possible. It is no ones intention to delay valuable car e to women birthing in the State of South Carolina yet when you place provisions in the law that prevent or delay basic care that is appropriate for the home setting this is what one happens. Regardless of weather one agrees with a woman's choices to birth her baby in the home or not she deserves the best care that can be safely rendered in the home such as: D. first and second degree repairs can be safely done in the home with lidocaine. B. If a mom requires an IV this task should not be delayed until par amedics arrive or the woman reaches the hospital valuable time is wasted for a task that can be safely initiated in the home and mom could be stabilizing while awaiting transport or being transported. C. We are in a pandemic midwives should have access to tele -visits the use of technology is imperative to all healthcare workers. D. Please allow your changes to regulation 61- 24 to reflect the voices of women choosing home birth in South Carolina. When South Carolina makes it hard for their midwives these wom en travel next door to Georgia seeking care this should not be the case let all listen. NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 63. Cynthia Glenn, Vice President, Palmetto Association of Licensed Midwives; Committees Chair, SC Chapter National Association of Certified Professional Midwives; Owner, Carolina Birth Center General Not Adopted. This issue is beyond the scope of this regulation. Coordination with other DHEC regulations Midwives and birth centers need to be added into the standard perinatal levels of care for transfer purposes in Reg. 61- 16: Listing all other maternity providers who may potentially need a level of care transfer but omitting midwives and birth centers is discriminatory. Lives will be saved by perinatal levels of care access, but without mandatory inclusion by regulation, midwife patients are susceptible to delays in care. This is an unacceptable safety oversight. Assess to perinatal level of integration of midwives is associated with significantly higher r ates of physiologic birth, less obstetric interventions, and fewer adverse neonatal outcomes provided that the full exercise of scope of practice, autonomy, self-regulation, and collaboration across disciplines is maintained. 103 NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RES PONSE 64.

Suturing - Adopted, 400.C.1; Starting an IV - Adopted, 400.C.2; Informed Consent has been added, Section 1000; National Standards - Partially Adopted, Midwives are required to meet NARM requirements and be certified by NARM and practice within the scope o f practice ; Televisits - Adopted, Nothing in this regulation prevents televisits. To whom it may concern, My name is Laura Smith and I live in North Myrtle Beach. I have successfully used a SC licensed midwife for all three of my children's births: 2004, 2009 & 2015. They were all born in excellent health, thanks to the prenatal care and attention of our Midwife and they are still very healthy and thriving. Our midwife is absolutely fantastic. She's knowledgeable, experienced, personable and I trust my midwife's judgement completely with my life and the life of my children. South Carolina Licensed Midwives need to be able to practice to a level that matches national standards for CPMs. South Carolina needs and deserves this level of service from our s tate's midwives. My care should be decided based on informed consent and refusal and discussions between myself and my Midwife, and my other healthcare professionals, without over -supervision of my Midwife. My Midwife should have all the tools at her dispo sal needed to keep her clients safe and well cared for, as much as the CPMs are allowed to do. Some examples of the updates that need to be made - My Midwife should be allowed to suture, potentially saving me an unnecessary trip to the hospital. I tore with all three of my home births and my midwife was not allowed to suture me, a fairly simple procedure. This is ridiculous. After going through full labor and delivery at home, in order to complete the suture, I have to go to the hospital? And risk being exposed to germs that could affect me or my newborn child? Why? It's silly. My Midwife should be allowed to start an IV in an emergency. Another simple way midwives can aid in the health and well being of her clients. If CPMs can do it, EMTs can do it, Midwives can do it too. Myself and my Midwife and her consulting practitioner should have the ability to utilize tele -visits that are being perfected during the current pandemic. This is crucial not only for the health and wellness of the many pregnant women in South Carolina but also for the hospitals, so as not to overwhelm them with more patients, unnecessarily. Please listen to our state midwives concerning the updates that need to be made to Regulation 61- 24. I do not understand all the nuances of midwifery practice, and neither can you. But there are many wise midwives in South Carolina who do. Refer to their judgement, please. They know what they're doing and they are an incredible asset to the families of South Carolina. Expand their treatment choices, don't limit them. Thank you for your time. 110 NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 71. Reagan Blackburn General Partially Adopted.

To Whom It May Concern: My name is Oba Mubarak I trust my midwife's judgement far more than any other conventional health provider. She provides an unbelievable amount of support for my wife. Having a traditional birth in a hospital setting with unnecessary interventions and medications is not the way women were created to give birth; nor is it healthy for women. Natures processes should NOT be tamper ed with in any way as they are already perfectly designed. South Carolina Licensed Midwives need to be able to practice to a level that matches national standards for CPMs, without question. These Midwives are certified nurses. It is disrespectful and unjust to not to allow them to practice what they were educated and trained to do. My care should be decided based on informed consent and refusal and discussions between myself and my Midwife, and my other healthcare professionals, without over -supervision of my Midwife.

I am a Collette Harper. I trust my midwife's judgement more so than any other healthcare provider. With that said, midwives are the greatest personal support during this time of uncertainly and provide a sense of relief to anyone with doubt. Midwives allow us women to do what women's body's were created to do. To give birth naturally with no unnecessary invention and medications. With such a life changing experience, women should all get to experience what I've experienced almost two times in my life. Giving birth and allowing my body to do what it KNOWS how to do. Midwives know the comfort, support and the best care for their patients with their well educated research and faith in what our body's a capable of doing. For women who decide to go the healthier way, and give birth in a natural setting, midwives are the best choice possible. With that said, South Carolina Licensed Midwives need to be able to practice to a le vel that matches national standards for CPMs. There should be no unnecessary complications for Midwives to care for their patients who GREATLY trust their care and knowledge. No women should be forced to give birth in a horrible hospital setting, unless they decided to do so. My care should be decided based on informed consent and refusal and discussions between myself and my Midwife, and my other healthcare professionals, without over -supervision of my Midwife. Some examples of the updates that need to be made- My Midwife should be allowed to suture, potentially saving me an unnecessary trip to the hospital.

Good afternoon, THIS IS DUE BY 5 PM TOMORROW. IT WILL TAKE LESS THAN 10 min. Please feel free to call me 24/7 today and tomorrow with any questions about this. To whom it may concern, I am a SC resident. I have had a SC midwife as my primary care provider for the birth of all 3 of my children. I fully intend to use a midwife if I am pregnant again in the future I fully trust my midwife's judgement. My midwife takes time t o inform me of every choice throughout my pregnancy. She goes through each possible medication we might need, it's uses and side effects. She takes the time to know mine and my husband's wishes regarding our baby's birth. I know if anything is wrong she wi ll quickly and safely transfer me to the hospital. I know she fully understands her capabilities and her limits. South Carolina Licensed Midwives need to be able to practice to a level that matches national standards for CPMs. My care should be decided based on informed consent and refusal and discussions between myself and my Midwife, and my other healthcare professionals, without over -supervision of my Midwife. Some examples of the updates that need to be made - My Midwife should be allowed to suture, potentially saving me an unnecessary trip to the hospital. Suturing is a necessary procedure, but should not require hospital oversight. It would be ridiculous to wait in the ER or burden the system for such a tiny need. My Midwife should be allowed to st art an IV in an emergency. This is necessary and not optional. Myself and my Midwife and her consulting practitioner should have the ability to utilize tele -visits that are being perfected during the current pandemic.

Jacqueline Sequoia, MD MPH General Partially Adopted. Suturing - Adopted, 400.C.1; Starting an IV - Adopted, 400.C.2; IV Fluids - Adopted, 1200.B.8. National Standards - Partially Adopted, Midwives are required to meet NARM requirements and be certified by NARM and practice within the scope of practice. Initial Licensure - Partially Adopted, 102.E To whom it may concern: I am a board certified family physician living in Oconee County, SC. I have been practicing in this state since completing residency in 2013. Additionally, I have masters level training in public health in epidemiology so I unders tand the outcome data around birth, infection control, and facility safety. Most importantly, I have birthed three of my four children here in SC, at home with midwives. As a mother and physician, I have chosen to trust my midwife's judgement in birth. F or normal low risk birth, home is an equivalent to the hospital in terms of safety if certain criteria are met. It is a superior option for comfort and recovery of the mother and family. In the current pandemic, it is the SAFER place for the healthy low r isk mother and baby to avoid infection. Data from cruise ships and hospitals in Northern Italy are showing us the hospitals are not safe for healthy individuals right now. This airborne virus is infecting people that aren't even working with covid- 19 pati ents through the ventilation system since it is airborne. In Georgia, a young healthy mammogram tech has died without any known contact or exposure to covid patients. Many facilities lack proper PPE and proper cleaning of facilities is practically impossib le with airborne transmission. Now more than ever it is critical that healthy moms and babies be able to stay at home if they possibly can. The demand for homebirth is rising in this crisis. This pandemic has called attention to the need for remote provi sion of care. My midwife and her consulting physician should have the ability to utilize tele -visits with me to provide optimum supervision of my pregnancy and post -partum recovery. I call on you to ensure that South Carolina Licensed Midwives can meet th e needs of women and babies by setting their practice standards to a level that matches national standards for Certified Professional Midwives. This should include suturing minor grade I and II perineal lacerations and starting intravenous fluids in an eme rgency. Any new midwives licensed in the state should be held to national CPM standards for training and practice. Having attended home births as the provider and having birthed at home three times myself, I am uniquely aware of the needs of birthing wom en and their midwives. 125 I trust my midwife's judgment and I believe midwifery care is an important component of maternity care. I hope that SC will continue to ensure safe well trained midwives are available to meet the needs of our birthing mothers. Thank you for your time. 126 NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 86.

Both are so familiar with the nat ural birthing process that they know exactly what stage of labor the mother is in, what signs cause concern and what to do to help move things along. One of the concerns was if I needed a small suture, which I didn't, they would not be able to do it. We ha d to discuss these things ahead of time to be aware of the risks and what we would do should the need arise. South Carolina Licensed Midwives need to be able to practice to a level that matches national standards for CPMs. My care should be decided based on informed consent and refusal and discussions between myself and my Midwife, and my other healthcare professionals, without over -supervision of my Midwife. Some examples of the updates that need to be made - My Midwife should be allowed to suture, potentially saving me an unnecessary trip to the hospital. My Midwife should be allowed to start an IV in an emergency. Myself and my Midwife and her consulting practitioner should have the ability to utilize tele -visits that are being perfected during the cu rrent pandemic. Please listen to our state midwives concerning the updates that need to be made to Regulation 61- 24. I do not understand all the nuances of midwifery practice, and neither can you. But there are many wise midwives in South Carolina who do. Refer to their judgement, please. Thank you for your time. 129 NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 89.

Dear Ladies and Gents, I am a young woman and greatly concerned about having the freedom to exercise my right to choose who will provide me with healthcare. I have had the privilege of knowing several midwives. Several of my family and friends have used them as them as their pri mary caregiver during pregnancy.

PALM's recommendations - Partially Adopted, Palm's recommendations were considered in the development of the regulation. Other credentialing bodies - Adopted, 104.E.1 Dear Sir / Madam, In this season of Coronavirus Pandemic, it is ever more apparent that midwives are a needed and necessary part of healthcare in SC and across our nation. It is unfortunate that childbirth has, by custom, become primarily a hospital based event. In fact, healthy young women who are having a normal, low risk pregnancy should stay in the comfort and safety of their own homes, particularly now when healthy people are being placed in places of great COVID -19 danger. Childbirth has become a curious situat ion in which healthy people are expected to enter a facility for the sick and injured in order to experience a normal life event. Our government should encourage the use of midwives and facilitate in every way possible their access, their ability to work with and across other health facilities and providers and to facilitate all midwifery skills and abilities to and for the women they serve. DHEC should ensure that other healthcare entities provide and enable midwifery care and work towards eliminating stu mbling blocks to their care. This access isn't provided by placing more restrictions on midwifery care or supervision but enacting legislation that require other healthcare providers and facilities do their jobs in providing care to everyone that needs the m. That is a public sacred trust that should be provided. I support the Palmetto Association of Licensed Midwives proposals that have been reviewed by the majority of actively practicing midwives in our state. I urge DHEC to use this document in entirety as the midwives themselves are the ONLY providers in this state who are the experts in low risk birth in the out of hospital setting. In addition to that document, I encourage DHEC to keep the ability of other credentialing bodies to be recognized for SC licensure. I am aware of other faith based organizations with national and international connections that have been working to establish a credentialing process with even more requirements than current CPM requirements. This is especially important as clos ely aligned organizations within the CPM world have become politically partisan and forcefully promoting policies and positions that many CPMs find objectionable and at odds with their faith, thereby violating their rights to free exercise and expression of their faith. It is, also, important that the Midwifery Advisory Council is maintained as the appropriate advisory council to DHEC as it is the source with proper representation of midwives who can advise DHEC on current midwifery standards and how to give physically and emotionally safe care to women and babies. Thank you for your attention to these recommendations. 135 NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 95. Marylee Ewell General Partially Adopted.

To whom it may concern, I am a South Carolina mother whom believes in birthing naturally, in a comfortable and safe environment for the mother and child. I have had two homebirths and could not have felt comfortable without my knowledgeable Midwife by my side the entire time. I could list all the reasons why I chose a homebirth but the list would be overwhelming. It was a choice I made and I have only positive memories an d experiences from the whole process. It was a beautiful time, that every mother should experience if they CHOOSE. Birthing how a woman chooses is very important for the mother and child. It needs to be a choice and option for birthing mothers. Many pregna nt women do not even realize that birthing at home is an option in many pregnancies. Hospitals are filled with sicknesses, and people on their deathbed. Hospitals are filled with strangers and many, many people. The birthing process is something that is s pecial and should be limited to whom the mother wants present during that special time. It is every woman's right to birth how they choose! The last month with the Coronavirus has been a scary time for everyone, especially pregnant mothers who plan to bir th in the hospital. They may want their spouse or other family members present. At this time, it does not seem like that will be an option, for obvious reasons. It does concern me that mothers are being sent to a hospital to birth where Coronavirus cases are more present, and growing day by day. Why would we send a pregnant mother and her newborn baby into a petri dish with Coronavirus? It baffles me and is frustrating. To birth at home is the most safe and natural way to birth, but more importantly during a outbreak. History repeats itself. At some point in time, there could possibly be a worse outbreak than the Coronavirus. If birthing at home became a more known option to mothers, then this would be one hurdle already jumped if another outbreak occurred. It would be one less situation that the government would have to come up with a remedy. I trust my midwife's judgement, along with hundreds and thousands of others whom trust her as well. The birthing process is a completely natural process that has been occurring for many, many years before hospitals and doctors. Midwives are part of our history! They have always been trusted since women began birthing naturally many years ago. Why would we not trust their judgement now? I can not explain enough why Midw ives are so important to our families! When hospitals and doctors speak, we listen to their concerns, give them our support and the same needs to be done for our Midwives. Our Midwives need our support, lets support them to the fullest! Now is the time! South Carolina Licensed Midwives need to be able to practice to a level that matches national standards for CPMs. My care should be decided based on informed consent and refusal and discussions between myself and my Midwife, and my other healthcare profess ionals, without over -supervision of my Midwife. 136 Some examples of the updates that need to be made - My Midwife should be allowed to suture, potentially saving me an unnecessary trip to the hospital.

To whom it may concern, I am a NC resident that had two healthy sons born in SC under the professional and exceptional care of my SC licensed midwife, Lori H. Gibson. My sons are now almost 7 and 2 years old. When I was a first time pregnant mama, hospitals in my areas were not \"baby friendly\" and did not provide the care that I knew would be best for me and my son on the way. While pregnant moms research so much and choose the best products for their baby on the way, I was also researching birth hormones, water births, kangaroo care, delayed cord clamping etc. This made me seek out my SC midwife and not be limited to hospital protocols that at the time denied me of options I was researching. I am glad to see that Novant hospital, in the past 7 years is looking at data and seeking to become a \"baby friendly\" hospital more each year. My midwife had been a wealth of knowledge and support who oversaw my prenatal, labor/birth and postpartum care in the uttermost professional matter and my husband and I are thankful for the option that SC provided for us that we have been stripped away from in NC where we currently reside. It is wrong on so many levels and takes away my rights as a woman to choose to birth in a way that is best for me and insures the best support and care that results in less complications. Please do not limit the rights of my midwife so that I and future woman after me can have the beautiful experien ces of birth under the personalized and exceptional care that midwives in your state provide. I completely trust my midwife's judgement to provide me with the medical care that is needed within her scope during every part of the way. I trust her to know a nd make the decision when medical care and intervention within a hospital is required. As a mama who had low risks pregnancies, I know I made the best decision for my family to birth under the care of a midwife outside of the hospital. Although, I complet ely respect and am thankful for doctors and nurses and the care they provide...this option is not best for everyone. Birthing children is not an emergency that needs to happen within hospital walls. It is a natural occurrence that often plays out better wi th less complications if the mama feels completely relaxed and safe in the care one ONE main provider that had overseen every single tiny step of her pregnancy, knows her like a friend and supports her in a way that hospitals, due to their large base of pa tients and protocols, just can not. I fully credit the fact that I did not have any PPSD like so many of my friends to the birth experience I was able to have under my midwife care compared to some of their birth experiences within hospital walls of my f riends. South Carolina Licensed Midwives need to be able to practice to a level that matches national standards for CPMs. My midwife is my healthcare provider of choice for my prenatal, delivery and postpartum care and should have full rights to practice and provide the full medical care that they are capable of. Please look at statistics and listen to hundreds of women that were under the professional care of SC Licensed Midwives. My care should be decided based on informed consent and refusal and disc ussions between myself and my Midwife, and my other healthcare professionals, without over -supervision of my Midwife. There is 139 no size fits all when it comes to medical care and when I choose to place myself under the care of a midwife, I trust her with al l my medical needs for that pregnancy and only she, who has walked with me every step of the journey, unlike any doctor could, should have full authority to decide the best medical care that is needed for me. Some examples of the updates that need to be m ade- My Midwife should be allowed to suture, potentially saving me an unnecessary trip to the hospital. My Midwife should be allowed to start an IV in an emergency. If a need of an IV arises, why on earth would anyone limit my midwife of something that s he is capable of doing and I, as her patient would require. Myself and my Midwife and her consulting practitioner should have the ability to utilize tele -visits that are being perfected during the current pandemic.

To whom it may concern, I'm the mother of a Certified Professional Midwife (CPM) in South Carolina, a state in which I have long- time ancestral roots and close family ties. My great grandfather served as a respected lawyer and judge in Columbia, and my daughter and three of my grandchildren, two of whom are child- bearing age, call the state home. I've seen my daughter's love and concern for her patients, and their love for her. Her patients' best best possible care is always her upmost concern. It's clear from hearing her experiences over a couple a decades that South Carolina Licensed Midwives and their patients would be best served if CPMs could practice in South Ca rolina to a level that matches national CPM standards. Patients should be able to make choices for care based on informed consent and refusal and discussions between them, their midwife, and other healthcare professionals as needed, without over -supervisi on by the state. Some important updates that should be made through revision in the laws governing South Carolina CPMs include: - The right to suture, potentially saving patients unnecessary trips to the hospital; - The right to start an IV in an emergency ; and - The right to utilize tele -visits by the midwives and their consulting practitioners.

To whom it may concern, I am a parent in Berkeley County. My wife and I had a home birth in 2017, and I couldn't imagine being in the hands of anyone better. I trust my midwife's judgement, training and expertise, and I want her and other South Carolina Licensed Midwives to be able to practice to a level that matches national standards for CPMs. Our labor and deliver care should be decided based on informed consent and r efusal and discussions between my family and our midwife, and my other healthcare professionals, without over -supervision of our midwife. During my wife's labor and birth of our son, our midwife skillfully handled tough situations. I am glad we did not ha ve any complications that necessitated a visit to an emergency room, especially because I've heard of the potential for nightmare scenarios. In addition to giving midwives clear access to hospital admissions, midwives should be allowed to suture, they shou ld be allowed to start an IV, and they most certainly should be allowed to make prenatal visits over the phone -- especially during the on- going crisis. We have to get this right now. In the coming months, more and more women will turn to home births during this coronavirus pandemic. Here's a story about that from The Wall Street Journal: https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus -is-forcing- pregnant -women -to-make -tough- choices - 11585560601 Midwives are trained professionals who offer excellent care with low risk.

Thank you for your time. 147 NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 105. Isiah Glenn General Not Adopted. This is beyond the scope of this regulation. Hello, Earlier in the year, a petition was started regarding Licensed Midwives. The petition asked that DHEC create regulations that integrate Midwives into the Perinatal System of Care for streamlined access during emergencies. It is Imperative, that Licensed Midwives maintain their autonomy while still being given expedited access to higher levels of care when more resources become necessary. Over 4,600 of our consumers signed and believe it is necessary to make you aware of their desires. I've attached two files to this email. Please consider every signature and personalized statement as part of the public open comments for regulation 61 -24. The petition read: \"The South Carolina state legislature must protect pregnant women, mothers and newborn babies by passing the Equal Access to Hospital Doors Bill H -4966, officially called the Perinatal Integration Act of 2020. A similar bill in the senate is also pending. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control also must not pass retaliatory regulations to further restrict midwives. \"In 2014, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) wrot e a regulation that specifically omitted patients of midwives and specifically outborn babies (babies who are not born in a hospital) from being able to automatically transfer care to a higher resource facility in an emergency. The regulation painstakingly lists every perinatal care facility type in the state, including prison infirmaries, except for Licensed Midwives and birth centers. Therefore, in an emergency, midwife and birth center patients may be refused smooth transfers into higher resource facilit ies in an emergency, which could create life or death situations for mother and/or baby. Instead, these patients are sometimes referred to an emergency room and lose precious time while waiting for their turn and for the slower process of admittance to tak e place. \"It is unlikely this is a simple oversight because there is an easy fix. All DHEC must do is agree to add in \"licensed midwives and outborn babies\" to the language, and all of these mothers and babies would suddenly be protected as well. DHEC has refused. Two years ago, the Palmetto Association of Licensed Midwives and the Midwifery Advisory Committee (whose job it is to advise DHEC) approached DHEC and also wrote a statement in favor of the change. Instead, DHEC went to the OB task force, which a lso agreed with MAC, yet DHEC continued to do nothing to change this except to say it was looking for stakeholders and would then talk to the Hospital Association. Two years later, nothing has changed. \"DHEC could also offer a quick and temporary solution to the problem by providing a provider -wide exception, position statement or memo. However, DHEC is also unwilling to do this. As recently as January 2020, MAC asked DHEC to provide this temporary solution, but DHEC stated that they have no plans to make such a resolution, according to representatives who were present at that meeting. They stated that the Licensed Midwife regulation is now scheduled for revisions, but they have no current plans to revise regulations 61 -16, which is the regulation regarding perinatal levels of care. The midwifery groups have asked DHEC numerous times why they instated and maintained this omission, but no reason has ever been given. \"Therefore, in order to protect these mothers and babies who choose the safe and attentive ca re of licensed midwives in the state of South Carolina, the House of Representatives has introduced the Equal Access to Hospital Doors bill. As of March 1 2020, that bill had 15 co -sponsors already, and a mirrored 148 senate bill was pending. \"On February 26 2020, in what appears to be retaliation to the pending legislation, DHEC formally announced that it was opening midwife regulations. The midwives believe this is not to fix the omission because historically DHEC has done this specifically to further limit and restrict midwives' freedoms. The public comment period for the Notice of Drafting for this new Regulation 61- 24 runs through Monday, March 30. Public comments regarding this regulation can be submitted via email to healthregcomm@dhec.sc.gov or by compl eting an online public comment form. A stakeholder meeting for the DHEC regulations on Tuesday, March 17, 2020 at 10 a.m. in the DHEC Columbia Mills Building, conference room 2407. A conference line to join the meeting is at 800- 753-1965, access code 6671491. Even though they opened the regulations, DHEC would not tell the South Carolina midwives why they want to update them. In the past, DHEC has tried to put in supervisory language, meaning licensed midwives would have to have a supervising physician and agreements with the hospitals. \"Why do I care? I personally had an incredible home birth with a licensed midwife on Feb. 26, 2019 -- exactly one year to the day before DHEC decided to open midwife regulations for potentially more restrictions. It was the most amazing, beautiful, empowering and loving experience of my life, and I strongly believe that anyone should have access to this experience if they so desire and they meet the safety parameters to have a home birth or to work with a licensed midwife. My highly trained and experienced midwife ensured my baby and I were safe at all times. At one point in labor, she was concerned I may not be dilating appropriately due to scar tissue, so she kept careful watch on the situation. Fortunately, right after she discovered the potential problem, I quickly fully dilated and birthed a healthy baby girl just an hour and a half later. However, if my cervix continued to be \"stuck\" due to scar tissue, I would have had to transfer to the hospital. It would have been cruc ial for me to have a smooth transition to a higher resource facility and NOT be stuck waiting in an emergency room. My midwife did her job perfectly, but DHEC's prejudice against midwives, birth centers and their patients could have led to a life or death situation, had my body not cooperated that day. \"Please sign this petition to urge DHEC to drop any additional restrictive regulations, fix the omission of midwives in equal access to hospital transfers, and for state legislators to sponsor and sign this bill so that no matter what kind of maternal and perinatal care a woman chooses, ALL mothers and babies are protected, even in an emergency.\" Thank you for your time! 149 NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 106. Kristyn Leonard General Not Adopted. This is not a comment regarding revision of the regulation text but rather the process. I would just like to remind you that in 2015 there were proposed changes to the regulations that did not involve heeding recommendations from the MAC and there was a great amount of push back from consumers. I authored an online petition found here: https://www.change.org/p/keep- midwives -in-south- carolina which received over 4000 signatures. The comments made and individual signatures are in the attached pdfs. I urge you to not make the same mistake again. There is a MAC for a reason, listen to their suggestions and implement policies and regulations that will protect consumers and providers while still allowing for patient autonomy and informed consent. Text of the p etition: The South Carolina Board of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) is attempting to rewrite the current Licensed Midwife (LM) regulations with inclusions that are not evidence based nor in the best interest of the patient. These include but are not limited to: *Not allowing a LM to attend a birth after 41 weeks gestation. Gestation can vary greatly and putting such an early arbitrary date helps no one. *Not allowing a LM to attend a VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean). This one really makes me ang ry as a c-section mama. Midwives scope of practice includes the care of low risk pregnancies and attendance of low risk births. DHEC is essentially saying that THEY know better than ME or my DOCTOR if I am low risk or not. That is not their call to make. T hey don't know me or my history, a history of cesarean alone does not make me high risk. Informed consent is critical, but I have the right to choose what risks I am comfortable taking. *Not allowing a LM to administer antihemmorragics until AFTER a very h eavy blood loss. Again, this is DHEC saying they know better than the midwife in the situation what is best for the patient. This is simply not true. Here is what I can gather about the DHEC board using their own website: Allen Amsler, Chairman; CEO of a construction company Mark S. Lutz, Vice Chairman; administrator at an OBGYN office, holds an MBA in Organizational Development Ann B. Kirol, DDS, Secretary; Dentist R. Kenyon Wells; owns a medical supply company Charles M. Joye, II, P.E.; CEO of an enginee ring firm L. Clarence Batts, Jr; chemical engineer John O. Hutto, Sr, MD; cardiologist William Lee Hewitt, III; owns a real estate firm While I have no doubt these are good people who together can solve many issues, birth is not one of them. Not one of these board members are equipped with any sort of formal training on childbirth, especially not out of hospital birth. And on top of that they have NO RIGHT to make medical decisions for me or anyone else for that matter. Period. DHEC continues to put polit ics above people and it has got to stop. It is those who bear children who are the consumers of birth services; whether they be at a hospital, at a birth center, or in our own homes is OUR decision to make. No one else's. The women, and men, who actually w ork with home birth and birth 150 center patients are the ones who know the nuances of out of hospital birth best. We, the undersigned, assert that the Midwifery Advisory Council are the ones who should be writing the regulations. NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 107.

Recommended change: \"A person who is licensed to practice medicine in his/her state. \" Rationale: Many midwives live near the state borders and may have consulting relationships with physicians whose primary practice site is in another state. Patients may live close to the state borde r or move from another state where they had received prenatal care prior to coming to South Carolina for prenatal care and birth and have primary physicians in their home state. Sometimes the closest physician or hospital to a mother is in a neighboring s tate. Some examples: clients living in or near Charlotte, NC or Augusta, GA. 151 NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 110. Cynthia Glenn, Vice President, Palmetto Association of Licensed Midwives; Committees Chair, SC Chapter National Association of Certified Professional Midwives; Owner, Carolina Birth Center A.2.q Adopted. 1300.A \"Physician. A person who is licensed to practice medicine in the State of South Carolina.\" Families move or travel to SC to birth during pregnancy and therefore should not be limited to seeing a SC licensed physician. Patient autonomy and insurance primary care physician status is being denied by requiring a mother to see only SC licensed providers. DHEC does not regulate physicians so there is no rationale for l imiting a patient's care to SC providers. Even state Medicaid plans cover providers in other states depending upon their proximity to the state border. This requirement is burdensome for the families and limits access to quality care.

This needs to state the purpose of the visit and give alternatives. If the purpose is to evaluate the baby but the baby is taken to a pediatrician instead, than the visit would be unnecessary. If the mother or baby are transferred to a higher level facility and are under the care of another provider, than the visit becomes unnecessary. We are guest in these homes and cannot demand access. While most families welcome assistance from their midwife, some families travel or live in another state where the midwife canno t logically follow them to their home. Some families have cultural or religious preferences for the care of their newborn. Wording should state midwife must \"offer\" or \"show evidence of wiliness to provide,\" or \"arrangements for postpartum follow -up care for mother and neonate.\" NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 142. Cynthia Glenn, Vice President, Palmetto Association of Licensed Midwives; Committees Chair, SC Chapter National Association of Certified Professional Midwives; Owner, Carolina Birth Center I.3 Partially adopted. 701.B.1.p, 904.B Metabolic Screening. All requirements for metabolic screening shall be made clear to parents. The midwife shall notify the county health department in the county where the infant resides within three days of delivery in order for a specimen to be obtained. This is outdated. Again this should be vague because recommendations and requirements may change over time. Suggestion: Consider \"The midwife should help the family to make plans for any state metabolic screen requirements.\" NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 143. Cynthia Glenn, Vice President, Palmetto Association of Licensed Midwives; Committees Chair, SC Chapter National Association of Certified Professional Midwives; Owner, Carolina Birth Center K.15 Adopted. 1300 Is anemic (Hematocrit under 32; Hemoglobin under 11.5); This is far from acceptable standard pregnancy values and has been forcing moms to take supplements that cause unnatural iron increases. The values are not necessary in regulation and should be omitted. 165 NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 144. Cynthia Glenn, Vice President, Palmetto Association of Licensed Midwives; Committees Chair, SC Chapter National Association of Certified Professional Midwives; Owner, Carolina Birth Center M.2.b, G.5 Adopted. 1200 M.2.b. Pitocin G.5. Rhogam Medications should not be listed by name. As new medications and data become available, listing medication names in regulations will limit the effectiveness of the regulations. Instead, the purpose of the medication should be listed without the name. NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 145. Cynthia Glenn, Vice President, Palmetto Association of Licensed Midwives; Committees Chair, SC Chapter National Association of Certified Professional Midwives; Owner, Carolina Birth Center O.1 Not Adopted. This is not within the scope of this regulation. (4) Blood group and Rh type; (5) Serological test for syphilis (including dates performed); Midwives need to be permitted to order these labs without the accompanying order of a physician. All state and hospital labs should be required to acknowledge a m idwife's order for those service that she is required to provide. That would also include cord blood samples for the newborn to determine the necessity of anti -D immune globulin. NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 146. Jami Morris, President, Palmetto Association of Licensed Midwives; Jennifer Kitchton CPM, LM P Not Adopted. This is not a comment regarding revision of the regulation text but rather the process. Department Responsibilities Recommendation: add a section \"3. Revision of Regulations\" which would outline the process for revising regulations. The regulated community should have a means to propose regulatory revisions to the Midwifery Advisory Council (MAC) in accordance with national standards of midw. MAC will review these proposals during their bi -annual meetings and advise DHEC of their recommendations. DHEC will then revise the regulations accordingly. Rationale: This is the fundamental mechanism for maintaining and improving regulations. This approach is commonly used b y accrediting bodies around the world. 166 NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 147. Cynthia Glenn, Vice President, Palmetto Association of Licensed Midwives; Committees Chair, SC Chapter National Association of Certified Professional Midwives; Owner, Carolina Birth Center P.1 Partially Adopted. 1800 \"DHEC shall appoint a Midwifery Advisory Council which shall meet at least annually for the purpose of reviewing and advising the Department regarding matters pertaining to the training, practices, and regulation of midwives in South Carolina....\" \"b. The Council shall establish a committee for peer review to consult with midwives in questions of ethics, competency and performance, and to serve as an appeal committee when disciplinary action has been taken. The committee may recommend denying, suspending, or revoking a license, or may recommend specific educational objectives, apprenticeship or other improvement measures as necessary.\" The Department is not allowing MAC to function efficie ntly. MAC is a highly qualified group of specialist in their field of Community Birth and DHEC should contact them first for advice instead of deferring to any other profession or the OB Task Force. MAC should be reviewing the regulations every five year s per 1 -23-120 and informing The Department of any deficiencies, not the other way around. I have repeatedly witnessed MAC members request that they be a part of the regulation drafting and have heard them be repeatedly denied by The Department. To date, MAC has not even been told exactly who is drafting the regulation revisions or the exact deficiencies that The Department has identified. In the past, we have seen regulation drafts that were created without the advice of MAC and those proposed regulatio n had dangerous safety issues. Without the full incorporation of MAC and the ethics subcommittee, it is becoming clear that Licensed Midwives need their own Board of Midwifery. I believe it would be to the benefit and safety of South Carolinians for DHEC t o cooperate with SC midwife organizations and move forward to establish this necessary endeavor. 167 ATTACHMENT D SUMMARY OF ADVISORY COUNCIL COMMENTS AND DEPARTMENT RESPONSES R.61- 24, Licensed Midwives Comments received by the Midwifery Advisory Council on July 21, 2020 SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 101: Definitions B. Authorized Healthcare Provider: add Licensed Midwives as extension of medical providers Not Adopted. These are individuals licensed by LLR and are authorized by statute to provide treatment and services that midwives are not authorized to provide. Se ction 1200 of this regulation authorizes Midwives to administer certain prescription medications to Clients. Additional Comment: Licensed Midwives must be added here for the scenarios when they will be administering prescription medications to Clients that were prescribed by the medical providers. See current definition of FF. and suggested change below. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 101: Definitions H: Consultation: change this to \"Meeting\" Partially Adopted. Changed to \"Compliance Meeting\" for clarity. Additional Comment: The definition of Consultation for healthcare professionals is in reference to having a conversation about a Client with another professional for medical advice. By using consultation in reference to having a meeting with DHEC can be confusing, especially since 101.V. is entitiled \"Medical Consultation\" SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 101: Definitions I: Amended License: add space between name, address Adopted. Additional Comment: 168 SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 101: Definitions O: Home Birth: a birth planned out of hospital in the location of a residence Not Adopted. The Birthing Center Licensure Act defines \"Birthing center\" as \"a facility or other place where human births are planned to occur. This does not include the usual residence of the mother or any facility which is licensed as a hospital.\" (S.C. 44- 89-30). Therefore, a planned delivery at a location other than the mother's usual residence falls within the statutory definition of a \"birthing center\" and would require a license as such. Additional Comment: There are situations when a pregnant person can neither give birth in their own homes nor have the option of using a birth center, in those situations they would be able to give birth in a residence in SC. Defining this as just the place of the resident of the Client severly limits their choice in place of birth and birth attendant which can have negative emotional and financial impacts. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 101: Definitions U. Low Risk pregnancy: Pregnancy in which there are no active complications and that there are no maternal or fetal factors that place the pregnancy at increased risk for complications. Partially Adopted. DHEC will use the definition from The Birthing Ce nter Act, S.C. 44- 89-30. Low risk \"means normal, uncomplicated prenatal course as determined by adequate prenatal care and prospects for a normal, uncomplicated birth as defined by reasonable and generally accepted criteria of maternal and fetal health.\" Additional Comment: \"Medical intervention\" should be removed as it could be interpreted as something as simple as antibiotics for a UTI, this does not place a pregnant person into a high risk category. Could be a dangerous open ended statement SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 101: Definitions EE. Physician. Adopted. Additional Comment: Consider using LLR's definition or \"licensed by the sc board of medical examiners to practice medicine in SC\" 169 SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 101: Definitions FF. Prescription Medication Not Adopted. Definition is from statute (Section 40- 43-30). The requested change would contradict statute. This regulation authorizes Midwives to administer certain Prescription Medications to Clients. Additional Comment: \"or restricted to use by physician or Authorized Healthcare provider only\" is concerning language. Are Licensed Midwives authorized? What if they write for medications for Licensed Midwives to administer? Restrictive language that could potentially be used against Licensed MIdwives at some point. Should be in definitions that Licensed Midwives are an authorized Healthcare provider as an extension of our consulting APRN or physician. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 101: Definitions LL. Transfer of Care. Change \"Higher medical authority\" to \"relinquishes care to another medical professional.\" Partially Adopted. Changed to Authorized Healthcare Provider or Emergency Medical Services Personnel. Additional Comment: Deminishes the professionalism, scope and skill of the licensed midwife. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 101: Definitions Add Line item for Telemed / Telehealth: Virtual consultations and visits with Authorized Healthcare Provider Not Adopted. We do not regulate whether or not a physician/authorized healthcare professional is allowed to use telehealth. Additional Comment: Telemed / telehealth consultations are now federally acceptible forms for means of communication and assessment by Authrorized Healthcare providers. These visits are reimbersilble by Medicaid and can help ease the burden both financially, as they cost less than in- person appointments, and scheduling as they lend themsleves to be more accesible for both the Client and the Authorized Healthcare provider. A client can follow through with this appointment without need of transportation or in the case of illness, loss of childcare etc. as currently demonstrated during the COVID 19 pandemic. 170 SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 101: Definitions Add line item for VBAC: Vaginal Birth After Cesaerean Not Adopted. We are consistent with LLR's Boards of Nursing Advisory Opinion #68. Additional Comment: There are only 6 other states that prohibit VBAC at home. The other 28 states that regulate midwives allow for and have successfully high rates of home vaginal birth after cesaerean. Pregnant people with prior low transverse incision should be allowed tria l of labor in the setting that they feel most comfortable with the professional birth team that they choose. Clients who are given these options are more likely to have a vaginal birth with decreased risk of maternal and neonatal morbidity. For some of the se people, home is the safest and best option for them. If it is prohibited by regulation then there will continue to be famlies who attempt to have a VBAC at home unattended or with improperly trained support. VBAC should be considered with prior low transverse incision, no prior classical incision and documented physician consultation explaining risks and informed consent. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 102 Licensure Requirements Correct typo to read \"...the expiration of license by...\" Adopted. Additional Comment: SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 102 Licensure Requirements C.3. Strike twenty -four (24) and replace with \"A License for a Midwife shall be effective for a thirty -six (36) month period following the date of issue.\" Adopted. Additional Comment: Renewal should be three (3) year period to coincide with NARM to ease burden on DHEC and on licensed midwives SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 102 Licensure Requirements F. Licenseing Fees: $225 every three years Adopted. Additional Comment: To coincide with three (3) year renewal SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 102 Licensure Requirements H. License Renewal. The Midwife shall renew his or her License every thirty -six (36) months... Adopted. Additional Comment: Renewal should be three (3) year period to coincide with NARM to ease burden on DHEC and on licensed midwives SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 201 General Add \"Licensed\" before the second Midwife and Midwife Apprentice. Adopted. Additional Comment: It reads a bit confusing as it is currently written 171 SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 203 Consultations Change \"consultations\" to \"Meetings\" as per the suggestion in the definitions above Partially Adopted. Changed to \"Compliance Meeting\" for clarity. Additional Comment: Using \"consultations\" for meetings with DHEC can lend itself to being confusing. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 302 Violations of Classifications Is there statutory basis to collect fines? S.C. 44 -1-140 Additional Comment: SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 400 Scope of Practice C.3. Strike \"first -degree and second -degree\" Adopted. Additional Comment: episiotomies are not classified as first degree and second degree, just episiotomy SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 400 Scope of Practice D.2. Provision of care for Client with a previous classical cesarean section Not Adopted. We are consistent with LLR's Boards of Nursing Advisory Opinion #68. Additional Comment: Pregnant people must be given the choice and autonomy to have trial of labor after cesarean section with the provider of choice and in the place that they feel safest. A client with a previous c -section with a low transverse incision may be assessed prenatally and considered appropriate for out of hospital birth, with informed consent, with a Licensed Midwife. See definitions above. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 500 Continuing Education B. 1.c. strike \"first -degree and second -degree\" Adopted. Additional Comment: episiotomies are not classified as first degree and second degree, just episiotomy SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 601 Incident A. Add \"when transport ends in maternal or neonatal death.\" Not Adopted. This is consistent with other Departmental regulations regarding transfer of clients, patients, and residents out of a licensed program. Additional Comment: Coordinated transfers of care should be appropriately reported on quarterly reports. This 48 hour incident report for transfers places undue reporting burden on Midwives for clients who have been appropriately cared for. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 603 Reporting Mortalities Strike section Not Adopted. It is a different department. Additional Comment: Redundant to section 601 B unless this is referring to a different department than in section 601 B 172 SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 701 Content B.1.a. Strike race Adopted. Additional Comment: Some clients decline to report race on intake and on birth certificates. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 701 Content B.1.a. Strike \"name and address of Physician to be contacted in the event of emergency\" Partially Adopted. This was edited for clarity. Additional Comment: This is consulting healthcare provider information, not generally recorded on a client's intake face sheet SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 701 Content B.1.e. add \"unless client refuses GDM testing (as listed in 900 d 1j if at high risk for...).\" Remove and create a new line item for syphilis testing Partially Adopted. Additional Comment: Clients at low risk for gestational diabetes often decline traditional testing in lieu of alternate nutritional agreements. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 701 Content B.1.k. Strike \"estimated amount\" Partially Adopted. Changed to \"Estimated amount (small, moderate, or large)...\" Additional Comment: no way to measure amniotic fluid SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 701 Content B 1.l. Where is the line item? Adopted. Additional Comment: SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 701 Content B.1.m. Strike the word \"and\" Adopted. Additional Comment: SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 701 Content B.1.p. Should read \"breast -feeding\" resources Adopted. Additional Comment: SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 701 Content B.2.a. Strike race Adopted. Additional Comment: Some clients decline to report race on intake and on birth certificates SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 701 Content B.2.d. Change \"resuscitations\" to \"resuscitation\" Adopted. Additional Comment: 173 SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 800 What is section 800 \"reserved\" for? The Department is creating consistency among regulations to align sections among its regulations within Healthcare Quality. Other regulations use this section for Admissions. This regulation does not have an Admissions section. Additional Comment: SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 901 Prenatal Care Create a separate section for items: C.2, C.9, C.10 and C.11 Adopted. Additional Comment: No need to educate on or recommend these items at each prenatal visit as it creates redundancy. Documentation of discussion of these items as needed should be sufficient. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 901 Prenatal Care C.4. Strike line item Adopted. Additional Comment: Not evidence based to dip urine at each appointment, only as needed. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 901 Prenatal Care C.8. Change \"yones\" to \"tones\" Adopted. Additional Comment: SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 901 Prenatal Care D.1. Change \"twelve (12) weeks\" to \"eight (8) weeks\" Adopted. Additional Comment: Some clients begin as early as 8 weeks and need to or prefer to have blood work done at that time. This helps us potentially detect issues (such as low hemoglobin) as soon as 8 weeks and simply broadens our window for treatment of issue. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 901 Prenatal Care D.1.h. add \"Optional, with informed consent from the Client\" Adopted. Additional Comment: this test should be optional SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 901 Prenatal Care D.2. Definition: change to \"thirty -five (35) weeks zero (0) days to thirty- seven (37) weeks zero (0) days\" Adopted. Additional Comment: Ensures that the window of time is sufficeint enough to not have to obtain tests more than needed. 174 SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 901 Prenatal Care D.2.a. Change to \"Council Client regarding Screening for Group B Streptococcus per current CDC guidelines and recommendations.\" Not Adopted. Evidenced - based practice, Group B Streptococcus is the most common cause of life - threatening infections in newborns. Additional Comment: This test should be optional. Despite evidence -based education, some clients will decline GBS screening SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 901 Prenatal Care D.2.b. Create and move to a new section for twenty -four (24) to twenty - eight (28) weeks, remove from this section Adopted. Additional Comment: This labwork should be obtained and reviewed closer to 24 -28 weeks, when the maternal blood volume has expanded and hemodilution has occurred. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 901 Prenatal Care D.2.c. Add \"Assess and offer for Clients with lifestyle risk factors\" Adopted. Additional Comment: The majority of home birth clients are monogamous and this could be a financial burden. Additionally, Repeat STI screening should be reserved for those with lifestyle risk factors SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 901 Prenatal Care E. Strike \"the written instructions signed and dated by the Client\" Adopted. Additional Comment: Documentation in the chart that these items were given should be sufficient. While documentation is necessary, signature during antepartum or postpartum instructions would be often forgotten. Post partum instructions during initial postpartum care provides for more favorable retention of information. A signature for these items is overkill 175 SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 902 Intrapartum Care A. Either keep verbiage as it is written in the current regulations or change to \"Assess and monitor Client vital signs according to the standard of care. Assess, evaluate, and document the status of labor and the Client and fetal conditions throughout the labor and birth process, including Client vital signs and fetal heart tones in accord with sound obs tetric and neonatal practice\" Adopted. Additional Comment: Home birth is not a medical event, it is a normal bodily function, the frequency of vitals collections should not be in regulation as this is policy and procedure. Mandatory collection of vitals every hour is excessive and is an interferance with and inter vention of the normal function of labor. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 903 Postpartum Care A.1. change to \"Assess, monitor and document Client and Newborn vital signs according to the standard of care during the first 2 hours and upon discharge. Adopted. Additional Comment: Home birth is not a medical event it is a normal bodily function, the frequency of vitals collections should not be in regulations as this is a policy and procedure. Mandatory collection of vitals every hour is excessive and is an interferance with and int ervention of the normal transition of client and newborn immediately following the birth. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 904 Newborn Care A 3. Strike this line item Not Adopted. Added \"if necessary\" for clarity. Additional Comment: This is arbitrary. Why do we need to have in regulation to chart how we are providing for warmth and stimulation? Most home born babies do not need stimulation. Blankets and heating pads are on the list of supplies for the Client to have available for each birth. This is an unneccessary item for regulation. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 904 Newborn Care B. Newborn Screening: add \"If the specimen is not collected by the midwife or is not collected within three (3) days...\" Not Adopted. This is copied from statute. This corrects the error in the current regulation. Additional Comment: Many clients with traditional insurance opt to have the newborn screen collected by their pediatrician to activate their insurance instead of being out of pocket for midwifery collection processed by DHEC lab 176 SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1000 Informed Consent D. Strike this line item Adopted Additional Comment: Anatomic ultrasounds are generally performed between 18 and 22 weeks of pregnancy. With reliable dating, early ultrasound is unwarranted and introduces unnecessary risk factors to the fetus. Late ultrasound is unreliable for dating or fetal size and only indicated in higher risk situations or questions of presentation. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1100 Physical Examinations Change title of section from Physical Examinations to \"Client Medical Consultations\" Not Adopted. Additional Comment: Replace Physical Examinations with \"Client Medical Consultations\" within this entire section. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1100 Physical Examinations A.1. Change \"Physical Examination\" to \"Medical Consultation.\" \"The Midwife shall require the Client to undergo an initial Medical Consultation either in person or via telemedicine completed by a Physician or other Authorized Medical Provider, at the Provider's discretion, within the first 2 trimesters.\" Not Adopted. This is consistent with evidence -based practice. Nothing in this regulation prohibits televisits. The S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control cannot opine on laws governing physicians' and authorized healthcare providers' scopes and standards of practice. Additional Comment: Clients may not be able to obtain an appointment during that window of time (fourteen {14} to twenty {20} weeks) for various reasons including but not limited to lack of transportation, illness, limited availbility with Authorized Heatlhcare Provider, life circumstances, etc. Due to our current Pandemic, Telemed/ telehealth visits are now federally accepted forms of medical appointments and are now reimbursible through Medicaid. When the Authorized Healthcare Provider has been given the client's prenatal fl ow chart and any lab reports to review, they can then advise the client appropriately. Any medications to be prescribed to Client can be written and sent to the chosen pharmacy by the Authorized Healthcare Provider at the time of appointment whether in per son or virtual. Licensed Midwives are assessing the Client for low risk at each appointment. 177 SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1100 Physical Examinations A.2.a. Strike entire line item Not Adopted. The Birthing center statute requires the physician shall make a determination that the birth is low risk. Consistent with other regulations Additional Comment: Providers who have an appointment with the Clients for those visit may not give a written and signed document. We cannot make another provider write a document. Licensed Midwives palpate for fetal position at every prenatal visit, some medical providers who see for these visits do not perform uterine palpation. Licensed midwives cannot be responsible for other providers, likewise Authorized Healthcare providers cannot be responsible for our Clients. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1100 Physical Examinations B 1. Change title from \"Physical Examination\" to \"Client Medical Consultation\" Not Adopted. This is consistent with evidence- based practice. Additional Comment: SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1100 Physical Examinations Change to read \"after thirty -four (34) weeks of gestation Adopted. Additional Comment: It can be difficult to find a medical provider and schedule an appointment in that short time frame for various reasons including but not limited to lack of transportation, illness, no availbility with Authorized Medical Provider, life circumstances, etc. Due to the current Pandemic, Telemed/ telehealth visits are now federally accepted forms of medical appointments and are now reimbursible through Medicaid.When the Authorized Medical Provider has been given the client's prenatal flow chart and any lab repo rts to review, they can then advise the client appropriately. Any medications to be prescribed to Client can be written and sent to the chosen pharmacy at the time of appointment whether in person or virtual. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1200 Prescription Medication Administration B 2... where is this line item? Adopted. This item is the eye prophylactic as required by statute. Additional Comment: 178 SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1200 Prescription Medication Administration B.7. Add\"or alternative antibiotic, as deemed appropriate and prescribed by Authorized Medical Provider in accordance with current CDC guidelines\" Adopted. Additional Comment: For cases of penicillin allergy alternative antibiotics must be availble SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1200 Prescription Medication Administration B.8. Change to read \"IV fluids\" Adopted. Additional Comment: Lactated Ringer's or Normal Saline would be appropriate here. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1200 Prescription Medication Administration Add line item for \"other anti -hemorrhagic medications as prescribed by Authorized Medical Provider\" Partially adopted. Misoprostol is not FDA - approved as a post - hemorrhagic medication. Additional Comment: Authorized Medical Providers may prescribe anti -hemmoragic medications in accordance with evidence based research and updated protocols in accordance with the World Health Organization. Efficent, appropriate and accepted medications include misoprostol and methergine in addition to synthetic oxytocin. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1300 Medical Consultation Change title to \"Midwife Medical Consultation\" Not Adopted. Additional Comment: SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1300 Medical Consultation A. Strike: \" and the Cient's decision, as evidenced by the Client's signature.\" Not Adopted. This is consistent with other Departmental regulations requiring evidence that a Client has received relevant information about their care from the licensed facility or provider. Additional Comment: When the Licensed Midwife should need to consult with a medical provider, the client may not necessarily be present. Medical consultation by midwife to Authorized Healthcare Provider may take place virtually or over the phone at any time. Physicians don't always record the time of their appointment or any consultations with midwives. Documentation in the chart of recommendations by the Authorized Healthcare Provider for the client is sufficient. Signature to confirm decision and recomm endations upon medical consultation by the Licensd Midwife to the Authorized Healthcare Provider should be evidence on the informed consent document upon the start of care. This requirement is redundant. 179 SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1300 Medical Consultation B.1.n Strike \"Failure to gain weight\" or add \"without adequate nutrition.\" to the end of the line item Adopted. Additional Comment: Obese clients who are committed to excellent nutrition often exhibit low weight gain due to nutritional choices being optimized SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1300 Medical Consultation Add line item: VBAC Not Adopted. We are consistent with LLR's Boards of Nursing Advisory Opinion #68. Additional Comment: May be considered with prior low transverse incision, no prior classical incision and documented physician consultation explaining risks and informed consent. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1300 Medical Consultation B.2.a. Add \"greater than 24 hours.\" Adopted Additional Comment: As it is written, it is too vague and leaves it open to interrpretation SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1300 Medical Consultation B.2.e. Add \"with non -reassuring fetal heart tones\" Adopted. Additional Comment: SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1300 Medical Consultation B.4.h Change to more than ten (10) pounds Adopted. Additional Comment: Well nourished, healthy Clients can give birth uneventfully to babies who weigh more than 9 pounds without signs of hypoglycemia or other issues. SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1300 Medical Consultation B.4.j. Strike line item Adopted. Additional Comment: No need to consult for post maturity unless the baby has an abnormal newborn exam SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1300 Medical Consultation B.4.k. Strike \"Meconium staining.\" Change the remaining line item to \"does not urininate within first twenty -four (24) hours or meconium within the first forty -eight (48) hours Partially Adopted. \"Does not urinate or pass meconium in the first twenty - four (24) hours following birth;\" Additional Comment: 180 SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1300 Medical Consultation B.4.n. Strike \"Rectal\" Change one hundred six (106) to one hundred and six tenths (100.6) Adopted. Correction was made. Additional Comment: Rectal temperatures are no longer recommended. Fever in neonate is not 106degrees F, it is 100.6 degrees F SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1500 Transfer of Care A. Strike \"by dialing 911\" Not Adopted. Additional Comment: SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1500 Transfer of Care B. Strike \" Upon arrival of the emergency medical services personnel, Physician, or other Authorized Healthcare Provider, the midwife shall transfer the care of the Client to the emergency medical services personnel, Physician or other Authorized Healthcare Provider. \" Not Adopted. Nothing is preventing the Client or responsible party from refusing the emergency care when it arrives and driving their own vehicle. Additional Comment: EMS providers are not ideally equipped nor are they trained to take over care in an obstetric emergency. Also, emergent transport via private car is often more expedient in some situations. Additionally, Licensed Midwives cannot rely on clients to have copiers or printers which in turn does not provide for printing in the field. Written summaries can be faxed to the receiving provider and/ or hand delivered by the transferring midwife at the receiving hospital for copies of the chart to be made at the time of report of situation to the receiving provider. 181 SECTION COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1800 Midwifery Advisory Council Currently the MAC is an appeal committee for DHEC actions. This should remain in the regulations. It provides the opportunity to have members of the profession review actions related to these regulations. Members of this committee are in a good position to keep the public safe. The council shall establish a committee for peer review to consult with midwives on questions of ethics, competency, licensure and performance, and to serve as an appeals committee for disciplinary action under this regulation. A licensed midwife or midwife apprentice shall have 30 days to provide notice of appeal by letter directed to the Midwife Advisory Council. Upon reciept of a request for appeal of agency action, the MAC shall schedule an appeal at the next available meeting. On ly actions of the department that fall under this regulation may be appealed before the MAC. A licensed midwife may be represented by an attorney in a appeal before the MAC. Not Adopted. This contradicts S.C. 44- 1-60. The prior regulation was enacted before this statute was changed.

Board of Health and Environmental Control From: Bureau of Facilities Oversight Re: Notice of Proposed Regulation amending R.61 -75, Standards for Licensing Day Care Facilities for Adults . I. Introduction The Bureau of Facilities Oversight (\"Bureau\") proposes the attached Notice of Proposed Regulation amending R.61- 75, Standards for Licensing Day Care Facilities for Adults , for publication in the August 28, 2020, South Carolina State Register (\"State Register\"). Legal authority resides in S.C. Code Section 44-7-260, which requires the Department of Health and Environmental Control (\"Department\") to establish and enforce basic standards for the licensure, maintenance, and operation of health facilities and services in order to ensure the safe and adequate treatment of persons served in this state. The Administrative Procedures Act, S.C. Code Section 1- 23-120(A), re quires General Assembly review of these proposed amendments. II. Facts 1. The Bureau proposes amending R.61- 75 to update provisions in accordance with current practices and standards. Proposed amendments incorporate and revise provisions relating to statutory mandates, update definitions to conform to terminology widely used and understood within the provider community, and revise requirements for incident reporting, staffing and training, medication management, patient care and services, infection control, meal service, emergency procedures, design and construction, fire and life safety, and licensure. The proposed amendments also update the structure of the regulation throughout for consistency with other Department regulations. 2. The Department had a Notice of Drafting published in the February 28, 2020, State Register. A copy of the Notice of Drafting appears herein as Attachment B. The Departm ent received public comments from five parties by the Marc h 30, 2020, close of the public comment period. Attac hment C presents a summary of these public comments received and Department responses. 3. The Bureau held a stakeholder meeting on March 12, 2020. The Bureau considered stakeholder feedback in formulating the proposed amendments herein. 4. Appropriate Department staff conducted an internal review of the proposed amendments on June 29, 2020.

Interested persons may submit comment(s) on the proposed amendments to the Bureau of Health Facilities Licensing; S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control, 2600 Bull Street, Columbia, S.C. 29201; healthregcomm@dhec.sc.gov. To be consider ed, the Department must receive comments no later than 5:00 p.m. on March 30, 2020, the close of the draft comment period. Synopsis: Pursuant to R.61- 75, Standards for Licensing Day Care Facilities for Adults, the Department is responsible for regulating t he licensure, certification, inspection, and training procedures of day care facilities for adults. The Department proposes amending R.61 -75 to update and revise definitions and requirements regarding obtaining licensure, inspections, violations, training, construction, client records and care, record maintenance and retention, and licensure standards. The Department may also include stylistic changes, which may include corrections for clarity, readability, grammar, punctuation, codification, and overall improvement of the text. The Administrative Procedures Act, S.C. Code Section 1- 23-120(A), requires General Assembly review of these proposed amendments. 69 ATTACHMENT C SUMMARY OF PUBLIC COMMENTS AND DEPARTMENT RESPONSES R.61-75, Standards for Li censing Day Care Facilities for Adults As of the March 30 , 2020, close of the Notice of Drafting comment period: NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 1. Melinda Newell, Director, Prisma Health SeniorCare PACE General Not Adopted. No other reg that offers this level of health care is required to have an AED on site. This is an additional cost for facilities that might be burdensome. I am the Director of Prisma Health SeniorCare PACE which includes the Laurel, Lexington, Shandon and White Rock Day Health Centers as well as the center in the Upstate formerly known as Greenville Health PACE. We are proposing adding the standard that each facility have an AED on site. Each year, more than 250,000 Americans die from sudden cardiac arrest, and the AED can be an important tool in the chain of survival. Many rural areas in South Carolina don't have access to Emergency Medical Services within the recommended five minutes after arrest and AED might give them a chance of survival until EMS arrival. NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 2. Sara DeVeaux, President, Mother DeVeaux Adult Day Care General Partially Adopted. The vast majority of regulation was not amended. I am the spokesperson for the Mother DeVeaux Adult Day Care. I am in agreement with the rules and regulation for the Adult Day Care. NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 3. Dottie Evans, Executive Director, Hopewell Senior Day Care Center General Acknowledged. I am the Executive Director of Hopewell Senior Day Care Center. The adult day care program is one of the best programs in the state of South Carolina, and it is a pleasure working with South Carolina DHEC in providing the best care for seniors and persons with disabilities. NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 4. Lindsey McKenzie General Adopted. 101.Z, 1100.A Stakeholder meeting oral comment: Inquired as to the physical examination requirement of who is currently allowed to perform it. She suggested that DHEC include language that would allow for a PA and LNP to be included. She stated that the current requirement is a limitation for providers when trying to admin a potential participant. She stated that stand alone facilities do not have the same resources on site as those affiliated with other healthcare entities. 70 NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 5. Anna Maria Conner, Attorney, Protection and Independence Team Leader and Attorney, Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, Inc. 101.A Not Adopted. This is included in the current definition. The definition of abuse should more clearly include instance of unnecessary or unlawful use of restraints or seclusion. NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 6. Anna Maria Conner, Attorney, Protection and Independence Team Leader and Attorney, Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, Inc. 101.C Adopted. 101.D Like the definition of Day Care Facility for Adults, this definition should include a reference to community integration as a core function of the services, like sustaining or regaining functional independence. (See also 501.A.) NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 7. Anna Maria Conner, Attorney, Protection and Independence Team Leader and Attorney, Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, Inc. 101.C, 101.E, 501.A Partially Adopted. 703 - DHEC does not regulate which therapies are to be provided, only that the facility must meet the needs of the individual participants. The word \"therapies\" is used to describe a component of treatment delivered at Adult Day Health Centers. However, the regulation does not specify what therapies ADHCs are expected to offer to participants or refer to a list of therapies in another document. NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 8. Anna Maria Conner, Attorney, Protection and Independence Team Leader and Attorney, Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, Inc. 101 Adopted. 101.AA, 101.CC This regulation uses both \"sponsor\" and \"responsible party\" to describe an individual's legally responsible representative. DHEC should clarify this definition and simplify the terminology throughout the regulation. NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 9. Anna Maria Conner, Attorney, Protection and Independence Team Leader and Attorney, Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, Inc. 102.K Adopted. 102.K was recodified to 800 and amended for clarity. P&A would suggest deleting this sentence. It is unclear in both meaning and to which other section the sentence refers. 71 NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 10. Anna Maria Conner, Attorney, Protection and Independence Team Leader and Attorney, Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, Inc. 302 Adopted. 1001.A.9 DHEC should specify which classification would cover instances of past abuse or neglect discovered through an investigation. P&A would suggest that past instances of abuse or neglect should be cited under Class I if the past harm resulted in death or bodily injury, but also due to the imminent danger of abuse or neglect reoccurring. NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 11. Anna Maria Conner, Attorney, Protection and Independence Team Leader and Attorney, Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, Inc. 401.A Adopted. 703.B DHEC should require facilities to maintain policies ensuring participants have adequate access to nity involvement. NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 12. Anna Maria Conner, Attorney, Protection and Independence Team Leader and Attorney, Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, Inc. 404.B Partially Adopted. The regulation does not prevent greater staff to participant ratio if the needs of the participants dictates it. DHEC should clarify that a ratio of 1 staff to 8 participants cannot be viewed as a fixed staff ratio but rather should be dictated by the individual needs of participants. NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 13. Anna Maria Conner, Attorney, Protection and Independence Team Leader and Attorney, Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, Inc. 404.E, 404.F Adopted. 505.A.3 DHEC should expand required training for staff of ADHCs, including specifically required training, including but not limited to: the prevention of abuse, neglect, and exploitation; positive behavioral intervention; individual plans of care; etc. 72 NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 14. Anna Maria Conner, Attorney, Protection and Independence Team Leader and Attorney, Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, Inc. 501.A, 503.A Adopted. 703.B,901.A - Although the term person- centered planning is not a term used in the regulation, the department has built in person -centered planning methodology in the individual plan of care and activities. 703.A - Care Plans shall be provided upon request. DHEC should state that the individual plan of care and activities must be based on a person -centered planning model. Additionally, DHEC should mandate that ADHCs provide a copy of the plan to the participant and/or his guardian or sponsor. The individual plan should also include specific plans as to how to ensure the participant has access to the community. NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 15. Anna Maria Conner, Attorney, Protection and Independence Team Leader and Attorney, Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, Inc. 703.A Adopted. 601.B DHEC should include \"sponsor\" as a party to be notified in the case of an accident and/or incident, or clarify the definition for \"sponsor\" as recommended above. NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 16. Anna Maria Conner, Attorney, Protection and Independence Team Leader and Attorney, Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, Inc. 901.A.9 Adopted. 1001.A.9 DHEC should clarify the wording of the ninth right, because it is unclear what \"if applicable\" refers to. NAME SECTION DEPARTMENT RESPONSE 17. Anna Maria Conner, Attorney, Protection and Independence Team Leader and Attorney, Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, Inc. 1202 Adopted. Clarified in 2601.A DHEC should clarify this section to reflect the ADHC situation (i.e., deleting references to \"participant rooms\"), including signal systems for mandated sick beds pursuant to 501.G. SUMMARY SHEET SOUTH CAROLINA BOARD OF HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL August 13, 2020 (X) ACTION/DECISION ( ) INFORMATION I. TITLE: Request for a nine -month extension by the Board for Certificate of Need (CON) SC-17-80 issued to KershawHealth Ambulatory Surgery Center , LLC (\"KershawHealth \") for construction of an ambulatory surgery center with three operating rooms. II. SUBJECT: KershawHealth requests Board approval for extension of CON SC -17-80. III. FACTS: CON SC -17-80 was issued to KershawHealth on December 13, 2017 for the referenced project. The original CON had an expiration date of December 13, 2018 . KershawHealth requested a first staff extension of the CON on November 12, 2018 , which was more than 30 days prior t o its expiration. KershawHealth received CON SC -17-80-EXT -1 on December 13, 2018 , and it was valid until September 13, 2019, for a period of nine months from the original expiration of the CON. KershawHealth requested a second staff extension of the CON on August 13, 2019 , which was 30 days prior to its expiration. KershawHealth received CON SC -17-80-EXT -2 on September 13, 2019 , and it was due to expire on June 13, 2020 . In accordance with R. 61-15, Certification of Need for Health Facilities and Services , Section 601, KershawHealth submitted a third staff extension request to the Department on March 13 , 2020, which is more than 90 days prior to its expiration. IV. ANALYSIS: Department staff have reviewed all relevant information concerning this third ext ension request and find that circumstances beyond the control of KershawHealth have contributed to the need for further extension of CON SC -17-80. Specifically, the applicant stated it had experienced a delay as a result of an ownership change at a level n ot subject to Department action under R. 61 -15, Section 604 . Prior to the expiration of SC -17-80-EXT -2, Department staff requested additional information concerning this transaction. On July 15, 2020, counsel for KershawHealth wrote to the Department and fully explain ed the nature of the purported transaction involving a potential change of ownership related to R. 61 -15, Section 604. Department staff's subsequent analysis of this information determined that the CON remained valid and is now subject to appropriate review and extension by the Board. Department staff have also determined that substantial progress towards implementing the project has been made and expect, based on the extension request itself, that the project will be implemented around Novembe r 2020. V. RECOMMENDATION: Department staff recommend that the Board concur that KershawHealth has demonstrated extenuating circumstances beyond its control that have prevented the project from advancing , and that a nine-month extension of CON SC -17-80 be granted , with an expiration date of March 13, 2021.
