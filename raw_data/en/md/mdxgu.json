But even if you've attended top-rank schools, public or private, it should be no news to you that across the country, our students are lagging, our schools are crum-bling, and it's becoming much less taboo to seek options outside of public education. Now that education is more readily avail-able than it's ever been, we've devalued it, and some people have even begun to take pride in their reaction against what should be our greatest privilege. Th is isn't an issue of test scores. Th is isn't even an issue of graduation rates, be-cause at 78% they're actually the highest they've been since 1974, which should be a reason to celebrate. Th is is an issue of attitude: Americans, both students and parents, regularly assume that school is boring, if not cruel, and that it serves no greater purpose than keeping our kids off the streets. Nasty opinions about public education are becoming more and more mainstream, especially among the lower class, minorities, and millions of creative students stuck in schools they fi nd intellec-tually suff ocating.We've heard college as pretentious and unnecessary. More radical Tea Partiers have waged an all-out assault on the entire Department of Education, whether for its failure to teach intelligent design or the \"awful lot of made up criticism about the founders intruding on the Indians or having slaves or being hypocrites in one way or another, \" as TP spokesman Hal Rounds puts it. Th e current familiarity of this fundamentalist dissent partly explains why the number of home-schooled students has spiked from 850,000 in 1999 to 2.5 million in 2013, mainly white children of blue-collar workers. Looking across racial lines, the badi- tudes are directed less at public education than at intellectualism as a whole. Th e he-roes of the Civil Rights Movement would weep to hear the views on brainpower that parts of the modern black community hold. One telling survey cited by Dr. Henry Louis Gates (we'll get back to him later) asked black students at a St. Louis char-ter school for construction careers, \"What does it mean to 'act white?'\" garnering re-sponses like \"good in school and in class on time, \" \"smart and well behaved, \" and \"uppi-ty about everything, geeky and always into stuff . \" Th e same question for acting black got answers like \"ghetto and having a nasty attitude and disrespect people, \" and \"listen to hip hop, saggy pants, making B's and C's even though we try our hardest, drop out of high school to have a baby and work at a fast food restaurant. \" Academic disengagement is now not only acceptable, it's rampant, and it marks nothing short of a cultural crisis. Race is an un-ignorable aspect of this, with Hispanics trailing whites in graduation rate by 12% and blacks by 17%. We are past the age where we can accept inherent, biological disadvantage as an explanation. A lack of food, books, and free time is part of the rea-son, but it's only half the problem, and there is little that the schools can do to remedy it. What our schools can do is reform cur-riculums, because right now, our standard course schedule does little to foster intel-lectual curiosity, and without that, every subject becomes much harder to teach. As far as how we ought to amend our methods of teaching, it's kind of a free-for-As someone who will shamelessly admit an obsession with tiny, repeating lines and patterns, I can't help but appreci-ate the style of Jackson Tupper's artwork. Chances are if you've managed to defrost your limbs and crawl around Burlington recently, you've seen his work too. Tupper's art has been featured all over from the Ra-dio Bean to the Vantage Point and even the acclaimed pages of the water tower once upon a time. At fi rst glance, Tupper's work appears simple. Th e characters of his artwork are created from strong, clean outlines and typically feature birds, stumps, men with enough facial hair to make any lumberjack proud, or some kind of combination of the three. Regardless, all his subjects tend to feature round, rolling fi gures with the oc-casional spaghetti limb winding around the body. Th e simplicity, however, only lasts for about the fi rst three seconds that you look at the image. Riddled in the beards, sweat-ers, or backgrounds are tiny, repeating pat-terns and lines executed with meticulous detail. Where his fi gures are formed from rounded, organic lines, all of the patterns Tupper includes are geometric and incred-ibly precise. Th e juxtaposition between the two line styles adds a wonderful element of texture into his artwork that keeps the viewer interested. It's important to pay attention to the detail of the work because that's where Tupper sneaks in the interesting bits. While a piece may seem to rather cheerful at fi rst glance, Tupper will slips in a little hint of morbid humor or something rather unex-pected. I won't ruin the surprise but there's the occasional, unexpected impaling of some body part or another. It's certainly worth a second look, especially if you fi nd \"Where's Waldo?\" to be a little too main-stream and you' d rather play \"Where's the Wound?\" Although Tupper's style is more ori- ented towards pen and ink, where he can showcase his precision detail, he is still able to transfer this unmistakable style on to dif- by katharinelongfellow by kerrymartinben James Aglio Liz Cantrell News Editor Kerry Martin Around Town Editor Cait O'Hara Reflections Editor Phoebe Fooks Fashion Editor Sarah Perda Fork It Over Editor Jamie Beckett Cr\u00e9atif Stuff\u00e9 Editor Beth Ziehl Tunes Editor Dylan McCarthy Humor Editor Collin Cappelle Copy Editor Laura Greenwood _________ ________Staff Writers Stacey Brandt Michael Storace Patrick Murphy Dan Nissim_________________Art Staff Art Editor Malcolm Valaitis Kitty Faraji Art Staff Ben Berrick UVM Art thewatertowernews@gmail.com Editors-in-Chief: watertowereditor@gmail.com Advertising: watertowerads@gmail.comOur generation stands at a crossroads.

Ramirez worries about amateurs using guns and machetes. I'm worried the Feds will step in with napalm and Agent Orange.Dear water tower ,all. On the radical, arguably fascist side of the debate, Improve-Education.org presents a Five Point Plan to reform our national curriculums. Point #4 is my favorite: \"REAL HIS - TORY , GEOGRAPHY , GOVERNMENT. No more Social Studies. No more propaganda, indoctrination, and political correctness. No more multiculturalism for its own sake. History is taught by people who majored in History. Y ou learn names, dates, places and events. Y ou understand why things happened the way they did. Everybody loves a good story. History is a million good stories. \" Y eah, maybe if you're a white supremacist. The opposite camp\u2014reform advocates who cite successful creative curricula in Bra - zil, Singapore, and the EU\u2014stresses the importance of creativity and interdisciplinary studies in the classroom. The intersection of religion and literature; science and politics; art and technology. This is what's going to get students critically thinking, this is going to appeal to a broader base than cut-and-dry subjects, this will teach kids to see links in our hyper-connected world. Separate disciplines are limiting and build an outdated, black- and-white worldview. They've realized it at Harvard, where they now offer a class titled \"Social Issues in Biology. \" But if Harvard were an accurate cross-section of the nation as a whole, I would have little to write about except maritime law. Another great idea (also out of Harvard) comes from Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr., the country's foremost African-American Studies scholar, sadly best known for getting ar - rested trying to enter his own home in 2009. UVM invited him as keynote speaker for its week-long Martin Luther King Day celebration, so Dr. Gates\u2014a funny man voted \"Best Teacher\" by Harvard students\u2014described a new curriculum he's been constructing and implementing, based on his well-known PBS series, Finding Y our Roots. Thanks to in - novations in modern genetics, students can test their DNA and discover where their family originated from, be it Northern Ireland or the Zulu nation. Then, by interviewing family members and consulting public records, they will build family trees, using their own histories as introductions to American history. \"Let kids study what they're most interested in, \" stressed Dr. Gates, \"themselves. \" No Child Left Behind hasn't turned our education system around. Creative curricula just might. There are ways to move from telling kids what they should know to letting kids discover what they want to know, and still preserve the intensity and integrity of the classroom. But it's going to take some imagination; hopefully we've still got some of that left.g2013 -continued from page 1 Dry skin- Fuck you wind, my face hurts. It's balls cold out but I didn't realize I need - ed a scarf to take the bus to class. Everywhere I go I see chapped lips and faces and that's just no fun. If the wind insists to persist, I say that ho better bring some snow. Late things- The cold is culling the herd and causing some of us to be late. Be we struggling into a lecture hall fifteen minutes in or missing morning buses to the mountain, the tardiness is really busting my balls. While I may forgive you (in time) your professor may not, so don't turn in your lab reports late this week folks. Nutella- Anyone else eat a jar of nutella lately? I stumbled upon this chocolaty trea - sure in my room late last Saturday and everything the nutella touched turned to gold. While enjoying sensational nirvana, I consumed a day's worth of calories. To - tally worth it, but also shit-worthy. Bagged wine - Don't get me wrong; I love to slap the bag, but these whole day hang - overs have got to go. Such head-throbbing is not conducive to learning and class picked up quick this week leaving me bamboozled in my GIS lab. Methane - Some douche bags fart on you, others near you and damn it! I can smell it. While I often find farts funny, methane is no laughing matter for it is a very strong greenhouse gas and more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat. The thawing of tundra permafrost is allowing for new activity, creating another source of meth - ane to be released into our atmosphere. Because cow farts weren't enough. g with kerry martin \"Her pads on her feet were bleeding. Her claws are worn weird. The front ones are really sharp, the back ones worn down to nothing. \" -Bonnie Richter describing the state of her cat Holly, who wandered off on a family trip and was thought lost, only to return to her Florida home, two months and 200 miles away. Holly also now knows how to speak, and she recounted her struggles with hunger and python attacks in an exclusive water tower interview. Don't miss her memoir, A Long Way For a Pussy: A Cat's Struggle Against All Odds.Since I have found out that the Watertower [sic] only publishes letters which fit its agenda of America and Israel bashing and ignores facts about the Middle East, I am not writing to publish anything. I do want to point out the hypocrasy [ sic] of Kerry's article on France in Mali. Why does French killing in Mali recieve support while Israel's self defense against Islamists which actual [ sic] fire on Israel does not? Be assured that French troops are less discriminating in their fire and Mali is less of a direct threat to France. Civillians in Mali are likewise not immune to French bullets and missiles. Have any missles from Mali landed on French ci - vilians? Also, if you are going to write about foriegn relations maybe you should get your facts right. Lybia [ sic] is a former Italian colony and Palestine was under the British after the fall of the Ottomans, they were not French colonies. The errors bother me as a student of the Middle East but the hypocrasy [ sic] of condoning and praising French intervention to fight a radical Islamist threat far from home while condeming the US and Israel is a distinction that is hard to understand. http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/164510 J.R. It disheartens me that you believe, what's more that you \"found out\" from someone, that the water tower \"only publishes letters which fit its agenda of America and Israel bashing. \" First, we will print pretty much any letter that fits within the space allotted for letters to the editor. When we do not print a letter, is is most likely too long to fit in the paper, and we always try to respond at least via email. Second, the paper does not have any agenda such as the one you describe. We are largely an editorial-style publication, and so the individual opinions of writers may come out in their writing. We do not make demands about the beliefs that our writers may hold. Kerry's article was specifically in reference to Hollande's recent (and to some, surprising) capability in foreign relations. It was not necessarily a \"pro-French intervention\" as much as it was discussing the decisions made by the leader of France in a positive light. In no way, shape, or form was it a comparison with the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, which got one brief mention during the section of background information. The conflicts in Irael are widely recognized to be incredibly complex, and while you may find it to be a hypocrisy for someone to support anti-Islamist wars elsewhere in the world but not in Is - rael, it is hardly a unique opinion to hold. Lastly, you are correct that Libya and Palestine were not French colonies. I believe that Kerry meant to express that they were colonies of some state at some point as a way of partially explaining the longstanding trend of European military intervention in the Middle East; he could have perhaps been more clear on that point. Thank you for your letter, it is always helpful to hear what the UVM population thinks about the articles we print. James Aglio Co-Editor-in-Chief This year's Super Bowl is full of great stories. We've got a second-year quarter - back, Colin Kaepernick, of the San Fran - cisco 49ers who has all of 9 starts in his career. Also, Super Bowl XLVII will be the last hurrah for Baltimore Ravens' line - backer Ray Lewis who decided to suit up this season in search of another champion - ship. And don't forget about Randy Moss, who has had a bit of a resurgence in his first year with the 49ers. Will he finally get his first Super Bowl ring? But the biggest headline might be the battle between the brothers: Y ounger brother Jim Harbaugh is the head coach of 49ers, and he faces his older brother, John Harbaugh, head of the opposing Ravens. John has worked hard to get his team through the playoffs this year to their first Super Bowl since the 2000 season. Jim, in his second season with the 49ers, has changed the mentality of the program in San Francisco. He led them to the NFC Championship game last year, and this year, with the help of Colin Kaepernick, has brought them to this joy - ous occasion. I was not a big fan of the switch to Colin Kaepernick at first. Why would the 49ers bench Alex Smith, who led them so triumphantly to the NFC Championship game last year, for an unproven quarter - back? I know last season was a bit of an outlier for Smith, but the logic escaped me. Answer: Alex Smith was able to get them to the NFC Championship game; Co - lin Kaepernick helped them win it and go on to the Super Bowl. Kaepernick has the arm, breakaway speed, and poise in high- pressure situations. For Baltimore, the big story is about Ray Lewis' last season. It looked like it was all over near the end of their divisional round match-up against the Denver Bron - cos, but by some higher calling, Lewis and his Ravens snuck away with the victory. Ex - pect to see some hard-nosed defense from both sides. Also look out for the matchup between the talented 49ers receiving core (Davis, Crabtree, and Moss) and the tough secondary of Baltimore. The teams are well matched, but I think the 49ers have too powerful an offense. My pick: 49ers 24 - 16. gby dan nissim ben berrick advertisementThere's little to like about doing homework; that's something that simply cannot be denied. However, there is a way to make it somewhat tolerable, and actually manage to get things done: Having \"Your Spot. \" There is something to having a place that you feel completely comfortable doing work at that makes the entire process seem smoother. The atmosphere you choose to work in has a direct effect on the quality and quantity of work that you produce. In my time here, I've found several that I really enjoy and lucky for you, dear Reader, I'm willing to share .by cait o'hara It seems as though it would the perfect spot for homework, seeing as it's the obvious choice, but there's something about the library that just makes it questionable: People. With the number of people coming in and out of the library for printing, Cyber Caf\u00e9 runs, and general attempts at work, you're almost guaranteed to run into someone you know. Which inevitably leads to conversation, and before you know it, it's been several hours and you've got nothing done. I reccommend trying the second floor because the usu - al noises of the library dissapate out as you go higher and deeper into the stacks. But really, only come here if you still have days to finish things.I discovered this hidden gem while desperately trying to pass my Calc 3 class last semester, and have definite plans to continue using it. There are rarely other people up there, several classrooms are free for use, and several tables tuck into nooks facing the window (perfect for those 5 minute day dreaming sessions). In short, it's hard not to love this place. The seclusion and lack of foot traffic makes it so easy to focus in on the task at hand. I've gone there expecting to only spend an hour or two getting the necessities done, and before I knew it 4 hours had passed and I was caught up on all of my work for the week. Oh yea, it's that kind of good. I will readily admit that this is my favor - ite place, not just to do homework but in general. It's never loud enough that a pair of headphones and some good zone-out music won't keep you focused, and there's something about being surrounded by the smell of freshly roasting coffee while try - ing to get things done that keeps me in a seemingly hyper-focused state. Here, I can keep going far beyond my average point of mental exhaustion, which is great when you can't procrastinate no more. Located in our lovely new eco-gasm of a building, this is one of those spots that most have not explored. Right as you walk in, you'll notice large windows, and through them you'll see tables and chairs. As you cautiously enter this foreign place, the level of concentration in the air will be palpable. And, at least in my experience, this concen - tration level will absorb through you skin and inspire you to achieve a whole new level of productivity. It's less than a three-minute trip to get a coffee or a snack from the Mar - ketplace, making this the ideal spot for a long-term study session.There's the tried and true option of staying in your dorm. From your own desk, to the study lounges, to a random room you've discovered in adventuring, there is some - thing comforting about studying in a familiar place. Ev - ery dorm on campus has some sort of lounge/study room/ multipurpose room, which are often occupied by other students trying to accomplish the same thing you are. The beauty of the dorms is that you are almost always able to find someone else who is taking the same class that you're struggling with, meaning help is never more than a couple doors away. Plus, there's something to be said about study - ing in your pajamas. So there you have it folks, my favorite study spots. I'm sure there are more and everyone has their own personal preferences, but I highly sug - gest giving one of these a try. Who knows? Maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised by a new level of ass-kicking when it comes to your work. gHere at the water tower , City Market gets a lot of flak for being far too expensive as a grocery store for the UVM student who can't afford to gold-plate their brand new cus - tom-made D&G boat shoes. While this may be true, it would be irresponsible to ignore the quality of some of the organic and local food. When used in tandem with the weekly farmers' market, City Market can be a great way to stay healthy and happy among the colossal tidal wave of fatty, processed temptations on campus. However, not only does it offer a way to keep your body in shape, but also your mind, keeping it covered with lectures and food classes. Covertly scheduled at night, and posted on UVM BORED (thus explaining why no one knows about them), these little seminars are held for anyone who wants to attend- you do not have to be a member of the Onion River Co-op, though if you are you can save $5.00 on the paid workshops. The ratio of free to paid classes is about 50/50, (though, quite frankly, the free classes are comparatively lame, usually focusing on a boring gen - eral topic) so even if you don't have a penny to your name, you can still learn how to keep a healthy colon in a way that doesn't involve the Grundle and a sizable roll of ResLife approved toilet paper. If you are willing to part with $10, you can attend the more kickass sessions and walk away with newfound knowledge of herbs, sauces, and hors d' oeuvres that will dazzle friends and quickly make you the most popular person in your social circle. This Wednesday, for example, will be a tutorial on making winter vegetable dips that you can bust out on movie night to feel like one fancy fucker. Imagine the looks of awe and respect on your buddies' faces when they pop some of your glorious-ass turmeric tahini in their face-hole: Totally worth investing $10 and an hour of your time. Even if cooking isn't your thing, and you would prefer to buy your food made for you, because this is the 21st century after all, there are still classes you can benefit from. On February 3rd, there will be a free smart buying course to educate you in the ways of keeping a pantry stocked without selling your soul to the bourgeois devil and how to keep food in the way which will keep it from spoiling for as long as humanly possible. As col - lege students, being able to eat what you buy right up until it grows lips and can plea for its life is a must if you expect to save every spare nickel and dime. Interested in alternative medicine? Then you can attend a free herbal consultation with a specialist who can recommend a swath of natural agents to cure that headache or sore throat so you won't have to worry about the horrible things those pills you've been taking may or may not have been doing to your liver. Being free, even if the recommend - ed remedies don't cure you as fast as a cocktail of chemicals, you haven't lost anything.More classes are posted all the time, so make sure to check UVM BORED or swing by the market to get the haps on the craps going down that week. Why not spend some procrastination time learning about Chinese root remedies? Facebook certainly isn't go - ing anywhere\u2014give it a try! Ultimately, you may come out of it a stronger, healthier, wiser person (or at least have some major new hipster street cred). gby ben berrick \"imagine the looks of awe and respect on your buddies' faces when they pop some of your glorious-ass turmeric tahini in their face-hole \" First, let me make it clear that we certainly have published some less-than-stellar IWYSBs this past semester, but to call these attempts bad, or worse than those that could have been published, would be to ignore the core of the section. Every so often there is a really stellar piece of horny poetry; some hopeless romantic with, I assume, a sizeable boner (or lady-boner), makes us swoon with their sweet nothings and wish that we could find some recognizable hint of our characteristics in their \"I saw. \" But these bits really are few and far between: Not to mention that recent issues have had just as many of these as past runs (seriously: The \"dirty blond paragon\" piece in issue 8? Could a piece of prose be more panty-wetting?). In the earliest issues, published submissions didn't even necessarily adhere to the basic premise that said submission should be a poem, often forsaking even the most skeletal of prose in favor of dropping enough deets to get their hands on whoever it was they were creaming themselves over. Compare: \"I see you all over L/L drinking tea and being friendly...we should hang out more often; you seem pretty cute\" (Issue 1, Sept. 2009). \"Met ya in Gen Chem/From there our love did stem/Then I learned you from an island/and I want my coconut fruity drink/WOOT HOT GIRLFRIEND\" (Issue 3, Sept. 2012) Clearly, both of these would be pretty shitty in comparison to one of the rare stellar poems, but at least the more recent one attempts to rhyme. Considering such an utterly un- funny origin, I would argue that we've come pretty far. Sure, we may not be publishing the next Byron, or even a Ginsburg, but the precedence that has been set\u2014a concerted effort to combine humor and licentiousness\u2014is in itself an accomplishment. Additionally, to claim that the issue is not with the quality of the submissions themselves, but with those that have been published is fallaciously ignoring the spirit of the sec - tion: Why should quality detract from the humor and lightheartedness of tumescent pleas for love? The water tower is UVM's student's paper and there is elegance in the entropy infused in the lowest common denominator. Like the graffiti of penises on Pompeiian villa walls or cuneiform couplets on pottery shards, crude art has been a staple of the human condition and is cumulatively worth just as much as the masterpieces in the Louvre. Basically, to say that recent semesters' batches of published IWYSBs have been especially worse is an egregious instance of looking back at past years through rose-colored glasses. They may not be perfect, but in a way, that's always been the point: They are a forum through which any shmuck can apply for the chance at wooing their unknowing crush with heavyhanded descriptions of their genitals. gby constance fingerbottom If you've ever suffered through the unfortunate experience of having a class here, you know exactly what I'm talking about. But it's a great way to sequester yourself and bust out copious quantities of work. I will admit that you can feel like somewhat of a creeper down there if you stay for too long, and the lack of access to coffee can be hard for some, but the redeeming qualities of this charming little place more than make up for it. Bathrooms, water fountains and vending machines are all within all of 40 feet of you at all times, and you'll be more than pleasantly surprised with how much you'll be able to get done.art by barry guglielmo art by ben berrickBeing a freshman has never really had anything positive attached to it, other than the fact that you're not in high school anymore. Y ou're a little fi sh in a big sea, most likely unaware of what you want to do with your life, and your mom calls you ten times each day. However there is certain nostalgia for this age, most oft en possessed by upperclassmen suddenly re-alizing they're graduating from college in less than a year and will have to move on from the \"best years of their lives. \" Even I, a mere sophomore, lust at last year's memories of move-in day, my fi rst time going home for Th anksgiving break, and everything associated with the \"honey-moon phase\" of college life. First of all, though it's nice that my parents have phased out the daily phone calls, with it they have also phased out one of freshman year's best of-ferings: the care packages. Come on, you guys don't care about me anymore? Sophomore status brings along the assumption that you're now immune from homesickness and therefore apples from your favor-ite hometown orchard and homemade trail mix (my hippie parents went for the healthy care package option) aren't worth the shipping and handling fees. Aft er freshman year, your mailbox is forever as lonely and empty as your old bedroom at home, which has now been converted into a guest room/offi ce. Th anks, Mom and Dad. Th ings that do show up in the mail once you're older are not the kind of let-ters that you rush to open and read right away. I'm talking about bills. Not hav-ing to worry about monthly rent, heat, electricity, and the like is a second thing that I miss about being a freshman. And as a sophomore with plans of living off -campus next year, I've only just dipped my toes in the waters of leases, landlords, and less-than-satisfactory Burlington real estate. Living in the dorms is fi nally start-ing to show off its advantages, just as it's time for me to make my way out. Furthermore, whether you bomb a midterm, black out on a Th ursday night, make out with a stranger on the drunk bus, or get frost bite on your toes be- cause you forgot to invest in proper Vermont winter footwear, noth-ing beats the \"I'm just a freshman, I didn't know any better\" excuse. Y ou still have time to learn from your mistakes. But as you get older, you can't really say, \"maybe an econ major just isn't for me, \" or that you had no idea Four Loko contains eight percent alcohol by volume. (As a matter of fact, unless you're a sixteen-year-old girl who has pierced her own belly button and runs a Brooke Candy appreciation blog, you really don't have an excuse to be drinking Four Loko at all.) Regardless, the point is when you're an upperclassman in college your parents won't have sympathy for your mediocre grades, drained bank account, and your poor decisions that lead to both of these results. Enjoy the pity while it lasts, kiddos. Being a freshman is ad-ditionally a lot less expensive than it seems at the time. Th e college years press on, your body begins to physically re-ject cheap din-ing hall food and Franzia, so you resort to spending more money eating out and buy- ing fancier beverages. On that note, my body's low tolerance to alcohol is also a fond memory of freshman year, and con-sequentially I have spent more on booze than ever before but without getting nearly as smashed as I did when I was a freshie. And I haven't even ventured into the bar scene yet... But these are menial complaints. In the grander scheme of things, I miss the genuine naivety of my freshman self. I miss feeling as though I had all the time in the world to decide what I want to do before graduating, signing up for classes just because they sound cool, and gener-ally never knowing what to expect with each turn of events. Th ere were times when I would look around and actu-ally be awestruck at the friendships I had formed, the new things I had tried, and how much my life had changed in such a short time. On your birthday, people oft en ask you if you \"feel older. \" Th e re-sponse is usually a shrug with some sort of clever answer such as, \"Only by a day, Aunt Joan!\" but frequently during fresh-man year I could actually feel myself growing up. I know you've all heard this too many times, but college really does go by fast. So freshmen, I encourage you to make mistakes, and to try new things that at no other time in your life will it be socially acceptable to do. gOn my way to class one fi ne morning, a strange woman around my own age handed me a small, ice cream-sandwich sized book of paper in the Davis Center. What fi rst caught my eyes was the small printed \"100\" in the corner and the multiple shades of green which I immediate-ly recognized as American money. Logic soon let me realize that this woman was not handing me a wad of 100-dollar bills but in fact the bian-nual coupon book that many of us receive, but never use. Th e Spring 2013 installment of the \"Cam- pus Special\" coupon book brings with it an up-date on its smart phone app counterpart. As an avid iPhone user, sometimes referred to as an \"addict\" of sorts to my cellular device, I prefer using the app to the textbook-thick equivalent that no one has time to fl ip through and become acquainted with. Th e updated app is a progres-sive and advanced step, now resembling more seasoned applications. Th is time around, you are required to make a profi le, or sign in with your Facebook. A slight deterrent, since now I'm going to get more emails, but the hope of sav-ing money helps me move on. Deeper into the app I realize the entire interface has been altered to help you narrow down the coupons you wish to use based on categories\u2014food, tattoos/pierc- ings, movies, etc. Th ere's a separate food section for take out with phone numbers and full menus alongside the deals! Pretty helpful for those nights when you forget to eat until nine and re-alize its too much eff ort to go outside so you just order pizza. Th e downside of this app is that it goes into loading limbo almost every time you switch pages, lasting from anywhere to three seconds or indefi nite loading purgatory. Th ere is also a lack of a \"view all\" option for each category, which is a huge bummer if you are just looking to browse through the coupons, thus forcing you to have to know exactly what you want upon entering the app. A brand new feature that I absolutely hate is the Campus Special grading system; I am cur-rently ranked as an underwater basket weaver and I have no idea what that means or if it's sup-posed to be even remotely amusing. Overall, having the digitized version of the most forgotten yet useful of UVM's free spew that comes by at the start of every semester is a huge convenience. All it requires is remem-bering that you have it when you're downtown at your favorite restaurant or store since you almost always have your phone, but not neces-sarily that stupid-ass coupon book. As the vast majority of us are in the broke college student category, saving money anywhere we can is es-sential to our survival and sanity. gby patrickmurphyIt pained me to see my favorite ten- nis player, Serena Williams, go down in her quarterfi nal match at the Australian Open last week. She has been playing at the top of her game, not letting her age of 31 slow her down. She fi nished her 2012 season in stride. Aft er losing at the Australian and French Opens, Serena went on to win Wimbledon, gold at the Olympics, and the US Open. I can still see her doing the Crip Walk at the All England Club aft er winning her gold medal. Now, I'm not going to spend time overplaying her rise from Compton. I am going to talk about the Serena Williams who has domi-nated opponents, overcame many obstacles, and placed herself among the best female tennis players of all time. It didn't take long for young Serena to make a name for herself in professional tennis. By the age of 17, she had already defeated stars like Mon-ica Seles and Lindsey Davenport earning her a world ranking of 20. At age 18, she won her fi rst Grand Slam singles title by beating world No. 1, Martina Hingis, at the 1999 US Open. Th is primed her for what would be one of the greatest runs in tennis history.Her 2002 and 2003 seasons have been called the \"Serena Slam. \" Serena beat her older sister, Venus, in four con-secutive Grand Slam events. First at the 2002 French Open, then at Wimbledon, the US Open, and fi nishing up at the 2003 Australian Open completing her Career Grand Slam. Serena fi nished 2002 with 56-5 record, splashing herself atop the world rankings. Th en came the injuries. Serena struggled for several years from knee, ankle, and other assorted ailments. She returned to true form by winning back-to-back Australian Open and Wimbledon titles in 2009 and 2010. Today, I believe Serena is playing her best tennis. Some have called her serve the best ever in women's tennis. She can put away her opponent's fi rst and second serves for easy winners. She commands the tempo of each match. Serena doesn't beat op-ponents; she obliterates them. But it was almost all over for Serena in early 2011 when her doctors found a pulmonary embolism. Serena recovered, and I was fortunate enough to see her play at the US Open fi nal that year. Even though she lost to Sam Stosur, I got to see her passion for the game fi rst-hand. Early in the second set, aft er dropping the fi rst, she yelled, \"Come on!\" aft er putting away a forehand winner. Appar-ently her celebration over the point was premature, and the point was awarded to Stosur. Serena had no problem getting in the face of the chair umpire. Th at is what I admire about her. In a game so proud of its etiquette, Serena brings a passion unmatched by her opponents. Sure, she did threaten to shove a ball down a line judge's throat at the 2009 US Open, but don't we all get a little out of hand sometimes? I am proud to have Serena Wil- liams as one of my sport's idols. While other sports are riddled with doping and cheating scandals, no one can question Serena's work ethic and passion for the game that she loves. gby dan nissim by phoebe fooks Catch Up. Get Ahead.

Tupper employs a range of mediums throughout the show, including paintings, pen and ink, as well as mixed media. Particularly in his pen and ink images, you can really get up close and personal with all the itty-bitty details and see how they develop the personality of his characters. He transfers this process to some large black and white paint-ings that continue to capture the delicacy and cleanness of the line with-out sacrifi cing style. In some of his other color pieces, Tupper blends soft earth tones with natural wood backgrounds, paying homage to the stumps frequently featured in the piece and refl ecting the thoughtful mood of the fi gure. Y et with his more energetic pieces, Tupper match-es the colors to the character, choosing pops of bright colors that contrast the muted earth tones without overwhelm- ing the lines of the fi gure. Th rough- out the show, Tupper creates a perfect triple threat. His clear, defi ned outlines im-mediately attract the viewer's at-tention, the tiny details draw you in closer, then the quirky, macabre twists throw a psycho-logical right hook and fi nishes with a knockout. I never thought I could be more excited about drawing thousands of miniscule lines than I already am, but the bearded men of Jackson Tupper's art have inspired me. Th e show is cur-rently located up on the fourth fl oor of the Davis Center and it's defi nitely worth a closer look. g\"the downside of this app is that it goes into indefi nite loading purgatory every time you switch pages\" \"in a game so proud of its etiquette, serena brings a passion unmatched by her opponents.\" someone on campus catch your eye? couldn't get a name ? submit your love anonymously uvm.edu/ ~watertwr/iwysb.htmloverheard a conversation in b-town? was it hilarious? dumb? the print it. uvm.edu/ ~watertwr/ear.html Millis - Girls' bathroom with shower running Young Woman (of good birth's voice) : Should I take my tampon out?!?

While these basic itera - tions may be serviceable, there is absolutely no reason why they shouldn't be made more difficult and better. If you're already a capable cook, you should have no problem adapting and enjoying your vastly superior meals. Those of you who may or may not be kept 1,000 feet away from a stove by court order can still hazard an attempt. If success - ful, you will emerge from the kitchen bruised, burned, and sweating bullets, but with a dish that will set your previous plebeian efforts to bitter shame. While winter settles in as comfortably as a brain freeze, our clothing choices have become dedicated to the preservation of body heat and the deterrence of the ele - ments. It is the season when jackets become puffier, mate - rials become hydrophobic, and the phrase \"my hood\" ex - plains both a person's street cred and why their hair looks like shit. Most winter apparel I have encountered seems to have some sort of practicality, but around New England a winter-wear anomaly has emerged: Uggs. Almost too perfectly, the word \"Ugg\" calls to mind a common adjective describing that which is homely or unattractive. If you've ever worn or seen this deplorable foot - wear, you know their power to magically transform the petite foot into the foot of a Sasquatch; they're just plain Ugg-ly. All in all, if you are trying to be fashion forward, Uggs will send you fashion backward about thirty-seven steps. I'm all for the minimalist approach Ugg designers have taken with their product: No laces, no buckles, no problems. Uggs, however, seem to surpass minimalism and enter into a world of blandness. Ok fine, shoe tying and fastening take precious time away from tweeting, online shopping, and Facebook stalking, but I would rather lace up a good pair of boots than slip into a pair of Uggs any day. Uggs are bulky, unflattering, and unfashionable. What other popular product shares these qualities? A Snuggie. And I have yet to see someone slip on their favorite Snug - gie and head out for a night on the town. So maybe you're not a fashion guru. Maybe you con - stantly wonder who Victoria is and why her Secret is so damn important to all of your friends. Y ou have also been known to say, \"Life isn't a fashion show!\" in stressful situ - ations. Even so, I do not recommend Uggs in addition to your preexisting fashion flops. Beyond their superficial flaws, Uggs do not fit the Vermont lifestyle. First and foremost, do not be distracted by the com - fort of dead sheep around your toes; Uggs lack any other sort of practicality. Without waterproof technology, wearing Uggs in precipitation of any kind is about as logical as using the af - ghan your great-aunt knitted for you as an umbrella. Though these non-vegan foot casings may be enticingly warm, they're only ideal on cold days when rain puddles, slush puddles, and snow mounds are nonexistent. That means, by Vermont standards, Uggs are suitable to wear one, maybe two days in mid-November. Terrible traction adds to the list of undesirable Ugg qualities. If you, an active Vermonter, plan on hiking in Uggs, you should also plan on falling off of a cliff. While wearing a material easily shredded by a Bichon Fris\u00e9 pup -py, don't plan on protecting your toes much either. Even in non-hiking situations, Uggs may become hazardous, pos - ing a threat to one's safety and dignity. For example: While hurrying to class one icy day in my Ugg footwear, I practi - cally skated across a busy crosswalk while falling on my ass with cars whizzing inches past me\u2014think clown slipping on a banana peel meets Spike TV's 1,000 Ways to Die. gby stacey brandt by ben berrick\"if you've ever worn or seen this deplorable footwear , you know their power to magically transform the petite foot into the foot of a sasquatch .\" mariel brown-fallon Mind Blowing Spinach Pear Salad (Courtesy of Epicurious.com)Ramsay's Scrambled Eggs (Courtesy of Gordon Ramsay) Ingredients: -3 eggs -\"generous pat of butter\" (no more than a tablespoon-ain't nobody got time for that) -\u00bd tablespoon cream fraiche (sour cream will work in a pinch too, you hillbilly) -salt/pepper -fresh chives (because all college students totally have this at their disposal) Directions: -Get a burner nice and hot. -Crack the eggs into a saucepan or small skillet\u2014COOL YOUR JETS, ACE, AND DON'T SCRAMBLE YET\u2014add pat of butter. -Place pan on burner: Now scramble the dickens out of everything\u2014DON'T YOU STOP STIRRING. -When the egg/butter mixture begins to thicken, remove from heat, keep stirring, and season with salt and/or pep - per. -Return to heat.

Across the street, the orange hand flashed, telling him not to cross. The rain poured down relentlessly, soaking everything it touched, including me, standing across the sidewalk from this man. Dark clouds rolled in, threatening me to get off the streets. The traffic flowed rapidly, creating a dull whooshing sound as the rain fell heavily on the cars. He stood there, unfazed, his long hair flattened against his head. His body was slender, defined by a white V-neck shirt and a black vest, and his shiny boots glis - tened in the rain. In one arm, he held a guitar case, clearly worn and well loved. It spoke words, told travels of the man, travels that he could never express himself. Water streamed down his face, running through his trimmed beard and dripping off his chin down onto his shirt. In one hand, he twirled a guitar pick between his fingers, caressing each side carefully. He possessed the aura of a man who had made many mistakes in life, but ones he had never re - gretted. He learned and traveled and spoke through his music. I felt as though I could hear his song now. He placed the fedora in his hand upon his head and the water was directed off the front of the hat. I gravitated toward him, beckoned by his vibe of experi - ence. I longed to touch him, to feel the warmth radiate from his soaked skin. I ran toward him, rain drenching me entirely as I flung my um - brella aside. The orange hand said no, but my heart said yes. This is what I needed. He could take me away from all the hardships if only just for a moment. He could teach me and we' d hide away in our own little world for eternity. I saw him for one more moment and then he disappeared into the crowd, following the others directed by the little white man glowing on the screen. He was gone, and I was left standing there in the middle of the intersection, nearly to the other side where he had stood only seconds before. I could now hear the cars beeping at me and saw the bright headlights glowing in the gray abyss. My heart sunk deep into my chest. I felt the water seep into my clothes. I stood there, turning round and round, looking up to the sky. Rain drops tapped me on the head. Lights glowed all around me. I closed my eyes. What now? In the short amount of time I stood there, I felt protected, contented. Nothing was wrong in the world. And like every - thing else, it didn't last long. A man came and grabbed me by the waist, pulling me out of the road. My feet shuffled up onto the sidewalk and I walked over to the traf - fic light post. Water drops clung to my lips, just resting there. I licked them off my bottom lip, tasting the pureness they pos - sessed. I leaned against the pole and slowly slid down to the ground into a puddle be - low. My fingers touched the water, absorb - ing the cool feeling, the numbness. They seemed detached. I could sense them touch something else, something that was not wa - ter. I picked it up and turned it over in my hand, rubbing the smooth edges. As I did, I felt a warm sensation crawl through my fingers and up my arm. It was a hard plastic in my hands. It was a guitar pick.

Y ou mixed in bittersweet dark chocolate and blue - berries, careful not to let the tiny fruits burst. In the gray, dispersed light of Sunday morning, they tasted like an undeserved apology. All day I had a feeling of restlessness, torn between the simultaneous desires to put you in the car and to beg you not to go. The forecast called for snow, and I was worried you would hit the storm if you left too late. Still, we took our time, letting the hour of your departure arrive with measured emptiness and slowness. I knew when you left we would never speak of this again, but I did not know what the contours of our friendship would now be. Y ou remained a perfect gentleman as you allowed me to break your heart. In the few moments after you left, I stood in the silence of my kitchen, and 3:00 in the afternoon suddenly felt like the darkest hour of the night. The air was thin, as if your vacancy had swept through the house and taken all its warmth and weight. In the following days, I wondered how you were and how we would be. The next few times we spoke, we grew more comfortable, and soon it was no longer possible or appropriate to address it. In my selfishness, I was grateful and relieved to have your friendship and to have the incident conveniently forgotten, or at least mutually unac - knowledged. I did not forget, however, your eyes looking down as you swirled your cup of tea. Or your voice, small but purposeful, as you told me you expected nothing in return. Or your face, because you saw mine, when he called to ask where you were, and you answered you were with me. Now, months later, instead of this letter, I have sent you a water-stained postcard. Its neutral blue ink runs around the edges, searching for a pulse in a thin network of veins.

I'm about to graduate, but between me and that piece of paper that'll barely qualify me to work in a Starbucks (Y ay English/Film double major!) is a mountain of work. I've got one sixty-page screenplay, one 110-page screen - play, a ten-page film paper, and an astronomy final that I can only assume is to me what the Expendables are to small fictional Hispanic islands. I'm one day of un-productivity away from collapsing and holding myself in the fetal posi - tion until someone realizes they haven't seen me in a week. These are the songs that are talking me off the prover - bial ledge; they take me back to high school and remind me that as bad as I have it, at least I'm not a 30-year-old with a sleeve tattoo crying into a microphone about a girl that broke my heart (yet. Does it pay well?). Songs like these help me feel 15 again and take the edge off of things like final exams, final papers, and a week with my family taking pictures of me wearing a graduation cap and gown (read: dress). \"Cute Without the 'e' (Cut From the Team)\" by Tak - ing Back Sunday - Like many, I was bit by the emo bug pretty hard ages 14 to ... well, now. Cute without the E is the emo movement distilled into three and a half minutes. One minute it's angry, the next it's devastated, then vengeful, lather, rinse, repeat. There's still no more wonderful song to scream at the top of my lungs on the six-minute stretch of highway from here to Williston for a Best Buy run. \"This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)\" by Talking Heads - David Byrne is a musical fucking genius. There. I said it. There's no chorus really, just a series of lyrics that convey a general feeling, a longing for something cohesive and tangible at the end of a gauntlet made of superficiality and false promises. It's gorgeous writing, gorgeous sing - ing, and the instrumentals on this track are so understated and subtle. Every time I hear this song my ears have a little orgasm. The live \"Stop Making Sense\" one is even better, somehow. That's like my ears having two little orgasms. \"Such Great Heights\" by The Postal Service - While never as prolific as his main squeeze, Death Cab for Cutie, I' d stand this one-off album ( Give Up ) against all of Death Cab's, save for Transatlantcism . Ben Gibbard is a master lyricist, making rhymes you never would've thought of but doing so in a way that never sacrifices quality of the narra - tive he's telling nor the flow of the song. It's precision with words complimented so well by the electronic music back - ing it up. Every song on this album is amazing, but \"Such Great Heights\" was the only song I listened to for about two months in 2004. \" A Favor House Atlantic\" by Coheed & Cambria - This song is nucking futs. It's part of a grander epic sci-fi love story space opera thing, that the band decided would be told over a series of albums, but this song stands on its own the best. It's loud, the wookie-looking lead singer sings incredibly high pitch, but never annoyingly so. \"Good eye, sniper/now I shoot/and you run\" . The lyrics are non-sensi - cal but they jazz me up when I get those 3AM blues in the cyber cafe after the 40 of PBR I didn't bring goes dry. \"Hurricane\" by Something Corporate - I'm hard pressed right now to think of a song more cheesy that isn't sung by someone whose name rhymes with \"bailer thrift\" . The rhymes are childishly simple, the conceit of the vers - es are meteorological phenomenas, and overall it's hard to think of as anything more than \"high school tripe\" at this point. But there was a time when that cute blue-eyed, curly-haired girl in my spanish class gave me butterflies and every batt of her eyelashes was something for me to read into.
