Picture on front cover : SARS -CoV-2 neurodissemination in the transgenic humanized K18hACE2 mouse brain at the level of the Devin Kenney Picture on back cover: Post-primary tuberculosis in the but susceptible -doc: Shivraj Yabaji National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories - 1 September 1, 2022 Letter from the Director We are in the latter half of the third year of the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic. Last year, as I wrote this letter, we were in the midst of the emergence of the SARS -CoV -2 \"delta\" variant, and now we face yet another variant evolution, the \"omicron\" variant(s ). Each variant that emerges becomes dominant because it is more infectious than those that appeared before. While hospitalizations and death from COVID -19 continue, vaccines (or prior COVID infections) have largely blunted the high incidence of severe dis ease evident in the first waves of the pandemic. COVID exhaustion is evidenced by a largely unmasked population which has tried to return to pre -COVID ways of life. Yet, almost 6.5 million lives have been lost, with over 1 million of those in the US, evide nce of the tragedy that has unfolded during the pandemic. The number of people who have been infected continues to increase. How long immunity to infection will last is unknown, nor is it known how many more variants this virus can evolve, but we will like ly be contending with the SARS -CoV -2 virus for the rest of our lives. We are fortunate to have one of our accomplished physicians, Nahid Bhadelia, NEIDL investigator and the founding director of CEID (the Center for Emerging Infectious Disease Research and Policy), serving in the White House as a senior policy advisor for global COVID response. COVID -19 is not the only emerging infectious disease we have to contend with. Monkeypox, a disease largely unknown outside of 7 countries in central and western Af rica where it is endemic has now spread widely outside of Africa. Infections have increased in Africa over the past several years and there have been warnings about its ability to emerge elsewhere that have been largely ignored. It has now spread to more t han 80 countries with over 41,000 cases, including over 14,100 in the US. We have new generation vaccines to smallpox which are highly likely to be effective against monkeypox, but the available doses are not sufficient for this unexpectedly large outbreak . Polio outbreaks are also feared to be on the horizon in New York and in London. While both monkeypox and polio can spread \"under the radar\" and take hold rapidly, we do have the tools to diagnose, vaccinate high risk members of the population, and contai n the outbreaks. Nevertheless, these latest outbreaks emphasize how important it is to invest in our public health systems, and pay attention to warning signs that have not been heeded. We are fortunate to have a cadre of investigators with diverse pathog en expertise in the NEIDL, capable of studying these pathogens, including those with experience with the poxviruses (Connor) and Picornaviruses, of which polio is a member (Saeed). However, there remain many pathogens we know exist for which we have few to ols to combat, leaving those of us in the research space plenty to do. We are also reminded often that there remain many pathogens capable of infecting humans still undiscovered in nature. Just this month, a newly described virus, named Langya Henipavirus, and likely of animal origin, has been associated with the infection of several dozen humans, causing febrile disease as well as more severe symptoms. The Henipavirus genus includes Nipah virus, a virus that causes severe disease in humans with a very hig h case fatality rate. Nipah virus is a high priority virus for study and is considered one that has high pandemic potential (the virus outbreak in the 2011 movie \"Contagion\" was modeled after Nipah virus. Several investigators in the NEIDL have the experti se to study this virus, have been planning and seeking funding to study it, and are now working on various aspects of this virus, from understanding its replication and testing potential vaccines and therapeutics (Griffiths, Fearns, M\u00fchlberger and colleagu es). These investigators will bring many of the lessons learned from studies initiated during the COVID -19 pandemic to accelerate research on this virus. In addition to these viruses, NEIDL researchers continue to study many other pathogens of importance to human health. These include a number of filoviruses, including Ebola virus, Sudan virus, Marburg virus, and the more recently discovered Lloviu virus isolated from bats in Europe (M\u00fchlberger, Griffiths, Davey, Hume). Of course, we continue to study SARS -CoV -2, not only to understand the complexity of the virus, but to develop and test therapeutics and next generation vaccine candidates. Our faculty also have been developing animal models to study the disease caused by the virus (Griffiths, Davey, Honko, and Douam) as well as study \"long COVID\", the plethora of symptoms that can persist for months or longer in patients who have recovered from COVID -19. These studies have benefited from our accomplished expert in the use of telemetry to interrogate disease processes (Honko) as well as our Veterinary Pathologist (Crossland) and his team. We also continue to study diseases that largely impact the very young, like 2 - FY22 Annual Report Respiratory Syncytial Virus (Fearns) and Enterovirus D68 (Saeed), as well as one of the most \"succ essful\" pathogens on earth, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Kramnik). We are also fortunate to have been selected for the BU Provost's Basic Life Sciences joint hiring initiative, resulting in the recruitment of a new NEIDL investigator who will join September 1, 2022, Dr. Adriana Tomic. Dr. Tomic will join Boston University as an Assistant Professor of Microbiology and Biomedical Engineering. She is an accomplished immunologist who uses machine learning/artificial intelligence to interrogate human responses t o pathogens and vaccines, using influenza virus vaccines as one model system. As I have noted before, we cannot do the science without our entire team of professionals who are dedicated to our overall success. Everyone has to work together - not only the scientific staff and trainees, but also our biosecurity team, facility engineers and mechanics, environmental health and safety professionals, and our information technology staff. None of the science could be done without this group of talented staff. Act ivities carried out by these groups are highlighted in this report. At the same time, we have continued to keep the community informed of the work that we are doing through the efforts of our community relations team, led by Valeda Britton. This team also spearheaded a number of activities to educate the young professionals of the future, and some of these have been highlighted as well. Ronald B. Corley, Ph.D. Professor of Microbiology Director, National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories - 3 Mission Statement The Boston University National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL) mission is to generate and translate fundamental knowledge on high priority emerging infectious diseases for the benefit of the public health, locally, nationally, and globall y. Emerging infectious diseases are defined as those that have newly appeared and been recognized in the population or have existed but are rapidly increasing in incidence or in geographic range. To meet our missions the NEIDL will: 1. Perform innovative basic, translational, and clinical research on emerging infectious diseases, especially those NIH/NIAID identifies as high Priority Category A, B, and C pathogens, in order to develop diagnostic tests, treatments and vaccines to promote the public's healt h. 2. Provide education and training in these areas of research, in order to develop the next generation of scientists in this field, and to support a national response in the event of a biodefense emergency. 3. Establish a research facility with the high est attention to community and laboratory safety and security. Strategic Goals To successfully fulfill its mission, NEIDL has developed and is implementing a strategic plan to: i. Partner with academic departments across the university to recruit a cad re of investigators, as well as to develop research staff with expertise in the scientific disciplines required to investigate the pathogenesis of emerging infectious diseases caused by category A, B and C agents. We encourage and support the development o f national and international research collaborations in order to carry out our mission. ii. Develop physiologically relevant models for the comparative study of these pathogens, mimicking as closely as possible the human disease process. Not only does thi s require that we recruit faculty with expertise in animal modeling and veterinarian pathology, but also develop the needed services to support these investigations. iii. Move promising basic research as rapidly as possible to translational, preclinical, and clinical research in animals and humans in partnership with appropriate collaborators. iv. Create and establish the methodologies needed to advance the development and testing of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics for these agents. v. Train scientists and related support personnel in the requirements to perform maximum containment research in a safe and secure environment. vi. Maintain the flexibility needed to support a national response in the event of a biodefense emergency. vii. Ensure a \"safety first\" environment for the conduct of all activities in the NEIDL 4 - FY22 Annual Report NEIDL by the Numbers 14 Core Faculty 7 Affiliate Faculty 14 Postdocs 22 Graduate Students 6 Undergraduate Students 4 Visiting Scientists 3 Research Scientists 18 Research Lab Support Staff 19 Animal Science support Staff 55 Operations staff 6 Administrati ve staff 73 Funded Sponsored Projects 114 Total Publications 33 co -authored by multiple NEIDL faculty 50 by Core Faculty 23 by Affiliate Faculty Total amount funded $38 M illion 86 trained staff at BSL -3 16 trained in FY22 63 trained staff at BSL -4 18 trained in FY22 National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories - 5 Featured Research COVID -19 Why Do Some People Get Sicker than Others from COVID? New study of virus in the lung suggests 11 \"protection -defining genes\" may help many avoid worst symptoms Original article from The Brink by Andrew Thurston & Jackie Ricciardi . April 29, 2022 COVID -19 vaccines have saved at least a million lives in the United States alone, but for many people, a lingering fear remains: if \u2014or when \u2014they get hit by the coronavirus, just how bad will it be? Will they breeze through with l ittle more than a sore throat \u2014or will it saddle them with long -term complications, perhaps even push them to the brink of death? Since SARS -CoV -2 first began storming around the world in early 2020, COVID -19 has claimed six million lives and counting, acco rding to the World Health Organization. And yet, the vast majority of people who've contracted COVID \u2014some 99 percent of the more than 500 million confirmed cases \u2014have survived their brush with the disease. So, why is it that some people are so badly affect ed by COVID when many are barely scratched by it? Age and other health conditions increase the risk of getting really sick, but a new study suggests that those who escape the worst symptoms might also have the right balance of a type of immune cells called macrophages. White blood cells found in every tissue, macrophages \u2014part of a group of cells called myeloid cells, the guards of the immune system \u2014are healers. They're crucial in wound repair, streaming to an injury to help the body patch itself up. They al so take on invaders, gobbling up and digesting anything that looks like it doesn't belong in the body, from dead cells to harmful bacteria. That attack mode helps keep us healthy, but it also seems to be a factor in severe COVID -19 cases. Evidence has been growing that many COVID deaths are caused by a hyper -immune response : rampaging Florian Douam (left), a BU School of Medicine assistant professor of microbiology, and Devin Kenney, a PhD student in Douam's lab, say their findings could propel the development of drugs that better prime immune systems for taking on the coronavirus. 6 - FY22 Annual Report macrophages attacking not just the virus, but also our bodies, causing excessive inflammation and damaging heart and lung tissue. In a study published in Cell Reports , a team of researchers at Boston University's National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL) and Princeton University looked at why that was happening, examining COVID's impact on those who get dangerously sick \u2014and those who don't. By studying lungs th at seem to easily deflect SARS -CoV -2 or quickly bounce back from infection, they found a set of genes that determine whether immune cells mount a solid defense \u2014or turn rogue and land someone on a ventilator. The findings could help efforts to develop new d rugs that better prime immune systems for taking on the virus. \"If you can understand why most people are protected against COVID and how their body protects them, then you could potentially harness this knowledge to de velop therapeutics and other advances,\" says Florian Douam , a BU School of Medicine assistant professor of microbiology who co -led the study. Why Are Some Lungs Protected against COVID? After two years of sickness and swabbing, a lot of scientists know about how SARS -CoV -2 is transmitted and how our bodies react when we get it \u2014but there's also a lot they don't understand. Take the lungs: We know COVID -19 can leave lungs full of liquid and inflamed, sometimes scarred by sepsis. But most of what's known about COVID in the lungs is driven by samples taken from those who died from the disease \u2014not those who lived through it. \"You can only access the lung when the patient dies,\" says Douam, who' s based at NEIDL. \"You cannot obviously get someone who had a mild disease and tell them, 'Oh, give me your lung.' In contrast to lung autopsy samples from diseased patients, the lungs from milder or asymptomatic patients are just much harder to access. Wh en you have the diseased lung, you get a snapshot of the end -stage disease.\" To get around this challenge, Douam and the research team developed a new model \u2014a mouse engrafted with human lung tissue and bolstered with a human immune system derived from stem cells\u2014for monitoring the different stages of SARS -CoV -2 infection and COVID -19 disease. Douam says that mice with human lung tissue, but without the human immune system, don't react well to infection \u2014the lung tissues are damaged in a similar way to people with a severe case of the disease. But when they studied mice that also had a humanized immune system, it was different. \"We were barely seeing any virus in the lungs,\" he says. \"The lung was protected. Then we asked the question, 'Why is the lung protect ed?' And this is where we found the macrophages.\" \"Protection -Defining Genes\" According to Devin Kenney, a PhD student in Douam's lab and lead author on the latest paper, one signature of lungs that were more severely impacted by COVID was a lack of macrophage diversity. They were dominated by a pro - inflammatory macrophage \u2014the cells that usually respond to viruses and bacteria \u2014called M1. \"It seems they drive this hyper -inflammatory response,\" says Kenney (MED'27), \"and it leads to a more severe diseas e state.\" By contrast, those immune systems that mixed in more of the cells that typically help in wound repair \u2014M2 or regulatory macrophages \u2014fared better. Douam (right) and Kenney (left) studied lungs that seem to easily deflect or recover from SARS -CoV-2 in order to better understand why most people survive COVID. Douam says the work they are \"doing here is really upstream\" and could lay the foundation for future immunotherapy strategies. National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories - 7 \"If you have a more diverse macrophage population that has both regulatory and inflammatory macrophag es, you can more effectively regulate the signals driving antiviral responses, shutting them off when appropriate,\" he says. \"Then, the immune system can clear the virus really rapidly, protect the tissue.\" The researchers tied this positive antiviral res ponse to a set of 11 genes they called \"protection -defining genes.\" In cases of effective resistance, these genes were working harder, or what's known as upregulated. \"We now know not only that macrophages can promote protection in the lung tissue,\" says D ouam. \"We also know the key set of genes that these macrophages need to express to protect the lung.\" What they don't know yet is why some people can put a diverse mix of macrophages to work while others can't. That's a target for future studies. \"What we're doing here is really upstream,\" says Douam. \"If you can generate knowledge and better understand the molecular processes driving lung protection from COVID -19, then once you get this really good comprehensive picture of what's happening, you can start designing potential immunotherapy strateg ies.\" And that's the end goal of this work. Knowing that some genes are critical in the COVID fight gives potential fresh targets for drugs. With new coronavirus variants springing up and taking root at a rapid rate, says Douam, it's important that scienti sts find alternatives to medications that target the virus itself. \"The virus, over time, can start escaping these types of drugs,\" he says. \"It's not the virus itself that makes you criticall y ill, it's an overreaction of the immune system.\" Finding drugs that help patients have a more balanced immune response could \"complement the antiviral strategy.\" This work was mainly supported by a Boston University start -up fund, a Peter Paul Career Development Professorship, and the National Institutes of Health. O ther researchers involved in leading the study include John H. Connor, a MED associate professor of microbiology, Nicholas Crossland, a MED assistant professor of pathology and laboratory medicine, and Andrew Emili, a College of Arts & Sciences professor of biology and biochemistry, as well as Alexander Ploss, an associate professor of molecular biology at Princeton University.

Original interview from This Week in Virology (TWIV) by Vincent Racaniello, Rich Condit, Kathy Spindler, an faculty members Elke M\u00fchlberger and Adam Hume joined the cast of This Week in Virology (TWiV) to discuss their work on Lloviu virus, a newly discovered member of the filovirus family which includes highly pathogenic viruses such as Ebola and Marburg virus. They discuss their research generating recombinant Lloviu virus as a tool to study this European filovirus which had not been previously cultured. They were also joined by G\u00e1bor Kemenesi, a collaborator from the University of P\u00e9cs (Hungary), who was able to use innovative field techniques to sequence and recently isolate Lloviu virus from Schreiber's bats in Hungary . Together, they talk about the discovery of this virus as well as explore its ecology (in formed by G\u00e1bor's work) and describe the work of Drs. M\u00fchlberger and Hume examining factors that may be involved in potential virus spillover to humans as well as what pathogenic threat the virus may pose to human s.

April 4, 2022 It's an unwanted ritual of summer: vainly splatting at mosquitoes as they nibble your exposed legs and arms, then enduring days of irritated itching from inflamed bites. For most Americans, it's just an annoyance, but for many around the world, those bites can be deadly. Globally, 400,000 people die from malaria every year, another 40,000 from dengue \u2014both diseases are primarily transmitted by mosquitoes . At Boston University's National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL) , researchers are looki ng at ways to halt mosquito -borne viruses \u2014known as arboviruses \u2014by studying the role of mosquito saliva proteins in facilitating disease transmission. They're especially interested in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes \u2014sometimes called the yellow fever mosquito \u2014which is typically found in tropical and subtropical climates. This disease -carrying insect is now finding a home across much of the southern United States , and is expected to fly even farther north as the climate warms, potentially becoming a regular nuisance in New England and Canada by 2100. At NEIDL, up to 2,000 mosquitoes are held in an Arthropod Containment Level 3 (ACL -3) insectary, with researchers having to make their way through a series of containment barriers to get to their lab to study the insects. Infected mosquitoes are locked in double cages, while mesh and plastic cover every lab entrance \u2014researchers also keep bug zappers on hand as an added precaution. The biosafety measures allow the researchers \u2014suited in Tyvek lab coats and N95 respirators \u2014to by Aedes aegypti like chikungunya, dengue, West Nile, yellow fever, and Zika. National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories - 9 \"Without specific medication to treat arbovirus infection \u2014and the only effective arboviral vaccine is the yellow fever vaccine developed in 1 937\u2014the prevention of arboviral transmission is limited,\" says Fabiana Feitosa a NEIDL senior research scientist and ACL -3 insectary manager. If we can better understand \"the mechanism in which mosquito saliva interacts with arbovirus during tr ansmission to the host,\" she says, it may give antivirals and vaccines something new to target: take down the saliva, stop the spread. \"I hope that finding new mosquito saliva proteins with prophylactic potential will contribute tremendously to the control of arbovirus diseases in humans.\" Watch the video inside the insectary to see how the researchers are learning more about mosquitoes and the diseases they carry. This research is supported by the National Ins titutes of Health and NEIDL. Feitosa -Suntheimer is the lead researcher on the project; Florian Douam, a BU School of Medicine assistant professor of microbiology, is a coinvestigator. Study explores molecular mechanisms underlying SARS -CoV-2 infection of macrophages and the induction of pro -inflammatory cytokines Original article from Medical Science News , by Neha Mathur, April 1, 2022 In a recent study posted to the bioRxiv* pre -print serve r, researchers examined the facilitating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) infection of angiotensin -converting enzyme and -inflammatory cytokine The monocytes and macrophages, including tissue -resident alveolar macrophages, have not been directly associated with productive SARS -CoV -2 infection as they do not express ACE2; however, studies have reported the presence of SARS - CoV -2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) and antigen in these cells. The aberrant activation of these cells in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) robustly induces interferon - stimulated gene (IS G) expression and high levels of pro -inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 6 (IL -6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and IL -1, all potential drivers of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Studies on post -mortem tissues from deceased COVID -19 patients have shown tissue -resident alveolar macrophages and inflammatory myeloid cell populations enriched with SARS -CoV -2 RNA. However, studies have barely investigated whether SARS -CoV -2 can establish a productive infection in monocytes and macrophag es and the molecular mechanisms contributing to the myeloid cell -intrinsic hyperinflammatory phenotype. Some recent reports demonstrated that dendritic cell (DC) -mediated SARS -CoV -2 trans infection of ACE2+ epithelial cells was facilitated by CD169 as it b inds to highly sialylated SARS -CoV -2 spike (S) protein. 10 - FY22 Annual Report About the study In the present study, researchers showed that CD169 binds to the SARS -CoV -2 S and mediates SARS -CoV -2 entry into macrophages even in the absence of ACE2, leading to restricted cytosoli c expression of viral genomic and sub -genomic (sg) RNA. They used two different human macrophage models, phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate of human AB -serum and macrophage colony -stimulating factor (M - CSF) for six days to obtain differentiated primary MDMs, with ACE2 expression under the detection limit. They infected these cells with a SARS -CoV-2 S-pseudotyped lentivirus. Further, they ACE2 with recombinant SARS -CoV -2 S protein and used flow cytometry (FC) to observe the relative S binding. Study findings The FC analysis showed a significantly reduced S binding in THP1/CD169 -R116A cells, indicating that CD169 recognizes the sialylated S protein. Co -expression of the CD169 and ACE2 in THP1 cells enhanced S -pseudotyped lentiviral infection by greater than 11 -fold and three -fold compared to cells only expressing CD169 or ACE2, respectively, suggesting a cooperative binding of CD169 and ACE2 to SARS -CoV -2 S. Furthermore, these results reinforced that the CD169 -S interaction alone is enough to promote SARS -CoV -2 entry and fusion in macrophages in an ACE2 -independent manner. The authors observed a marked attenuation in the S -pseudotyped lentiviral infection in CD169+ macrophages upon treatment with the N -terminal domain (NTD) -targeting antibodies, suggesting that the CD169 -S interaction facilitates SARS -CoV -2 entry in a manner distinct from ACE2. Accordingly, the results have implications for antibody treatment for COVID -19 patients, as current therapies primarily focus on the receptor -binding domain (RBD) -targeting antibodies. However, the inflammatory signature. In THP1/PMA macrophages, uthors observed that the CD169 -mediated SARS -CoV -2 entry was as effective as that mediated by ACE2. Consequently, there were no significant differences in the guide RNA (gRNA) levels at early times (up to six hours post -infection (hpi)) between CD169+, ACE 2+ or CD169+/ACE2+ THP1/PMA macrophages, suggesting the absence of any restrictions to the initial steps of SARS -CoV -2 replication, such as attachment and fusion, in CD169+ THP1/PMA macrophages. SARS -CoV -2 RNA synthesis occurs reticu lum (ER) -derived double -membrane vesicles (DMVs). The authors observed fewer double RNA (dsRNA) in the SARS -CoV -2 S-pseudotyped lentivirus - infected CD169+ macrophages, likely reflecting the selective impairment of the formation of DMVs and in turn SARS - CoV -2 RNA. However, upon restoring the ACE2 expression in the THP -1/PMA and primary MDMs, they started infectious SARS -CoV -2 production, suggesting that the macrophages were permissive to viral replication in an ACE2 - dependent manner. Interestingly, clinical treatment with remdesivir (RDV) blocked de novo SARS -CoV -2 RNA expression and significantly reduced the pro -inflammatory cytokine expression in non -productively infected CD169+ macrophages. This finding suggested that the newly synthesized SARS -CoV-2 RNAs viz., negative sense gRNA, dsRNA, and sgRNAs are key drivers of innate immune activations in the macrophages, not the S protein interaction with ACE2. This discovery presents a novel therapeutic strategy for combating hyper inflammation in COVID -19 patients. Conclusions Although CD169 facilitated SARS -CoV -2 entry in the macrophages and monocytes in an ACE -2 independent manner and enhanced the kinetics of SARS -CoV -2 replication and magnitude of infection even during the ACE2 -mediated entry, its mol ecular mechanism remains unclear. Nevertheless, the study highlighted a post -entry role of ACE2 in the SARS - CoV -2 life cycle in the macrophages. Future studies should further explore the ACE2 -independent CD169 -mediated mechanism of SARS -CoV -2 entry in the macrophages resulting in the hyperactivated immune response during SARS -CoV -2 infection for providing insights into the molecular -level post -entry restrictions on viral replication and the viral determinants that trigger the innate immune activation.

Those infected by SARS -CoV -2 stand out by appearing much brighter. What happens in our respiratory tract once COVID -19 invades? A three -dimensional airway model, made from patient - derived stem cells, could provide answers about the initial stages of infection. The model not only replicates the infection process, but can be used to test potential antiviral drugs. Ruby Wang, MD, attending physician in Boston Children's Division of Pulmonary Medicine, led the research in collaboration with the Center for Regenerative Medicine of Boston Universi ty (BU) and Boston Medical Center and BU's National Emerging Infectious Disease Laboratories (NEIDL). \"Human primary bronchial cells are the gold standard for studying lower respiratory infections,\" says Wang. \"But the value of our model is that it doesn't require getting tissue from patients' airways, an invasive procedure. Our platform provides an inexhaustible supply of cells for modeling purposes and produces the relevant airway cell types.\" Derived from patients' cells, a new airway model containing ciliated respiratory endothelial cells recapitulates SARS -CoV-2 infection and can be used to test drugs. Three ciliated cells in this model are infected with the virus. Image: Chantelle Simone Roach, Boston Children's, and Jake La Suer, Boston University 12 - FY22 Annual Report From blood cells to a model airway To build the model, Wang and BU colleagues Finn Hawkins, MB, BCh, and Darrell Kotton, MD, obtained blood cells from two individuals. They first genetically \"reprogrammed\" the cells back to a stem cell state, together with Thorsten Schlaeger, PhD, and George Daley, MD, PhD, fr om Boston Children's Stem Cell Program. They then added factors to get the stem cells to form all the major types of epithelial cells that line the trachea and bronchi. These included multi - ciliated, secretory, and basal cells. The model airway carried the hallmark cell receptor ACE2 as well as TMPRSS2, a key enzyme that aids in viral entry. Using live SARS -CoV -2 in BU's Biosafety Level 3 facility, Wang's group NEIDL Hume, PhD , and Elke Muhlberger, PhD , successfully infected the model a irway. They showed that multi -ciliated airway cells are the initial point of viral entry. \"That's important, because ciliated cells help propel airway mucus and entrapped pathogens up away from the lungs,\" says Wang. \"If the ciliated cells are injured, the virus can more easily get down to the lower lung.\" Modeling SARS -CoV-2 infection, testing treatments Once infected, the model airway mounted a robust antiviral response, producing type 1 and type 3 interferons. The team also saw a marked inflammatory resp onse. They observed increased production of inflammatory signaling molecules and increased expression of genes stimulated by interferon (natural antivirals that rally the immune response), and genes involved in activating immune cells. Because the model ai rway genetically matches the patient from whom it's derived, it enables testing of how specific underlying conditions may affect susceptibility to COVID -19. \"We can also use CRISPR gene editing to see the effects of different genetic mutations,\" says Wang. She, Stuart Rollins, MD, and other members of her lab are currently using stem cells from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients to study how a CF airway responds to SARS -CoV -2 and other pathogens. Perhaps most importantly, scientists can use the model to test pot ential treatments. The team tested the antiviral remdesivir and found a decrease in viral replication. They found the same when they tested camostat mesylate, which inhibits TMPRSS2, confirming that the virus requires TMPRSS2 to infect airway cells. The te am's findings appear in the journal American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology. In the future, Wang plans to use the airway model to study Omicron, Delta, and other new variants and their response to treatments in both healthy patients and those with airway diseases such as CF. RESEARCH THAT MATTERS - NEIDL: RIGHT PLACE, RIGHT TIME Microbiologist Robert Davey 's ongoing novel coronavirus research was boosted with $400,000 through Harvard from the Massachusetts Consortium on Pa thogen Readiness, part of $1.6 million in funding that BU researchers received. Original article from BU Annual Report. January 31, 2022 When news broke that an unknown and dangerous virus had reached US shores and was rapidly spreading, researchers at BU didn't blink. By mid -March 2020, they were already working with live samples of the novel coronavirus at the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL). \"NEIDL was built to be able to study emerging infectious diseases and respond to nation al emergencies,\" says Director Ronald Corley , chair and professor of microbiology at the School of Medicine. \"This pandemic has demonstrated the value of having a facility like NEIDL and all the expertise that we've brought into it.\" Built in 2008, NEIDL i s a state -of-the-art research facility that supports the work of investigators who focus on infectious diseases that are \u2014or have the potential to become \u2014major public health concerns. It is one of only a handful of facilities in the United States that house s biosafety level 2 (BSL -2), BSL -3, and BSL -4 laboratories, which are designed to permit investigators to work safely with these emerging pathogens. NEIDL is owned and operated by Boston University but is also one component of a national network of secure facilities that studies emerging infectious diseases. Since the COVID -19 outbreak, NEIDL scientists dropped nearly every other research project to focus on understanding and combating the novel coronavirus. National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories - 13 BU researchers quickly received $1.6 million in new funding through Harvard from the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness to further advance coronavirus research, from modeling infections in lung organoids to developing better and faster testing to screening thousands of drug compounds in search of new treatments. During the pandemic, global vaccine development focused heavily on activating immune cells \u2014B cells \u2014which are responsible for creating antibodies. But with the mutatin g variants, NEIDL researchers are now looking at other ways human cells activate the immune system in response to SARS -CoV -2 infection, specifically T cells, considered the body's killers as they are sent out to destroy infected cells. Along with colleague s from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, BU researchers have been studying the types of \"red flags\" the human body uses to enlist the help of T cells. Their findings , published in Cell in June 2021, could open the door to even more effective and powe rful vaccines against the coronavirus and its rapidly emerging variants. \"We swung into full action right away because my laboratory had already generated human cell lines that could be readily infected with SARS -CoV -2,\" says Mohsan Saeed , a NEIDL virolog ist and a co -corresponding author of the paper. \"This virus wants to go undetected by the immune system for as long as possible. Once it's noticed by the immune system, it's going to be eliminated, and it doesn't want that.\" Researchers identify a new protein that enables SARS -CoV-2 access into cells Findings may lead to the development of new antiviral therapeutics against COVID -19 Original Article from Science Daily published on January 27, 2022 Summary: Researchers have identified extracellular vimen tin as an attachment factor that facilitates SARS -CoV -2 entry into human cells. Vimentin is a structural protein that is widely expressed in the cells of mesenchymal origin such as endothelial cells and a potential novel target against SARS -CoV -2, which co uld block the infection of the SARS -CoV -2. The entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) into human cells is an essential step for virus transmission and development of COVID 19. Although the lung epithelial cells are its initia l target, SARS -CoV -2 also can infect endothelial cells. Endothelial cells are the major constituents of the vascular system and cardiovascular complication is a hallmark of severe COVID -19. Angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the entry receptor for SARS -CoV -2. However, the possible involvement of other cellular components in the viral entry is not fully understood. A team of researchers from the Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) has identified extracellular vimentin as an attachment factor t hat facilitates SARS -CoV -2 entry into human cells. Vimentin is a structural protein that is widely expressed in the cells of mesenchymal origin such as endothelial cells and a potential novel target against SARS -CoV -2, which could block the infection of th e SARS -CoV -2. \"Severe endothelial injury, vascular thrombosis, and obstruction of alveolar capillaries (tiny air sacs scattered throughout the lungs) are common features of severe COVID -19. Identification of vimentin as a host attachment factor for SARS - CoV-2 can provide new insight into the mechanism of SARS -CoV -2 infection of the vascular system and can lead to the development of novel treatment strategies,\" said corresponding author Nader Rahimi, PhD, associate professor of pathology & laboratory medicin e at BUSM. Microbiologist ROBERT DAVEY 's ongoing novel coronavirus research was boosted with $400,000 through Harvard from the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness, part of $1.6 million in funding that BU re searchers received. 14 - FY22 Annual Report The researchers used liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) and identified vimentin as a protein that binds to the SARS -CoV -2 spike (S) protein and facilitates SARS -CoV -2 infection. They also found that depletion of vimentin s ignificantly reduces SARS -CoV -2 infection of human endothelial cells. In contrast, over - expression of vimentin with ACE2 significantly increased the infection rate. \"More importantly, we saw that the CR3022 antibody inhibited the binding of vimentin with C oV-2-S-protein, and neutralized SARS -CoV -2 entry into human cells,\" included Elke M\u00fchlberger, PhD , Vipul Chitalia, MD, PhD and Catherine E. Costello, PhD. These findings appear online in the Proceedings of the Nati onal Academy of Sciences.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , 2022; 119 (6): e2113874119 DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2113874119 COVID ON Prepared to Detect Omicron \u2014and Other Variants BU's National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL) has been monitoring COVID -19 variants from BU and Boston Medical Center tests since February Original article from The Brink By Kat J. McA lpine. December 8, 2021 When will the coronavirus variant known as Omicron arrive at BU? Although it's hard to predict, it seems like a foregone conclusion that it's only a matter of time given how quickly Omicron has spread around the world \u2014already infecting people in more than 30 countries across 6 continents, and at least 16 US states. On December 4, the first known case of Omicron in Massachusetts was detected in a woman in her 20s who lives in Middlesex County. One thing's for certain \u2014if and when Omicron infects a member of BU's community, its presence will be quickly detected. The University's testing program \u2014which screens a pool of all students, faculty, and staff that come to BU's campuses \u2014hinges upon its Clinical Testing Lab, which was rapidly outfitted with machinery and custom software to screen nasal s wabs for coronavirus over the summer of 2020. Fully operational for the last year and a half, it has screened over two million swabs and is capable of processing up to 6,000 coronavirus tests per day. And for every positive test result that diagnoses a ne w case of COVID -19, that swab is then couriered over to BU's National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL), where scientists perform genomic sequencing to determine the strain of the virus \u2014mostly the Delta variant, since July 2021 \u2014and to detec t whether transmission occurred from sources outside of the BU community or from within. The NEIDL also performs variant sequencing for Boston Medical Center (BMC), BU's primary teaching hospital and the safety -net hospital for the city of Boston. The NEIDL's variant sequencing efforts took off in February 2021, after NEIDL virologist John Connor teamed up with BMC infectious disease clinician Karen Jacobson and other clinical staff to propose a plan for sequencing anonymized positive test results from BU's Clinical Testing Lab, as well as patient samples from BMC's COVID Biorepository and samples from BMC clinicians and staff. NEIDL scientists Jackie Turcinovic (left) and John Connor analyze the genomic sequences of all positive COVID -19 tests that come from BU faculty, staff, and students. Photo by Cydney Scott National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories - 15 Jacobson says the NEIDL's variant sequencing effort is a real example of science that would not be possible without a big team of collaborative scientists, including infectious disease specialist Tara Bouton of BMC and BU School of Medicine (MED), Cassandra Pierre of BMC and MED, and Harvard University epidemiologist William Hanage. \"This is not something that just a few investiga tors could pull off,\" she says. When Delta arrived on the scene at the end of June, \"all of sudden, within the span of two weeks, there was a rapid shift,\" says Jackie Turcinovic, a third year PhD student and one of the primary NEIDL scientists who perform s variant sequencing. Positive results started coming in for sequencing much more rapidly, and case reports indicated Delta was causing more symptomatic than asymptomatic cases. The amount of viral material in each positive sample was also typically much h igher than the lab had seen with other coronavirus variants. \"There was this shift from trying to squeeze out [enough viral material from samples to allow for sequencing] to suddenly seeing samples with tons of virus \u2014it was very odd, almost a little creepy ,\" Turcinovic says. \"The change in presentation and urgency seemed really different.\" According to Judy Platt, BU's chief health officer and executive director of Student Health Services, viral materials from positive test results are analyzed by NEIDL scientists to reveal the unique genetic sequence of the virus, and to match those sequences up with databases cataloging all currently known COVID variants from around the w orld. There are several steps involved in being able to sequence the viral genome, a process which takes several days. Variant sequencing is not considered a clinical diagnostic for individuals. Instead, it's used to study how COVID -19 is spreading and evo lving at the population level. For regulatory reasons, BU is not permitted to tell individuals if they have a variant form of COVID -19\u2014NEIDL scientists are not even aware of which person the sequenced samples came from; they just know the virus sample was collected from someone at BU. \"The most direct thing we've been able to do is see what the pattern of virus spread is,\" says Connor, a BU School of Medicine associate professor of microbiology. \"From the genomes we can get a pretty good idea of whether po sitives at BU are coming from person -to-person spread versus transmission from cases outside of the BU system. If we see two virus genomes that are identical, we know two people were in the same room together.\" That has helped the team understand where mos t cases at BU are coming from and corroborate the findings of BU Healthway's contact tracing team. The contact tracing team is on call 12 hou rs a day, 7 days a week, addressing positive COVID -19 cases as soon as they come up. On a slow week, the contact tracing team might investigate between 50 and 60 cases, a number that can grow to more than 100 during periods after long weekends or holiday b reaks, when more positive cases tend to surface. A contact tracer's day involves just what you would expect: a lot of phone calls and a lot of hard conversations. To date, BU's contact tracing team has discovered that the majority of spread within BU's co mmunity actually occurred off campus, from external sources, rather than from in -class or in -office interactions. That's largely due to the power of vaccines \u2014more than 95 percent of BU faculty, students, and staff are fully vaccinated against COVID \u2014and BU 's community health protocols, which require people, regardless of vaccination status, to wear masks in common spaces shared with others. It's those unmasked interactions \u2014within households, at social gatherings, during travel, or in other settings \u2014that are largely contributing to the vast majority of cases at BU. \"Most true breakthrough cases are linked to clubs, bars, and socializing in crowded, indoor spaces,\" says Hannah Emily Landsberg (Sargent'12, SPH'13), associate director of Student Health Services . \"It does put in perspective your level of risk\u2014if you go to a 10 -person gathering, that's less risky than going to several bars or big parties.\" Third year PhD student Jackie Turcinovic in the Connor Lab.

John Connor 16 - FY22 Annual Report \"Unmasked, prolonged social events can lead to COVID \u2014whether you're vaccinated or not,\" Platt says. With Omic ron spreading around the world, scientists have been racing to understand if the new variant, which has the most mutations ever seen on a coronavirus variant, will be able to evade immunity from vaccination. Preliminary indications are showing that Omicron may cause milder infections than earlier variants, although sc ientists caution that it's too soon to be sure. The emergence of the Delta and now Omicron variants likely foreshadows that the world will continue living amongst the SARS -CoV -2 virus for a long time. \"In Massachusetts, we've been very fortunate that we've had some of the highest rates of vaccine acceptance,\" says Jacobson, who in addition to treating patients at BMC is also a BU School of Medicine associate professor of medicine in the sect ion of infectious diseases. \"But the virus has mutated in ways that [make it] hard to put the genie back in the bottle \u2014the virus is figuring out ways to [mutate] over time. A lot of arrows point toward SARS -CoV -2 becoming an endemic virus [like influenza], one that is much milder and comes around seasonally.\" SCHOOL OF MED ICINE MED's Biology of the Lung Funded through Its 50th \u2014Yes, 50th \u2014Year BU's longest running federally funded training program began in 1975 Excerpt f rom o riginal article BU Today By Joel Brown. September 23, 2021 When the School of Medicine training progra m called Biology of the Lung: A Multidisciplinary Program began, on July 1, 1975, Gerald Ford was president, all four Beatles were alive, and gas cost about 50 cents a gallon. \"I was in elementary school when this started, so I wasn't spending a lot of tim e thinking about lung biology or pulmonary disease or anything else,\" Joseph Mizgerd , now program co -principal investigator, says with a smile. Pulmonary fellow Ellen Suder (MED'26,'26) working in the high containment lab, BSL -4, at BU's National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL). Photo by Cydney Scott National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories - 17 The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has funded Biology of the Lung from the beginning and has just renewed i t for five more years, taking it through years 46 to 50 of training predoctoral and postdoctoral scientists, both PhDs and MDs, in lung biology and pulmonary disease. The $4.1 million renewal will fund stipends and other expenses for a dozen trainees a yea r until 2026. While Biology of the Lung appears to be the longest running grant -funded training program at the University, the scientists who run it would much rather talk about the innovative idea at its core. \"There are certain well -worn, traditional pa ths in training a doctor or a researcher, and this program is not one of those. It's very different,\" says Darrell Kotton, who joined Mizgerd as a co -principal investigator on the grant this summer. Mizgerd , the Jerome S. Brody, MD, Professor of Pulmonary Medicine, is a MED professor of medicine, microbiology, and biochemistry and BU Pulmonary Center director. Kotton , the David C. Seldin Professor of Medicine, is a MED professor of medicine and pathology and founding director of the Center for Regenerative Medicine (CReM). Dr. Mizgerd is a NEIDL faculty member, and both Drs. Mizgerd and Kotton have productive collaborations in the NEIDL. Training doctors and researchers Some fellows have found themselves on the front lines in the pandemic. \"My dissertation research actually focuses on filoviruses \u2014that's Ebola and Marburg,\" says Ellen Suder (MED'26'26), a PhD candidate in microbiology and a program trainee who has been doing a lot of COVID -related work at BU's National Emerging Infectious Disease s Laboratories (NEIDL) high -containment labs. \"Over the past year and a half, I've picked up a lot of research on SARS -CoV -2. It's been a really amazing experience to be involved with all that.\" The NEIDL lab where she works offered virology help to scientists around the Boston area last year as soon as the seriousness and duration of the outbreak became clear. \"We ended up accruing 20 -plus collaborators at a bunch of labs in the Boston area \u2014a lot of BU labs, a lot of other universities, some companies,\" Suder says. \"It was very much an all -hands -on-deck situation. I just started volunteering to take on samples that needed to be generated and things like that. \"The big gest project that our lab did last year was this collaboration with Darryl Kotton's lab at the CReM. We came up with all of these potential drug targets and curated a list of drugs that were either approved for something else entirely or were in clinical t rials, and tested if they would be viable in preventing this infection. What we found out that was really cool was in the cell -type model we normally use they weren't terribly effective at preventing infection, but in the actual stem cell -derived lung cell s, they worked a lot better. \"Now I'm really interested to see what I can do with these lung cell models,\" she says, \"studying the viruses we normally study.\" Ellen Suder preparing to work in the NEIDL high containmen t lab.

These funds are designed to enhance the research activities in the NEIDL. As the NEIDL research programs have evolved and the existing instrumentation has aged, so the way the Director's Research Initiatives have evolved as well. Operational support of the BSL -2 and BSL -3, remains a large expense ( almost $80,000 ), which also involves maintaining the pathogen repository. As instrumentation has aged, and the need for repl acement shared equipment has accelerated, around $160,000 was committed to this. Shared equipment repairs and maintenance ($ 40,000) and contracted services and common supplies ($12, 000) helped support BSL -2 work. Organoid and stem cell work remains a high priority, and almost $30,000 was committed to this function. Other areas included support for the insectary ($8,0 00) and Veterinary Pathology services ($34,00 0), and support for the BSL -4 ($7,000). Finally, support of CEID remains an important strategic ob jective of the NEIDL, and $ 80,000 was committed for this purpose. 32 - FY22 Annual Report Faculty and Staff Recognitio n Conference - Invited Speaker Engagements (National & International) Markus Bosmann Polyphosphates - 'The Forgotten Polymer' as a New Modulator of Inflammation.

Guest editing: \"Latest research in flavivirus vacc ines\" Faculty Promotions Associate Research Professor Adam Hume , PhD During his 12 year tenure at BU, Adam has developed into one of our most passionate virologists focused on improving our understanding of replication and pathogenesis of the highly pathogenic viruses filoviruses. One focus of Dr. Hume's research has been the use of filoviral reverse gene tics systems, including minigenomes and virus rescue systems for Ebola, Reston, and Marburg viruses. Minigenomes allow for the safe study of viral genome replication and transcription at BSL -2 as well as facilitate antiviral drug screening. Dr. Hume lever aged his extensive experience with filoviral minigenome systems to study a lesser -known emerging filovirus called Lloviu. Using Lloviu virus minigenomes, Dr. Hume has attempted to compare its pathogenicity to that of Ebola and Reston Viruses and its zoonot ic potential to cause disease in humans. Another of Adam's particular research interests is studying bat -borne zoonotic viruses and comparing the immune responses of human cells and cells from the bat reservoir species, like the Egyptian fruit bats, the ho st species of Marburg, and the Schreiber's bats, the host species of Lloviu. To study these processes, Dr. Hume has developed many tools, including identifying cross -reacting antibodies and RT -PCR primers, that work with these relatively unstudied species, allowing us to gain our first insights into how these bats respond to these viruses. Dr. Hume demonstrated a strong commitment to establishing BSL -4 research at the NEIDL. As a member of the M\u00fchlberger laboratory, he played a critical role in launching BS L-4 work. He was integrally involved in establishing scientific SOPs for BSL -4 and has become one of our most experienced BSL -4 laboratory trainers and mentors. Dr. Hume's work has been published in prestigious journals, reported on by multiple news sourc es, and presented at national and international scientific meetings. Dr. Hume has a strong publication record, particularly after the NEIDL BSL-4 laboratories became active in August 2018. Since his promotion to Senior Research Scientist in March 2019, he has coauthored 8 publications. Some of the most notable reflected his recent work on SARS -CoV -2 with collaborators in the Center of Regenerative Medicine, published in Cell Stem Cell and Molecular Cell. Other papers have been published or are in review. Dr. Hume has been invited and presented his work at nationally and international events from the beginning of his postdoctoral career at BU. Notably, he presented his work on the Lloviu Virus Minigenome Systems at the Keystone Symposia: Framing the Response to Emerging Virus Infections, which took place in Hong Kong. More recently, he presented his work on SARS -CoV -2 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories. 36 - FY22 Annual Report Education In partnership with the Department of Microbiology and the GMS Immunology Training Program, the NEIDL co - sponsors the Microbial Pathogenesis and Immunology Seminar Series.

This has led us to try different, and creative methods to introduce community members of all ages to the exciting world of science and research. As outlined in more detail below, NEIDL researchers and staff actively participate d in community engagement activities to share their knowledge and expertise. This past spring Dr. Corley hosted the Spring, the 12th Annual NBL/RBL Network Meeting in Boston and opened the facility for in -person guided tours . This in person event , well attended by over 100 network members, was a welcome respite from the pandemic blues. We have an ongoing relationship to bring our scientists and staff to the Match High School in Brookline through our Speaker Series. The \"My Journey To...\" Speaker Series is a career exploration program focused on exposing students to careers they may not be familiar with. Featuring various BU professionals including the NEIDL, the Speaker Series allows for students to engage with experts around college preparedness, job skills, and their personal roadway to their respective careers. The goal is to show studen ts that no two paths are the same, and the road takes hard work, relationship building, and sometimes a bit of luck. As BU opened its doors for the summer session, the NEIDL had its first in -person tour with high school students since the pandemic started . Our female professionals hosted a panel with the Greater Research Opportunities for Girls (GROW ), Followed by a tour of the Sim ulation lab , the suit room and the Animal Science Center . The NEIDL thanks Aditi Colleen Thurman and Jacqueline Turcinov ic for contributing to this program and inspiring the next generation of women scientists. Another group to visit the NEIDL was BU SPH - PopHealthExperience 2022. This year, students came prepare d with in sightful questions. Not only did we discuss careers, but also climate change and government polic y. According to Francisco Patino, Assistant Director of Lifelong Learning at Boston University School of Public Health , the NEIDL continues to be a fav orite piece of the BU SPH - PopHealthExperience program. NEIDL contributors to this year's PophealthExperience program were Anna Tseng, Nafisah Nakhid, and Judy Yen. For the final NEIDL tour of the Summer, we tried a new format. The Summer Training as Res earch Scholars (STaRS) cohort of students at the BU School of Medicine, were placed in small groups and researchers moved from group to group, like \"Research Speed Dating\". This arrangement allowed students to be more comfortable asking questions in a smal ler group. Researchers got to interact directly with students and each student got to ask questions of each researcher. The feedback we received from the cohort was that the tour was very insightful and informative. The NEIDL Research Speed Daters were: Anthony Griffiths, Anna and Jacquelyn Turcinov ic. 38 - FY22 Annual Report Our Faculty in the News COVID -19 BU's Nahid Bhadelia Joins White House COVID -19 Response Team Bhadelia, an infectious diseases physician and global leader in pandemic preparedness, named senior policy advisor for global COVID response Original article from The Brink by Andrew Thurston. June 13, 2022 Nahid Bhadelia , an infectious diseases physician and founder of Boston University's Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases Policy & Research (CEID), has joined the White House COVID - 19 Response Team as senior policy advisor for global COVID response. The team's founding goal was to create a unified national respons e to the pandemic. Nahid Bhadelia , an infectious diseases physician and founder of Boston University's Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases Policy & Research (CEID), has joined the White House COVID -19 Response Team as senior policy advisor for global C OVID response. The team's founding goal was to create a unified national response to the pandemic . A BU School of Medicine associate professor of infectious diseases, Bhadelia is taking a sabbatical for the duration of the full -time position; David Hamer , a BU School of Public Health professor of global health, will serve as interim head of CEID. \"Dr. Bhadelia is widely known as an international expert and leader in highly communicable and emerging infectious diseases,\" says Gloria Waters , BU vice president and associate provost for research. Bhadelia is also an associate director of BU's National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL) and helped launch and develop the Special Pathogens Unit at Boston Medical Center, BU's primary teaching hospital . \"She has extensive clinical, field, academic, and policy experience in pandemic preparedness,\" says Waters. \"Her background in health and human security, international affairs, and her training in infectious disease, coupled with her extensive experience in health system response to emerging infectious diseases \u2014such as Ebola, Zika, and more recently, COVID -19\u2014have provided her with invaluable insights into the underlying challenges to pandemic preparedness.\" Bhadelia brings a broad global health backgroun d to the White House position . She worked in West and East Africa during multiple Ebola virus outbreaks, contributed to pandemic preparedness in Liberia and Uganda, and codirects the BU and University of Liberia Emerging and Epidemic Virus Research Program , which is funded by the Fogarty International Center . She's also a member of the World Health Organization's Technical Advisory Group for Universal Health and Preparedness Review , which is working to improve the metrics used to measure pandemic preparedne ss. Since founding CEID in 2021, Bhadelia has grown it into a hub for research and actionable policies \u2014the center has contributed to congressional hearings, advised legislative offices, prepared policy briefs, and provided input on pandemic preparedness bi lls. That work will continue under Hamer's direction. An infectious diseases specialist, Hamer says Bhadelia has been a leader not just for CEID, but for the rest of the nation during the COVID -19 pandemic. \"Since the beginning of the SARS -CoV -2 pandemic, Nahid has been a dynamic speaker, helping to effectively communicate about all aspects of the pandemic \u2014from epidemiology to vaccination \u2014to colleagues at Boston University and Boston Medical Center, as well as the broader US population,\" he says. \"Her insig ht into the disease, strategies for prevention, including vaccination, and input on policies to mitigate the adverse public health consequences of COVID - 19 in the United States \u2014as well as low - and middle -income countries worldwide \u2014have resulted in national and international recognition of her expertise as an emerging infectious disease specialist.\" National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories - 39 Draft bill would ban CDC, NIH from funding lab research in China House of Representatives measure catalyzed in part by suspicion that pandemic virus escaped fro m Wuhan laboratory Original article from Science by Jocelyn Kaiser. June 12, 2022 A proposal moving through Congress to bar the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from funding research laboratories in China is sparking concern among scientists. If signed into law, the measure could cut off millions of dollars of U.S. funds flowing to collaborative research projects in several areas, including HIV/AIDS, cancer, mental health, and flu surveillance. The proposed ban, part of a 2023 spending bill approved by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations on 30 June, grew out of suspicions among some lawmakers, so far unsupported by evidence, that the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China released the corona virus that started the current pandemic, as well as objections to other potentially risky biomedical experiments involving animals. Specifically, the measure would bar the Department of Health and Human Services (the parent agency of NIH and CDC) from fund ing WIV or \"any other laboratory\" in China, Russia, or any country the U.S. government has designated a foreign adversary, a list that currently includes Iran and North Korea. The measure's sponsor, Representative Chris Stewart (R -UT), says the ban is aimed at ensuring the United States does not fund \"dangerous research\" in \"uncontrolled environments\" overseas. Some scientific organizations are concerned by the proposal's expansive scope. \"It seems a bit extreme,\" says Eva Maciejewski, spokesperson for the Foundation for Biomedical Research, which advocates for animal research. \"In theory it's good to have oversight over biosafety and animal welfare, but in practice there may be better ways than blocking all NIH funding to foreign countries.\" The microbi ology community is also troubled, says Mary Lee Watts, director of federal affairs for the American Society for Microbiology. \"International collaboration is essential to allowing our scientists to ... understand disease threats wherever in the world they ex ist, in order to protect public health,\" Watts says. An NIH spokesperson said the agency does not comment on pending legislation. But Gerald Keusch of Boston University , a former director of the NIH Fogarty International Center, believes \"most of the senio r leadership [of NIH's 27 institutes] will be deeply concerned to have Congress interfering in the review and awarding of grants.\" (It is unusual for lawmakers to adopt such countrywide bans on research funding.) Backing the measure is the White Coat Waste Project, an animal rights group that 2 years ago publicized NIH's funding of WIV. Justin Goodman, the group's senior vice president, says that \"taxpayers shouldn't be forced to fund ... cruel, wasteful, and dangerous animal experiments in hostile countries ... where there's no real transparency and accountability.\" (The proposed measure, however, does not specifically mention animal studies.)The ban's potential impact isn't clear. WIV is largely funded by the Chinese government, and researchers there have rece ived no U.S. funding since NIH, citing compliance issues, suspended a small subcontract for studying bat coronaviruses in July 2021. But NIH supports other research in China, with grants totaling $8.9 million in 2021 and $5.6 million this year, according to federal databases. Projects that do not involve laboratory work \u2014such as a long -running NIH -funded survey on health and retirement in China \u2014could be spared. But many others would likely be vulnerable, including three projects headed by Chinese investigato rs studying influenza and the mosquito -borne diseases dengue and malaria, and dozens of subawards to Chinese groups participating in clinical trials of drugs, studies of the health effects of heavy metals, and neuroscience research. The U.S. leader of one clinical trial in Shanghai \u2014who asked for anonymity \u2014said his Chinese partner is a former trainee and \"close collaborator,\" and it would not be possible to recruit enough patients at a single site in the United States. The Wuhan Institute of Virology in China. A bill moving through Congress would bar U.S. biomedical science agencies from funding researchers at the institute and all other laboratories in China. HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES 40 - FY22 Annual Report The ban would likely have a smaller imp act on research in Russia. NIH and CDC appear to have just two active grants there, and they may already be subject to recent White House guidance winding down U.S. research funding to Russia because of its war against Ukraine. There are no NIH or CDC gran ts to researchers in Iran or North Korea. To become law, the ban would need to survive negotiation of a final bill with the Senate. Some research groups hope lawmakers will remove the provision before any bill goes to President Joe Biden for final approval , likely late this year. After the Infection Is Gone MassCPR experts discuss the knowns and unknowns of long COVID Original article from Harvard Medical School News by Ekaterina Pesheva. June 9, 2022 As the vast majority of the world's population continues to encounter SARS -CoV -2 virus and become infected, one question looms ever larger: What will be the long -term physiological repercussions of having had COVID? Experts from the Harvard Medical School -led Massachusetts Consortium on Path ogen Readiness discuss the emerging science, latest knowledge, and critical unknowns of the novel syndrome known as long COVID. Nahid Bhadelia , founding director, Boston University Center for Emerging Infectious D iseases Policy and Research; associate professor of infectious diseases, Boston University School of Medicine; visiting fellow, the White House Office of Science & Technology Policy; long COVID research group co -lead for MassCPR Bruce Levy , HMS Parker B. Francis Professor of Medicine and division chief of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital; long COVID research group co -lead for MassCPR Linda Sprague Martinez , associate professor, Boston University School of Social Work; co -director, Community Engagement Program, BU Clinical & Translational Science Institute; long COVID research group health disparities lead for MassCPR Jake Lemieux , instructor in medicine, Harvard Medical School, infectious disease specialist at Mass Genera l; viral variants program co-lead for MassCPR Harvard Medicine News: Set the stage for us and give us the big -picture view on long COVID. Bhadelia: First, it is important to keep in mind that aside from long COVID, there are many other post -acute infectious syndromes, so the notion that infections can cause long -term post -acute symptoms is not new. Some of these syndromes develop after viral infections like Ebola, Epstein -Barr, polio, dengue, H1N1 flu, and others, while others develop after infecti on with a bacterial pathogen. We do not understand many of these syndromes, and their scope is not well defined. For many of these, our understanding is limited by research capacity and clinical infrastructure and our ability to capture good, quality data in order to understand the biological phenomena that underpin them. Levy: Long COVID is such a novel entity that even its definitions vary. The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention define it slightly differently, but , broadly speaking, long COVID involves a constellation of symptoms that develop in the aftermath of acute infection \u2014hence the term post -acute sequelae of SARS -CoV -2 infection, or PASC. The WHO says long COVID starts three months from the onset of COVID w ith symptoms, that these symptoms last at least two months and are not explained by alternative diagnoses. The CDC starts the clock earlier, at four weeks after original infection. Important to note, as of July 1, 2o21, post -COVID conditions can be conside red a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act. HMNews: What is the current profile of long COVID in terms of prevalence and symptoms? Levy: Keeping in mind that our knowledge is evolving, and this is a moving target, here's what we know so far. Overall, the current CDC estimate is that one in five adults over the age of 18 may have a condition related to COVID, but the estimate is uncertain. According to the CDC, 13 percent of people diagnosed with COVID meet the definition of long COVID one month after infection, and this number drops to 2.5 percent three months after infection. Elena Fomina/iStock / Getty Images Plus National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories - 41 Among those hospitalized with COVID, more than 30 percent have symptoms suggestive of long COVID six months after infection. Hospitalization does appear to drive ris k for long COVID. It appears the condition is more common in women, with at least 60 percent of long COVID diagnoses occurring among women, but this could also be a factor of who is more likely to seek care. Fatigue is the most prevalent symptom, with two -thirds of patients reporting it as part of their symptom constellation. Yet, there is a very wide variety of symptoms associated with this condition \u2014neurologic, neurocognitive, respiratory, sleep disturbances, mental health, cardiovascular, rheumatologic, digestive, and more. The long -term effect of long COVID remains to be seen over time. Long -term, will long COVID lead to more vascular illness, atherosclerosis, heart failure? These are all questions that remain to be answered. HMNews: How much do we know about what drives the development of long COVID? What is known and unknown about its pathophysiology? Bhadelia: One of the overarching questions in this unfolding mystery is whether these symptoms and conditions are truly caused by COVID itself or are bein g picked up more just because patients are coming to seek care who weren't before their SARS -CoV -2 diagnoses, and their preexisting conditions are coming to attention. It's very difficult to tease apart. If we don't know biological mechanisms are causing p eople to be sick, then it's hard to tease apart what's attributable to the virus itself versus other factors. Another challenge in gleaning answers is the heterogenous nature of studies of long COVID, how differently they are designed, which makes it trick y to compare patient populations across studies. Another complicating factor is that there are many different phenotypes of long COVID, meaning that some people will develop more neurocognitive symptoms, while others more pulmonary symptoms. Underpinning t hese phenotypes are potential clues, none of which are slam dunk, but just different angles through which researchers are approaching figuring out the pathophysiology of long COVID. Some of the hypotheses about what drives long COVID include the presence o f persistent reservoirs of SARS -CoV -2 in the body \u2014we've seen this in other infections: reactivation of other dormant viruses such as Epstein -Barr; the presence of predisposing conditions such as diabetes and obesity; the development of a maladaptive autoim mune response against the body's own tissues; chronic inflammation that fails to go away after the infection; blood vessel inflammation and damage; and direct organ injury from the initial severe disease. In terms of who's at risk: So far, according to CDC data, it looks like the highest risk groups for developing long COVID include those who are not vaccinated, people with medical comorbidities, those with severe initial infections, those who developed multi -system inflammatory syndrome, either adult or pe diatric. Ultimately, we want to know enough to create a uniform understanding of what long COVID is by taking away all the confounding factors. But it is important to note that regardless of the cause, there are many people who are suffering and need care, and we need to address that as a health care system. HMNews: In addition to the science and the research that are so fundamental to understanding long COVID, what are some of the broader health care, policy, and societal implications of long COVID? Spragu e Martinez: Health inequities were pervasive pre -COVID and amplified with the pandemic. Some of the highest infection rates in Massachusetts occurred among immigrant communities, working class residents, and families of color. As in COVID, health equity in long COVID is of paramount concern. People of color will likely be disproportionately impacted by long COVID. Long COVID has the potential to further widen existing gaps in health and getting ahead of it is critical. The MassCPR long COVID research group includes a health equity core of investigators that span disciplines and are embedded at hospitals that conduct clinical trials as part of the NIH Recover Initiative . Our goal is to define the impact of long COVID on diverse communities in Massachusetts an d to identify barriers to proper diagnosis and care of long COVID for those communities. We want to increase both awareness of and access to long COVID treatment both among those communities and the primary care providers serving them. We are also interest ed in influencing relevant policies at the local, state, and national levels. Right now, we are focused on Black and Latinx communities, but plan to expand and engage other people of color and other marginalized groups in the state. Some of the key element s in advancing health equity will involve direct community engagement to increase diversity and representation in clinical trials that study long COVID and support of community health centers and community health workers. Other elements include engaging th e primary care providers to ensure they are getting the latest research and engaging their patients in meaningful conversations that go beyond symptoms to understand the social factors impacting their health and referrals to job retraining programs for pat ients who cannot continue to do their work because of long COVID symptoms. 42 - FY22 Annual Report Also important will be policies related to eviction moratoriums, many of which have sunset, rental assistance, unemployment insurance, and more. Factors that lead and sustain inequi ties are caused by racialized policies that create inequitable living conditions. Tackling inequity will require an understanding of the structural determinants of health. HMNews : Where are we on the treatment front for long COVID? Lemieux: First a word on prevention and minimizing risk: Early data suggest that whatever we can do to limit the severity of acute disease will pay dividends on the other side in limiting the incidence of long COVID. That still needs to be explored further, and some therapies wil l be better than others. We have seen from just about every angle that vaccination limits the severity of disease, and since the risk of long COVID is linked to the severity of acute infection, we believe that vaccination will be partly, but not completely , protective. Once a patient develops long COVID, that's a very different story. Right now, we are in a situation of having to treat and manage a complicated clinical syndrome that affects multiple systems in different ways. Every patient is different, eve ry patient's symptoms will be different, and potentially the treatment of every patient will be different. That's hard on so many levels \u2014it's hard to establish which treatments are best for which patients and, of course, it's hard for patients. We are goin g to be in a period \u2014an unenviable position, frankly \u2014of having to feel our way, of having to treat patients symptomatically and having to conduct clinical trials and investigations to get at therapies that are safe and effective and reverse the mechanisms o f disease to the extent that this is possible, while recognizing we don't yet know the mechanisms of disease for many manifestations of long COVID. Sprague Martinez: That question of diagnosis and treatment is even more complicated among marginalized commu nities. For many people it's a privilege to take the day off from work and to seek care and treatment, especially in the context of employment instability which continues to impact industries such as service, which was very hard hit during the pandemic. Then there's the question of awareness. Have people heard of Paxlovid? Are they aware it's out there? I can say that many people are not aware. How do we get the word out about it? Then there's testing. Access to at -home testing is not equitable. Many people may not even know they have COVID. We can't assume access to health information or care. HMNews : Where does the pandemic stand in Massachusetts? Lemieux: Things are getting better, but transmission of SARS -CoV -2 is still quite high if you look at both at the percentage of positivity and at the absolute case counts. The wastewater RNA levels are high. Although we are probably past the peak of the BA.2.12.1 wave, we are starting to see BA.4 and BA.5 variants starting to show up in a few percentage points of our sequenced cases here in the region. They are more transmissible and likely to cause some surge in cases. So, while we are dealing with the effects of post -acute COVID, we are also likely going to be seeing a lot of ongoing acute COVID into the summer, and there may be a resurgence in the fall. MONKEYPOX How Worried Should We Be about Monkeypox? The country's history with smallpox vaccination might help, but it's not yet a cause for alarm, says NEIDL virologist John H. Connor Original article from The Brink by Doug Most . May 25 , 2022 As if COVID -19 is not enough to worry about, now there is monkeypox. In Boston, one patient hospitalized with the monkeypox virus came in contact with 200 people (most of them healthcare workers). And the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified more than 100 suspected and confirmed cases of the virus in an outbreak across Europe and North America. Like similar pox viruses, monkeypox is most often transmitted through close skin -to-skin contact , and can, less easily, be transmitted through respiratory droplets when a patient has lesions in the mouth. Monkeypox symptoms include a fever, headache, exhaustion, and a rash or lesions \u2014about 1 in 10 who contract the disease die from it, according to th e Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And on Monday even President Joe Biden weighed in, reassuring Americans already exhausted from the COVID -19 experience that the country was ready if it had to take on a new virus. Still, he advised people to be careful. For some perspective on monkeypox and the level of concern it's causing, The Brink spoke with John H. Connor , a virologist at Boston University's National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL) and a BU School of Medicine associate pro fessor of microbiology. National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories - 43 Q&A WITH JOHN H. CONNOR The Brink: What kind of virus is monkeypox? Connor: An orthopoxvirus. It carries its genome as double -stranded DNA. It is similar to other known human pathogens like cowpox, and it's also similar to vaccinia , which is the vaccine that was used to eradicate smallpox circulation on this planet. We've heard that the smallpox vaccine is effective in protecting people from monkeypox. But are most people vaccinated against smallpox? So, the answer is that Americans \u2014and people in many places around the world \u2014used to automatically get vaccinated against smallpox. But then in 1980, the WHO declared smallpox had stopped circulating. And there was a key transition that occurred. There had not been a single case of it, ma ybe [one] in 1977, and very few cases before then. The effort to eradicate smallpox from the planet was successful. It was worth vaccinating people when there was a threat. Then when the threat completely disappeared, the benefit of being vaccinated agains t a virus that was not actively circulating was highly debatable. And so vaccination largely disappeared, except for individuals in specific circumstances. Part of the reasoning for why regular vaccination stopped is that the vaccine does have side effects . There was a population health effect of the vaccine. A small number of people, small percent, will have a very strong reaction to vaccination. So, for me, born in the late 1960s, would I likely be vaccinated? Do you have a scar on your shoulder? I think that I do, yes. But what percentage of the world is vaccinated against smallpox? I'm not positive, but I know that number is out there. [According to Pfizer, 80 percent of the world's population had been vaccinated by 1967. Since smallpox's eradication, vaccines have typically been held in stockpiles; the United States ended routine vaccination in 1972.] OK, so knowing what we know about monkeypox, and knowing that not everybody today is vaccinated against smallpox, how concerned should we be as we read abo ut this new virus in our midst? From my standpoint, people should be aware. But I am not packing the car and heading for the hills. The basis for that is while monkeypox can be transmitted person to person, it is not something that has been described as having the real wildfire transmission we have seen with SARS -CoV -2. There has been an ongoing outbreak of monkeypox in Nigeria since 2017. There are only 500 or 600 cases. Compare that, over five years , with SARS -CoV -2\u2014we are a little over two years in and we are at how many hundred million cases? Of the two current infection threats, I think SARS -CoV -2 is the one that people should be concerned about right now. For people who do get it, how serious is monkeypox? It can be a very serious disease. But if it is caught early, and depending on which strain, it might not be. Right now, the current cluster of cases is from that milder strain. But there have been deaths reported from monkeypox infections. Have NEIDL researchers been interested in pox viruses before this latest news? We have been thinking about this since 2010, 2011. We are currently supported by the National Institutes of Health grant to research a small molecule that blocks poxviruses, includin g monkeypox. We are working with colleagues in the chemistry department to take an An image of various monkeypox virus particles taken from human skin. According to BU virologist John H. Connor, monkeypox \"is not something that has been described as having the really wildfire transmission we have seen w ith SARS -CoV-2.\" Courtesy CDC/Goldsmith. Photo via Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images 44 - FY22 Annual Report interesting initial \"hit\" and make it more potent and more likely to be a successful broad -spectrum anti -poxviral treatment. Knowing that the smallpox vaccination is effecti ve against pox viruses like monkeypox, in your mind, is there any chance of smallpox vaccinations coming back? It's a good question. You may remember this was tried once before. After the anthrax attacks [in 2001], there was very real concern about weapons of mass destruction and biological agents being used as weapons of terror, and smallpox came up as something that would be really horrible. And I agree with that. The armed forces began a vaccination campaign. But I believe they stopped it because there w ere some severe adverse reactions. It came down to, if there is not a clear and present danger, is the cost of starting up again worth it? That answer could shift if monkeypox becomes an endemically transmitted event. But from my perspective, we're not the re yet. From everything you are saying, you sound confident that monkeypox could be contained? Yes. We have evidence of being prepared. Monkeypox has been imported into the United States recently: into Texas in July 2021, into Maryland in the fall of 2021. In both of these instances, importation did not then lead to lots of additional monkeypox infections. In the future, if there is evidence of community transmission, the United States has several options: postexposure treatment and vaccination. The country has prepared in ways that we weren't prepared for COVID -19. We could react in a big way. Checking in on the state of the pandemic, 2 years after Mass. emergency declaration Original article from WBUR by Rupa Shenoy & Hafsa Quraishi. March 10, 2022 Thursday marks the two -year anniversary of when Gov. Charlie Baker declared Massachusetts under a state of emergency due to COVID -19. At the time, there were 92 known or presumptive cases in the state. Baker eliminated non - essential travel by state worker s, called for state employees to work remotely and urged private companies to do the same. Now, two years later, communities across the state are loosening mask mandates, lifting capacity limits and easing restrictions. WBUR's Morning Edition host Rupa She noy checked in on the state of the pandemic with infectious disease specialist Dr. David Hamer , professor of global health and medicine at Boston University. INTERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS On the pandemic over the past few years It's been a roller coaster ride. Back when Gov. Baker made the announcement two years ago, we knew so little about this virus and about how it was spread. And I think over time, we've learned a lot of lessons about what can be done safely using prevention measures. If you look at the numbers ... the total number of new cases, hospitalizations \u2014 everything has been going down very quickly over the last month. I think there still is some transmission of SARS -CoV -2 in the community, but it's at much lower levels and the risk is gradually subsiding. On the possibility of a case surge following loosening restrictions I think that we're in a good place right now. There's a lot of both natural immunity from infection as well as vaccine - associated immunity. The only way we're going to have a really major increase in cases, I think, is if a new variant arises. On keeping ourselves safe and healthy I think it really is going to be a new world ... individuals really need to balance the risk based on [both] their personal risk and also what's going on in the community. And because all the community measures in Massachusetts look very good right now, I think that the risk is progressively subsiding. National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories - 45 I think we need to keep a careful eye on children. Certainly, if they have symptoms, they should be tested and isolated until their test result is back. Beyond that, if there's less virus overall being transmitted in the community, then the risk of children becoming infected and transmitting to other children or family members should be much lower. On what the COVID -19 pandemic might look like in a year That's a tough question. The optimistic scenario is that we will not have any more waves and we'll just hav e periodic clusters, maybe because of transmission to groups that have not had the vaccine at all, or importation of the virus from outside of the country. That sort of transmission may become seasonal and so, we may be looking at late fall and winter, when we typically have influenza season and certain other respiratory viruses. I think we will be doing a lot more dual testing for influenza and SARS -CoV -2 at the same time until we have a better grasp of the epidemiology of the disease. The worst case scena rio is that we have another successor to omicron come along, and if it's different enough that there's not great protective immunity, which is essentially what happened with delta and omicron, then we could have another wave and we might have to restrict m ovements and bring back mask use in certain places and do enhanced testing and so forth. But I'm cautiously optimistic that's not going to happen. This segment aired on March 10, 2022. COVID -19 Here's what to do after being exposed to omicron Dr. David Hamer, a professor of global health and medicine, explains why rapid tests are effective at indicating when someone is infectious. Original article from Boston.com By Gwen Egan. January 24, 2022 In the wake of the omicron wave, the steps to take afte r being exposed to COVID -19 seem increasingly complicated. If someone gets exposed, do they test immediately? Or do they test after 5 days? Should they isolate for 5 days? Or 7? Or even 10? Below is a timeline of what to do after being exposed to omicron and what should be done at each juncture with the help of Dr. David Hamer , a professor of global health and medicine at the Boston University School of Public Health and School of Medicine. Right after being exposed: First off, don't get tested right awa y. \"With omicron there's at least a suggestion that you become infected and symptomatic within two or three days.\" said Hamer. \"If you have had no symptoms and no other exposure, testing the same day as an exposure is a waste of time.\" 3-5 days after ex posure: Get tested. According to the most recent Center for Disease Control guidelines , if someone exhibits symptoms of COVID -19, they should get tested. Therefore, over the 3 -5 days following exposure, that person should be monitoring for signs of sympto ms. What symptoms to look for within those 3 -5 days: The symptoms associated with omicron are slightly different than previous variants, aligning more with influenza or the common cold according to Hamer. Someone with omicron can expect to experience symptoms like: runny nose , headache, fatigue, sneezing, sore throat. This is according to the Zoe COVID -19 Symptom Study. \"The only way we're going to have a really major increase in cases, I think, is if a new variant arises.\" 46 - FY22 Annual Report What kind of test to get and why: During Governor Baker's Jan. 11 press conference concerning testing and exposure, he e mphasized that rapid tests are a reliable way to get results. This is because of something called viral load. Hamer explained viral load as \"the concentration of virus in some bodily fluid.\" Rapid tests are a strong option because they are quick, cheap, easy to find and use, and can usually tell someone that \u2014 not only are they positive \u2014 but also infectious. A PCR test will indicate a positive result if someone has \"really tiny particles\" of virus left in their system, according to Hamer. However, rapid tests will only show a positive result if there is a large amount of virus concentrated in the body, enough to make that individual clearly infected and infectious. When someone is initially infected with COVID -19, said Hamer, they are likely to be infecti ous because there is a large amount of virus in the body. However, as that infected person starts to recover, their viral load quickly decreases. \"SARS -CoV -2 is a virus that grows quickly inside the body, so by the time a benchmark PCR test becomes positiv e, the virus is well into exponential growth,\" read a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine . \"At that point, it is probably hours, not days, before the virus grows by orders of magnitude, reaching the detection thresholds of currently avai lable cheap and rapid point -of-care tests.\" For a more visual interpretation, the New England Journal of Medicine created a graph. \"[A rapid test] does tell you that you're infected, but also, it has a pretty good association or sort of correlation with infectiousness,\" Hamer said. After testing positive : Current CDC guidelines recommend isolating for five days. However, Hamer has thoughts. \"The CDC recommends five days. It's not based on a lot of evidence...day five about half or less people are no longer infectious, and by the seventh day it's gone down to an even better, lower level of risk.\" Hamer recommends abiding by the official isolation guidelines, but advise s it's good practice to continue wearing a well -fitted mask for a few days beyond the five -day mark. Why it's not suggested to get a PCR test to return to normal activity: \"The PCR is much more sensitive, so it can detect really tiny particles of the RNA of the virus.\" he said, \"Some people will have bits and pieces of virus spread that goes out for weeks.\" Therefore, getting a rapid or even an at -home test to provide to workplaces, schools, and other facilities is a much better method. This is also why mo st organizations that do mandatory testing of their community, such as universities, will exempt those who have already been infected from the testing requirement for 90 days. Graph from Rethinking Covid -19 Test Sensitivity \u2014 A Strategy for Containment. National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories - 47 We work with dangerous pathogens in a downtown Boston biocontainment lab - here's why you can feel safe about our research Original article from The Conversation , authored by Ronald Corley. July 14, 2021 Microbiologist Ronald Corley has gone to work every day throughout the pandemic as director of the National Emerging Infectious Diseas es Laboratories . Within this secure lab facility in Boston, scientists study pathogens as diverse as tuberculosis, Ebola virus, yellow fever virus and Zika virus. Many investigators there quickly turned their attention in 2020 to SARS -CoV -2, the virus that causes COVID -19. Here Corley answers some of the most frequently asked questions about this kind of biosecure lab and the work researchers do inside it. What is the purpose of a biocontainment facility? A newly emerging or reemerging human pathogen is detected somewhere around the globe every 12 to 18 months . Infectious diseases don't respect borders. Because of the global economy and unprecedented mobility, everyone on the planet is vulnerable to potentially devastating infectious diseases that may have originated halfway across the world. In this age of high -speed travel, we are as little as 36 hours away from any outbreak. As with SARS -CoV -2, scientists may know little about emerging pathogens or the diseases they cause. Studying these ge rms - whether bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms - in the safe environment of a biocontainment laboratory is the best protection humankind has against these diseases. In the lab, researchers can safely test new diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines . The more scientists learn about these new diseases, the better prepared we are for the ones that will come after. This is where labs like the NEIDL, and our stringent safety measures, are important. I feel safer from infection working in the NEIDL than I do in my apartment building. We know what we're working with in the lab and how to keep ourselves and others safe. But outside, I don't know who I might pass who could have a transmissible pathogen, including the coronavirus. This is not to say that there is no risk working within the laboratory - there is. But we minimize it through a series of safety measures - including building systems, laboratory design, personal protective equipment, training and safety protocols - that have been tried and tested in laboratories across the world. How do you try to minimize risk? Our biosafety manual sets the standards for all work with biological material in the NEIDL. Requirements increase in complexity from Biosafety Level 2 (BSL -2) on to BSL -3 and BSL -4. In the U.S ., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determines each pathogen's biocontainment level, based on what's known about how it infects its host, the severity of the disease it causes, how easily transmissible the pathogen may be and the nature of th e work itself - does it potentially create aerosols, for example. The biosafety levels require different types of engineering controls - such as the building materials the space uses, directional air flow to ensure pathogens can't get out, HEPA filtration so that only sterile air is discharged from the lab space and so on. The administrative controls required vary by biosafety level, as well - safety protocols, requirements for personnel training, limiting access and so forth. Each level requires different types of personal protective equipment: gloves and lab coats in a BSL -2 laboratory, protective lab wear and N95 or PAPR respirators in BSL -3 or a fully encapsulating suit in a BSL -4 laboratory. Security precautions, thoughtful facilities design, careful training and safe lab practices help keep pathogens isolated. Boston University Photography , CC BY -ND 48 - FY22 Annual Report \"Safety First\" is not just a bumper -sticker phrase at the NEIDL. Everyone from public safety officers to support staff to researchers has fully bought into the culture of safety. It informs the way we're trained and drilled, the way pathogens are transported to the facility, and policies that govern our employees . We know the risks of the work, train on protective measures, and ensure every member of our staff follows our protocols. What does containment look like with these safety strategies in place? Everyone undergoes annual background checks, medical clearances and training. Only cleared staff can enter the building alone. There are limited ways into the space, one for pedestrians, and one for vehicles, like delivery trucks. Entry requires access via biometric or card access or both, and screening by security. Access controls limit staff members to entering spaces where they have permission to work, based on their training, clearances and biosafety protocols. A network of security systems and closed -circuit cameras monitors the facility. Entering laboratories requires that workers don the appropriat e PPE for the area. Within the labs, we know what pathogen we are working with and how it is being used and are confident staff are following the safety measures required to keep them safe. This ensures the safety of others in the building as well as the s urrounding community. Importantly, the biosafety practices ensure that each pathogen we're studying is restricted to the appropriate spaces. Researchers work at biosafety cabinets that sterile -filter the air before releasing it back into the lab. What kind s of regulation and oversight are there? Biocontainment laboratories do not function in a vacuum. The building and laboratory designs, and the PPE and operating procedures that protect staff, meet the guidelines set by the CDC and by the 574 -page book \" Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories \" from the CDC and National Institutes of Health. To carry out a project, the lead scientist begins with an application to the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Experts in biosafety and science review the application, as do laypersons who provide a community perspective. These Working with pathogens only within a specially ventilated b iosafety cabinet provides another layer of security. Boston University Photography, CC BY -ND Biosafety levels are defined by how much risk is involved in working with particular pathogens. The Conversation, CC BY -ND National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories - 49 deliberations are open and transparent thanks to public participation on the committee. Its minutes are posted online . Safety professionals also inspect the laboratory facilities before work gets underway. In the city of Boston, projects that involve any BSL -3 or BSL -4 work require review and approval from the Boston Public Health Commission, one of the only local public health departments with this type of oversight. Work with certain types of pathogens called \" select agents \" that pose a severe threat is further regulated by the Division of Select Agents and Toxins within the CDC. Here at the NEIDL, both city and federal officials inspect the laboratories, interviewing personnel and reviewing records, including maintenance records. They also inspect pathogen inventories. Inspections can be announced or unannounced. What would happen if something went wrong? An important aspect of safety is making sure everyone knows what to do in an emergency. Three trainings per year involve first responders from the city as well as from Boston University. These are done as eith er live drills or tabletop exercises with experts walking through what an emergency would look like. Afterward we review how we did and develop plans for improvement. Community members are also part of the exercises, and this keeps our neighbors involved a nd hopefully provides assurance of our ability to handle accidents, keeping ourselves and the community safe. At Boston University, we post all laboratory incidents, including those at the NEIDL, on a quarterly basis to ensure that we remain transparent in our activities. Depending on what went wrong, we may also report to the BPHC and the CDC. Why place these high -security labs in urban environments with lots of neighbors instead of the middle of nowhere? Scientific research is a communal activity, and adv ances happen in places where diverse expertise is concentrated. It's no different for research on emerging pathogens. Research on pathogens relies on faculty with expertise in not only the pathogens themselves but chemistry, engineering, stem cell biology, structural biology, immunology and more. Biocontainment research also requires facilities engineers, safety professionals and security personnel. You can find personnel with diverse experience and expertise in metropolitan areas that are already home to b iomedical research. The original permitting process of the NEIDL mandated a comprehensive risk assessment to determine any potential danger for the community. After two years and independent review by two scientific panels, we ended up with the most extensive analysis of risk for any BSL -3 or BSL -4 facility in the U.S. It considered hundreds of possible scenarios that might result in exposure of a worker to a pathogen, or the release of a biological agent. The report concluded that it's as safe, or ev en safer, to have such a facility in an urban environment than in a rural or suburban environment. \"Near misses\" have occurred at these kinds of labs within the U.S. and Europe. A near miss might, for example, involve glove tears and a potential exposure t o a pathogen during laboratory work, but these have never resulted in any community infections. At the NEIDL, we intend to maintain this track record. The safety of a facility like the NEIDL benefits from the expertise and resources available in a densely populated area. Boston University Photography, CC BY -ND 50 - FY22 Annual Report What are the risks of not doing this research? Science builds on what's been learned before, accelerating our ability to respond to new outbreaks. The data we generate speeds progress on other pathogens as well, and informs how we develop and test potential therapeutics and vaccines. The risk of not doing this work is to leave ourselves more vulnerable to emerging pathogens as they arise. Professionals working o n emerging infectious diseases are interested in solving problems that benefit the public's health. We take pride in our work and are serious about our responsibility to perform our work safely and securely. We recognize that this research is often viewed skeptically and thus strive to keep the trust of the public by ensuring transparency around the work we do. Scientists put their intellectual curiosity to work on problems that challenge public health.
