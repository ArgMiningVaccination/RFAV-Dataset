No research in Croatia has yet addressed this field. This study, the first of its kind in Croatia, validated a Croatian translation of the EORTC QLQ-SWB32 measure of spiritual well-being with curative Croatian oncology patients and assessed its use and value. The study was conducted between July 2019 and January 2020 at the Department of Radiotherapy and Oncology, University Hospital Rijeka, with 143 cancer patients, using the linguistically validated Croatian version of the measure. All patients found the measure acceptable. Confirmatory factor analysis aligned with the structure found in previous studies. Cronbach's alpha confirmed internal consistency. Female participants scored higher on the RSG (Relationship with Someone or Something Greater), RG (Relationship with God), and EX (Existential) scales, and on Global-SWB. Patients with breast and gynecological tumors scored higher on RG. Older patients scored lower on RSG, RG and EX. Retirees and those with below-average incomes scored lower on EX. Participants who identified as having no religion scored lower on RSG. Stage I cancer patients scored higher on RG. The Croatian version of the EORTC QLQ-SWB32 is an acceptable, valid, and reliable measure of SWB for Croatian cancer patients.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-11-13", "cleaned_text": "Spiritual Well-Being for Croatian Cancer Patients: Validation and Applicability of the Croatian Version of the EORTC QLQ-SWB32 [https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182211920](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182211920) [Spiritual Wellbeing in with a focus on treating pain and other symptoms that may be physical, psychosocial, and/or spiritual [ [2](#B2-ijerph-18-11920)]. The Quality of Life Group (QLG) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) has established a modular approach for developing measures of HRQoL for cancer patients, which assess a range of issues relevant to HRQoL [ [3](#B3-ijerph-18-11920), [4](#B4-ijerph-18-11920)]. [5](#B5-ijerph-18-11920)]; it has been shown that for palliative patients [ [6](#B6-ijerph-18-11920), [7](#B7-ijerph-18-11920), [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920)]. SWB may protect against suicidal thoughts, hopelessness, and the desire for accelerated death in terminally ill patients, and so may be considered indispensable for holistic care [ [5](#B5-ijerph-18-11920)], assisting with increased adaptation to a malignant disease diagnosis and its acceptance [ [6](#B6-ijerph-18-11920), [7](#B7-ijerph-18-11920), [9](#B9-ijerph-18-11920)]. However, no research in this area has previously been conducted in Croatia. [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920)]. This study was conducted cross-culturally with collaborators from 14 countries on four continents, in 10 languages, and with 451 participants receiving palliative care for cancer. The international and intercultural aspects helped to assure that the measure was suitable in participating cultures and contexts, and understandable and consistent in all tested languages [ [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920), [10](#B10-ijerph-18-11920)]. [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920), [11](#B11-ijerph-18-11920)]. The SWB32 has been recognized as a means of intervening and beginning to address respondents' spiritual problems and needs [ [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920), [10](#B10-ijerph-18-11920)]. [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920)] recommended exploring the use of the SWB32 with curative oncology patients. No such research has yet been conducted in Croatia, but two recent studies in China included curative patients [ [12](#B12-ijerph-18-11920), [13](#B13-ijerph-18-11920)] (it must however be noted that both these Chinese studies used a translation of the SWB32 which has not been validated by the EORTC Translation Unit). Following an initial small-scale study validating the Croatian translation of the SWB32, the primary aim of our project's main study was to evaluate and validate the psychometric characteristics of the Croatian version of the SWB32 with Croatian curative oncology patients, and assess its suitability as both a measurement and intervention tool for these patients. The secondary aim was to conduct known-group comparisons, exploring whether there were any relationships between participants' socio-demographic and medical characteristics and their responses to the SWB32. Lastly, we compared our findings with those from the international validation study and the other studies which have used a version of the SWB32 with curative patients. 2. Methods 2.1. Measure: EORTC QLQ-SWB32 (SWB32) [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920)]. The measure also includes a Global-SWB item and nine other items: two items that screen for current or past belief in someone or something greater; three items that are only answered by those responding positively to the screening items; and four non-scoring clinically relevant items [ [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920)]. [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920), [10](#B10-ijerph-18-11920)]. 2.2. Patient Recruitment and Data Collection [14](#B14-ijerph-18-11920)]. The UHR Ethics Committee approved the study. [15](#B15-ijerph-18-11920)], including the EORTC standard translation procedure of two forward-back translations, Initial linguistic validation, i.e., assessment of the comprehensibility of the translated SWB32, was then performed in April 2019 with Department patients attending for oncology treatment. Subsequently, the Croatian version was approved by the EORTC QLG as the official Croatian version of the EORTC QLQ-SWB32. [16](#B16-ijerph-18-11920)]: \"search for the goal and meaning of life\". [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920), [10](#B10-ijerph-18-11920)]. The developers recommend, therefore, that a researcher and/or care professional should always be available for subsequent discussion if required [ [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920), [10](#B10-ijerph-18-11920)]. Consequently, administering the SWB32 requires that research team members and/or other care professionals (mental health and/or spiritual care professionals) be present to offer emotional, psychological, or spiritual support if required after respondents have completed the measure. Accordingly, qualified members of the research team were present and available to all participants who might wish further support. 2.3. Statistical Analysis [17](#B17-ijerph-18-11920)]. None of the analyzed variables showed normality, and non-parametric methods were used in all statistical analyses. Specifically, the Mann-Whitney U-test was used to test differences between any two groups, and the Kruskal-Wallis test to test differences between more than two groups. Statistical analysis of the collected data was performed using the software Statistical Package for Medcalc 11.2.0.0 [ [18](#B18-ijerph-18-11920)], and statistical significance of the tests was set at p < 0.05. 3. Results 3.1. Linguistic Validation 3.2. Main Study Participants' Socio-Demographic and Clinical Characteristics [Table 1](#ijerph-18-11920-t001). 3.3. Factor Analysis and Reliability Analysis [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920), [19](#B19-ijerph-18-11920)]. Our study identified four factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 (Keiser criterion), explaining 66% of the variance. This result agreed with the number of factors found in the international validation study, and broadly with their content [ [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920)]. In order to determine the factor loads, a varimax rotation of the factor load matrix was performed. Almost all items were allocated to the same scales as in the international study [ [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920)], except for two items, which each loaded to two scales. Item 12 (\"Able to forgive others\") was allocated to the RSG scale, rather than RO, as in the international study, although it loaded to both scales, and the difference in factor loads between the two was small (0.1339 (RO); 0.2567 (RSG)). The second difference appeared for item 31 (\"I have spiritual well-being\"), which was associated with EX instead of RSG, but also loading to both scales, with a minimal difference in the factor load (0.5718 (EX); 0.5171 (RSG)). The results are presented in [Table 2](#ijerph-18-11920-t002). [Table 3](#ijerph-18-11920-t003)shows the reliability analysis of participant scores for each of the measure's scales. We assessed the internal consistency of the measure using Cronbach's alpha, and for all scales the value was satisfactory. For two scales (RSG and EX), Cronbach's alpha was over 0.7, and for a third, RO, just under, at 0.68. Cronbach's alpha for the fourth scale, RS, was slightly lower, at 0.62. 3.4. Known-Group Comparisons: Associations between Participants' Scores on the SWB32 Scales and Their Socio-Demographic Characteristics and Clinical Parameters [Table 4](#ijerph-18-11920-t004)presents the comparisons for the known groups of our participants, with the associations between participants' scores on the SWB32 scales, and their socio-demographic characteristics and clinical parameters. 4. Discussion [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920)] state that the EORTC QLQ-SWB32 measure offers possibilities for future research and clinical practice in a field where there is currently no \"gold standard\" [ [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920), [20](#B20-ijerph-18-11920)]. Our study engages with this observation and contributes to further understanding of the multiple facets of SWB, and its place and role in different clinical and cultural settings, providing additional insight by investigating the use of the measure with Croatian curative oncology patients of both sexes, and with a variety of cancers. As Feng et al. [ [13](#B13-ijerph-18-11920)] point out, understanding the role of spirituality and SWB for both curative and palliative patients is important in developing and delivering holistic and culturally appropriate patient-oriented care. [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920)], Median values of scale scores in our study were mostly consistent with those in other published studies [ [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920), [12](#B12-ijerph-18-11920), [13](#B13-ijerph-18-11920), [19](#B19-ijerph-18-11920)]. For each of the four multi-item scales, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was above the threshold of 0.6. [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920), [10](#B10-ijerph-18-11920)] have pointed out that the SWB32 is also an intervention tool because it opens space for additional insights into patients' experiences. Our linguistic validation also found this, with participants generally satisfied with the content of the SWB32 and the way its items are conceived. They felt that through their interaction with the tool they had gained deeper insights into themselves and ways of coping with the disease, and they recognized the connection between SWB and their own QoL. They thought that the SWB32 would be a useful tool in oncology treatment, and that it was important to have members of the research team or other health care professionals available after completing it. [21](#B21-ijerph-18-11920), [22](#B22-ijerph-18-11920), [23](#B23-ijerph-18-11920), [24](#B24-ijerph-18-11920)], as they are confronted with the loss of bodily functions, emotional anguish, deteriorating physical conditions, and the threat of death [ [25](#B25-ijerph-18-11920), [26](#B26-ijerph-18-11920), [27](#B27-ijerph-18-11920), [28](#B28-ijerph-18-11920), [29](#B29-ijerph-18-11920)]. In one study [ [27](#B27-ijerph-18-11920)], participants expressed considerable fear of recurrence despite their disease-free interval, indicating that even four years after diagnosis, cancer and primary treatment still have an effect on even curative patients' lives, through fear and the need for emotional coping. [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920)] was a variation in the factor loads for two items (item 12 and item 31), which each grouped in a different scale from the international study. However, each item also grouped slightly less strongly in a second scale, and, for each, this second scale was the same as that in which they grouped in the international study. [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920)]. The concept of forgiveness has deep roots in religion across faiths and cultures [ [30](#B30-ijerph-18-11920), [31](#B31-ijerph-18-11920)]. It has been shown to partially mediate the relationship between religion and health [ [32](#B32-ijerph-18-11920)]. The practice of religion and spirituality is one of the positive indicators of mental and spiritual well-being [ [12](#B12-ijerph-18-11920), [32](#B32-ijerph-18-11920)], and thus relates conceptually both to a relationship with someone or something greater (RSG) and to relationships with other people (RO). [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920)]. The need to explain the phrase (\"spiritual well-being\") occurred repeatedly with our participants. Most associated SWB with religion, and so became \"stuck\" on the item, as the linguistic validation also found. The brief explanation offered, Frankl's \"search for the goal and meaning of life\", [ [16](#B16-ijerph-18-11920)] may have affected our participants' responses, and hence also affected the factor loading for that item. [19](#B19-ijerph-18-11920)], we found no differences for marital status, in contrast to other studies with other SWB measures [ [33](#B33-ijerph-18-11920), [34](#B34-ijerph-18-11920)], although it should be noted that the SWB32 and these measures have distinct conceptualisations of SWB [ [20](#B20-ijerph-18-11920)], and that these studies were conducted in the USA, so their findings may reflect specific geo-cultural effects. [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920), [19](#B19-ijerph-18-11920)], and the two Chinese studies [ [12](#B12-ijerph-18-11920), [13](#B13-ijerph-18-11920)], female participants also scored significantly higher on RSG, EX, and Global-SWB. Studies using other measures of spirituality or SWB (the Spiritual Interests Related to Illness Tool (SpIRIT) [ [33](#B33-ijerph-18-11920)] and the Spiritual Needs Inventory (SNI) [ [35](#B35-ijerph-18-11920)]) have also found that women have greater SWB than men [ [33](#B33-ijerph-18-11920), [34](#B34-ijerph-18-11920), [35](#B35-ijerph-18-11920), [36](#B36-ijerph-18-11920)]. The only statistically significant difference for types of cancer we found was for RG scores, with higher scores from participants with breast and gynecological tumors, all but one of whom were women (one man had breast cancer). The lowest RG scores were from patients with urogenital tumors, all of whom were men. It is important to note also that, while some studies have found that women with gynecological tumours may report worse HRQoL [ [28](#B28-ijerph-18-11920), [29](#B29-ijerph-18-11920)], women are more likely than men to utilize cancer information services and other support services [ [37](#B37-ijerph-18-11920), [38](#B38-ijerph-18-11920)]. [12](#B12-ijerph-18-11920)]. As Chen et al. [ [12](#B12-ijerph-18-11920)] recommend, future studies should compare the SWB scale scores for patients in different cancer stages. [19](#B19-ijerph-18-11920)], however, found that RS scores were positively associated with older age; and other studies using other measurement tools have also found weak positive associations of SWB with increasing age [ [35](#B35-ijerph-18-11920), [39](#B39-ijerph-18-11920)]. The difference for our study could be because Croatia was a communist country for fifty years, where religious practice was officially forbidden, thus performed in secrecy. Croatia became a secular state in the 1990s, so adherence to religion may be understood as a relatively novel concept in our society, and therefore more acceptable to people under 50 years of age [ [40](#B40-ijerph-18-11920)]. [41](#B41-ijerph-18-11920)]. In 2019 in Croatia, the at-risk-of-poverty rate was 18.3%, and this was among people aged 65 or over (30.1%), especially women (33.6%). The at-risk-of-poverty rate was also highest for the unemployed, at 45.3% [ [41](#B41-ijerph-18-11920)]. Such patients find it difficult to make plans for the future, engage in activities they love, feel fulfilled, or cope well with problems. [12](#B12-ijerph-18-11920)], patients with formal religious affiliations had higher scores on the EX and RSG scales. In Feng et al. [ [13](#B13-ijerph-18-11920)], where 90% of participants had no religious belief, the lowest scores were for RSG. [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920)]. Some people may say that they have no religious or spiritual beliefs, and have never had them, but may still indicate elsewhere that they have some such beliefs [ [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920)]. The SWB32 international validation study found this for 73 of the 156 respondents who had stated that they had no religion nor involvement with any spiritual movement [ [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920)]. Similarly, while 42.7% of our participants responded to our Background Information Survey that they had no religious beliefs, the majority of these \"not-religious\" participants' responses to items 22 and 23 nevertheless indicated that they believed in someone or something greater. Thus, these respondents should not be considered as pure atheists. This suggests that dividing \"not-religious\" into atheists and agnostics might be helpful for further research using the SWB32 in Croatia, where, in the most recent census [ [42](#B42-ijerph-18-11920)], 86.3% of the population identified as Christian and Catholic. [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920)]. Astrow et al. [ [43](#B43-ijerph-18-11920)] found that patients who did not subscribe to any specific religion had greater spiritual needs than those who did. This suggests that health care providers should also attend to spiritual care for patients who say that they have no religion, and perhaps provide more of this kind of care, or combine it with psychological counselling [ [12](#B12-ijerph-18-11920)]. [6](#B6-ijerph-18-11920), [12](#B12-ijerph-18-11920), [19](#B19-ijerph-18-11920)]. Our participants' Global-SWB scores were similar to those in the further analysis of the data from the international validation study with palliative patients [ [19](#B19-ijerph-18-11920)], but our participants' scores for RS and EX were higher than in that study. We had hypothesized that this might be the case for RS, since curative oncology patients may be more focused on everyday situations and specific life concepts. Two Chinese studies using the SWB32 included curative patients [ [12](#B12-ijerph-18-11920), [13](#B13-ijerph-18-11920)], and both found that these patients scored higher than palliative patients on EX, RS, and Global-SWB. However, since both these studies used a Chinese translation of the SWB32 which the EORTC Translation Unit has not yet validated, it is unclear how that version relates conceptually to EORTC-validated versions, so any comparison of results must be treated with caution. 5. Study Strengths and Limitations [16](#B16-ijerph-18-11920)]. This may have affected participants' responses, thereby causing the minimal differences for two items in our factor analysis, compared to the international validation study [ [8](#B8-ijerph-18-11920)]. However, our sample size was considerably smaller than that of the international validation (143 participants rather than 451), and far less culturally diverse (respondents from a single country and using one language, rather than fourteen countries and ten languages). This may have influenced the factor analysis, and also the scale reliability. 6.
