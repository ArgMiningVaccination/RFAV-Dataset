Alternative medicine is often referred to as [naturopathic medicine](https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/what-is-naturopathic-medicine). Natural medicine, or naturopathy, is a type of alternative medicine that includes homeopathy, herbalism, acupuncture, food and lifestyle counseling, and many more practices. Naturopathic doctors are those who practice natural medicine and many of them have earned a degree and passed an exam to gain a license to do so. Each year, these healthcare professionals must update their expertise in order to stay abreast of new developments in medicine. Natural medicine is based on the principles of vitalism and self-healing, hence naturopaths typically counsel their patients to stay away from pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and other invasive medical procedures. The healing process can be aided by the incorporation of mild therapeutic practices that involve the body, mind, and emotions. As a result, patients are treated as unique individuals, with attention paid to the full person rather than just one section of the body or one particular ailment. Muscles, bones, and nerves are thought to be interrelated, so when the components of the body system are aligned, the body may work efficiently and enable self-healing. It's important to remember that the goal of natural medicine is to help patients return to their natural state of health rather than suppressing their symptoms. Educating and equipping patients to take charge of their own health and wellbeing is an important part of the practitioners' job description. Teaching and patient counseling are two methods of naturopathic medicine's prevention of illness, and both are significant.

How can a Florida Ketamine Clinic help me? [In the 1960s](https://www.webmd.com/depression/features/what-does-ketamine-do-your-brain), Ketamine was used as an anesthetic for animals in Belgium. People were allowed to use it as a painkiller by the FDA in 1970. It was used on the battlefields of the Vietnam War to treat soldiers who had been wounded. To administer ketamine, patients do not need to be on a ventilator because it does not reduce breathing or heart rate, unlike other anesthetics. As a solution for treatment resistant and severe depression, , the medication has piqued the interest of academics. Treatment-resistant depression, PTSD, and other diseases have been improved in controlled clinical settings using this method. People who don't respond to other drugs may benefit from a medically supervised use strategy designed by doctors. Our [Florida alternative medicine doctors ](https://newhorizonclinics.com/)have had success treating the following conditions with ketamine: How does Ketamine work? Among the many things we already know: Ketamine has been shown to quickly alleviate the symptoms of [depression](https://newhorizonclinics.com/conditions/depression/), [anxiety](https://newhorizonclinics.com/conditions/anxiety/), and [PTSD](https://newhorizonclinics.com/conditions/ptsd/), as well as [complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS](https://newhorizonclinics.com/conditions/complex-regional-pain-syndrome/)). Acute symptoms such as suicidal thoughts and anxiety are where we've seen the greatest impact. For mood disorders like depression, PTSD, and anxiety that have treatment-resistant symptoms and haven't responded to conventional treatments or drugs, Ketamine can have a dramatic impact for a high percentage of patients. Research and clinical results - including those of our patients at New Horizon Clinics - have shown great promise.. Ketamine affects a wide range of receptors and pathways in the mind and body. The glutamate pathway is one important nervous system mechanism that may be in play. Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist. Blocking excitatory NMDA receptors can lead to anesthesia and dissociation. Direct anti-depressant effects have not been identified in other NMDA receptor antagonists. It is in low doses of ketamine that we see the clinical benefit of depressive symptom relief. While the mTOR route and the AMPA receptor have been linked to ketamine's effects on the brain, it isn't clear how much each of these pathways interacts with the other pathways or which of them is more significant. However, although we know that ketamine improves neuronal connectivity and neuroplasticity, we don't know exactly how this happens. This is because the mTOR pathway is assumed to be how ketamine causes the development of new connections in the brain. Ketamine metabolites (the molecules that our bodies produce as we break down the medicine) have recently been explored as a possible source of ketamine's effects. This has resulted in more research and at least one novel medicine that is currently being tested in humans. There has been a growing body of evidence suggesting that metabolites aren't as beneficial in humans as the early studies had suggested.
