Acupuncture is a natural way to relieve pain and improve function. It comes from Traditional Chinese Medicine and has become popular in the United States as treatment for pain. It works well for pain in muscles and joints, such as back pain, hip pain and knee pain. Acupuncture can also treat pain that is vague or long-term. It can help patients manage pain before or after surgery. It can even help patients avoid surgery altogether. How does it work? Acupuncture involves placing very small needles at various locations on your body to help stimulate nerves and release muscles. The number of treatments you need will depend on your condition, usually one to five treatments. Your doctor may recommend monthly follow-up treatments. Patients often feel immediate relief of symptoms, but sometimes may not respond until the third or fourth treatment. Acupuncture works for many people, but may not work for all.
