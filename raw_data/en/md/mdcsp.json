Reiki offers comfort, nurture and support for the good health and balance of your mind, body and spirit. Reiki is an ancient, Eastern, healing art that promotes healing and helps to balance and energize you physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. It is administered by using subtle hand placements to bring about the body's own natural healing process. Reiki is based on the idea that an unseen life force energy flows through us. If one's life force energy is low then we are most likely to get sick or feel stress, if it is high we are more capable of being happy & healthy. The style of Reiki I practice is a blend of Usui Shiki Ryoho, Usui/Tibetan Reiki, and traditional techniques. Reiki is a powerful natural healing energy that is complete and whole in itself but also acts synergistically with all other healing methods. In addition to Reiki sessions I also offer Integrative Vibrational Energy Healing Sessions which are a powerful combination of vibrational energy healing techniques including crystal healing, sound healing, Reiki, customized aromatherapy and intuitive guidance. These techniques have the ability to release stuck energy, clear and balance your energy system, and bring about greater well being. The guidance given after the session includes the use of oracle cards and helps you to recognize any unhealthy patterns and help you to move forward in achieving your wellness goals. See [Vibrational Medicine page](https://integrativehealingartsstudio.org/vibrational-medicine) for more information about vibrational energy healing. Distance Reiki sessions and classes in Usui Reiki are also available.
