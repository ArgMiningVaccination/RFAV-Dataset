In March 2020, the United States was in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. We shut down the entire country and ground the economy to a halt to slow the spread of the virus. Think back to March and how much uncertainty we were living under. Nine months later, the Food and Drug Administration provisionally approved two COVID-19 vaccines under emergency authorization. Before New Year's Day, millions of Americans had received the vaccine, including front- line physicians and health care providers and nursing home patients, our most vulnerable citizens. Nine months. Take a moment to let that sink in. There is another way \u2014 a more accurate and underappreciated way \u2014 to tell the story of the past nine months. It is a story of heroism, innovation and pre - cise science, performed under unbelievable pressure. Let's not mince words: The U.S. and the world must appreciate the role of the pharmaceutical industry \u2014 the researchers and physicians \u2014 who are res - cuing the world from COVID-19. It's the medical breakthrough of our lifetime. Let's review some facts. Since the discovery of COVID-19, here is what scientists have accomplished: They identified a novel virus, unlocked and sequenced its genetic code, used this information to create new therapies to save lives, and developed multiple safe and effective vaccines using messenger RNA technology, one that is hopefully applicable to future vaccine development. The U.S. has two vaccines approved for emergency use, one from Pfizer/BioNTech and another from Moderna, and the AstraZeneca/ Oxford vaccine has been approved for emergency use in the U.K. In addition, there are 64 vaccines undergoing clinical trial at the moment, including 20 in phase 3 trials. This was the fastest vaccine development program in history, and it's not even close. Dr. David Pride, a microbiologist at the University of California, San Diego, estimates that vaccines typically take 10 to 15 years to develop. Until the COVID-19 pandemic, the fastest development timeline was four years, for the mumps vaccine. The current step of the process \u2014 distribution of the vaccine \u2014 has been as challenging as the development phase, if not more so. Factories worldwide are working overdrive to produce hundreds of millions of vaccine doses. Less than a month after the Pfizer vaccine was approved, more than 15.4 million doses of vaccine were distributed across the country, and more than 4.6 million people received their first dose, according to CDC data. Many patients have already received their second dose. Although 15.4 million doses are impressive, some expected 20 million doses. But that is moving the goal line, as six months ago many observers didn't think a vaccine would be available until 2021. Every day, more people will be vaccinated. After health care workers and our most vulnerable citizens, other front-line workers will be next. Teachers will be vaccinated so our children can return to school. And soon, all Americans will be able to receive the vaccine at their doctor's office or at a CVS or Walgreens. Remember, we accomplished this in nine months. MIKE HENNESSY SR.

In health care delivery, such disparities are well documented and are further complicated and magnified by associated factors such as educa - tion level, income, employment and access to care. Cancer care is among the most expensive and complicated medical deliverables and, perhaps, the most affected by racial disparities. Imbalances among racial groups that exist in many corners permeate every dimension of cancer, from lifestyle and preventive aspects to availability of cancer screening, timely diagnosis of cancer and rapid access to treatment and follow-up. Because research into this topic has increased in the past few decades, this subject has come to the forefront of government officials, the health care industry, businesses that provide and purchase health care cover - age, and the public in general. How has this information influenced policy and laws? Has it really helped level the playing field for all races and ethnicities? Are cancer outcomes starting to improve for affected racial groups? In this issue of CURE\u00ae, you will learn more about these dispari - ties and some of the underlying reasons we find ourselves in this situation. You will read about examples of and possible reasons for racial inequities in different parts of patients' cancer journeys. A deeper dive into specific ethnic and racial groups will provide some context and personalize this problem \u2014 illustrating that we all own it and need to address it as a society. As is our tradition, you will get specific facts and figures that illustrate the magnitude of the problem. For example, postoperative mortality after cancer surgery has improved over the years, but there is still a gap in death rates \u2014 it remains higher for Black patients compared with White patients, according to a large analysis using national Medicare data. Disparities in outcomes also exist for Hispanic/ Latino patients with cancer. The past year has spotlighted racial inequities not only in the U.S., but worldwide. It has also opened our eyes as to how a major health disruption \u2014 in this case, a pandemic \u2014 can aggravate the unacceptable status quo. This issue will also provide some hopeful and positive new trends on both small and large scales that we hope can move us toward greater cancer care equality. MIKE KITADA DEBU TRIPATHY , M.D. Editor-in-Chief Professor of Medicine Chair, Department of Breast Medical Oncology The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer CenterEDITOR'S NOTE LETTERS TO THE EDITOR TWO YEARS AGO, I was at home recovering from a hysterectomy and the removal of cancer from my body. My family and several close friends rallied around me. Once my doctor called and informed me that the results were that the cancer was positive and yet no further treatment would be necessary, I felt a huge relief. Then for a year and a half, I went in regularly for a check-up and continued on my path with her confirma - tion and support. This last September, I advanced even further in not having to return for a year. Tonight, I finished reading one of the most outstanding periodicals in support of cancer diagnosis, procedures, new protocols, recovery, treatments, etc. and free to patients with cancer. One of my dear friends shared a copy of the annual CURE \u00ae Cancer Guide , but it took me a while to be ready to read it. When I finally picked it up, it provided me with a wealth of knowledge about cancer. No matter what you think you know about cancer, you will never really know until you walk the cancer path in your own life. Even being a caregiver, as difficult as it may be, struggles with understanding the immense emotion and stress that comes with such a diagnosis. That initial diagnosis leaves many scary doors to be opened by the patient and the unexpected may come again. The CURE \u00ae magazine for fall 2020 is the most recent quarterly to come in the mail. I often wait until there is a peaceful moment in which I can open my mind to the outstanding information that it contains. With the complications of 2020, I was able to read each magazine after getting caught up on others that had piled up. The current issue came at the right time for me in facing the health challenges that are before me. It contains cancer updates, research and education. There are sections that cover current news and articles on six types of cancer. The article \"Can a Blood Test Detect Cancer?\" is amazing. There are over 100 types of cancer that a simple blood test can screen for. Early diagnosis and advancing protocols are key to conquering cancer. Knowledge is power in the cancer fight. My diagnosis was early because I took my concern about a medical issue to my doctor. During the past year, I continued to struggle in recovery. Communicating with my doctors has been a great support. Understanding symptoms in the COVID-19 environment meant additional challenges. I am grateful to have telephone appointments with the 14 medical professionals that oversee my progress. They are patient, kind, thoughtful and willing to work with me on this journey. There are others whose journeys have been different from mine, and each of us who face this fight will have special needs. One key thing that we can do is to reach out to others who are beginning this journey and assure them that they are not alone. Susan Olsen LeBlanc Scappoose, Oregon IN THE FIRST LINE of your feature article on blood tests to detect cancer in the fall 2020 edition of CURE \u00ae, it says: \"Picture this: At your annual doctor's appointment when they draw your blood to check your cholesterol, thyroid and liver enzymes...\" If one is on Medicare, annual physical exams are not covered. Once you're on Medicare, you are not allowed to get routine bloodwork (ie., no cholesterol checks, no complete blood counts, etc.) or a physical unless you want to pay for it yourself. You have to have symptoms before blood tests are done. You do a disservice to everyone on Medicare by perpetuating the myth that the physical exam that we are taught to have all our lives can continue once we're forced onto Medicare by virtue of our age. It simply is not true. This isn't the first time I've seen articles talk about physical exams and routine blood - work that I'm no longer allowed to have. Medicare stopped all of that. It was a routine blood test during an annual exam that indirectly found my cancer. It happened when I was 60 \u2014 before I was forced onto Medicare at 65. Had that test not happened when it did, the cancer wouldn't have been found at an early stage, if at all. An official Medicare document states \"The yearly 'Wellness' visit isn't a physical exam.\" This document can be read here: https://www.medicare.gov/Pubs/ pdf/10050-Medicare-and-You.pdf .

Here's what you need to take into consideration as the weather gets colder. TAMPA BAY RADIATION ONCOLOGY WINTER CAN BE HARD FOR many people, but for patients with cancer, slippery streets and cold weather are more than a hazard \u2014 they can also be a health risk. Learn how cold weather affects patients with cancer and how you can stay safe. Patients with cancer are more susceptible to hypothermia Hypothermia is a condition where the human body begins to lose heat faster than it can produce it, causing the body temperature to become dangerously low. Adverse effects of cancer treatment, such as fatigue, dehydration and anemia, can make patients more susceptible to hypothermia as they may lose heat much faster. Frostbite is a bigger risk for patients with cancer Some treatments can cause peripheral neuropathy, which car - ries numbness in the extremities as a potential adverse effect. Patients who have peripheral neuropathy are more likely to get frostbite since they can't feel how cold their fingers and hands are in cold weather. Patients will have a higher risk of falling Patients can have a higher risk of fracture if they are receiving treatments that affect bone density. Patients with cancer also need to be especially careful if they have thrombocytopenia, a condition associated with blood cancers that causes low platelet counts. Since platelets help blood clot, a low count can lead to bruising or serious bleeding after injury. Patients who have numbness in their feet are also more prone to falls. Having a higher risk for complications with the flu Cancer therapy may weaken patients' immune systems. They need to get their flu shot since they don't have enough white blood cells to fight infections. This is why patients with cancer have a higher chance of complications from the flu than a healthy person.Tips to stay safe Follow these tips to protect your health or that of a loved one in winter and stay safe: Stay inside as much as you can when temperatures are freezing or when low temperatures are accompanied by rain or high winds. Make sure your walkways are cleared of ice and snow. If you need to go outside, make sure to bundle up in layers. Put on a hat that covers your ears, especially if therapy has caused you to lose your hair. Wear heavy gloves, thick socks and warm boots with good treads. Protect your skin by minimizing or preventing skin exposure. Therapy can make your skin itchy, dry and cracked, especially when the humidity level drops. Use lip balm and moisturizers regularly and avoid long, hot showers and baths. Consider getting a humidifier. Stay hydrated and drink plenty of noncaffeinated liquids regularly. If you'd rather avoid winter and the risks it carries for patients with cancer, you can always consider health tourism. It's the practice of traveling to a popular tourist destination with the pur - pose of receiving therapeutic treatment. For example, Florida has mild, pleasant winters, which make it an ideal location for health tourism! Winter won't last forever, even if you sometimes feel that way, so celebrate each sunny day!

By RICHARD E. FARMER AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO more than five years ago received a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, I have been struck by the reliance of some patients with cancer on clinical trials and research and the desire to \"battle and fight\" the disease in order to seek cure and avoid untimely death. This emphasis also applies to health care providers and researchers, many of whom are the originators of this focus. Offering hope supports that singular human need to achieve another state of being. As a need, hope is more than an emotional state. Hope is a multifaceted need that drives an individual to achieve or craft their life in a certain direction. More than serving as a guide or road map for life, hope can influence the essence of fundamental human behavior from birth to death.For the patient with cancer, the concept of hope can be applied in many ways. At its core, hope and the patient may be seen through the lens of the quality of life or lifestyle, a reli - gious orientation and faith, and the belief in the human soul. Finding Hope Through Faith Hope can produce a quality of life that may be considered a lifestyle. Our daily behavior from birth onward is built around a series of ideas, principles and concepts that form a belief system and ultimately are organized as a lifestyle. Although the concept of lifestyle is a complicated phenomenon, group - ing the many forms of individual human behavior into a set of mostly observable behaviors can have, at its core, the idea of SHARE YOUR STORIESNGUPAKARTI / STOCK.ADOBE.COM A Letter to Myself: You Were Made for This Breast Cancer Journey Paula Schneider, president and CEO of Susan G. Komen, writes to her younger self about the lessons and challenges she faced as a patient with breast cancer. By PAULA SCHNEIDER Dear Paula, YOU MAY THINK THAT you have faced adversity, but now you're in for an actual life-and-death struggle. Like your mom, you're going to be diagnosed with breast cancer. You will later lose your mom to metastatic breast cancer, just as you lost your brother to metastatic prostate cancer, and your sister will be diagnosed with melanoma. Cancer will become a central animating feature of your life. You'll struggle to keep it together when you tell your husband and your two school-age daughters that you, too, have cancer. You'll have to learn how to give up control and accept help, even from your children. That will be hard for someone who is used to feeling large and in charge, but you'll soon discover that you feel the most empow - ered when you feel the most powerless.It will be tough, taking its toll physi - cally and emotionally. Cancer always leaves scars. You'll pull through, though, and the experience will inspire a life change. You will quit your job and seek out an opportunity to help others. You'll apply all you have learned to the challenge of leading the fight to save lives from breast cancer. This undertaking will present its own set of challenges, but don't worry \u2014 you were made for this. You'll meet people who will touch your heart in ways you never imagined possible, and you'll have to say goodbye to too many. You'll learn that it's OK to cry at meet - ings. It is not a show of weakness but a sign of purpose. Along this journey, you'll meet kids who are raising money to honor their mothers. You'll meet patient navigators, like Susan, who will hold your hand through every step of your treatment. You'll get to know some brilliant scientists who are discovering how to help people like you. And you'll partner with innovative thinkers who want to help make significant changes to how our health care system works to improve the patient experience, accelerate discovery, and address racial and geographic disparities. All these people will give you hope for a better future for your daughters, despite your family history. So keep your head up and keep walk - ing forward. You never know where the path will take you. With love, Me 10 WINTER \u00b7 2021SHARE YOUR STORIES hope. Hope may well be the driving force as we traverse our way through life. Part of this is the idea that hope is an amaz - ing gift from God that underlies the very essence of a positive quality of life or stan - dard by which we live from birth to death. In many organized religions, hope is part of the foundation of a faith that is built around the omnipresent force commonly referred to as the concept of God. And, as some religions have espoused, the human soul is the per - son's window to God, guiding thoughts and beliefs about the future and, ultimately, an understanding of the hereafter. Hope also helps form three other aspects of human behavior: belief in the human soul, belief in one's own future, and belief in the hereafter. Hope, then, becomes a primary vehicle for understanding human existence. Finding Hope Talking With Patients So, how do we make sense out of this? My own interest in this topic grew out of my volunteer work as a moderator for a digital support group for people with blood cancers. This group is nationally supported by the Answer Cancer Foundation (AnCan), a cancer information organization. In my moderating work with AnCan, I was struck by the participants' almost exclusive interest in medications they were taking, clinical trials they were participating in, details about their chemotherapy and related topics. Initially, I was shocked as I listened to the conversation. As a psychologist, I had anticipated discussion questions such as \"What are you feeling?\" \"How are you coping?\" \"What is your family doing to help you?\" \" Are you ever angry about getting cancer? If so, how do you express yourself?\" To my professional amazement, these discussion points never came up; when participants asked if they were interested in talking about these issues, there was only some quiet grumbling. The good news is that silence almost always works. After a moment or two, one brave soul said, \"You know, I always wanted to know what it will feel like when 'the end' for me is near.\" Understandably, this generated a good deal of healthy discussion. So, from a hope perspective, perhaps what I call medication talk is really help talk organized in a way that is emotionally acceptable to the participants. As I mentioned earlier, hope can also be viewed as a concept of quality of life or lifestyle around which some build their style of living. Virtually everything they do involves some consideration of hope. Almost every human contact and relationship, including with self, spouse, extended and close-in family, employ - ers, friends and acquaintances, and neighbors, involves hope \u2014 hope that it will remain the same, change for the better or somehow be different. Hope is tightly woven into our very essence or being and is the principle upon which we judge and evaluate our thinking con - cerning the past, present and future. From a practical point of view, the concept of hope is difficult to understand, especially in the presence of catastrophic disease. We are chal - lenged to live beyond the confines of the disease as we know it or come to understand it. For example, consider the emotional role placed on medica - tions at the center of disease treatment, especially cancer treatment. First, a practitioner provides a diagnostic explanation and prescribes the medica - tion to \"fight\" the disease. The patient then fixates on the current medication, clinical research around new drugs and the overall effectiveness of both. In my experience with mul - tiple oncology physicians, the regular monthly appointments focus almost completely on the efficacy of the medications that fight the symptoms of the disease itself and the side effects of these medications. Only under rare circumstances have we had a conversa - tion about feelings, emotional coping strategies and end-of-life expectations. Hope is a complex concept about with each of us has a multitude of thoughts. Conceptually, hope may be characterized as a religious phenom - enon involving the idea of God and eternal life. On the other hand but clearly related, hope can be considered a common part of the human ego or a person's emotional and biological struc - ture. Finally, although hope is thought to be a universal aspect, its parts and dimensions have cultural components that differ among human beings. How one defines hope is both individualistic and group or culturally determined. Finding Hope Throughout The Journey Hope does not equal living per se. Some have the idea that if they go through life embracing hope, they are truly living, yet hope alone does not and cannot define living. If all our ideas, actions, behaviors, thoughts and the like are based solely on hope, then indeed we are deferring the present reality for the future, which is, by definition, hope ori - ented. Although living \u2014 past, present and future \u2014 does contain elements of hope, the totality of the concept is prob - lematic because it can keep us focused only on hope elements for the future and does not constitute living in and of itself. It is a version of the childhood From a practical point of view, the concept of hope is difficult to understand, especially in the presence of catastrophic disease. \" \u2014RICHARD E. FARMERstatement \"When I grow up, I'm going to be ...\" Hope feeds the soul with a sense of identity that enables living beyond one's current situation. For many, the soul has an exceptionally large religious or spiritual component that serves as a guide throughout life. This is especially the case for those of us with a terminal illness whose end can be and is predicted in terms of the length of time with the disease and its level, which provide a statisti - cal determination of the average life span. Hence, the role of hope and its foundation in God becomes even more important as the patient with cancer prepares for life hereafter. Perhaps the final and most significant statement about hope involves the question about God being eternal life. As patients and others face the prob - ability of near death, the idea that God is about eternal life gathers increasing importance and meaning. For those of us raised with a concept of God as part of our intellect and being, at the very essence of hope is an ever-strong belief that God is responsible for our hopeful belief in our daily existence and in the afterlife. Hope is a complex issue all human beings deal with, but it is particularly relevant to those for whom illness or age make it more imperative. Hope provides a livable statement about quality of life. As an alternative to the idea of hope as a pathway for disease fighting, hope can provide a set of statements or directions to be followed for living a quality life. Although the approach of determining a mechanistic attitude is a normal human process, hope can be useful for concep - tualizing a much broader approach to living. The endless possibilities usually involve other people, such as family and friends, and perhaps even volunteering to assist others in need.Even though patients with cancer must follow a structured path of treat - ment for disease resolution, that path does not preclude elements with broad - er appeal and usefulness for the patient. In fact, an attitude of belief that the future may be predetermined because of the disease, adding dimensions such as hope, can strengthen one's approach and add richness to quality living. To this end, then, hope is a gift and becomes the essence of an issue of quality of life. We surround ourselves with the idea that hope is a gift, one that has been nurtured by ourselves over time and often nurtured by other people in our lives. We have been taught or otherwise learned that the idea of hope provides one of the main ways to achieve happiness in life even in the context of catastrophic disease. As we move through our individual stages of development, hope is a human quality that enables us to create opportunities for positivity and peace of heart.

US-XPOV-12/20-00001 NEW INDICATION FOR PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE MYELOMA Y our doctor may prescribe XPOVIO, the only FDA-approved medication of its kind, as early as 1st relapse in multiple myeloma. XPOVIO\u00ae (selinexor) is now approved in combination with other treatments (bortezomib and dexamethasone) to treat adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. LEARN MORE ABOUT TREATMENT AT XPOVIO.COMIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION What is XPOVIO? XPOVIO\u00ae (selinexor) is a prescription medicine used: in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone to treat adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. It is not known if XPOVIO is safe and e ective in children less than 18 years of age. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests before you start taking XPOVIO, and often during the rst 3 months of treatment, and then as needed during treatment. XPOVIO can cause serious side e ects, including: Low platelet counts. Low platelet counts are common with XPOVIO and can lead to bleeding, which can be severe and can sometimes cause death. Your healthcare provider may prescribe platelet transfusions or other treatments for your low platelet counts. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any bleeding or easy bruising during treatment with XPOVIO. Low white blood cell counts. Low white blood cell counts are common with XPOVIO and can sometimes be severe. You may have an increased risk of getting bacterial infections during treatment with XPOVIO. If needed, your healthcare provider may prescribe antibiotics if you have signs or symptoms of infection. Serious infections. Infections are common with XPOVIO and can be serious and can sometimes cause death. This includes upper or lower respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia, and an infection throughout your body (sepsis). Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any signs or symptoms of an infection such as cough, chills, or fever during treatment with XPOVIO. Neurologic side e ects. XPOVIO can cause dizziness, fainting, decreased alertness, and changes in your mental status, including problems with thinking, seeing or hearing things that are not really there (hallucinations). These problems can sometimes be severe and life-threatening. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get any of these symptoms. Do not drive or operate heavy or dangerous machinery until you know how XPOVIO a ects you. Take precautions to prevent a fall. Nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea. Nausea, vomiting and/ or diarrhea can occur when you take XPOVIO and can sometimes be severe. You may be at risk for becoming dehydrated. Your healthcare provider may prescribe anti-nausea or anti-diarrhea medicines. Loss of appetite and weight loss. Loss of appetite and weight loss are common with XPOVIO. Tell your healthcare provider if you have a decrease or loss of appetite and if you are losing weight. Decreased sodium levels in your blood. Decreased sodium levels in your blood are common with XPOVIO. Your healthcare provider may talk with you about your diet and prescribe IV fl uids or salt tablets.

Teitelbaum met his friend Zamari in chemotherapy, and they bonded over their mutual dislike of the boring, ugly, beige, nonslip hospital-supplied socks that they were both wearing. As an alternative, Zamari made custom socks that helped her feel better and stand out. Together, the two started creating more designs, which they shared online with others going through cancer treatment. Later, Teitelbaum founded Resilience Gives, a foundation that sells nonslip socks co-designed by children receiving treatment for cancer and donates one pair of socks to a child in the hospital for each pair purchased. \"We started having a lot of people sending in photos of themselves wearing Zamari's socks out and about. And for this 14-year-old who was battling non-Hodgkin lymphoma, it was this little bright spot of, 'Wow, there are all these people out in the world thinking of me as I'm going through this journey, '\" said Teitelbaum in an inter - view.

Frontline Nurse Receives Diagnosis of Stage 4 Non- Hodgkin Lymphoma and COVID-19 HELENE NEVILLE TRAVELED to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to assist a long-term care facility with COVID-19 care, but when she had a fever and headache, it wasn't COVID-19 she was diagnosed with at first. After Neville's symptoms increased, she was diagnosed with stage 4 non- Hodgkin lymphoma while in New Mexico, and she couldn't return to work until her treatment was completed. Neville has been a traveling nurse for 36 years and wanted to help on the front lines by helping to care for patients with COVID-19. Because she worked through exhaustion and extra shifts, she attributed some symptoms to long hours. When she couldn't ignore her symptoms anymore, she sought help. \"I just said, 'I don't know anybody here. I'm a traveling nurse. I didn't even sign my insurance stuff. I'm so sick, but can you take care of me?' And then I passed out right on the floor, \" Neville recalled in an interview.

Woodhull was a fixture at FORCE over the past decade, serving on the board of directors and most recently, as president, until she resigned due to her health. Woodhull also helped create FORCE's clinical trial match - ing program, the first matching tool specifically for patients with inher - ited gene mutations and hereditary cancers, allowing many to find the clinical trials they're desperately looking for. Woodhull inherited a BRCA mutation from her mother, who died of breast cancer at age 46. What Woodhull didn't know at that time was that she also inherited an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. Woodhull learned about FORCE after receiving a diagnosis for advanced ovarian cancer in 2010 and remained an active participant in the organization until her death. \"My personal philosophy is that although I did not choose to be on this (hereditary breast and ovarian cancer) journey, I can choose how I travel it, \" she said in a previous blog post on FORCE's website in 2016. \"I refuse to live in fear of the 'what ifs' and choose instead to live with joy and appreciation \u2014 and part of that appreciation is choosing to be an active part of this inspiring FORCE community. \" 18 WINTER \u00b7 2021 PHOTO COURTESY OF CYNTHIA HAYESCYNTHIA HAYES RECEIVED A diagnosis of endometrial cancer five years ago, and the treatment was a \"grueling experience.\" During her treatment, not only did she feel physical side effects, but she also felt a sense of isolation and fear of her impending death, both of which she originally thought were fatigue and depression. Once someone at her gym started sharing their cancer story with her, she knew she wasn't the only one. \"I was feeling all alone, and somebody was parroting back to me exactly what I was feeling,\" Hayes said. \"It gave me the sense that, wow, if I'm not the only one who feels this way, why is it that I feel like I'm the only one who feels this way?\" As she spoke with more patients with cancer, she real - ized that this emotional experience was more common than she originally believed, which was one of the drivers for her writing her book, \"The Big Ordeal: Understanding and Managing the Psychological Turmoil of Cancer,\" published by River Grove Books in February 2021. \"We don't do enough to talk about the fact that cancer is an emotional diagnosis,\" Hayes said. \"There are physi - ological reasons why it's an emotional diagnosis, but because of the way our health care system works, the way our society works, we don't talk about emotions. We don't talk about emotional health.\" For this book, Hayes collaborated with several experts \u2014 including her oncologist \u2014 to discuss the emotional side of cancer, starting with the diagnosis, into treatment and recovery, and finally progression or recurrence. Before her diagnosis, Hayes was the chief marketing officer for Montefiore Medical Center in Bronx, New York, where she was responsible for Understanding the Emotional Aspects of the Cancer Journey Although physical effects of cancer may be well known, people often overlook the emotional responses that patients with cancer experience. By DARLENE DOBKOWSKI, M.A.BOOKSHELF CORNER19 marketing and communications. It was here where she connected with several doctors to not only run the idea of the book by them, but to work with them to write it. Hayes wants readers to understand that their emotions are valid throughout this journey. \"They don't need to judge themselves harshly because they are feeling stressed, anxious and fearful of their own mortality,\" she said. \"Cognitive impairment, whether it is due to chemotherapy or just the overwhelming, under - lying stress of coping with cancer, that's a real thing. It's not that you're making it up, shirking your responsibili - ties or being a lesser citizen because you are having this emotional response to cancer.\" Through discussions with neuroscientists, Hayes learned that cytokines, small proteins in the body that serve as chemical messengers, play a role in changing a patient's brain chemistry during their cancer journey. Cancer itself and chemotherapy both cause increases in cytokines. Some immunothera - pies are actually comprised of cytokines. Cytokines are good up to a point, Hayes said, although high levels of cytokines can lead to \"sickness behavior,\" or the persistent desire to stay in bed and hide during treatment. \"Some of that sickness behavior is actually good because the body does have to recover from the physical onslaught of cancer, but some of that sickness behavior is what contributes to the emotional spiral that many patients find themselves in, where they are depressed and overwhelmed and (they) can't imagine that they're ever going to get well, and (they are) feeling anxious all the time and fearful,\" Hayes said. \"That's a chemical imbalance. I really wish that I had understood that so much of what I was experiencing (during my treatment) was chemically driven.\" She also connected with patients and caregivers she met through her family and friends. This then expanded to meeting people through the doctors she spoke with and even social media to form an \"ever-expanding circle,\" Hayes said. She emphasized the importance of including the caregivers' perspective in her book due to the critical role they play in the patient's journey. \"I wrote this book in large part for cancer patients, but also for the caregivers, because I like to say caregivers get cancer, too,\" Hayes said. \"Everything that the cancer patient is fearing, the loved one is fearing, as well. I think it makes it very (difficult) for the relationship between a cancer patient and spouse, parent, child, whatever, given those mutual fears are unspoken.\" Fifty percent of proceeds from the book will be donated to The Women Global Cancer Initiative (www.thewomen.org), which is focused on eliminating health care inequities in women with gynecological cancer. This organization was founded by her oncologist, Dr. Ann Marie Beddoe, and aims to bring cancer treatment to underserved parts of the world. \"I recognized that I was privileged to have excellent cancer care, to have my diagnosis come when my cancer was early and to have the successful treatment and recovery that I did because of the support network that I was able to access,\" Hayes said. \"Not everybody is as fortunate, and I believe that there are huge disparities in our health system. This was just one way of me trying to address that as one small cog in this large global health network.\" PHOTO COURTESY OF CYNTHIA HAYES PHOTO COURTESY OF CYNTHIA HAYESBOOKSHELF CORNER \"THE BIG ORDEAL \" is available for purchase on Amazon.com and at other retailers starting February 2021.

Yet many patients, even those eligible to receive CAR-T cell therapy now, may be unaware of the treat - ment strategy, its mechanics or how it could help them. To get a deeper understanding of how this treatment is being used today, as well as the side effects associated with it, CURE\u00ae recently spoke with Dr. Jordan Gauthier of the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance about a new set of CAR-T therapy guidelines for patients released by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). Gauthier, who specializes in CAR-T-related toxicities, elaborated on what the new guidelines hope to achieve, and what patients can expect from treatment. Q:CURE\u00ae : Can you give our audience a brief overview of what CAR-T cell therapy is and how it's used? A:Gauthier: In CAR-T cell therapy, the \"CAR\" means chimeric antigen receptor. So, what does that mean? This is really using your immune system to attack cancer cells. And how does that work? We use one white blood cell type that we call T cells, and we engineer them in the lab to express this new receptor that we call the CAR, or chimeric antigen receptor. So, we \"cook\" the cells in the lab until we have enough of them, Immunotherapy 101: What Patients Can Expect From CAR-T Cell Therapy CAR-T cell therapy is becoming more widely available, with two drugs approved to treat specific blood cancers and more being investigated in clinical trials across cancer types. Here's what patients need to know if they're considering treatment with one of these novel immunotherapies. By JESSICA SKARZYNSKI DRAZEN / STOCK.ADOBE.COM; GAUTHTIER COURTESY BY ROBERT HOOD - FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTERDR. JORDAN GAUTHIER, hematologist/ oncologist at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance UNDERSTANDING CAR-T CELL THERAPY 21 and then we put them in a bag and we infuse them. It's like a transfusion, basically. And after this infusion, the CAR-T cells will roam around (the body), and when they find the target on the surface of the tumor cells, they become activated. They produce a lot of molecules that activate the immune system, (which) we call cytokines, and multiply many, manyfold, and they kill the cancer cells. This new type of immunotherapy has proven very, very efficient in patients who did not respond to standard chemotherapy, for example. Today, there are two available CAR-T cell therapy products that are Food and Drug Administration-approved, one called Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) and one called Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel). And they are approved, still in a very narrow indication, for adults with large B-cell lymphoma and (patients up to the age of 25 with) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). So there is, today, no approved product for adult patients with ALL. This is still fairly early days, because the indication is in the relapsed or refractory (treatment-resistant) setting, which means that you cannot receive this treatment in the front line (as a first therapy). (In order to receive it,) your disease would not be responding to a first-line or second-line therapy, and then we would consider these new treatments. So, these are not standard-of-care, frontline therapies, but maybe someday in the future they will be. Q:This type of therapy often involves just a single treatment, whereas other regimens, such as chemotherapy or radiation, might involve multiple treatments over a course of time. Could that be considered a benefit? A:Yes, I think that's the dream. The goal is to have a one-shot type of treatment where we give the infusion and we wait 28 days. Then we look at how the disease responded and we are good to go, and there's no consolida - tion treatment and nothing else. That's obviously the goal. To date, there is no additional treatment when we give CAR-T cells, and then we have actually observed very prolonged responses, but not in all patients. There's still a lot of work to do to ameliorate or improve the durability of responses. Q:What kinds of side effects can patients expect on this treatment? A:I would say there are four main types of side effects, but the guidelines really focus on two of them. First, I mentioned that when the CAR-T cells meet the target and become activated, it produces the molecules that activate the immune system. We call these molecules cytokines, and the clinical complication that can occur is called cytokine release syndrome (which involves the cytokines overstimulating the immune system so that it attacks healthy organs). That's a very significant side effect that can happen.Another concern is neurologic side effects, or neurotox - icity. We call that ICANS, which means immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndromes. The other effects that are not as detailed in the guidelines, but I think are still important to mention, are the risk of infec - tions and the risk of having low blood counts and the need for transfusions for a couple of weeks or even sometimes a couple of months after the treatment. These are quite significant toxicities as well, but they are not really the main focus of this particular document. Q:Can you give us more information on these new NCCN guidelines around this treatment and how they will help patients? A:These new treatments are very, very promising in terms of efficacy, but they do come with some significant side effects. And I think it's critical to inform patients to the best of our ability as to what can truly happen: What are the main symptoms? When do they happen? How long do they last? What are the treatments for these complications? I think it makes the treatment much more tolerable for patients when, psychologically, they can anticipate and they're not caught off guard completely when something happens. So I think it's really to raise awareness regarding the side effects and improve patient education, and it's a really thorough document. Q:When a doctor recommends CAR-T cell therapy, what kinds of questions would you recommend a patient ask? A:Well, funny you say that, because on page 23 (of the NCCN guidelines), there is a list of possible questions that patients can draw some inspiration from if they don't know what to ask. I think something that is not provided is an approximation of the risk. Patients may think, \"How likely am I to develop these side effects?\" Today, there really is no good prognostic tool, but I think most CAR-T cell physicians will be able to give you a rough estimate as to what is (the) risk of devel - oping very serious cytokine release syndrome or neurologic toxicity. So to me, that's an interesting thing to ask. Last, I think it's important to understand that, when some patients become confused or delirious, caregivers are sometimes even more worried than the patients themselves, who don't sometimes fully realize what's happening. So I think both should really be part of the conversation.

SINCE THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization for two COVID-19 vaccines, one by Pfizer- BioNTech and one by Moderna, many patients with cancer are faced with tough decisions, such as whether to get the vaccine, which one to get and how the vaccine may affect their treatment. To help patients with cancer who are feeling conflicted or are unsure about what to do, CURE\u00ae spoke with Dr. Tian Zhang, assistant professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine and member of the Duke Cancer Institute in Durham, North Carolina, to learn more about these vaccines, how they affect patients with cancer and how to decide what's right for you. Q:CURE\u00ae: What does the emergency use authorization of the COVID-19 vaccine mean for patients with cancer? A:Zhang: Just as a preliminary disclaimer, I am a medical oncologist interpreting the vaccine data for my patients with cancer to the best of our current understanding of how the vaccine works and how our cancer therapies work. But I do think that this emergency use autho - rization is truly a step forward in the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and a breakthrough for modern science that we've been able to generate and clini - cally test the COVID-19 vaccine over just about a year since the first reports of the initial infections. So patients with cancer already have a preexisting condition. And in many large subsets of patients, we've seen more severe COVID-19 infections or higher mortality rates in patients who have cancer and develop COVID-19. Therefore, to me, the approval of the vaccine and the ability to potentially prevent COVID-19 infection is truly paramount to keeping our patients with cancer safe. And although the vaccine trials do not specifically include patients with cancer, I do think that the majority of patients with cancer will have similar immune responses to hopefully develop protective immunity against the (virus that causes COVID-19). Q:Should all patients with cancer receive the vaccine or only patients with certain types of cancer? A:That's a really good question. Patients who have had definitive surgery or radiation for localized cancers are probably the most similar to the normal population, and those patients should definitely undergo vaccination. Should You Receive the COVID-19 Vaccine? With two COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use by the FDA, patients with cancer undergoing treatment have to decide whether it's safe to receive the vaccine and how it might affect their therapy. By DARLENE DOBKOWSKI, M.A. DR. TIAN ZHANG, assistant professor of medicine at Duke University SHINTARTANYA / STOCK.ADOBE.COM26 WINTER \u00b7 2021COVID-19 For patients who are receiving systemic treatments \u2014 and these are for patients who often will have cancer that has spread to a different organ \u2014 it may depend slightly on the nature of the systemic treatment. ... Targeted treatments with small-molecule inhibitors as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors are probably fine and shouldn't impact the protec - tive immune response from the vaccines. Chemotherapy (is) truly cytotoxic (meaning, toxic to cells). Chemotherapy is generally more immune suppressive, but not specifically suppressive of lymphocytes. Those are the B and T cells necessary for protective immune response from a vaccine. And so those patients undergoing chemotherapy should probably have a discussion with their oncologist about the better timing during a chemo cycle to receive the vaccine for the more optimal immune response. The main question, then, is for patients who have a B-cell lymphoma or plasma-cell multiple myeloma, so their systemic treatments are truly suppressing those lymphocyte popula - tions that are specifically necessary to generate an immune response. And so for those patients, I think, the data (are) less clear about whether and how they will be able to generate an immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine. When in doubt, I think patients should ask their treating oncologist about whether it's safe and the right timing of the vaccine for them. Q:You mentioned patients with cancer who could receive the vaccine and patients who should discuss it with their physicians before proceeding, but are there any patients who would simply not be good candidates for this vaccine? A:The FDA label of the vaccine does specifically say patients who have had anaphylactic reactions to prior vaccinations as well as to any components of the vaccine, (which are) listed quite clearly in the FDA label as mRNA, lipids, potassium chloride and sodium chloride, or basically salt, potassium phosphate, sodium phosphate and sucrose. So if patients have had prior truly anaphylactic reactions, they should probably be either carefully monitored during vaccination and the time frame after or they could opt to not receive it for the time being while we await more data. Q:Do you think this emergency use authorization from the FDA will allow patients to come back into the office for oncology appointments? And if so, when? A:Our in-person visits have been ebbing and flowing basically depending on the incidence of COVID-19 in a certain geographic area. So I think that answer kind of depends on where people are practicing. But in general, I think when oncologists and nurses in the outpatient centers have been vaccinated, that will provide a safer environment for everyone coming in and out of the cancer center. And that safe environment will be even further enhanced when patients are also vaccinated. So, you know, from best esti - mates, I would hope that this would happen in the next three to six months.Q:So let's focus now on the blog post you wrote for the Kidney Cancer Association, in which you mentioned that patients with kidney cancer undergoing targeted treatments or immunotherapy may still be candidates for the vaccine. Do you mind going into more detail about that? A:Patients with kidney cancer in our front-line settings are often getting what we call anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) treatments that are targeted against angiogenesis (forming new blood vessels from preexisting vessels) \u2014 what I commonly term blood-vessel blockers for our patients. Those patients probably should not have any immune-suppressive effects (from) their treatments so their response to the COVID-19 vaccine will likely be almost as good (as patients not undergoing treatment for kidney cancer). We don't have direct data to say, but based on best estimates, these patients may have a good response to generate a protective immunity against COVID-19. For patients who are on immunotherapies for kidney cancer, these immunotherapies are generally checkpoint inhibitors, (which block proteins called checkpoints that sometimes keep T cells from killing cancer cells). This is more to activate the T cell response against (the cancer). So in general, for patients who have kidney cancer who are on these targeted immunotherapies, these should not impact their immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine. There are some ... rare kidney cancers that are treated with chemotherapies and cytotoxic chemotherapies. So for those patients, I think there should be a discussion about when during (chemotherapy) would be best and optimal for a patient to have a protective immunity response against the vaccine. Q:If a patient is currently undergoing cancer treatment and concerned about the vaccine potentially negatively impacting the treatment they're receiving, what advice would you give them? A:(Because our patients with cancer and preexisting conditions are at risk) of severe COVID-19 infections and (even) dying from COVID-19 ... I would think the benefit of receiving the vaccine outweighs the risk. In thinking about the When in doubt, I think patients should ask their treating oncologist about whether it's safe and the right timing of the vaccine for them. \" \u2014 DR. TIAN ZHANG PROXIMA STUDIO / STOCK.ADOBE.COM27 COVID-19GOLIBTOLIBOV / STOCK.ADOBE.COMPfizer vaccine data, there was about a 94% vaccine efficacy compared to the placebo. And so certainly, the protection that the vaccine potentially has outweighs the risk of the side effects. ... We can specifically talk some more about patients with lymphomas or multiple myeloma, (for which) their cancer-targeting treatments are specifically inhibiting B-cell populations. But in most cases of solid tumors especially, the vaccine response should not change how they respond (to) anti-cancer treatment. Q:What advice would you give patients with all cancer types who are on the fence about whether to receive the vaccine or hold off? A:Sure, and this is where I think patients with cancer are a particularly vulnerable population because they already have a preexisting condition. Depending on where their cancer is, it might impact their lungs or their ability to really combat the virus, and patients who develop severe pneumonias may have more severe courses based on their prior malignancy. And so I do think that it may be a case-by-case, individual decision. But in most cases, the benefit of receiving a vaccine to prevent potentially severe COVID-19 infections or possible death ... outweighs the risks of the vaccine itself. Q:Are there any other negative effects, potential drug-drug interactions or even other side effects with the vaccine that would specifically affect patients with cancer? A:I've thought very hard about this question. And the only one that I (came up with) \u2014 and it's somewhat hypothetical \u2014 is that patients who are undergoing treat - ment targeted against B-cell lymphomas or multiple myeloma plasma cells ... may or may not amount the right immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine. (They) are a small but significant population, (and) further discussion with their oncologist should determine if and when they should receive it.Q:As more vaccines receive this emergency use authorization or are approved by the FDA, how can patients decide which vaccine is best for them? A:There's a beautiful review in Nature about these vaccines. (There are) about 140 preclinical studies of vaccines, (with) 20 vaccines currently in phase 1, about a dozen in phase 1 to 2 and about 10 in phase 3 trials. And as of Dec. 16, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the only one that's fully approved in the U.S., but the Moderna one is set for FDA review this week. (Since then, the Moderna vaccine has been authorized for emergency use by the FDA.) So there's no direct head-to-head comparisons of the vaccines, but if there's similar vaccine efficacy of each compared with placebo, I think that patients should prob - ably choose the one that is available for them the fastest, the one that they can receive the earliest. Both vaccines (require) two doses. The booster shot (for Moderna's vaccine) is four weeks after the first dose and Pfizer's is three weeks after the first dose. Q:It somewhat goes without saying that it's crucial for all patients, whether they have cancer or not, to stay on that vaccination schedule? A:Yes, I do think that booster is going to be necessary. And, you know, there could be a lag time of patients presenting with symptomatic COVID-19. But, certainly, that booster dose seems to be further protective. Q:Is there anything else you'd like to mention about this topic? A:These vaccines are intramuscular injections and likely will generate a type of antibody that's more systemic called IgG antibodies. So these antibodies are not the ones on the mucosal surface, which are more IgA antibodies. So patients still could theoretically harbor the (virus) and pass it to others. And there are other patients who, as you mentioned, can't or won't receive the vaccine. That's why I think we should all still wear masks, avoid large gatherings and practice good hand hygiene until the time when we seem to have eliminated the COVID-19 threat. We also don't know about long-term loss of immunity and when patients and people will need booster vaccinations. There are many vaccines that adults receive booster vaccines for during their lifetimes, and potentially COVID-19 will be one of those. And I think that depends on long-term follow- up for these patients who have generously participated on the studies in terms of following their antibody titers and when we think that these patients might lose their immunity. I think there's still a lot to learn as we follow these patients longer. But overall, with the approval of the vaccine, there is this glimmer of hope that sometime in the coming year, hope - fully patients and people will all be protected through these vaccines. And hopefully we will all be safer and healthier. This interview has been edited for clarity and conciseness . Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for emergency use by the FDA.28 WINTER \u00b7 2021MANY PATIENTS DEFER TO their oncologists for advice on managing cancer. Roxane Vermeland, however, was committed to making her own treatment decisions every step of the way. Vermeland developed breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), a type of cancer not yet well understood, after undergoing mastec - tomy and reconstruction due to breast cancer. Because all her doctors had limited experience treating BIA-ALCL, she felt it was crucial to study clinical diagnosis and treatment guidelines and discuss them with her care team. In part due to her persistence, Vermeland is now cancer free, and she encourages others with the disease to also advocate for themselves. BIA-ALCL has been linked to textured breast implants filled with either saline or silicone \u2014 in particular, Allergan's Natrelle Biocell brand \u2014 and as of Nov. 5, 2020, has been diagnosed in 1,136 patients, 36 of whom have died, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In response to a July 2019 FDA request, Allergan, which has since been purchased by AbbVie, issued a worldwide recall of those products.On Sept. 28, 2020, the FDA urged the makers of breast implants to supplement their labeling to include a boxed warning and a patient decision checklist focusing on health problems that can arise from the implants, in particular, two major health issues: BIA-ALCL and breast implant illness, an autoimmune condition that can result in brain fog, fatigue, rash, and muscle or joint pain. Vermeland considers that a victory for patients but remains committed to creating more awareness around the issue. \"We do believe that many more women will be diagnosed properly by generating much-needed attention around this cancer,\" she says. COPING WITH IMPLANT ISSUES In November 2012, Vermeland was shocked to learn she had breast cancer in both her breasts, with infiltrating ductal and ductal carcinoma in situ T1c in one and T1b in the other. Vermeland underwent surgery at Rush Copley Medical Center in Aurora, Illinois, on Dec. 14, 2012, and had expanders put in at the advice of her plastic surgeon so reconstructive surgery could be performed later; she was not, however, informed of the risks of getting another cancer. On Jan. 14, 2013, Vermeland began five months of harsh chemotherapy that included Adriamycin (doxorubicin), Taxotere (docetaxel) and Neupogen (filgrastim). \"I cried every time I went because I knew how sick it was going to make me,\" Vermeland says, adding that her side effects were ongoing and included hand-foot syndrome (swelling, redness and pain on the soles of the feet and/or palms of the hands), breast cellulitis (infection of the skin and tissue from bacteria), body aches, neuropathy (weakness, numbness, tingling or pain in the hands or feet) and weight loss. In October 2013, almost a year after her diagnosis, Vermeland had smooth saline implants made by Mentor placed by her plastic surgeon, but problems cropped up right away. \"They just wouldn't stay in place,\" she says. \"I went into surgery probably two more times for him to straighten them and do some fat grafting, but they always looked terrible.\" In April 2014, her plastic surgeon offered to replace them with Allergan's Natrelle 410 textured implants that Advocating for Herself Amid Treatment for a Rare Cancer One patient with breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma spoke out for herself throughout therapy \u2014 and encourages other patients do the same. By BETH FAND INCOLLINGO PHOTO COURTESY OF VERMELAND ROXANE VERMELAND and her husband, CRAIG, who's been her support.SPEAKING UP PHOTO COURTESY OF VERMELAND29 SPEAKING UP he recommended highly, assuring Vermeland and her husband that the product would not put her at risk of developing a new cancer. SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS In July 2015, the area around Vermeland's implant filled with fluid. Her plastic surgeon tried to improve their appearance with fat grafting, but he never tested the fluid to determine if it could be associated with cancer. It wasn't until July 2018, when her left breast swelled to triple the size of her right that Vermeland did some research online and learned about BIA-ALCL. Although her plastic surgeon said that her breasts looked fine, Vermeland requested an MRI and that he test the fluid spotted during the imaging for CD30, a protein that can signal the presence of BIA-ALCL. The fluid was drained by a radiologist, who was instructed to put in a drain \u2014 but did not have orders to test the fluid. While on the operating table, Vermeland needed to advocate for herself again by requesting he call her plastic surgeon for orders, which he did. The fluid was tested by flow cytometry and immuno - chemistry in labs at Rush Copley Medical Center in Aurora, Illinois, and at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Vermeland went into septic shock a week after her drain was removed due to an infection from her left breast implant. Her plastic surgeon was called immediately to remove her left implant. Her husband asked her plastic surgeon to remove not just the implant but also the surrounding capsule made of scar tissue that forms around implants during healing. He told the doctor that this would allow Vermeland to avoid a second surgery later and prevent the spread of cancer that could occur if the capsule was disturbed but not removed. Despite the suggestions, the surgeon only removed the left implant and multiple samples of the capsule, which were tested for CD30. This left Vermeland in fear for her life.To make matters worse, she had trouble getting any physician to disclose her test results. \"Both (the surgeon and my oncologist) knew nothing about that cancer type,\" she says. FACING STAGE 4 After receiving a diagnosis of BIA-ALCL on Aug. 11, 2018, Vermeland underwent a positron emission tomography (PET) scan on Aug. 23, 2018, at Mayo Clinic that identified effected mammary lymph nodes, which were false positive due to surgery a few weeks prior. This led to their removal on Aug. 24, 2018, along with the other implant with the capsule, the remaining capsule from left implant and part of Vermeland's ribs to get to the mammary nodes. She was given a negative result for CD30. Her next PET scan three months later showed more mammary nodes lighting up, which biopsy results proved positive. After multiple second opinions, Vermeland chose removal of the nodes through cryoablation at Mayo Clinic to potentially bypass chemotherapy. Unfortunately, more nodes were affected, requiring more biopsies and several other PET scans at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, all of which were either negative or inconclusive. In July 2019, after a PET scan and a few more biopsies, she was told she was in remission. However, Vermeland was convinced otherwise because she could still feel an enlarged node along with persistent chest wall pressure. \"It was the worst thing,\" she says. \"I was supposed to be happy, and it was so sad for me because I felt the results just were not correct. My family was telling me to move on, thinking I (was) being too pessimistic. I was confused what to do.\" At her next PET scan in November 2019, doctors saw positive nodes throughout her body, including her lungs. Vermeland had advanced to stage 4 disease. We do believe that many more women will be diagnosed properly by generating much- needed attention around this cancer. \" \u2014 ROXANE VERMELAND PHOTO COURTESY OF VERMELAND30 WINTER \u00b7 2021Hematologists at Mayo Clinic wanted to treat her with a multichemotherapy regimen known as CHOP Vermeland was against it. At the First World Consensus Conference on BIA-ALCL that she attended in October 2019, Vermeland had learned that Adcetris, an antibody-drug conjugate that targets CD30-positive cells, can be used alone to treat the disease. Past treatment guidelines recommended giving CHOP (or that regimen with Adcetris replacing vincristine) as the preferred treatment for BIA-ALCL that had spread. After lengthy discussions and a second opinion from MD Anderson Cancer Center, she completed treatment with Adcetris at an affiliate of Northwestern Medicine in Geneva, Illinois. \"I had a lot of side effects including neuropathy, and I was in the (emergency room) a bunch of times,\" she recalls. \"But after I got my second PET scan during treatment on June 8, 2020, it showed I was in remission. It was unbeliev - able. My oncologists at all clinics were in awe. I was the miracle child.\" ADVISING OTHERS Vermeland has these suggestions for other patients undergoing mastectomy: Find a plastic surgeon who is well informed about all kinds of implants, is familiar with the symptoms of both BIA-ALCL and breast implant illness, is willing to test for CD30 and knows how to remove both implants and capsules. For patients who suspect they have BIA-ALCL, Vermeland warns that most health insurers won't pay for testing or implant removal unless the patient has survived breast cancer. According to Allergan, it is not recommended that asymptomatic women remove their Biocell implants, and the FDA recommends against this as well. Those who do choose explant will receive a free pair of smooth implants from the company, although it will not pay for surgery. Women with Allergan implants and a confirmed case of BIA-ALCL receive $7,500 from the company, but they must sign a document releasing the company from liability, Vermeland says. The company did not respond to a request for comment on the issue. Some women are suing Allergan, claiming that Biocell implants contain unsafe particles and contaminants, according to an article on aboutlawsuits.com. The women allege that they may have avoided BIA-ALCL if Allergan had been more forthcoming about the dangers of the implants, the article states. Vermeland also points out that breast implant illness is not covered by insurance because it's not recognized as a medical condition, although patient advocates want the FDA to change that. She notes that Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research, can help patients get insurance to pay for this by identifying the best codes to use when filing claims. Still, Vermeland says, \"We need funding to help these women. They are doing GoFundMe pages to get their breast implants removed.\" CREATING CHANGE Giving patients the care they deserve requires action, Vermeland says. She suggests that efforts should start with studies of patients who have BIA-ALCL, the therapies they've received and their health outcomes so treatment guidelines can be continually updated. In addition to the guidance it recently issued, the FDA created a registry of patients with BIA-ALCL in 2012 called PROFILE (thepsf.org/PROFILE). Still, \"it's just not enough,\" Vermeland says. She wants the FDA to force Allergan to pay for the removal of its textured implants in any patients who want the procedure. In addition, Vermeland and three other women started a Facebook group, the BIA-ALCL Global Patient-Clinician Site, aimed at patients, doctors and advocates. \"We hope to contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of women with the disease and to the prevention of more cases in the future,\" she says. \" As we say very frequently these days: 'Not our daughters.'\" VERMELAND and her husband, CRAIG , play golf in their spare time.

How can we end this disparity? By KATHERINE MALMOCANCER SEES 33 ANUSORN / STOCK.ADOBE.COM ADAPTED BY GWEN SALAS Here's the grim truth of the matter: According to the National Cancer Institute, Black people are more likely to die of most cancers than any other racial group. Despite improvements in cancer outcomes across the population in recent years, racial disparities remain. Dr. Luis Raez, chief scientific officer and medical director of Memorial Healthcare System's Memorial Cancer Institute in Pembroke Pines, Florida, says the problem persists partly because it's too complex for a single explanation or solution. \"It's a social problem, it's a biological problem, it's a system problem,\" Raez says. \" And so we need to tackle the problem from all corners, and hopefully one day we'll improve the health care of all patients.\" Temi Omaghomi, a Black 23-year-old compliance analyst diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ in June 2020, experienced this form of racism when she did not receive the same level of breast cancer care as her White counterparts. DISPARITIES COVER STORY 34 WINTER \u00b7 2021 JEN BRAVO TEMI OMAGHOMI, who received a diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ, experienced racism throughout her journey. \"Diagnosis was a really hard time, and I didn't feel like I was being treated as I should have been,\" Omaghomi says. \"But it wasn't until I found an online support group \u2014 and the White women told me what the doctors should have been testing and scanning for \u2014 that I realized what I was missing. And nobody even talked to me about fertility. Nobody offered me a therapist or a dietitian. These things were offered to others but not to me.\" So how do we ensure that Omaghomi and people of all races have the same access to high-quality cancer care and the best possible rates of recovery? THE PROBLEM Disparities in cancer treatment can be measured in a variety of ways: The number of new cases, existing cases, death rates, survival, stage at diagnosis, etc. Regardless of how you ask the question, the answer is still tragic. According to a 2020 Cancer Disparities Progress Report by the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR): Black men are 111% more likely to die of prostate cancer than White men. Black women are 39% more likely to die of breast cancer than White women. Asian Pacific Islanders are twice as likely as White Americans to die of stomach cancer.Darcie Green, executive director of Latinas Contra Cancer, a nonprofit organization in San Jose, California, that provides services to the underserved Latino popula - tion around issues of cancer, says there isn't a single problem but \"a fabric of problems that lead to prevent - able, predictable, adverse health outcomes.\" DISPARITIES IN HEAL TH CARE ACCESS According to the National Cancer Institute, patients who have low incomes, low health literacy or lack health insur - ance, transportation to a medical facility or paid medical leave are less likely to have cancer screening tests than patients who don't face these obstacles. \"Nobody needs to die of cervical cancer,\" Green says. \"It's slow growing and can be detected early and prevented. But Latinas are still disproportionately impacted by it, and that's largely because we face barriers to care in the area of cervical cancer screenings and HPV vaccines for younger Latinas.\" And the challenges continue, even after receiving a diagnosis. \"When you are diagnosed with cancer, it can be disrup - tive and scary for anyone,\" Green says. \"But if you're in a household that is already food or housing insecure, plus now you've lost your income and have inadequate health insurance, this will negatively impact your health.\" Diagnosis was a really hard time, and I didn't feel like I was being treated as I should have been. \" \u2014 TEMI OMAGHOMI BRIAN KLEMM35 JEN BRAVO \"Rosemary,\"* a 48-year-old Hispanic woman with kidney cancer who is living in the U.S. without legal permission and only had insurance that covered medical emergencies, experienced these hardships last year. In January 2020, she went home from cancer surgery with a new pain in her rib cage that didn't go away. \"I wasn't able to go back to work because something felt weird,\" she said. \"It felt like the doctor had moved my organs and not put them back in the right place.\" Her husband was deported, and her daughter was away at college. Eventually Rosemary moved in with her sister, but was unable to pay rent and did not qualify for many assistance programs because of her documentation status. A year later, she is still struggling to recover her health. SOCIAL FACTORS Rick Kittles, founding director of the Division of Health Equities at City of Hope, a cancer research and treatment center near Los Angeles, says about 40% of adult cancers can be prevented by lifestyle changes such as reducing or eliminating tobacco, for example. \"Some people say your ZIP code is a bigger predictor of disease than your genetic code,\" Kittles says. \"Some neighborhoods lack access to a gym or YMCA, grocery stores and quality school programs. And because some of these communities have been overrun with drugs or crime, people may not feel safe going out or riding bikes. So these commu - nities look different, and their outcomes are different than those communities that are safer and have better access to things like physical activity and quality foods.\" RACISM AND CUL TURAL MISTRUST Green says they encourage their clients at Latina Contra Center to overcome this mistrust and advocate for them - selves. She notes that many of them have to push to be heard in a way she doesn't hear about as often from White patients. Dr. Miranda Lam, radiation oncologist at Dana-Farber/ Brigham and Women's Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School in Boston, conducted a study that examined dispar - ities in death rates between Black and White patients after cancer surgery. Lam says there have been policy efforts to encourage hospitals to focus on quality improvement, which may have led to improved cancer outcomes overall. Unfortunately, higher mortality among Black patients with cancer (compared with White patients) still persists. \"The majority of recent efforts have not directly addressed a component of structural racism that may be underpinning the gap in outcomes,\" Lam says. \"Critical race scholars have argued that racism produces significantly higher rates of morbidity and mortality and decreased overall well-being.\" THE SOLUTIONS Maimah Karmo, founder and CEO of Tigerlily Foundation, an organization that provides education, awareness, advocacy and support for young women with breast cancer, thinks a world without disparity should be the goal. \"(COVID-19) touched the entire world,\" she says. \" And all the world's focus and energy and money went into finding the vaccine, and look what happened? We found one \u2014 in less than six months, and multiple global organizations are working to create other vaccines. Think of the level of money, corporate commitment, time and diversion of focus to immediately put out the fires of this pandemic. Why not put that kind of focus on ending barriers to care for Black people? ... How many more deaths do we need before Black people get the right care?\" One study of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system found that Black men were slightly less likely than non-Hispanic White men to die of prostate cancer in the 10 years following diagnosis. Some say this is because Black men were less likely to experience treatment delays in the VA 's system, but others say that the study did not factor in patients who left the VA system to get care elsewhere. The study was unable to conclusively show that equal access to medical care is the only reason disparities were not seen.

SOCIAL FACTORS One way to prevent avoidable cancers is to increase patient education and health literacy in Black and Hispanic popula - tions. A lot of information can be found through nonprofit and advocacy organizations like the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Tigerlily Foundation and Latinas Contra Cancer. \"We want patients to ask questions and to be curious because it's their body and they're coming to the table with something too,\" Green says. \"Make sure to bring up any concerns, no matter how small.\" Raez, who says that 35% of Memorial Cancer Institute's patients is made up of minorities, relies on patient naviga - tors to help make appointments and resolve insurance and financial problems. Getting to the root of this problem, however, involves ending socioeconomic disparities in the United States. This would help people in disadvantaged neighborhoods live healthier lives and reduce the incidence of prevent - able cancer. A report on the complexity of this topic by AACR calls for new strategies in education and interven - tion and a deeper look into how to solve socioeconomic disparities. RACISM AND CUL TURAL MISTRUST At Tigerlily Foundation, Karmo is working to tackle racism in the medical system head-on with a variety of programs designed to educate patients and the medical community. After Omaghomi discovered the support group and Tigerlily Foundation, she found a new doctor who talked her through everything she needed to know and all her treatment options. Her advice for other newly diagnosed people of color? \"First, it's hard, but breathe and take it one step at a time,\" she says. \"There are some things you can control and some that you can't. So let go of what you can't control. Surround yourself with support groups, and keep looking until you find a doctor you feel comfort - able with and understand.\"37 CLINICAL TRIAL ENROLLMENT Raez believes one way to increase clinical trial enrollment is to have more professionals of color in the research field, which could help patients with trust and language barriers. But more needs to be done. \"When researchers are competing for grants, they should be required to provide a specialized outreach plan that ensures they have certain demographics in their trial,\" Green says. \"The grant money should depend on meeting those numbers.\" Kittles believes part of the solution rests in the hands of academic medical centers. \"I firmly believe many of these ivory tower academic institutions can increase diversity in clinical trials by offering more charity care to patients who are underinsured or unable to pay,\" he says. Raez has a slightly different take, saying that the drug companies should choose to operate their clinical trial programs in public hospitals, even though some patients who are homeless or underinsured may not return for follow-ups. \"They say the (Food and Drug Administration) cannot mandate that minorities must be enrolled in clinical trials, but why not?\" Raez says. \"If 30% of the population of this country is minority, then why should the FDA approve the use of a drug that is tested entirely on the non-Hispanic White population? How do you think it's going to work for the other 30%?\" MOVING FORWARD Latinas Contra Cancer started helping Rosemary with housing after her first surgery in March 2020. Then in December 2020, she underwent another surgery to remove an ovarian cyst, and a day later, she started showing symp - toms of COVID-19. She tested negative before the surgery, but then tested positive after the surgery. She believes she contracted it during the operation. Because of this, she was unable to recover at her sister's place (where she' d been living) and unable to pay for a hotel. \"I felt like I was going crazy,\" she says. \"I was lonely, I lost my job, I had no place to stay. I tried to get help from other organizations, but they needed paperwork and docu - mentation I didn't have. I didn't even want to look for help anymore. But then I called Latinas Contra Cancer, and Darcie (Green) got me money for rent and gave me a number to call to talk to someone and get emotional support.\" Rosemary is still struggling, but organizations like Latinas Contra Cancer and Tigerlily are there to help those failed by the medical system. \"We have to get back to our humanity,\" Karmo says. \"We forget this is about humans, not subjects, case numbers or statistics, and that by action or inaction, we are impacting people's lives. Sometimes the weapon people use is silence. How many more people need to die before this changes and we end barriers to care once and for all?\" *Name changed for anonymity.BRIAN KLEMM TOPVECTORS / STOCK.ADOBE.COM ADAPTED BY GWEN SALASPrograms Educate Patients, Medical Community to Reduce Inequities Tigerlily Foundation, an organization that provides education, awareness, advocacy and support for young women with breast cancer, offers the following programs: The #InclusionPledge \u2014 A transparent and tangible framework across stakeholders, holding organizations accountable to make outcomes that will result in dismantling systemic barriers; co-creating solutions resulting in health equity for Black women; and end disparities in our lifetime.

Rolling up her sleeves, she dived into the research, exploring her options and bouncing ideas off family members. After getting a second opinion, she decided to enter a clinical trial. Her decision was made easier because the trial was avail - able in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan. \"I received treatment through the Cancer and Hematology Centers of Western Michigan at both the Spectrum Health Lemmen-Holton Cancer Pavilion and at the Mercy Health Saint Mary's Lacks Cancer Center,\" says Schroder. \"These are the same places I would have gone if I hadn't been part of a trial. They were 10 minutes from my home, which made a big difference, especially after I became more debilitated from the treatment. I also had my close friends available to go with me to my appointments and to offer moral support and relaxation when I needed to get away from everything that I was living through.\" Bringing Clinical Trials Closer to HOME Local access to national cancer studies allows patients to receive promising new treatments in the most convenient setting possible: Their own community. By MARILYN FENICHEL VENIMO / STOCK.ADOBE.COM ADAPTED BY GWEN SALAS40 WINTER \u00b7 2021 AMANDA MONTGOMERY DEBBIE ARRINGDALEThe clinical trial consisted of chemotherapy along with a monoclonal antibody treatment called Rituxan (rituximab) given during each session. This regimen was followed by one shot of radioactive material plus four years of mainte - nance therapy with Rituxan alone \u2014 two years longer than standard of care at that time. By all accounts, the trial was a success. Ninety-four percent of trial participants were without disease progres - sion at the two-year mark. The only downside of the trial was that four years on Rituxan proved to be too long for many patients due to the cumulative toxicities, she found out from her research nurse. At 10 years, Schroder shows no evidence of disease. She attributes her favorable outcome to her local hospital's affiliation with the Cancer Research Consortium of West Michigan (CRCWM), which is made up of 11 hospitals currently running about 140 new trials and monitoring an additional 250 ongoing trials. The consortium, part of the National Cancer Institute's Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), makes it possible for Schroder and other patients like her to participate in national clinical trials and receive the same potentially lifesaving care as patients living closer to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and academic medical centers. NCORP is just one way that national cancer clinical trials can be brought to smaller communities. Health systems and cancer centers have developed other models too. Some large health systems, such as Jefferson Health in Philadelphia, have expanded their reach to outlying communities, offering state-of-the-art trials at several different centers. The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston has expanded on this concept by providing its clinical trial protocols to institutions nationwide within its Cancer Network. Each approach has been structured differently, but all of them have a common goal: Offer clinical trials to patients in the hope of providing the highest-quality care in the most convenient setting possible. NCORP CASTS A WIDE NET For many hospitals and cancer centers, the opportunity to participate in studies developed by NCI is a big draw. NCORP is a large program and is currently funding 46 sites, 14 of which are in minority and underserved communities. It also offers a range of trials, from exam - ining new treatment options and screening techniques to preventive strategies and ways to improve the cancer delivery system. \"Clinical trials are complex to run, and we are able to take some of the burden off the sites,\" explains Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens, a medical oncologist and director of NCORP . \"We provide the infrastructure for the trial and cover the cost of the intervention, which allows the medical team to focus on their patients.\" SUE SCHRODER was able to participate in a clinical trial 10 minutes away from her home.41 AMANDA MONTGOMERYCLINICAL TRIALS FEATUREDEBBIE ARRINGDALECRCWM is a good case in point. \"We would not be able to fulfill our regulatory and financial obligations without NCI support,\" says Connie Szczepanek, director of CRCWM. \"But the relationship is definitely a two-way street. NCI relies on community involvement to collect much-needed data. More than 35% of enrollment in NCI studies takes place in community sites.\" Dr. Richard Deming, principal investigator for Catholic Health Initiatives' NCORP grant, agrees. Deming over - sees a large NCORP grant that has 53 sites nationwide and is also medical director of the Des Moines, Iowa, site, MercyOne Cancer Center. Deming adds that since 85% of patients with cancer are treated at community hospitals, bringing trials to the community makes sense for everyone. \" Allowing community cancer programs to enroll patients has shown that in addition to benefiting patients, it also allows the trials to scale-up quickly, accelerating the speed at which results become avail - able,\" Deming says. Although a common perception is that clinical trials mostly study new treatments, they actually cover many different aspects of cancer care. \"We're currently involved in a screening study, where we're comparing two- dimensional to three-dimensional mammography,\" says Deming. \"This is one of the few clinical trials in 25 years that focused on screening technologies to determine which is most effective for patients.\" Other types of trials include an examination of financial toxicity, a growing problem among patients with cancer. Deming and his colleagues across many sites are evaluating how cost affects patients' quality of life and how concern about finances affects adherence to treatment. Other trials include investigating compliance with oral treatments, which patients take at home, and how to better manage side effects of treatment, such as neuropathy (nerve damage in the hands and feet that result in weakness, numbness and a tingling feeling). Valeria Mason, 61, of Alleman, Iowa, is currently participating in a neuropathy trial that is occurring simultaneously with her chemotherapy and targeted therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer. The drugs in her treat - ment regimen are known for causing neuropathy, so Mason was recruited for the trial to assess the extent of neuropathy over the course of her treatment. \"I was fortunate in that I only had mild neuropathy,\" recalls Mason. \"But I was happy to participate to help other women going through similar treatments. Plus, the research team came to my therapy sessions, so I didn't have to travel or have extra appointments to be a part of the work.\" Deming notes that many patients feel like Mason does, eager to participate in clinical trials to advance science, even if the outcome may not ultimately help them. \"They see it as an altruistic delight to want to help themselves and others,\" he says. Along with patients and institutions, policymaking oncology organizations such as the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the Association of Community Cancer Centers have also become aware of the value of clinical trials in the community. Their growing interest VALERIA MASON is currently participating in a trial while undergoing treatment for breast cancer.42 WINTER \u00b7 2021 AMY BUELOWin this approach has led large cancer centers to develop innovative models specifically designed to meet the needs of their diverse patient populations. BRINGING CLINICAL TRIALS TO PATIENTS Large cancer centers are known for their exemplary treat - ment, but most are located in large cities. The traditional model for clinical trials has been for patients to travel to those centers, but it has becoming increasingly clear that this approach is no longer working for patients. \"We've noticed that over the past few years, patients are actively looking for clinical trials, especially those who have exhausted standard treatments. We had already been growing our network of collaborators, which include 20 institutions in 16 states, by sharing expertise and resources. It was a natural next step to bring them into our clinical trials program,\" says Dr. Michael Kupferman, senior vice president of clinical and academic network development at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. \"We now have 13 cancer network sites with 65 ongoing protocols, for which nearly 1,700 patients have been recruited.\" But clinical trials are complex, so getting a new site up to speed is no easy task. Support in operational capabilities and regulatory and safety oversight, as well as access to data, are just a few issues that must be addressed. Most of the trials, which are usually large phase 2 or 3 trials, were designed by MD Anderson investigators and focus on the most common cancers, including breast, lung, genitourinary and gastrointestinal cancers. Some trials are open that target rare tumors and certain mutations as well. Studies range from investigating new types of radiation for breast cancer to testing new targeted therapies to prevention trials focused on tobacco cessation. \"We have been on a remarkable journey with our collabo - rators,\" says Kupferman. \"In addition to easing the burden for patients, we've been able to work closely with local physicians, educating them on the latest in cancer care. We were among the first to grow clinical trials to scale, and we plan to continue to do so.\" The Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) has a similar model in place, with SCCA's main campus serving as the hub of its five satellites in the surrounding community and its five-state network. The clinical trials in the community are managed by experts from SCCA, who help with start-up, recruitment and overall management. One of the values of this model is that underserved communities have an opportunity to participate in clinical trials. \"The desire to work in these communities has been a huge force in our push to expand our networks,\" says Dr. Jennie Crews, medical director of community sites and research integration for the SCCA Affiliate Network. \"For example, one ongoing trial is conducting genetic testing for men with metastatic prostate cancer. After patients take a saliva swab and send it to designated labs, investigators can determine the frequency of certain genetic markers in this The Human Face of Clinical Trials LINNEA OLSON OF AMESBURY , Massachusetts, has been living with lung cancer for 16 years. She attributes her survival to the six clinical trials in which she has participated. All of those trials took place at Massachusetts General Hospital, part of the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/ HCC) research consortium. Olson's saga began in 2001, when she had a cough, chest pain, and overall weakness and fatigue. At first, doctors didn't consider lung cancer because she wasn't a smoker, but a case of intractable pneumonia finally led to an accurate diagnosis in 2005. Olson was hoping that surgery and chemotherapy would put her in remission. They didn't. She was tested for genetic mutations but did not have EGFR, the only one for which there was a targeted therapy at the time. She hung on until 2008, when she was found to be ALK positive. \"The timing was fortuitous,\" recalls Olson, now 61. \"The clinical trial had just opened up at Massachusetts General Hospital. At that point, they only gave me three to five months to live.\" The phase 1 clinical trial was testing Xalkori (crizotinib), the first available ALK inhibitor. Olson was only the fourth person in the world to receive this drug. \"I started to feel better almost immediately, \" says Olson. \"I had a 70% resolution, which lasted for almost three years. \" Since then, Olson has tried new ALK inhibitors as they've become available in clinical trials. She had five good years with Lorbrena (lorlatinib), although in her last year, chemotherapy was added to the mix. Currently, she is on a clinical trial testing a new antibody treatment. Mass General, a well-established research hospital, has the capacity to conduct complex phase 1 to 3 trials. Although satellite facilities outside Boston are part of the DF/HCC network, most aren't set up to conduct clinical trials like those Olson has participated in. \"Down the road, we hope to be able to provide the requisite infrastructure to those community cancer centers, \" says Dr. Ryan Sullivan, an investigator at Mass General. \"But for patients (with) difficult-to-treat diseases, having the option to go to an academic medical center able to conduct innovative, high-risk clinical trials is lifesaving.\" CLINICAL TRIALS FEATURE SYLVERARTS / STOCK.ADOBE.COM43 AMY BUELOWpopulation. This has proven to be a successful study (that was) relatively easy to conduct in the community.\" Another health system, the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center in Philadelphia, part of Jefferson Health, has gone beyond providing the community access to its clinical trials; it also uses population science to tailor the trials to the needs of its network, which include four Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center Advanced Care Hubs in downtown Philadelphia; Abington, a nearby suburb; Torresdale, in northeast Philadelphia; and Washington Township in New Jersey. \"For example, northeast Philadelphia has a high smoking population, so to better serve that community, lung cancer screening and trials are a priority,\" explains Karen Knudsen, executive vice present of oncology services at Jefferson Health and enterprise director for its Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center. \"In Abington, there is a high level of cervical and ovarian cancer, making this community an excellent candidate for our women's cancer trials.\" Knudsen is passionate about her belief that providing access to clinical trials in the community is essential. \"They are our best chance to improve outcomes and eliminate disparities,\" she said.Although the COVID-19 pandemic has made getting medical care difficult, it has also prompted a few improve - ments to clinical trials. \"We've relaxed the consent process, allowing patients to complete the paperwork online,\" says Crews. \"We've also allowed patients to use local labs to avoid unnecessary travel. Not only have these innovations been safer for patients, they also have expedited these important parts of the clinical trial process.\" McCaskill- Stevens concurs, adding that telehealth, which gives patients easy access to their physicians, will likely play a greater role in clinical trials in the future. By all accounts, the future of clinical trials appears to lie in the community. Other institutions adopting a network model include Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center in Boston, City of Hope in Los Angeles and Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. This growing movement means that more patients than ever will have access to state-of- the-art care. \"For both patients and providers, there is great joy in being part of the pursuit of knowledge,\" says Deming. \"Clinical trials enhance and elevate the overall quality of care and show the communities involved that their health system is committed to excellence.\" SYLVERARTS / STOCK.ADOBE.COM LINNEA OLSON credits her participation in six local clinical trials to her survival from lung cancer.44 WINTER \u00b7 2021 CARLA TEN EYCK45 SKIN CONDITIONS FEATURECARLA TEN EYCKCoping With Cancer Treatment's Effects on Skin By STACY WILLINGHAM As she walked into Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Erin Hazelton was struck by the appearance of the woman in front of her. Hazelton was at the New York, New York, cancer center to begin treat - ment for stage 2 invasive ductal carcinoma. \"I walked into the center right after another woman, and when I heard her give her date of birth (to the receptionist), I realized that she was only a couple of years older than me, but she looked like she was my mother's age,\" recalled Hazelton, who received her diagnosis in 2018. \"When you (get a diagnosis) at age 37 (like I did), it's scary. So much of my identity was tied up in how I looked. I was terrified.\" Although many cancers are unseen, different types of treat - ment can lead to painful, visible side effects. After starting treatment, Hazelton experienced skin side effects including universal hair loss; facial wrinkles and loss of collagen; melasma her face; dry skin; scars; and radiation tattoos. 46 WINTER \u00b7 2021 CARLA TEN EYCKSKIN CONDITIONS FEATURE PHOTO COURTESY OF ERIN HAZEL TON\"In addition to the regular side effects of chemotherapy, which can be devastating to quality of life, newer targeted therapies and immunotherapies have additional side effects of the skin that can be very frequent and very specific,\" says Dr. Nicole LeBoeuf, a dermatologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and director of the skin toxicities program at Dana- Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. DIFFERENT TREATMENTS, DIFFERENT EFFECTS According to LeBoeuf, systemic cancer treatments can gener - ally be grouped into three categories, and the types of side effects patients could experience will depend on the patient's treatment regimen and cancer type. The first category is cytotoxic, or classic, chemotherapy, which most commonly causes side effects including alopecia, or hair loss; painful rashes on the hands and feet; and general rashes elsewhere on the body that can lead to swelling, pain and itchiness. Hazelton's initial regimen included Adriamycin (doxoru - bicin), a chemotherapy drug known as \"the red devil\" because of its harsh side effects, followed up with Taxol (paclitaxel). \"I lost all my hair \u2014 eyelashes, eyebrows, everything \u2014 and my skin looked like I had aged a good 15 to 20 years toward the end of it,\" Hazelton says. \"My cheeks had wrinkles because the collagen wasn't being renewed; I had melasma, which I hadn't expected, that was made worse by the sun.\" She also experienced skin-related side effects from radiation and scars from her lumpectomy. \"My skin started slowly breaking down over the course of my radiation, and at the end of six weeks, I had seeping wounds,\" Hazelton says. \"My nipple looked like it was going to separate from my body.\" The second category of treatment that can lead to skin side effects are targeted therapies, which are linked to the specific drug used for that patient's treatment. \"The most commonly talked-about skin side effect of targeted therapy is called a papulo - pustular, or an acne-like, rash from EGFR inhibitors, or drugs that target the epidermal growth factor receptor mutation. This mutation is found in lung cancers, head and neck cancers, some colon cancers and, rarely, in breast cancer,\" LeBoeuf says. \"In fact, 85% of patients who are treated with drugs that target that particular genetic mutation will develop that rash.\" Another common skin side effect from targeted therapies is hand-foot skin reaction, which causes painful calluses and blisters on pressure points. \"These blisters can occur from doing very normal activities,\" LeBoeuf says. \"Something as simple as going to the grocery store can make a patient's feet look like they've just run a marathon. Someone who works on a keyboard may experience painful blisters on their fingertips when they type.\" Severe skin side effects such as these can prevent patients from resuming everyday activities and make them more likely to discontinue their cancer treatment, leading to a worse prognosis. The third category of treatment leading to skin side effects is immunotherapy, a type of treatment that boosts the body's natural defenses, or immune system, to fight the cancer. \"Immunotherapy is a beast because once you unleash the immune system, you can turn on any and all skin diseases that would happen outside the cancer setting. Anything that could possibly happen in the field of dermatology has been triggered by activating the immune system,\" LeBoeuf says. \"It is amazing and it is ground - breaking...but it can also lead to autoimmune disease in any organ.\" The most common skin-related side effects of immu - notherapies include psoriasis, with bumpy red patches covered in white scales; vitiligo, or whitish patches from lost pigment; and lichen planus, an autoimmune disease that can cause swelling and irritation of the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes. Sometimes the adverse immune events that are activated through immunotherapy persist after the treatment has ended. \"Our approach to these side effects is always to try to uncouple the toxicity from the effects of the drug on the cancer, then target the side effects as specifically as possible,\" LeBoeuf says. \"This leaves the rest of the immune system intact to fight the cancer.\" DEVISING A SKIN-SAVING PLAN Given the variety of possible side effects and the degree to which it may affect a given individual, it can be hard for patients to know which ones to expect and how to manage them if they arise during and after treatment. Dr. Anisha Patel, an associate professor of dermatology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, recommends that patients follow good hair, skin and nail habits before starting treatment: \"Moisturize often, avoid perfumed products, and decrease the use of lacquer on your nails,\" she says. Patients who have a history of skin conditions prior to their cancer diagnosis are more likely to see worsening during treatment. \"If you already have eczema, psoriasis, or acne, those things are more likely to be exagger - ated,\" Patel says. \"If you have a preexisting skin condition, that should be taken care of before your therapy starts, as well.\" ERIN HAZEL TON'S hair started to grow back post-treatment.47 CARLA TEN EYCKPHOTO COURTESY OF ERIN HAZEL TONDuring treatment, certain practices can help prevent the most common side effects. For example, wearing ice- cold gloves and socks and using scalp cooling treatments to restrict blood vessels reduces the chances of hair loss and hand-foot syndrome. Patients should also take steps at home to minimize side effects. Wearing sunscreen, avoiding direct sun exposure and wearing a hat when outdoors can prevent photosensitivity side effects, Patel says. To manage her symptoms, Hazelton applied organic shea butter daily and wore gloves and socks to bed to keep her skin as moisturized as possible. \"My nails were actually amazing during treatment because I was moistur - izing them so religiously,\" she says. \"Whatever your skin can drink up during that time that is nontoxic, contains no preservatives and has no scents will help.\" For patients who are undergoing targeted therapy or immunotherapy, dealing with side effects can be more complicated. \"In general, the newer cancer therapies (like immunotherapy) have very specific side effects, which may require specific treatment,\" Patel says. \"Patients have to go into it with the mindset that they will have some sort of side effect and ask their treatment team what to expect and what they can do to minimize it.\" LeBoeuf recommends that patients seek the advice of a dermatologist, who can work with the medical oncolo - gist to manage skin side effects. \"Whenever possible, if a specific dermatologic diagnosis can (be) made, then the most appropriate treatment can be instituted as quickly as possible,\" LeBoeuf says. \"If you treat the side effect specifically, based on dermatologic literature, then often, patients will recover and can continue their cancer treatment, as well.\" Both Patel and LeBoeuf urge that the mental and emotional side effects of treatment-related skin condi - tions receive as much attention as the physical side effects. \"Often, patients are embarrassed or they feel HAZEL TON applied shea butter and other moisturizing products daily during treatment to manage side effects.I lost all my hair \u2014 eyelashes, eyebrows, everything \u2014 and my skin looked like I had aged a good 15 to 20 years toward the end of it. \" \u2014 ERIN HAZEL TON48 WINTER \u00b7 2021 CARLA TEN EYCKlike they shouldn't be concerned about a side effect that isn't life-threatening,\" LeBoeuf says. \"But the reality is, if a side effect affects your quality of life, increases your stress or changes your course of treatment, it can also affect your ability to fight the cancer. So be open, ask for help and advocate for referrals if you feel you aren't getting the treatment you need.\" Maintaining skin health can also prevent secondary problems such as infections or ulcers and can minimize scarring. Taking one day at a time helped Hazelton maintain a positive mindset. \"Thinking ' Am I going to burn during radiation?' or 'What's my scar going to look like?' doesn't help you mentally. Just approach it as it comes,\" she says. Patients might be surprised to learn that there is a silver lining to skin-related side effects: \"Skin side effects to some of the newer targeted and immune therapies is correlated to having a better tumor response,\" Patel says. \"It is correlated to the body's immune system being revved up to fight the cancer.\" BOUNCING BACK Post treatment, patients should be advised about options to help restore the health of their skin, hair and nails. \"What happens after the treatment isn't talked about as much,\" Dr. Anthony Rossi, a dermatolo - gist and surgeon specializing in skin cancer, lasers and cosmetic surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, says. \"Radiation can cause chronic changes in the skin; surgery, obviously, leaves a lot of scars, and high-dose steroids can leave stretch marks that last forever.\" To combat these side effects, Rossi and his team at Memorial Sloan Kettering are working on what they call \"restorative oncodermatology,\" which, he says, aims \"to restore patients who go through cancer treatment and help them get back the form and function of their skin.\" Through the use of treatments such as topical retinoids, topical skincare, chemical peels, lasers, botulinum neurotoxin (such as Botox) and platelet- rich plasma (or PRP) injections \u2014 an experimental therapy that uses injections of the patient's own blood platelets to prompt hair growth \u2014 Rossi reports that many survivors are seeing life-changing results. \"There is definitely a cosmetic aspect that people want to improve... but these treatments help with skin functionality and overall quality of life, most importantly,\" he says. Hazelton has received chemical peels and laser treatments to reduce her wrinkles and melasma, as well as used over- the-counter eyelash serums to help her hair grow back. \"I thought my life was over when I got my diagnosis. I thought I would never look the same or feel the same ... but there are people out there to help you fix these physical things that remind you of your sickness,\" she says. \" A lot of people bounce back more than they expect they will. ... Your body really does recover; you just have to give it a chance.\" HAZEL TON kept a positive attitude throughout her journey despite her treatment experience.CARLA TEN EYCK CURE\u00ae is now accepting nominations to recognize our 2021 Class of Lung Cancer Heroes\u00ae, individuals who go above and beyond to make a di erence in the lives of those a ected by lung cancer.

Nominat/e.end your Lung Cancer Hero today! Founding BY RAY PELESKOBASAL CELL CARCINOMA (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer, with approximately 8 in 10 skin cancers being BCC. This type of cancer originates in the lower part of the epidermis in sun-exposed areas such as the head, neck and face. It typically grows slowly, but if left untreated, can progress to other areas of the body in addition to the bone. This form of skin cancer is associated with disturbances in hedgehog signaling, which involves certain cells and is critical for skin repair. Hedgehog pathway inhibitors have recently been approved as first-line therapy for patients with advanced BCC and other difficult-to- treat scenarios. Although this novel class of inhibi - tors has been shown to be safe and effective for locally advanced BCC and metastatic BCC, it may not be the right fit for every patient. CURE\u00ae spoke with Jeffrey Wittig, a 62-year-old patient with recurrent BCC who has had skin cancer in one form or another since his 40s. He was treated with hedgehog therapy for BCC, which is now creeping toward his brain. Despite this outcome, he emphasizes the importance of perseverance throughout this process. Q:CURE \u00ae: Can you tell us how your journey with BCC began? A:Wittig: It began a number of years ago, probably more than 15, with small things that were scraped and burned, and (it got) progressively worse to the point where major things were being removed \u2014 large skin grafts, forehead flap. I had radiation in 2012 on the bone in my nose because the BCC had spread to the bone. And then from 2012 to now, (it got) progressively worse to the point that I had a partial rhinectomy four years ago and then a complete rhinectomy three years ago. I had my nose reconstructed at Dana-Farber (Cancer Institute). I guess that would tell you how bad it's gotten and what the journey has been. Q:When you were originally diagnosed with BCC, at what stage were you diagnosed? A:I've had 41 surgeries, so you' d have to be more specific. What I have now is recurrent BCC. It's a strange cancer that's very slow moving. In my case, they don't believe it has metastasized yet, so I'm not sure if there's a stage that they could put on that. They just know that it's marching forward toward my brain at this point. It's gone from my sinus cavity up through my sinus into the ethmoid (cavity) and is perfo - rating bone there as we speak. So the outlook right now is not very good. My prognosis based on my most recent discussion with my oncologist is the \"we're so sorry\" speech because they can't do much more at this point. I had gone back onto Erivedge (vismodegib), which is a hedgehog inhibitor, for 51 days. I started in October, and I continued until New Year's Eve. The toxicity just built up immediately again. Before that, ... I took 227 consecutive doses of Erivedge, then I had taken the whole summer off from Erivedge. I melted down on June 11 last summer from toxicity. And that's when I stopped taking it for the summer. I went from 128 pounds back up to 165 pounds, which was lovely. I had a great summer, best summer ever. All the side effects went away and my appetite came back. And I've actually got little tufts of hair growing here and there now, which had all been gone because (that's) one of the side effects. My MRIs at the time looked clean, but what they found in the last one in September was they had been looking in the wrong place. If they went back six months and looked where the cancer is now, they could actually see a little spot there. They said, \"Oops, sorry.\" So I thought I was good for months and months, and evidently, I was not. So that was a little \u2014 I don't know the accurate word to describe that \u2014 but it was a little disappointing, let's just say frustrating. I met with my doctors at Dana-Farber on January 5, 2021, when I had an MRI and blood work. The results are still not good. If anything, (it) looks a little bigger. My doctor basically talked to me about the odds and the ramifications of trying this immunotherapy, which I wasn't particularly interested in doing, having read all the side effects, which remind me very much of what I'm experiencing still from the hedgehog therapy. If you don't do anything, nothing's going to happen and nothing is going to change, and that's the path (I'm) heading down. ... My wife and I talked about it. ... We quickly came to an agreement that nothing ventured, nothing gained, so let's go with the immunotherapy. Q:What other therapies, if any, did you undergo, and how was it decided for you to be on hedgehog therapy? A:Because of the location of the recurrent BCC that I have now, previous to (hedgehog therapy), I' d had blue light therapy, which is topical. I've had radiation. I had different What's Next After Hedgehog Therapy Fails for Basal Cell Carcinoma? A patient with recurrent BCC discusses his cancer journey, his latest challenge and how he's now prioritized quality of life over quantity. By DARLENE DOBKOWSKI, M.A. ILLUSTRATION BY RAY PELESKOSKIN CANCER JEFFREY WITTIG 50 WINTER \u00b7 202151 ILLUSTRATION BY RAY PELESKOvariations of blue light (therapy) where you sit out in the sun for three hours after they administer this chemo to your head and it basically burns all your head off. In terms of medicine, the hedgehog (therapy) is the first medication that (I've) taken (because) it was determined that we can't treat this any other way. The options right now for me surgically are none, basically. They can remove my right eye, my right orbital bone, my right cheekbone, my right cheek, my nose and my forehead with a significant amount of bone, which will leave me horribly disfigured. Then they can't promise that they will have gotten the cancer. So to me, that's really not an option from a surgical standpoint. My wife and I have spoken about this at great lengths. (For) the surgery that I had for my nose, they took a vein and a piece of bone from my arm and skin, and they removed my whole nose and built a new nose out of this piece of bone, which is screwed into my skull. And they overlaid that with the skin and the vein. They used a vein and snaked it from the graft that they took and brought it down through my face and down into my neck to feed that. It was a pretty significant surgery. It was 19 hours of operation, and I was at Dana- Farber for eight days or (so). And it took me about a year to recover from that with physical therapy and (from) just emotional shock because it's pretty invasive and daunting. So I had a couple good years with the new nose. Then we went back and they said, \"The cancer's back in your sinus.\" So (it was in) the area that they' d spent all their time recon - structing (so) somehow, there's something somewhere. (BCC) is very invasive. They describe it to me as sort of a spiderweb of tiny cells that are all dancing to their own beat. They all march wherever they feel like going, and mine seems to be marching north right now toward my brain. So that's the hand that I've been dealt. Q:How did your cancer team work with you throughout this entire process and how supportive were they? A:Well, it runs beyond that. I have a dermatologist and a surgeon up (in Maine). I still go to the dermatologist every couple of months because I still have things on my head. I've had all three skin cancers. I've had squamous (cell carcinoma) and melanoma numerous times. I'm still getting residual squamous (cell carcinoma) in my head. Fortunately, I haven't had any melanomas in a couple years. I see my dermatologist here, she gets the (pathology) results, she sends me to ... my plastic and hand surgeon, and he does my little surgeries. I call them little ones, but anytime you can be awake and laugh with everybody, that's a good surgery, not a rough one. So I have those people up here. It's sort of my core team. My (primary care provider) through this whole event ... has been critical. There are many spokes on this wheel, and she's been the hub because insurance companies want your doctor to send them this or that. I've literally had probably 10 or 12 doctors in the past 10 years, and it's very difficult to coordinate 10 different doctors independently. So she's been the coach for me, my cheerleader and the hub of this wheel to gather all the information and send it to people as needed. So that is part of my health team up here. The Dana-Farber team is fabulous because of the patient portal and being able to send messages or pictures. After my surgery, a piece of bone fell out of my nose. It looked like a little piece of fish bone. If you're having a lovely meal out, you're having fish and you pull this bone out of the salmon, it's that big. I'm a writer, so I'm writing and this thing goes \"clink\" on the table. I held it up, I took a picture of it and sent it. (My doctor) laughed and said, \"Don't worry about the detritus of the surgery. That's fine.\" Just getting instant feedback like that, and I could email him and he' d email me back in less than an hour because I have his personal email. I have (the Dana- Farber team's personal cell phone (numbers). I can text these doctors, and I get a call back in 15 minutes if I need it. Q:What advice would you give patients in a similar situation to you \u2014 when hedgehog therapy isn't quite working for them to treat BCC? A:I would do what I did, which is go until you don't think you can go anymore because I think it ultimately did help me extend my time here to a significant degree. If I had thrown in the towel a few years ago, I probably wouldn't be here right now. So I guess that and really discussing things. ... I told my oncologist, my dermatologist and my radiologist that I'm not really concerned about quantity at this point, but quality. If I've got two years, how can we make this the best two years? My goal at this point is not to wrap this up with a big bow and call it all good because I know that's not true. Let's be realistic about this and pragmatic. I guess the advice that I give everybody as a patient (is that) the hardest part for a patient is just showing up. Everybody else has the tough job. What do we do for this guy? What can I do in surgery for him? As a patient, I just have to put one step in front of the other and move forward. People are always cheering me on and (telling me), \"You're so brave.\" It's certainly not that at all. Just keep going.

She was also a full-time first-grade teacher, so when she developed a persistent cough, she attributed it to her profession. She visited her primary care provider several times for the cough over a 10-month period, and the focus shifted from bronchitis prevention with antibiotics and cough medicine to an inhaler and steroids for allergies after a chest X-ray came back completely clear. \"It still was getting bad, and at this point, it was pretty bad,\" says Paccione. \"There were nights when I would wake up and I would be choking. I just couldn't control myself.\" At her third primary care visit, the doctor told her that it must be acid reflex, which Paccione thought could be a stretch but trusted her doctor regardless. Over time, her cough was accompanied by tremendous back pain, which she originally thought were muscle spasms from weightlifting. Her primary care provider prescribed Paccione muscle relaxers and pain medicine to alleviate the pain. The straw that broke the camel's back, Paccione says, was when she became breathless after walking up four stairs during a date night with her husband. \" At that point, I (thought), 'OK, there's something desper - ately wrong because I run 10Ks, and now I'm going up four stairs and I can't catch my breath. And so that kind of scared us,\" Paccione says. She also noticed that she was becoming increasingly tired after working four-hour workdays as a summer school teacher. She was taking eight-hour naps after coming home, yet still felt awful. Because she felt some - thing was seriously wrong, she pushed for her doctor to perform testing. Test results showed that she had a 5-centimeter mass in her left lung and stage 4 lung cancer, which had spread to other areas including her brain, bones, liver and lymph nodes. \"It was devastating because, honestly, other than those few symptoms that could be attributed to other things, I felt fine,\" Paccione says. \"There's no way I could have lung cancer. I never had any history of cancer on either side of my family. I was healthy. I've never smoked a day in my life. And, I mean, I was young. How do I have stage 4 lung cancer?\" NO TIME TO WASTE Paccione had biomarker testing performed at the advice of her doctor because the cancer was progressing so quickly. At that time, it typically took three weeks for the results. Because her doctor was worried how much the cancer could progress during that time, Paccione underwent one round of chemotherapy (carboplatin and Taxol [paclitaxel]). Once her biomarker testing came back and indicated that she was ALK positive (meaning her ALK gene had fused with another gene, resulting in a mutation that can cause cancer, and is found in about 5% of non-small cell lung Monotherapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: One Survivor's Story This young mother and athlete discusses receiving a shocking diagnosis of stage 4 lung cancer and her incredible response to treatment with a single, targeted drug. By DARLENE DOBKOWSKI, M.A.LUNG TABITHA PACCIONE, husband, ANTHONY ; son, DYLAN; and daughter, BROOKLYN .57 cancer), Paccione's doctor decided to treat her with the targeted therapy Xalkori (crizotinib), developed for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Compared with chemotherapy, during which Paccione experienced side effects such as hair loss and severe neurop - athy, Xalkori provided her with a more positive experience. \"My hair grew back. I was able to go back to work. I felt great,\" says Paccione. \"I had energy again. I wasn't suffering from any neuropathy anymore. ... I felt really lucky to be able to be on the targeted therapy because the side effects were so much more manageable.\" After taking Xalkori for three months, Paccione underwent her first post-therapy scan, which showed that she was having a complete response to the therapy, with a 60% reduction in the primary mass and responses in her lung, lymph nodes, liver and bones. Because the brain metastases showed no improvement (Xalkori cannot penetrate the blood-brain barrier), Paccione also underwent two rounds of stereotactic radiation. \"But as far as my body was concerned, it was a complete improvement,\" says Paccione. \"I went from not being able to say a complete sentence because I would not be able to breathe and (would) cough uncontrollably, waking up in the night, sometimes throwing up because I couldn't stop coughing, to not coughing at all, being able to walk again and breathe, and not being completely out of breath after taking a few steps. It was shocking because you always hope for the very best, but you're also very cautious as to what you allow yourself to (hope) until it happens.\" Paccione emphasized the importance of a strong medical team, which she attributes to her treatment success. \"You're in the fight of your life, so you need to make sure your medical team is right,\" she says. \"(My doctors) are just phenomenal not only in the sense that they're just very brilliant and very well versed in lung cancer, but emotionally and mentally, I feel safe with them. I know that they're going to fight for me.\" TARGETING BRAIN METASTASES Paccione was treated with Xalkori for exactly one year before switching to Alecensa (alectinib) in October 2017 in an attempt to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, since the metastases in her brain kept returning. Her next scan showed that all the brain lesions had disappeared, enabling Paccione to forego the next treatment option: brain radiation. Paccione is still taking Alecensa, four pills twice per day. This treatment allows her to work full time and participate in the lives of her children, who are now 16 and 12. As thankful as she is for her positive response to the treatment, Paccione understands that everyone may not have the same experience. \"The side effects are minimal, and I know this is different for everyone,\" Paccione says. \"I will stress that not every single person feels exactly like I do. It's different for everybody, but I have great energy. I can breathe. I don't cough anymore. Sometimes I get tired, but I think that just comes with the territory of being a mom, too, and doing everything else.\" LESS WORRY , MORE LIVING Compared with chemotherapy, this monotherapy allowed Paccione to not be sick and in bed. \"Maybe (you) have the quantity of life when you're on chemo, but the quality really isn't there,\" says Paccione. \"You can't sleep at night. You can't really eat anything because you're nauseous. You're tired all the time. And you can't go out and do anything because you're so susceptible to (getting) sick.\" Paccione credits the research to develop this monotherapy for giving her the opportunity to watch her son play water polo and to attend birthday parties with her daughter. \"These treatments are saving our lives. They're giving us time,\" says Paccione. \"Lung cancer is not a death sentence anymore. Thanks to all the research and to (this) monotherapy ... we have more time. When I was diagnosed in 2016, I was told that I would have between three and six months. And so I spent so much time worrying about the future and worrying about whether I needed to write these birthday cards to my kids for all the years that I wouldn't be around. Thanks to these therapies, it's been four years.\" In October 2019, Paccione was told she was in remis - sion \u2014 something she thought would not be possible. After everything she's gone through, and the perspective it brings, Paccione advises and encourages every patient and survivor to share their stories to help others. Hearing someone else's story early on in her own journey with lung cancer would have been beneficial, says Paccione. \"When I was diagnosed, I didn't know anyone that had lung cancer, and it's an overwhelming ... isolating feeling,\" she says. \"But I remember the very first time I met one of my friends that has cancer. I remember looking at her and thinking, 'Oh my gosh, look at her. She has three kids, she's working and she's advocating. One day, I really want to be like that.' Now here I am, and the only reason I share my story is because I want to give that next lung cancer survivor the help that they need to push forward and to live their lives.\" LUNGPHOTO COURTESY OF TABITHA PACCIONEThese treatments are saving our lives. They're giving us time. Lung cancer is not a death sentence anymore. Thanks to all the research and to (this) monotherapy ... we have more time. \" \u2014 TABITHA PACCIONE 58 WINTER \u00b7 2021 PATCHARA / STOCK.ADOBE.COMPATIENTS WITH refractory treated Venclexta (venetoclax) and Rituxan (rituximab) had a sustained progression-free survival and overall survival benefit at five years compared with those treated with bendamustine and Rituxan, according to a long-term analysis of the MURANO trial presented at the 62nd American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition. \"Overall, sustained undetectable (minimal residual disease, or the small number of cancer cells remaining in a patient during or after treatment), progres - sion-free survival and overall survival benefits provide further support for the use of a fixed-duration (combination of Venclexta and Rituxan) in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL,\" said Dr. Arnon P . Kater, leader of tumor immunology at the Cancer Center Amsterdam, during a virtual presentation of the data. In the MURANO trial, 389 patients with relapsed/refractory CLL were randomly assigned either Venclexta with Rituxan (194 patients) or bendamustine with Rituxan (195 patients). At a follow-up of 59.2 months, patients who received Venclexta with Rituxan continued to show sustained progression- free survival (time during and after treatment when cancer does not get worse) compared with those who received benda - mustine with Rituxan. The median progression-free survival in the Venclexta-Rituxan group was 53.6 months, significantly more than 17 months in the bendamustine-Rituxan group. Of the 130 patients who completed two full years of therapy with Venclexta and Rituxan, progression-free survival at 36 months after treatment completion was estimated at 51.1%. In addition, five-year overall survival was estimated at 82.1% for the Venclexta-Rituxan group versus 62.2% for the bendamustine-Rituxan group. Patients assigned Venclexta with Rituxan who reached the end of treatment without disease progression and had undetectable minimal residual disease (83 patients) \u2014 which is important for deep, durable responses \u2014 showed improved overall survival compared with those who had minimal residual disease (35 patients). Survival estimates three years after the end of treatment was 95.3% for those with unde - tectable minimal residual disease and 85% for those with minimal residual disease. In patients with undetectable minimal residual disease, 32 did not have disease progression and continued to have undetectable minimal residual disease out to five years. In addition, four patients had disease progression without prior confirmed conversion to minimal residual disease, and 47 patients converted to minimal residual disease, with a median conversion time of 19.4 months from the end of treatment. Of the 47 patients who converted to minimal residual disease, 19 developed disease progression at a median time of 25.2 months. Importantly, these 19 patients had more rapidly increasing rates of minimal residual disease after completing treatment compared with those with minimal residual disease, yet they remained free from disease progression. During this presentation, Kater noted that the longer a patient maintains undetectable minimal residual disease, the less likely they'll convert to minimal residual disease Several high-risk factors, such as having three or more subtle genetic abnormalities (unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain gene, presence of del(17p) and genomic complexity) were associ - ated with an increased risk of disease progression in patients with undetectable minimal residual disease at the end of treatment. Patients without these high-risk factors \"were more likely to main - tain undetectable (minimal residual disease) or experience (minimal residual disease) conversion without progressive disease at this follow-up,\" said Kater during the presentation. Researchers also investigated the growth rate of minimal residual disease in 102 patients assigned Venclexta with Rituxan and 104 patients assigned bendamustine with Rituxan. The Venclexta-Rituxan group showed a longer mean doubling time (the time for cancer cells or a tumor to double in size) compared with the bendamustine-Rituxan group. \"I'm pretty much myself a believer that, if you can, fixed dura - tion is actually better. And (there are) three reasons for this,\" said Kater in an interview with CURE\u00ae. \"First one is the costs. ... The second one is, indeed, side effects, and although all those novel targeted agents, especially (when compared) to chemotherapy, give much less severe complications, (they're) still complica - tions. ... Most important, the third one is we know for sure that if you take a drug until relapse, that at that moment, this drug doesn't work anymore. ... Still, we have to test it, (but) if you give (the drug) and you stop at a certain amount of time, you can actually repeat the same very effective drugs later on.\" Drug Combo Extends Survival in Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment with Venclexta plus Rituxan demonstrated improved progression-free and overall survival over five years, potentially offering patients a significant period of time without treatment after initial therapy.

These agents, in one way or another, block the action of certain enzymes and protein kinases that perform several cell functions, such as growth, signaling and division, potentially halting the growth of cancer cells. \"Proactive dose modification/interruption and patient and physician awareness may help to reduce toxicity while maintaining efficacy,\" wrote the study authors in the paper published in the Journal of Geriatric Oncology . Researchers analyzed data from 838 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who were treated with first-line tyrosine inhibitors (87%), mTOR inhibitors (5%) or (8%). Patients were analyzed in subgroups by age: younger than 65 (42%), 65 to 74 (39%) and 75 or older (19%). End points assessed in this study include progression-free survival, defined as the time from the start of therapy to disease progression or all-cause death; overall survival, defined as the time from the start of therapy to all-cause death; and time to treatment discon - tinuation, defined as the time from the start of therapy to discontinuation for any reason including disease progres - sion, toxicity, death or another cause. Patients age 75 and older took lower toxicity-adjusted doses of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Votrient (pazopanib; 300 mg) compared with those 65 to 74 years old (400 mg) and patients younger than 65 (600 mg). This effect was also seen with another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Sutent (sunitinib malate; 25 mg, 37.5 mg and 50 mg, respectively). Patients older than 75 received two doses of checkpoint immunotherapy, and younger patients received more doses; patients 65 to 74 years old and those younger than 65 years received five doses each. Dose reductions or interruptions occurred in 76% of patients age 75 and older, in 55% of those 65 to 74 years old and in 41% of patients younger than 65. Older patients also had a shorter mean time to dose reduction or interruption at 0.5 months compared with patients 65 to 74 years old (1.9 months) and those younger than 65 (3.4 months). After adjusting data for prognostic risk scores and the microscopic anatomy of the disease, the findings deter - mined that age did not affect progression-free survival, overall survival and time to treatment discontinuation. \"Data most (inevitably indicate) that older patients ought not to be restricted in their access to both thera - peutic options and several treatments in succession,\" the study authors wrote. \"Present data (reveal) the message that (side effects) and the consequences hereof were not necessarily unfavorable. Treatment efficacy depends on the proactive toxicity-adjusted dosage of drugs.\" The study authors also elaborated on several patient- based factors for doctors to consider when making treat - ment decisions. \"Each patient's point of view must be taken into account not only managing short-term goals, but also long-term goals, concerns, expectations and needs,\" they wrote, adding that \"decisions about cancer treatment should not only take age into account, but crucially their disease-related condition, resulting in individualized patient-centered interventions.\" Age May Not Affect Outcomes from Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Treatment Despite Increased Toxicity in Older Patients Study shows that although patients older than 75 experienced more therapy-related side effects, age did not impact progression-free and overall survival. By DARLENE DOBKOWSKI, M.A.KATERYNA_KON / STOCK.ADOBE.COMKIDNEY Renal cell carcinoma can spread from the kidneys to other areas.62 WINTER \u00b7 2021TREATMENT WITH OPDIVO (nivolumab) plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) was manageably safe and resulted in a promising response in patients with advanced hepatocel - lular carcinoma (HCC) previously treated with Nexavar (sorafenib). \"Based on the results of this study, (1 mg/kg of) nivolumab plus (3 mg/kg of) ipilimumab every three weeks followed by (240 mg of ) nivolumab every two weeks or 480 mg every four weeks received accelerated approval in the United States as a second-line therapy for HCC,\" the study authors wrote. \"Investigation of this combination is underway as a first-line therapy in patients with HCC.\" The combination of Opdivo and Yervoy was previously proven to be effective in treating other tumor types including non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carci - melanoma. trial, whose findings were published in JAMA Oncology , focused on the safety and efficacy of this treatment in patients with advanced HCC who were either intolerant of or had issues with Nexavar. This phase 1/2 randomized clinical trial included 148 patients (median age, 60 years; 81% men) from 31 centers in 10 countries or territories in Europe, Asia and North America. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three arms: Arm A: 1 mg/kg of Opdivo with 3 mg/kg of Yervoy every three weeks at four doses total, Arm B: 3 mg/kg of Opdivo with 1 mg/kg of Yervoy every three weeks at four doses total or Arm C: 3 mg/kg of Opdivo every two weeks with 1 mg/kg of Yervoy every six weeks. Patients in arm A and arm B were then given 240 mg of Opdivo intravenously every two weeks after completion of their assigned regimens. The goals (or outcomes) of this trial included tolerability, safety and objective response rate (a measurable response to a treatment). In addition, tumors were assessed every six weeks until 48 weeks by CT or MRI, which was then conducted every 12 weeks until disease progression. Follow-up was conducted for a median of 30.7 months. The objective response rate was 32% in arm A, 27% in arm B and 29% in arm C. Although the median duration of response was not achieved in arm A, it was achieved in arm B (15.2 months) and arm C (21.7 months). Side effects related to the assigned treatment occurred in 94% of patients in arm A, 71% of those in arm B and 79% of patients in arm C. One treatment-related death occurred in arm A as a result of grade 5 pneumonitis, or lung tissue inflammation. \"To our knowledge, this is the first report of nivolumab- ipilimumab combination therapy in the treatment of advanced HCC,\" the study authors wrote. \"Nivolumab plus ipilimumab provided a robust clinical benefit in patients treated with sorafenib.\" Patients With HCC Respond Positively to Opdivo With Yervoy When Nexavar Is Not an Option Results of this trial led to an accelerated FDA approval of Opdivo (nivolumab) and Yervoy (ipilimumab) in March to treat this specific patient population.

The follow-up findings indicate that long courses of the three-drug regimen can be given safely, said lead study author Dr. Volkmar Mueller, head of the oncology outpatient clinic at the University Medical Center Hamburg- Eppendorf in Hamburg, Germany, during a presentation at the European Society for Medical Oncology Virtual Congress 2020. Tukysa inhibits the activity of proteins known as kinases, helping to prevent the growth of cancer cells. Metastatic breast cancer is disease that has spread beyond the breast to other parts of the body, including the brain in some cases. HER2-positive breast cancer expresses high amounts of the protein human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and is treatable with drugs that target this protein, such as Herceptin. The Food and Drug Administration's approval of Tukysa was based on data from the HER2CLIMB study. Findings showed that the drug, given with Herceptin and Xeloda, lengthened life and delayed disease progression compared with only Herceptin plus Xeloda in patients with metastatic, HER2-positive breast cancer with or without brain metastases who had previous treatment with another anti-HER2 drug. The trial demonstrated that two years after the start of treatment, 45% of patients receiving the three-drug regimen were alive, compared with 27% of patients on the two-drug regimen. Average length of life from the start of treatment was 21.9 months in the triplet group versus 17.4 months in the doublet group. Findings from the trial also showed that the triplet combination had a manageable safety profile similar to that of the Herceptin-Xeloda pairing. Adding Tukysa to the regimen did not increase the percentage of patients requiring hospitalization, Mueller noted. The researchers conducted a follow-up to the HER2CLIMB study because patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, particularly those with brain metastases, have limited treatment options and an increased likelihood of reporting deterioration in their health-related quality of life. Because disease progression is one factor that can negatively impact quality of life, maintaining quality of life in these patients is a key goal of treatment. Hence, the investigators wanted to explore the impact of the more effective triplet combination on health-related quality of life, which was a secondary goal of HER2CLIMB. Patients included in the follow-up had HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and had received previous drugs: brain metastases at baseline. To assess health-related quality of life, the researchers administered a questionnaire to 331 HER2CLIMB participants who evaluated their status in five areas: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/ depression. The patients were asked to rate the severity of the problems they encountered in each category as none, slight, moderate, severe or extreme. Patients filled out the surveys periodically throughout their treatment, which in some cases lasted more than six months and tended to be longer in patients receiving the drug triplet. They were questioned again 30 days after completing therapy. Among the respon - dents, 218 received the triplet therapy and 113 received only Herceptin plus Xeloda. In all five categories, most patients in both treatment groups reported slight or no problems. Moderate, severe or extreme problems were reported infrequently and in similar numbers in each treatment group. No clinically meaningful differences in health-related quality of life were observed between the two treatment groups. Mean question - naire scores were similar between the groups and stable throughout therapy. No decline in the categories or question - naire scores was seen while patients were receiving therapy. Said Mueller: \"These results, together with the HER2CLIMB primary analysis, demonstrate that this regimen not only provides significant and clinically meaningful activity, but also maintains quality of life in patients with and without brain metastases.\" Adding Tukysa to Regimen for Metastatic HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Does Not Decrease Quality of Life Follow-up to the HER2CLIMB study indicates that long courses of the targeted drug plus Herceptin and Xeloda can be safely given.

Study authors assessed data from 511 patients from 73 centers from the post-market requirement study, of whom 410 had available follow-up data. Patients were either children or young adults with relapsed or refractory ALL (255 patients; median age at infusion, 13.2 years; 58.8% men) or adults with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (155 patients; median age at infusion, 65.4 years; 53.5% men), all of whom were treated with Kymriah. Several outcomes were included in this study, such as the incidence and severity of cytokine release syndrome, or the release of small proteins from immune cells into the blood, which may result from CAR-T cell therapy. Duration of response was defined as the period between the date of first complete or partial remission to relapse, progression or death. Event-free survival in patients with ALL was the time between Kymriah infusion and all-cause death, treatment failure or relapse. Progression-free survival in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma was defined as the time from Kymriah infusion to all-cause death or disease progression. Overall survival was considered the time between the Kymriah infusion and all-cause death. Follow-up was conducted for a median of 13.4 months in patients with ALL and 11.9 months in those with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The complete remission rate for patients with ALL was 85.5%. For 12 months, patients with ALL had a duration of response of 60.9%, event-free survival of 52.4% and overall survival of 77.2%. In patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the best overall response rate was 61.8%, which included an initial complete remission rate of 39.5%. Duration of response during a six-month period was 55.3%. In addition, patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma had a progression-free survival rate of 38.7% and an overall survival rate of 70.7%. Cytokine release syndrome of grade 3 or more, which requires supportive care and Actemra (tocilizumab) either with or without corticosteroids, occurred in 11.6% of all patients. Neurotoxicity, or damage to the peripheral nervous system or the brain, was reported in 7.5% of all patients.

By DARLENE DOBKOWSKI, M.A.SPECTRAL-DESIGN / STOCK.ADOBE.COMBLOOD CANCERS 68 WINTER \u00b7 2021 ILOVECOFFEEDESIGN / STOCK.ADOBE.COMAS WITH MANY CANCERS, the sooner pancreatic cancer is diagnosed, the better. In particular, this may affect at what point chemotherapy is introduced as a therapeutic option. And thanks to promising new treatments in the pipeline, patients with the disease will soon have more options besides surgery and chemotherapy. \"The only way we can advance in this mission is to study the new treatments that we are developing,\" said Dr. Andrew M. Lowy in an interview with CURE\u00ae. Lowy, professor of surgery, chief of the Division of Surgical Oncology and clinical director for cancer surgery at the Moores Cancer Center at University of California San Diego Health, spoke about current stan - dards of care for pancreatic cancer, as well as options being evaluated for the future. Q:CURE\u00ae: How does early detection play a role in treatment? A:Lowy: Early detection is critical for achieving the best outcomes in pancreatic cancer, as it is in really all cancers. One of the big problems and challenges we face in pancreatic cancer is still our inability to diagnose most patients at an early stage. But when we do diagnose patients with, for instance, stage 1 pancreatic cancer, we can cure more than half of them. Q:Why is there a need to consider treatment at a high-volume cancer center? A:Well, pancreatic cancer is a complex disease, for many reasons. ... Patients (with pancreatic cancer) face a number of issues that range from managing their therapy, whether it be chemotherapy, radiation therapy or surgery, to managing these other medical aspects. Multiple providers are involved, and you really need a team approach ... so they're familiar with all the issues that patients with pancreatic cancer face. Q:Can you explain what neoadjuvant therapy is and how it improves outcomes? A:Neoadjuvant means getting your treatment, usually chemotherapy, before you have an opera - tion. So for patients whose tumors are operable, the traditional means of caring for them has been to remove the tumor and then give them therapy afterward. While that's the traditional approach, it's become clear that that approach has a lot of disadvantages, as compared to giving chemotherapy upfront. The thing to understand is that pancreas surgery is very complex. Despite the fact that we've gotten better at it, it is associated with a high complication rate. (It can take patients time) to recover from the operation to be able to get their chemotherapy. We know that the best outcomes are achieved when people get chemotherapy in addition to surgery. And so, by giving chemotherapy before the operation, when people are still in good shape before they have to undergo a surgical recovery, it ensures that we get that chemotherapy delivered. The next thing that's important is by giving the therapy when the cancer is present, we can get an assessment of whether the treatment is actually working, and that can allow us to continue therapy if it's being effective or to consider changing therapies before or after surgery to something that may be more effective. SPEAKING OUT Know Your Options On behalf of the National Pancreas Foundation, Dr. Andrew M. Lowy offers background on treatments and outcomes for pancreatic cancer. By KRISTIE L. KAHL69ILOVECOFFEEDESIGN / STOCK.ADOBE.COMThe last part that I'll talk about is that, unfortunately, a certain percentage of patients, when they present, have disease ... somewhere else in their body, most often the liver. (In this instance), we don't want to (operate) on those patients because those operations are not helpful. ... We don't want to do surgery on people unless we think the operation is really going to help. So by giving chemotherapy ahead of time, we are selecting out those folks who have a better chance of bene - fiting from the operation because in the time we're giving treatment, some of those people who have disease in their liver, it will show up as we rescan them, and then we know they're not a good candidate to have their operation. Q:What are the standards of care for pancreatic cancer right now? A:Like all cancers, the treatment selection is based on stage. However, what's different about pancre - atic cancer is, because it's such an aggressive disease, every patient essentially will get chemotherapy at some point in their care. We just talked about the earlier-stage patients who have operable disease, (for whom) we often will give chemotherapy before their operation. Patients who have tumors that are metastatic \u2014 meaning (the cancer has) spread to another organ or it's inoperable because it's involved in critical blood vessels, for instance \u2014 will get treated with chemotherapy. Two main standard regi - mens are used most often for this disease. One is called FOLFIRINOX (folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin) and the other regimen consists of two drugs, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane). Q:What kind of treatments are on the horizon for pancreatic cancer? A:The exciting thing is that more drugs are being tested for pancreatic cancer than in any time in history. And the drugs span a variety of different classes. The one big area of intense investigation is immu - notherapy. ... So far, we haven't had success with most current immunotherapies for (patients with pancreatic cancer). And there are a lot of reasons for that, which are fairly complicated. In short, what we're trying to understand is how we can make the immune system recognize pancreatic cancer by using combinations of immuno-modulating drugs. There's a whole bunch of them that work on different parts of the immune system that are in clinical trials. Another interesting area is tumor metabolism. Cancer cells have a different way of getting energy than do our normal cells. And there are drugs being developed that are trying to block the pathways that pancreatic cancer cells use to acquire and use their energy. Some of those drugs are even in very late-stage trials. And if we're lucky, and they show efficacy, they could be approved as soon as next year. And then finally, there are targeted therapies, which are drugs designed to target specific alterations or vulnerabilities in cancer cells that are often identified by (studying the tumor of an individual patient), rather than being broadly applicable like chemotherapy. Q:What is your biggest piece of advice for patients considering their treatment options? A:First of all, I think that being at a high-volume center is always a good idea, or at least to get an opinion from a center if that's available to you. It's never a bad idea to get multiple opinions to make sure that you're comfortable with the treatment plan that's being presented to you. And organizations like the National Pancreas Foundation (NPF) provide information to patients, which can help educate them about the disease and answer questions. (It's also important for patients to realize): You're not alone. NPF and other organizations are available to support you, help you through the journey and make it as easy as possible for you to deal with this difficult disease. SPEAKING OUT SHARE YOUR STORY!
