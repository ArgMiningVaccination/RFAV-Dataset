Abuse of Controlled SubstancesThe misuse and abuse of drugs is a crisis, in our country and around the world. By 2020 mental health and substance abuse disorders will surpass all ph ysical diseases as a major cause of disabilit y worldwide. Abuse of prescription drugs is the largest drug problem in the United States, and one that is growing. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people from all age groups, ethnic backgrounds, and genders are affected b y this disease. Accidental o verdose and misuse of prescription drugs leads to the sev ere consequence of death and addiction. The 2013 National Surv ey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) indicates that 15.2 million people aged 12 or older used prescription drugs nonmedically in the past year, and 6.5 million did so in the past month. Prescription drugs are abused and misused more often than an y other drug ex cept marijuana and alcohol (S AMHS A/NSDUH, 2014a). Defining the Problem Medical professionals face a dilemma because they need prescription drugs for patients in pain but they also need to prev ent the div ersion and misuse of the drugs. Among the prescription drugs div erted and misused are opioid analgesics, powerful painkillers that are medically indicated in the treatment of chronic pain; howev er, when the patient tak es the wrong dose, or the wrong person tak es the opioid pain medication, consequences can be deadly . While the sales of opioid analgesics increased four -fold between 1999 and 2010, the United States concurrently experienced an almost four -fold increase in opioid o verdose deaths (SAMHS A, 2014). Other consequences of the abundance of opioids include emergency department visits and admissions, falls and fr actures in older adults, and initiating injection drug use, which increases risk for infections such as hepatitis C and HIV . In 2010 Dela ware's drug-induced o verdose death r ate (16.4 per 100,000 ) ex ceeded the national a verage (12.9 per 100,000) (ONDCP , 2013). In 2012 Dela ware Go vernor Jack Markell established the Dela ware Prescription Drug Action Committee to impro ve access to treatment, best pr actices, data tr acking, pro vider education and public education (DPDAC, 2013). In October 2014 the state launched a new information website that emphasiz es prevention, treatment, and reco very (www .helpisherede.com) (DHS S, 2014). The Dela ware Board of Nursing R ules and R egulations now require R egistered and Licensed Practical Nurses to complete continuing education (CE) on substance abuse. Starting with the next renew al, at least three of the required contact hours must be in the area of substance abuse (Section 9.2.1.1.1). This policy is a response to the state' s need for additional education about drug div ersion and abuse mitigation. The following are some statistics for the State of Dela ware.Delaware has the tenth highest drug o verdose mortalit y rate in the United States, with 16.6 per 100,000 people suffering from drug o verdose fatalities, according to a new report, Prescription Drug Abuse: Strategies to Stop the Epidemic 2013 (TAH, 2013). Between 1999 and 2010, annual age- adjusted drug o verdose mortalit y rates in Dela ware rose 156 percent, from 6.5 in 1999 to 16.5 in 2010. The increasing trend in drug o verdose mortalit y appeared in both male and female r ates, with the female r ate more than tripling and the male r ate doubling in the ten- year span. Despite the larger proportional increase in the female r ate, males had a 2010 mortalit y rate 45 percent higher than the female r ate (19.6 vs. 13.5 deaths per 100,000) (DHSC, 2013). According to the National Surv ey on Drug Use and Health, 8.99 percent of Dela ware residents reported using illicit drugs in the past month, compared to the national a verage of 8.82 percent (ONDCP , 2013). In 2010-2011 Dela ware w as one of the top ten states in sev eral drug-use categories: past - year nonmedical pain reliev er use among persons 12 or older; past -month use of illicit drugs other than marijuana among persons 12 or older; and illicit drug dependence among persons 12 or older and y oung adults 18-15 (ONDCP , 2013). The rate of drug-induced deaths in Dela ware is higher than the national a verage (ONDCP , 2013). As a direct consequence of drug use, 147 persons died in Dela ware in 2010. This is compared to the number of persons in Dela ware who died from motor v ehicle accidents (111) and firearms (88) in the same y ear. Dela ware drug-induced deaths (16.4 per 100,000 population) ex ceeded the national r ate (12.9 per 100,000) (ONDCP , 2013). What is the role of nurses in the problem of prescription drug div ersion, misuse, and abuse? Because nurses are the health professionals who treat the most patients, they are in a unique position to educate, identif y, and interv ene with patients and colleagues who are at risk for prescription drug misuse and abuse. R ecognizing the signs of misuse and risk factors of drug abuse and div ersion b y patients and fellow healthcare professionals is an important responsibilit y of nurses. Educated nurses can be instrumental in changing patterns of misuse and abuse of prescription drugs for individuals, colleagues, and communities, and thereb y reducing the public health epidemic. Glossary of Terms Aberrant drug-related behaviors : any medication-related beha viors that depart from strict adherence to the ph ysician-prescribed plan of care, r anging from mildly problematic behavior (such as hoarding medications) to illegal acts (such as selling medications).Addiction : a primary , chronic, neurobiologic disease whose dev elopment and manifestation is influenced b y genetic, psy chosocial, and en vironmental factors. Addiction behaviors often include impaired control o ver use, compulsiv e use, continued use despite resulting harm, and cr aving (Corsini & Z acharoff , 2014). Abuse/nonmedical use : Abuse is the use of an illicit drug or the intentional self - administr ation of a prescription (or o ver-the counter) medication for an y nonmedical purpose, such as altering one' s state of consciousness, eg, \"getting high. \" Howev er, some critics dislik e the term abuse being applied to substance use disorders and claim it is inaccur ate and reflects mor ality-based language to depict what ma y actually be a medical condition (Corsini & Z acharoff , 2014). Chronic pain : any pain that last more than 12 weeks, but ma y last for months or y ears. Whereas acute pain is a normal sensation that alerts the body to injury or damage, chronic pain persists. Chronic pain ma y result from an injury or an ongoing cause such as illness, or there ma y be no clear cause. Chronic pain often limits a person' s activities of daily living (ADLs) and mo vement, and is often accompanied b y other health problems (NIH, 2011). Diversion : the intentional remo val of a medication from legitimate distribution and dispensing channels. Div ersion also in volves the sharing or purchasing of prescription medication between family members and friends or individual theft from family and friends (Corsini & Z acharoff , 2014). Div ersion can also occur in healthcare settings if health professionals div ert medication from the intended recipient. Misuse : any ther apeutic use of a medication other than as directed or indicated, whether intentional or unintentional, and regardless of whether it results in harm. Increasing a medication dose without clinician appro val is misuse, whether the reason is dependence, tolerance, desire to achiev e greater ther apeutic effect, or forgetfulness (Corsini & Zacharoff , 2014). Physical dependence : a state in which the body has adapted to a drug or class of drugs to the degree that withdr awal syndrome occurs upon abrupt cessation, r apid dose reduction, decreasing blood lev el of the drug, and/or administr ation of an antagonist (Corsini & Z acharoff , 2014). Pseudoaddiction : a state of inadequate analgesia that ma y lead to aberr ant drug-related behavior, such as increasing dosage without a ph ysician' s order or acquiring more than one prescription.Tolerance : a state in which the body has adapted to a drug or class of drugs o ver a prolonged period of use to the degree that there is a decrease or loss of ther apeutic effect over time, or the need to escalate the dose to maintain the same ther apeutic effect (Corsini & Z acharoff , 2014). Loss of tolerance : When a person stops taking a drug or class of drugs after taking it for a long time, loss of toler ance occurs. Serious adv erse effects, including o verdose, can occur if the person tak es the previously toler ated dose of the drug (S AMHS A, 2014d). Controlled Substances Drug abuse is not a new problem. The United States Congress passed the first Controlled Substances Act in 1970, but addictiv e drugs were first outla wed in America in the early 1900s. The current, 2012, Controlled Substances Act has fiv e schedules, known as schedules I, II, II, IV , and V . Source: DEA, CS A, 2014.Controlled Substances, 2012 DEA schedule Medical use/abuse potential Examples of abused drugs Schedule 1 No accepted therapeutic use. Lack of safety even under medical supervision. High potential for abuse; abuse may lead to severe psychological or Accepted therapeutic use. Highly restricted.

Less high potential for abuse; abuse may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence.Products containing not more than 90 milligrams of codeine per dosage unit Depo- Testosterone Schedule IV Accepted therapeutic use. Low potential for abuse relative to Schedule I, II, and III drugs; abuse may lead to limited physical dependence (Halcion) Schedule V Accepted therapeutic use. Low potential for abuse relative to Schedule I, II, III, and IV drugs; abuse may lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence.Cough preparations containing not more than 200 milligrams of codeine per 100 milliliters or per 100 grams (Robitussin AC, Phenergan with Codeine), an d ezogabine On August 22, 2014, the U .S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) formally rescheduled hydrocodone combination products (HCPs), mo ving them from Schedule III to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act. The Treatment of Pain Pain is part of the human condition; at some point, for short or long periods of time, we all experience pain and suffer its consequences. While pain can serv e as a warning to protect us from further harm, it also can contribute to sev ere and even relentless suffering, surpassing its underlying cause to become a disease in its own domains and dimensions. . . . Severe or chronic pain can o vertake our liv es, ha ving an impact on us as individuals as well as on our family , friends, and communit y. Through the ages, pain and suffering ha ve been the substr ates for great works of fiction, but the reality of the experience, especially when persistent, has little redeeming or romantic qualit y. The personal story of pain can be tr ansformativ e or can blunt the human v alues of jo y, happiness, and ev en human connectedness. Institutes of Medicine, 2011 Chronic pain affects appro ximately 100 million Americans, according to a 2011 Institute of Medicine R eport from the Committee on Adv ancing P ain Research, Care, and Education. In 2011 at least 100 million adult Americans ha ve common chronic pain conditions; this a conserv ative estimate because it does not include acute pain or children. Pain is a significant public health problem that costs societ y at least $560 billion annually in direct medical costs ($261-$300 billion) and lost productivit y ($297-$336 billion), (an amount equal to about $2,000 for ev eryone living in the United States). This cost of chronic pain is believ ed to be a conserv ative estimate because sev eral populations were ex cluded, such as institutionaliz ed and noncivilian populations (nursing home residents, military personnel and prison inmates), persons under 18, cost to caregiv ers in lost w ages, and working persons o ver the age of 65 or under the age of 24. In 2008 the cost to feder al and state go vernments of medical expenditures for pain was $99 billion (including Medicare, Medicaid, the Department of V eterans Affairs, TRICARE, work ers' compensation, and others). Recent CDC and National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data suggest substantial rates of pain from the v arious causes and that most people in chronic pain ha ve multiple sites of pain. F or U.S. adults reporting pain, loci include: sev ere headache ormigraine (16.1%), low back pain (28.1%), neck pain (15.1%), knee pain (19.5%), shoulder pain (9.0%), finger pain (7.6%), and hip pain (7.1%). (IOM, 2011) When Pain Becomes Chronic Pain is a normal ph ysiologic sensation that signals injury or disease. It serv es a vital function, w arning of the need for medical treatment. The International Association for the Study of P ain defines pain as an unpleasant sensory experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. . . . P ain is alw ays subjectiv e. . . . It is unquestionably a sensation in a part or parts of the body , but it is also unpleasant and therefore also an emotional experience. (IA SP, 1994) The Institutes of Medicine define pain this w ay: Pain's occurrence, sev erity, duration, response to treatment, and disabling consequences v ary from person to person because pain, lik e other sev ere chronic conditions, is much more than a biological phenomenon and has profound emotional and cognitiv e effects. P ain can be mild and easily handled with o ver-the-counter medications; it can be acute and recede with treatment; it can be recurrent o ver months or y ears; or it can be chronic and debilitating, requiring almost constant attention and accommodation. (IOM, 2011) Chronic pain is pain that persists, often for weeks, months, or y ears. The presence of chronic pain is a disease state in itself . When the pain' s warning function is completed, continued pain is an abnormal state. Its distinct pathology causes changes in the nerv ous system that often worsen. Its effects on a patient 's psychology and cognitiv e abilit y are significant, and include anxiet y, depression, and anger . Effectiv e pain management is a mor al imper ative because the alleviation of suffering is the guiding star of medicine. Chronic pain prev ention and management often require a comprehensiv e, interdisciplinary approach due to its div erse effects and the combination of biologic, psy chological, and social factors. Chronic diseases, including chronic pain, in volve many physical, cognitiv e, and emotional factors, but chronic pain often lacks reliable \"objectiv e\" measures.Knowledge of pain prev ention and management is not alw ays applied effectiv ely; man y people suffer pain needlessly . Chronic pain can result from age, genetic predisposition, or as part of a separ ate chronic disease, surgery , or injury . Healthcare pro viders must understand \"pain is a uniquely individual, subjectiv e experience\" that depends upon man y factors such as gener al health, genetic char acteristics, previous pain experiences, the brain's processing system, the context, and cultur al and social background (IOM, 2011). Trends in Pain Management and Prescribing In past decades, concern about undertreatment of pain despite the numerous pharmaceuticals dev eloped to treat it led to increases in prescribing of analgesics as part of a movement to treat pain, especially chronic pain, more aggressiv ely. In 1998 the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) released guidelines that supported the use of opioids for chronic, noncancer pain. This contributed to the increase in opioid prescriptions that followed. The Joint Commission, an accrediting body , then issued the Pain Standard , which ev aluated healthcare organizations (including hospitals, ambulatory care centers, behavioral health, and home care) on the basis of their consistent, documented assessment of patients' pain (A SAM, 2012). The FSMB Model Policy on the Use of Opioid Analgesics in the Treatment of Chronic Pain has been revised twice since 1998, once in 2004 and again in July 2013. K ey in the new model policy are the following points: Many Americans suffer from chronic pain that is inadequately or ineffectiv ely treated. Since the 2004 revision, evidence for risk associated with opioids has surged, while evidence for benefits has remained contro versial and insufficient. Appro ximately one-fourth of all patients seen in primary care settings suffers from pain that interferes with their ADLs. While under -treatment of pain exists, nev ertheless chronic pain is often intr actable and burdensome and current medical knowledge and ther apies, including opioid analgesics, do not completely eliminate pain in most cases. Furthermore, intr actable pain is not alw ays evidence of undertreatment, and ma y in fact result from o ver-treatment in procedures and medication (FSMB , 2013). Balance is the goal in treating patients' pain and prev enting drug div ersion, according to a Joint Statement from twent y-one health organizations and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA):Preventing drug abuse is an important societal goal, but there is consensus, b y law enforcement agencies, health care pr actitioners, and patient adv ocates alik e, that it should not hinder patients' abilit y to receiv e the care they need and deserv e. . . . Undertreatment of pain is a serious problem in the United States, including pain among patients with chronic conditions and those who are critically ill or near death. Effectiv e pain management is an integr al and important aspect of qualit y medical care, and pain should be treated aggressiv ely. (Joint Statement, 2002) Primary care is where patients with pain usually go first, but these ph ysicians r arely ha ve the time to perform comprehensiv e patient assessments. Both pro viders and patients should be educated to understand that pain management must be tailored to each individual, which ma y take time (IOM, 2011). Opioids are v ery effectiv e in the treatment of pain. Their increased use is in part due to the pharmaceutical industry' s widely mark eting opioids to ph ysicians, and offering incentiv es for prescribing. In Ma y 2014, two California counties sued fiv e of the world' s largest narcotics manufacturers, claiming that these pharmaceutical companies engaged in a \"campaign of deception\" to boost sales of prescription analgesics such as OxyContin and thereb y caused the national public health epidemic of prescription drug abuse. The la wsuit alleges that the companies activ ely work ed to expand their mark et by engaging in a dishonest campaign to encour age doctors to prescribe opioids for pain relief by hiring ph ysicians to giv e speeches and write papers to encour age more liber al prescribing pr actices (Glo ver & Girion, 2014). A similar suit against fiv e narcotics manufacturers w as filed in June 2014 b y the Cit y of Chicago . The cit y sought damages and accused the drug companies of deceiving the public about the risks associated with the use of pain medications while o verstating their benefits. The Univ ersity of Wisconsin P ain and P olicy Studies Group receiv ed $2.5 million from narcotics manufacturers o ver the last decade. That pharmaceutical group w as a significant force in the liber alizing of opioid analgesics for noncancer pain b y helping to create \"a body of 'information' that toda y is found in prescribing guidelines, patient liter ature, position statements, books, and doctor education courses, all of which fa vored drugs known as opioid analgesics\" (F auber , 2012). Prescription Drug Abuse and MisuseBecause of changes in pain treatment, prescriptions of opioid analgesics ha ve increased dramatically from the 1990s\u2014from 76 million prescriptions in 1991 to 210 million subscriptions in 2010. This increase resulted in their increased a vailabilit y for nonmedical users (NIDA, 2014). The U .S. culture of drug use, faith in pharmaceutical solutions, and desire for r apid relief from pain has contributed to the increase in opioid prescriptions. Alcohol use pla ys a role in drug abuse. Manufacturers of pharmaceuticals mark et directly to consumers in all t ypes of media. This, combined with information about medications that is widely a vailable on the Internet, leads to patients' asking doctors for drugs b y name. The increase of prescription opioids has exacted a sev ere toll. Unintentional o verdose deaths ha ve quadrupled since 1999, and now far outnumber those from heroin and cocaine combined (about 16,000 for opioids vs. about 2,000 for heroin and 3,000 for cocaine). The CDC considers prescription drug abuse to be epidemic. According to the CDC, appro ximately one hundred Americans died from o verdose ev ery da y in 2010. Prescription drugs were in volved in more than half of the 38,300 o verdose deaths that y ear, and opioid pain reliev ers were in volved in o ver 16,600 of these deaths (ONDCP , 2014). The State of Dela ware is facing a significant drug abuse problem. Dela ware has a higher rate of sales of opioid pain reliev ers (10.2 kilogr ams sold per 10,000 population) compared to the national r ate (7.1) in 2010 (T AH, 2013). There is wide v ariation among states in prescribing pr actices. Dela ware ranks 17th among all fift y states, with 90.8 prescriptions for opioid pain reliev ers per 100 persons, compared to the mean of 87.3 (CDC MMWR, 2014). According to the 2014 Dela ware School Surv ey, 3 percent of eighth gr aders and 7 percent of elev enth gr aders report past y ear use of pain killers (UDCDA S, 2015). The Delaware Health and Social Services, Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health reports 1,793 admissions to DS AMH Funded T reatment Progr ams for \"other opiates and synthetics\" drug abuse (UDCDA S, 2015). Societal and Economic Impacts of Drug Abuse Drug use affects not only the drug abuser but also the family unit and the communit y at large. Ov erdose and accidental death impacts family members and caregiv ers as well as our healthcare system. Drug abuse impacts on-the-job performance and missed work. The overall cost of prescription opioid abuse in the United States has been estimated at $9.5 billion (in 2005 U .S. dollars), including healthcare, criminal justice, and workplace costs (Passik, 2009). What Drugs Are Most Diverted or Abused?After marijuana, prescription drugs are the second-most abused category of drugs in the United States (ONDCP , 2011a). The three classes of the most commonly abused prescription drugs are: Opioids that include o amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (Adder all). One w ay to understand the scope of the problem of prescription drug misuse and abuse is to look at data on drug-related emergency department (ED) visits. The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DA WN) is a tr acking system managed b y the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administr ation (S AMHS A). DA WN's purpose is to monitor trends in drug misuse and abuse, identif y the emergence of new substances and drug combinations, assess health hazards associated with drug abuse, and estimate the impact of drug misuse and abuse on the nation' s healthcare system. In 2009, there were nearly 4.6 million drug-related ED visits nation wide, including drug abuse, adv erse reactions to drugs, and other drug-related consequences. Of these, almost 50% were for adv erse reactions to medications tak en as prescribed, and 45% in volved drug abuse. DA WN estimates that of the 2.1 million drug abuse visits: 27.1% in volved nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals (ie, prescription or O TC medications, dietary supplements) 21.2% in volved illicit drugs 14.3% in volved alcohol, in combination with other drugs. (NIDA, 2011) Furthermore, the emergency department (ED) visits in volving prescription drugs (alone or in combination) increased 98.4% between 2004 and 2009, from 627,291 visits in 2004 to 1,244,679 visits in 2009 (NIDA, 2011). For patients aged 20 or y ounger , ED visits resulting from nonmedical use of prescription drugs increased 45.4% between 2004 (116,644 visits) and 2009 (169,589 visits). Among patients aged 21 or older , there w as an increase of 111% (NIDA, 2011). Who Are the Drug Abusers?People of all ages, genders, and backgrounds use illicit or prescription drugs nonmedically . Data from the 2013 National Surv ey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) shows that nonmedical use of prescription pharmaceuticals w as 2.6% in men and 2.3% in women. In 2013 about 15 million people aged 12 or older used prescription drugs nonmedically in the past y ear, and 6.5 million did so in the past month. In 2013 y ouths aged 12 to 17, or y oung adults age 18 to 25, were more lik ely to misuse prescription drugs in the past y ear than adults aged 26 or older . On an a verage da y during the past y ear, about 2,500 adolescents used prescription pain reliev ers nonmedically for the first time (S AMHS A, 2014a). According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, as of 2014 prescription drug misuse or abuse is increasing among people in their fifties (S AMHS A, 2014b; NCHS , 2014). How Drug Abusers Get Drugs Drug div ersion is the intentional remo val of a prescription medication from the legitimate channels of distribution and dispensing. Div ersion also occurs when family or friends share or purchase prescription medication, or when medication is stolen from its intended recipient or is otherwise illegally acquired (Corsini & Z acharoff , 2014). Div ersion can also occur in healthcare settings if health professionals div ert medication from the intended recipient for personal use or financial gain. Friends and Family Although we might assume that drug users acquire their prescription drugs from street dealers, this is not usually the case. Because prescription pain medications are fairly commonly prescribed, often nonmedical users merely ha ve to look in the medicine cabinet of a family member or friend. Among people aged 12 and older who used prescription pain reliev ers for nonmedical reasons in the past 12 months, 55.9% obtained them from a friend or relativ e (SAMSHA, NSDUH, 2013). If the prescription drug is not freely giv en, a drug user ma y steal it from an unsuspecting family member or acquaintance who has a legitimate need for the medication (ONDCP , 2014). Doctor Shopping Another source for prescription opioids is legitimate prescriptions obtained illicitly . Patients may request prescriptions from more than one ph ysician, and thereb y receiv e more than one prescription for pharmaceuticals. This is known as \"doctor shopping. \" The patient does not inform the ph ysicians of the multiple prescribers, and fills multiple prescriptions for the same or similar medication at different pharmacies.A 2009 study found that elders in Wilmington, Dela ware, were div erting their medications for economic reasons. \"It was clear from the focus groups with prescription drug abusers that the elderly gener ally were not drug dealers, but filled their prescriptions and sold part or all to a few abusers known to them, as well as to dealers or pill brok ers for much less than the street v alue of the drugs\" (Incardi et al. , 2009). Furthermore, Focus group participants indicated that ev en in a small state lik e Dela ware, doctor shopping appeared to be fairly easy . The v ast majorit y of abusers reported obtaining medications through doctor shopping, and most reported frequenting at least four physicians in order to obtain sufficient amounts of their desired medications. Occasionally clinics and hospital emergency rooms were reported as locations for doctor shopping as well. R egardless of location, the most common scenario reported by abusers w as to present to a ph ysician with complaints about pain. (Incardi et al. , 2009) A recent study b y McDonald and Carlson (2013) found that 1 out of ev ery 143 U .S. patients who receiv ed a prescription for an opioid pain medicine in 2008 obtained prescriptions from multiple prescribers, suggesting misuse or abuse of the drugs. The study identified a group of \"extreme\" patients who a veraged 10 prescribers through a 10- month period. When researchers look ed at those who had paid cash for their prescriptions, the average rose to 15 prescribers per patient. R esearchers concluded that impro vements in healthcare information technology should focus on prescription monitoring progr ams that allow ph ysicians to pull up a patient 's prescription history . Doctor shoppers are exploiting the lack of good data management. McDonald sa ys, \"Ultimately , healthcare providers are the front -line defense against prescription drug div ersion\" (McDonald & Carlson, 2013). Fraud Patients seeking to feed a habit of drug misuse or abuse ma y attempt to pass fr audulent prescriptions at the pharmacy . Fraudulent prescriptions come in the following forms: Fraudulent prescriptions written for a fictitious patient on a legitimate prescription pad stolen from a prescriber 's office Legitimate prescription that has been altered to obtain additional amounts of a drug Legitimate prescription pad with an altered call-back phone number to v erify the prescription Fraudulent prescription called in b y the drug abuser , who giv es his or her own call- back numberFraudulent prescription created b y a computer for a fictitious doctor or copied from a legitimate doctor It is incumbent on pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to be cautious about filling prescriptions for controlled substances and to look for signs of fr aud or suspicious patient activit y (DEA, 2000). Healthcare Professio nals Drug div ersion isn' t only a problem in patients, howev er. Pharmacists, doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals often ha ve access to prescription drugs, including opioid analgesics, and while these individuals usually ha ve greater knowledge than the public, they are still subject to the same propensities, temptations, genetic and medical histories, and ph ysical and mental health problems as patients. Prescribers ma y be in volved in drug div ersion b y providing drugs to patients engaging in the pr actices of fr aud or doctor shopping, who ma y be selling or sharing drugs. \"Recommended clinical pr actices include protecting access to prescription pads, adhering to strict refill policies, and thoroughly documenting when prescribing narcotics. Prescribers can also curb drug div ersion b y adhering to prescribing principles for opioids and other controlled substances\" (HS S CMS , 2014). Clinicians should be a ware that the Affordable Care Act has ushered in changes to Medicaid, Medicare, and other health care progr ams, including more stringent penalties for submitting false claims and statements related to the ordering and prescribing of prescription drugs (CMS , 2014). Attempting to obtain a controlled substance b y misrepresentation, fr aud, forgery , or deception is a felon y in most states and punishable b y a prison term and fines. In addition, the U .S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector Gener al (HHS OIG) uses a r ange of la w enforcement tools that can impose v arious legal sanctions and actions on ph ysicians and other pro viders, such as recoupment, restitution, civil monetary penalties, suspension or loss of pro vider license, ex clusion from participation in Medicaid and other F ederal health care progr ams, and imprisonment (CMS , 2014). Health professionals ma y also div ert drugs for their own use. According to research b y Storr and colleagues conducted in 2000, the prev alence of substance abuse and addiction in nurses and other healthcare professionals is no higher than that of the gener al population. Estimates r ange from 8% to 20% for use and abuse combined (NCSBN, 2011). Shaw and colleagues (2011) determined that because nurses comprise the largest group of healthcare professionals, those with substance use and abuse disorders are more visible, more stigmatiz ed among health professionals, and receiv e more sev ere sanctions than physicians with similar abuse and addiction (NCSBN, 2011).Nurses must be tr ained to recognizing substance misuse and abuse among fellow nurses because substance abuse on the job and untreated addiction disorder jeopardiz es patient safety. When nurses ha ve been giv en guidelines and a means of reporting suspected substance use, it can result in earlier detection of nurses with substance use disorders and their appropriate treatment. Without such guidelines, nurses are more lik ely to co ver up for colleagues. Dunn (2005) found that gener al symptoms of substance use problems among nurses include the following: Defensiv eness Isolation Irritabilit y Difficult y following through on work assignments Signs and symptoms of a prescription drug substance use disorder among nurses can include the following: Coming to work on da ys off Volunteering for o vertime Incorrect narcotic counts Volunteering to administer medications Waiting to be alone to open a narcotics cabinet Lacking witnesses to v erify the w asting of unused medications Negativ e impacts on patient safet y may result from an y of the following: Impaired judgment Slowed reaction time Diverting drugs from patients who need them Neglect of patients Nursing errors (NCSBN, 2011) Martin and colleagues found that nurses whose substance abuse problems are detected early and treated ha ve a higher lik elihood of successful treatment outcomes (NCSBN, 2011).Addiction and substance abuse ha ve been called an occupational hazard for all health professionals. In addition to gener al risk factors that all members of the population are subject to (eg, depression, anxiet y, stress, low self -esteem, use of other substances, early age of first misuse, alcohol and drug use b y peers, family use, genetic predisposition to alcohol or drug dependence), nurses face specific risk factors in their workplace environments: Role str ain, including burnout, work o verload, feeling of insignificance, and inadequate support at work Problems of daily living, such as loss of a significant other , poor coping skills, insecurit y, and isolation Enabling b y peers and managers, such as o verlooking symptoms out of lo yalty and fear of job loss Attitudes tow ard drugs and drug use; eg, that substance use is an acceptable means of coping with life Faith in drugs for promoting healing due to witnessing positiv e effects of drugs on patients Sense of entitlement, that the nurse must continue to work, leading to r ationalization Special status of nurses as in vulner able to illnesses of patients Professional tr aining about drugs leading to self -diagnosis and self -medication for pain or stress/fatigue from workplace demands (Clark & F arnsworth, 2006) Lack of education regarding substance use disorder , including lack of understanding about the addiction process and how to recogniz e signs and symptoms of abuse Lack of controls and securit y of controlled substances and their ready a vailabilit y Physician prescribing pr actices, such as obtaining prescriptions from ph ysician friends without proper assessment and diagnosis protocols (NCSBN, 2011) Of these risk factors, the top four are access to drugs, attitude, stress, and lack of education about addiction. Nursing is a highly stressful profession impacted b y staffing shortages, difficult schedules, and long shifts (NCSBN, 2011). A Closer Look at Addiction Health Risks of OpioidsHealth effects related to opioid misuse and abuse include pain relief , drowsiness, nausea, constipation, and euphoria. An acute effect, when tak en in w ays other than prescribed, is life-threatening respir atory depression leading to coma and death. Long-term effects include drug toler ance and addiction. In combination with alcohol, opioid use can cause life-threatening slowing of the heart r ate and respir ation with potential coma and/or death. Certain populations ha ve additional health risks. Y outh often think that prescription drugs are safer to use than illegal drugs because they are prescribed b y a ph ysician and manufactured b y legitimate pharmaceutical companies. But according to a 2013 S AMHS A study , ED visits for y outh aged 12 to 17 on a t ypical da y include 174 prescription drug- related incidents, with 74 for prescription or nonprescription pain reliev ers (S AMHS A CBHSQ R eport, 2013). Pregnant women who use opioids nonmedically can ha ve spontaneous abortions and low - birth- weight babies. Older adults are at greater risk for sev ere health consequences due to accidental misuse or abuse of opioids because of age-related changes in metabolism, alcohol use, or drug inter actions with multiple prescriptions (NIDA, 2012a). Addiction and accidental o verdose occurs in all populations. Addiction is a primary , chronic, neurobiologic disease, with genetic, psy chosocial, and environmental factors influencing its dev elopment and manifestations. It is often characteriz ed by beha viors that include one or more of the following: Impaired control o ver use Compulsiv e use Continued use despite harm Craving Addiction medicine is a specialt y field in the mechanism and treatment of addiction. In August 2011 the American Societ y of Addiction Medicine released a new definition of addiction, Public P olicy Statement: Definition of Addiction. Its shortened revised definition: Addiction is a primary , chronic disease of br ain rew ard, motiv ation, memory , and related circuitry . Dysfunction in these circuits leads to char acteristic biological, psychological, social and spiritual manifestations. This is reflected in an individual pathologically pursuing rew ard and/or relief b y substance use and other beha viors.Addiction is char acteriz ed by inabilit y to consistently abstain, impairment in beha vioral control, cr aving, diminished recognition of significant problems with one' s beha viors and interpersonal relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional response. Lik e other chronic diseases, addiction often in volves cycles of relapse and remission. Without treatment or engagement in reco very activities, addiction is progressiv e and can result in disabilit y or premature death. (A SAM, 2011) How Addicting Are Opioids? Opioids are a class of drugs that broadly includes heroin, h ydrocodone, o xycodone, and other morphine-deriv ed drugs. Br ain abnormalities can result from chronic use of such drugs and they cause dependence (the need to k eep taking drugs to a void withdr awal syndrome) and addiction. Dependence can resolv e after deto xification. Addiction, howev er, has complex and long-lasting effects, in volving cr aving that can lead to relapse long after the patient 's dependence resolv es (Kosten & George, 2002). The opiate tr avels through the bloodstream to the br ain, where chemicals attach to proteins called mu opioid receptors on the surfaces of opiate-sensitiv e neurons. When the chemicals link with the receptors, a biochemical process of the release of dopamine into the nucleus accumbens rew ards the individual with feelings of pleasure, in the same manner as when they experience sex and food. Although the opioid ma y be prescribed to reliev e pain, the pleasure rew ard process is activ ated, building motiv ation for repeated use of the drug for pleasure. The br ain creates lasting associations of the feelings of pleasure with the circumstances and en vironment in which they occur , further cementing the motiv ation to continue taking the opioid, despite the risks and obstacles. Although taking drugs for pleasure is the first stage of drug abuse, the beha vior becomes compulsiv e, which leads to toler ance and dependence. R epeated doses of opioids alter the brain. It begins to function normally when the drugs are present and abnormally when they are not. Higher dosages are needed to achiev e the surge of dopamine for the same pleasur able effect; this is known as toler ance. The br ain's opioid receptors gr adually become less responsiv e to the opioid. The dopamine rush has a diminished impact on the reward circuit, which means the drug user experiences a reduced abilit y to enjo y not only the drug but also other pleasur able life experiences.Drug dependence is the condition of being so accustomed to the drug that withdr awal symptoms occur if the drug is not used. Another br ain change in the locus ceruleus from use of opioids results in withdr awal symptoms of jitters, anxiet y, muscle cr amps, and diarrhea because ex cessiv e levels of nor adrenaline are produced. Dependence leads to daily drug use to a void unpleasant symptoms of withdr awal (Kosten & George, 2002). Symptoms from opioids include: Anxiet y Irritabilit y Craving for the drug Rapid breathing Yawning Runny nose Salivation Gooseflesh Nasal stuffiness Muscle aches Vomiting Abdominal cr amping Diarrhea Sweating Confusion Enlarged pupils Tremors Loss According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (2012b): Long-term abuse causes changes in other br ain chemical systems and circuits as well. Glutamate is a neurotr ansmitter that influences the rew ard circuit and the abilit y to learn. When the optimal concentr ation of glutamate is altered b y drug abuse, the br ain attempts to compensate, which can impair cognitiv e function. Br ain imaging studies of drug- addicted individuals show changes in areas of the br ain that are critical to judgment, decision making, learning and memory , and beha vior control.It is important to understand the opioid dependence and addiction are chronic medical disorders. Although initially people ma y voluntarily tak e a drug to treat pain or to feel pleasure, the br ain changes that result from opioid use can create a ph ysiologic and psychological need that is difficult to resist (K osten & George, 2002). Best Practices of Pain Management and Addiction Medicine The Ph ysicians Advisory Committee for Controlled Substances of the Medical Societ y of Delaware issued guidelines and recogniz es that the use of opioid analgesics for other than legitimate medical purposes can pose a threat to the individual and societ y and that the inappropriate prescribing of controlled substances, including opioid analgesics, ma y lead to drug div ersion and abuse b y individuals who seek them for other than legitimate medical use. Accordingly , these guidelines mandate that licensed pr actitioners incorpor ate safeguards into their pr actices to minimiz e the potential for the abuse and div ersion of controlled substances. (MSD , 2013) A comprehensiv e approach is necessary to achiev e safe pain management and optimal patient functioning (ph ysical, psy chosocial, social, and work -related) while guarding against misuse, abuse, addiction, and o verdose. The Dela ware approach aligns with the 2011 Prescription Drug Abuse Prev ention Plan, which outlines actions in four major areas to reduce prescription drug abuse: Education for parents, y outh, and patients about the dangers of abusing prescription drugs, and for prescribers on the appropriate and safe use and proper stor age and disposal of prescription drugs. Monitoring via Prescription Drug Monitoring Progr ams (PDMPs) in ev ery state to reduce doctor shopping and div ersion, and enhance PDMPs to mak e sure data is available across states and used b y healthcare pro viders. Proper medication disposal in con venient and en vironmentally responsible progr ams to help decrease the supply of unused prescription drugs in the home. Law Enforcement tools to eliminate improper prescribing pr actices and stop pill mills. (ONDCP , 2011a) It is not enough merely to diagnose and treat patients' pain. It is incumbent on clinicians to understand the treatment of pain, alternativ es to opioids, and medical indications for using opioids in the treatment of chronic pain, including the drugs' gener al char acteristics, toxicities, and drug inter actions.Delaware clinicians can reference the Dela ware Pain Initiativ e (www .delawarepaininitiativ e.org/healthcare-professionals), which aims to educate the public and healthcare pro viders regarding the assessment and treatment of pain, reduce the barriers to effectiv e pain management, and serv e as a resource for state-of -the-art pain information. Of use to all healthcare pro is the Opioid Ov erdose Prev ention T oolkit. It aims to educate healthcare pro viders, patients, and family members about the risks of opioid analgesic misuse, abuse, and o verdose, the risks associated with such drugs, how to identif y overdose, how to treat it, how to appropriately prescribe and monitor the use of opioids (S AMHS A, 2014d). In brief , the best pr actices appro ved by the Medical Societ y of Dela ware and S AMHS A include the following: Evaluation Treatment plan Informed consent Agreement for treatment Periodic review Consultation Medical records Compliance with controlled substance la ws and regulations (MSD , 2013) These best pr actice recommendations are echoed in publications b y the F ederation of State Medical Boards (2013) and the American Societ y of Addiction Medicine. W e will discuss each of these safeguards in more depth. A Clinica l Approach to Mitigate Abuse Patient Evaluation and Health HistoryTo adequately address pain and best outcomes, a ph ysician must complete a thorough patient ev aluation before an y treatment plan can be made or medications prescribed. Such an ev aluation must include a complete medical history and a ph ysical examination. The physician should mak e a thorough examination of the patient 's medical record, current and past treatments for pain, underlying or co-existing diseases or conditions, the effect of the pain on the patient 's physical and psy chological functioning, and history of substance abuse. One or more recogniz ed indications for the use of a controlled substance should be present in the medical record to justif y prescribing (MSD , 2013). The use of opioid analgesics for other than legitimate medical purposes poses a significant health risk to individual patients and to societ y. Inappropriate prescribing can lead to drug diversion and abuse b y individuals seeking to use opioids nonmedically . It falls to physicians, nurses, and other health professionals to use systematic precautions to minimiz e the possibilit y for abuse and div ersion of controlled substances (MSD , 2013). and long- acting (ER/LA) opioid pain reliev ers must balance the benefits of these drugs to treat chronic pain against the risks of serious adv erse outcomes including addiction, unintentional o verdose, and death. Health professionals ha ve an obligation to ensure that these medications are used safely and effectiv ely by their patients to control pain, and to mitigate risks. Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) The FDA requires that extended-release or al forms of pain medications containing hydromorphone, morphine, xycodone, systems; and methadone tablets or liquid that are indicated for use as pain medicines are subject to a risk management progr am to ensure that the benefits of a drug for a patient outweigh its risks. REMS in volves: Knowing how to assess patients for treatment with opioid analgesics. Knowing how to initiate ther apy, modif y dose, and discontinue use of opioid analgesics. Knowing how to manage ongoing opioid ther apy. Knowing how to educate patients and caregiv ers about the safe use of opioids analgesics, including proper stor age, protection from theft, and disposal. Knowing gener al and product -specific drug information. (FDA, 2014)All opioids analgesics contain more opioid than immediate-release formulations, which carries a high potential for accidental o verdose, life-threatening respir atory depression, abuse b y patient or people known to the patient, misuse and addiction, ph ysical dependence and toler ance, interactions with other medications, risk of neonatal opioid withdr awal syndrome with prolonged use during pregnancy , and inadv ertent exposure/ingestion b y household contacts, especially children (FDA, 2014). Risk Factors of Opioid Abuse Research shows that there are three main categories of risk factors for opioid abuse and addiction: Psychosocial factors Substance-related factors Genetic factors (F errari et al. , 2012) The factor that is the most strongly predictiv e of opioid abuse, misuse, or other aberr ant drug-related beha vior is a personal or family history of alcohol or drug abuse (Chou, 2009). Although family history of substance abuse and psy chiatric disorders are relev ant to the appropriateness of opioid pain medications, prescribers should recogniz e that \"a history of substance abuse does not prohibit treatment with ER/LA opioid analgesics but ma y require additional monitoring and expert consultation\" (FDA, 2014). Pain Assessment Tools When treating chronic pain, healthcare pro viders must assess the nature and lev el of patient pain. Common assessment tools include a numeric pain r ating scale (0-10), the Wong-Bak er FACES P ain Rating Scale, and the 20-question P ain Qualit y Assessment Scale (PQAS). Other useful tools help clinicians ev aluate patient risk for adv erse effects when considering prescribing opioid analgesics. These tools allow healthcare pro viders to ask useful, clinically relev ant questions in order to gain a full understanding of the patient before prescribing a potent drug. Here are brief summaries of some assessment tools that healthcare pro viders can use before initiating opioid ther apy: National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Quick Screen : This is a free online tool that helps primary care pro viders screen patients for drug use in gener al medicalsettings. The tool asks a pre-screening question regarding alcohol, tobacco , non- medical prescription drug, and illegal drug use. Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients in Pain (SOAPP-R ): This is a brief tool to facilitate assessment and planning for patients being considered for long-term opioid treatment for chronic pain. Before initiating opioid pain analgesics, pro viders can distinguish between high-risk and low -risk patients. Diagnosis, Intractability, Risk, Efficacy (DIRE) : This primary care tool assesses the risk of opioid abuse and whether patients are suitable candidates for long-term opioid ther apy. Opioid Risk Tool (ORT) : This tool assesses the risk that patients will dev elop aberr ant drug beha viors when using Ov erdose Prev ention T oolkit recommends that a thorough patient assessment and health history include specific questions. F or example: \"In the past 6 months, ha ve you tak en an y medications to help y ou calm down, k eep from getting nerv ous or upset, r aise y our spirits, mak e you feel better , and the lik e?\" \"Have you been taking an y medications to help y ou sleep? Ha ve you been using alcohol for this purpose?\" \"Have you ev er tak en a medication to help y ou with a drug or alcohol problem?\" \"Have you ev er tak en a medication for a nerv ous stomach?\" \"Have you tak en a medication to giv e you more energy or to cut down on y our appetite? \"Have you ev er been treated for a possible or suspected opioid o verdose?\" Further , a patient history should include questions about the patient 's use of alcohol and over-the-counter medicines. Caution must be observ ed because man y OTC medications and alcohol can depress the centr al nerv ous system and must not be used in combination with prescription opioid analgesics (S AMHS A, 2014d). Physical Examination During a ph ysical examination, pro viders and nurses should also be on the look out for the following signs in patients being seen for chronic pain: Needle marks in neck, hands, feet, and antecubital fossae Signs of opioid into xication, including drowsiness, nodding offSigns opioid withdr awal, including goose bumps, sweating, sniffles, dilated pupils, muscle tenderness, increased bowel sounds, r apid heartbeat, restlessness, and hypertension Signs of liv er disease, including jaundice, enlarged liv er and spleen, \"stigmata\" of chronic liv er disease, and ascites (CAMH, 2011c) Review of Medical Records When considering prescribing opioid analgesics for a new patient, clinicians should carefully review the patient 's medical records. Consulting with the patient 's previous ph ysician could reveal important information. Treatment Plans with Functional Goals After a thorough examination, a clinician must dev elop a written treatment plan. The plan must include goals that can be used to measure treatment success. Goals might include pain relief and impro ved ph ysical and psy chosocial function. The treatment plan should also indicate other diagnostic ev aluations or treatments. Treatment plans should incorpor ate pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic pain management modalities. Ph ysical options for nonpharmacologic treatments for chronic pain include bandage wr aps, ex ercise, heat or cold application, limitation of activities, postur al changes, h ydrother apy, massage ther apy, mechanical devices such as splits, r ange-of - motion ex ercises, and ph ysical and occupational ther apy. Options for psy chological treatments for chronic pain include attention control ex ercise, biofeedback, cognitiv e- behavioral ther apy, hypnosis, distr psy chother apy, among others. Other interv entions for chronic pain are br acing, injection and r adiation ther apy, nerv e blocks, surgery , transcutaneous electrical nerv e stimulation (TENS), and v ertebroplast y (Gourla y & Heit, 2005). \"Universal Precautions\" The goal of pain treatment is to decrease pain and impro ve patient functioning while monitoring for adv erse effects. Univ ersal Precautions is an idea deriv ed from infection control but applied to the use of powerful pain analgesics (Gourla y & opioids for management minimal patient risk for adv erse outcomes: Diagnosis. Identif y causes of chronic pain and whether the pathoph ysiology for the pain supports the use of opiate ther apy.1. Conduct a psy chological assessment, including risk of addictiv e disorders. 2.Assess for depression, which ma y lead to misuse or abuse of prescription drugs. Screen for patient/family history of an y substance abuse. Informed consent. Discuss the risks and benefits of opiate ther apy, including: Side effects Severe respir atory depression Risk of addiction Risk that the opioid analgesic ma y not reduce pain, and ma y need to be discontinued if pain and function does not impro ve3. Make a treatment agreement, also called a patient -physician contr act. This specifies the conditions under which opiate ther apy will be continued or discontinued. Both the patient and the pro vider should retain a cop y of the agreement. The patient agrees to the following: To obtain prescriptions for opiates through one pro vider To take only the prescribed amount, only when instructed To undergo r andom urine drug testing To abstain from using illicit substances or alcohol with the prescribed drug4. Assess pain lev el and function both before and after interv ention. The medical provider should document baseline pain scores and lev el of function before opioid analgesics are started. A set of simple questions about patient functioning in the areas of work, household duties, and self -care can be r ated on a 1 to 10 scale, and then reassessed during treatment, along with a pain score, to determine continuation or discontinuation of opioid ther apy.5. Conduct an appropriate trial of opioid analgesic ther apy with or without adjunctiv e medication. Certain medications (antidepressants, muscle relaxants, neuropathic medications, and anti-inflammatory medications) can impro ve the response to opioids. Titr ate the opiate dose to obtain pain relief and minimiz e side effects. If there is no impro vement in pain and function, the medication should be titr ated back down and discontinued.6. Reassess pain score and lev el of function. A t each visit, the patient 's pain and level of function should be check ed. Therapy should be continued, adjusted, or7.The Clinicians for R esponsible Opioid Prescribing adv ocate a cautious approach to pain management. They believ e that the increased prescribing of opioid analgesics for chronic noncancer pain lacks high-qualit y evidence to justif y the ther apeutic change and that, while opioids ma y provide short -term pain relief , the long-term benefits of opioid ther apy have not been established. They adv ocate that low doses should be considered only for carefully ev aluated, closely monitored patients when a structured approach is emplo yed and clear benefits for pain and function are documented. T o better educate prescribers about the risks v ersus benefits of opioids for chronic pain, they ha ve published the Cautious, Evidence-Based Opioid Prescribing Myth v ersus F act Sheet, containing do' s and don'ts for acute and chronic pain management (PROP , 2012). Cautious, Evidence-Based Opioid Prescribing Do's Do screen patients for depression and other psy chiatric disorders before initiating CO T (chronic opioid ther apy) Do talk with patients about ther apeutic goals, opioid risks, realistic benefits, and prescribing ground rules. Do realiz e that patients are reluctant to disclose a history of substance abuse. Do perform a thorough medical ev aluation and a urine drug screen before initiating COT. Do explain to patients that discontinuing opioids ma y be difficult.discontinued based on the assessment. Regularly assess the \"4 A 's\" of pain medicine. Ongoing, routine assessment of analgesia, activit y, adverse effects, and aberr ant drug beha viors will support the current ther apy and/or alert the ph ysician to prescription drug misuse, abuse, tolerance, and addiction.8. Periodically review pain diagnosis and other conditions, including possible addiction disorders. Ongoing pain management involves periodic diagnostic procedures and assessment for worsening or impro ving pathology . Clinicians should also assess for new disease processes and assess for addiction disorder , especially if the patient is displa ying aberr ant beha viors.9. Documentation. Careful documentation of all aspects of patient ev aluation, assessment, treatment, medication, response to treatment and followup is necessary to protect the clinician and the patient. Appropriate documentation showing a standard approach to chronic pain management can reduce malpr actice risk and risk of regulatory sanction. (Gourla y & Heit, 2005)10.Do perform r andom urine drug screens on patients receiving CO T. Don'ts Don't initiate chronic opioid ther apy (CO T) before considering safer alternativ es. Don't continue with CO T with patients who show no progress tow ard treatment goals. Don't assume patients know how to use opioids safely . Don't assume patients use opioids as y ou intend. Don't start a treatment that y ou are not prepared to stop . Don't assume patients are doing well with CO T without careful ev aluation. (PROP , 2012) Informed Consent and Prescribing Agreements As part of an y treatment plan, pro viders must educate patients on the prescription opioid, its safe use (including dosage, frequency of use, expected ther apeutic effects, risks, and side effects); its potential inter actions with other drugs and alcohol; its proper stor age according to manufacturer instructions; and the proper disposal of the medication. As we have mentioned, div ersion of opioids b y family members, caregiv ers, or visitors can be a serious problem with serious consequences for the patient, who should be using the drug as directed, and for the nonmedical user , who ma y be risking injury or accidental death b y illegally using a drug not prescribed. It is imper ative that patients receiv e education so that they ma y give informed consent to the treatment plan recommended b y the ph ysician. What Is Informed Consent? Health pro viders ha ve the responsibilit y of informing patients about opioid pain medications. The F ederation of State Medical Boards specifies that informed consent documents t ypically address the following points: The potential risks and anticipated benefits of chronic opioid ther apy. Potential side effects (both short - and long-term) of the medication, such as constipation and cognitiv e impairment. The lik elihood that toler ance to and ph ysical dependence on the medication will develop. The risk of drug inter actions and o ver-sedation.The risk of impaired motor skills (affecting driving and other tasks). The risk of opioid misuse, dependence, addiction, and o verdose. The limited evidence as to the benefit of long-term opioid ther apy. The clinician' s prescribing policies and expectations, including the number and frequency of prescription refills, as well as the clinician' s policy on early refills and replacement of lost or stolen medications. Specific reasons for which drug ther apy may be changed or discontinued (including violation of the policies and agreements spelled out in the treatment agreement) (FSMB , 2013) Patients need to understand that opioid pain medications work to reliev e pain b y binding to specific receptors in the br ain, spinal cord, and gastrointestinal tr act. But stimulating the receptors, or rew ard centers, in the br ain can also affect other body systems, such as those responsible for regulating mood, breathing, and blood pressure. Signs of Overdose Opioids can cause pleasure, nausea, v omiting, allergic reaction, and ev en overdose, which can cause breathing and heartbeat to slow or stop . Opioids ma y significantly reduce pain, but they ma y not er adicate all pain. Life-threatening o verdose can occur when: A patient accidentally tak es an extr a dose or doses A patient accidentally tak es doses more frequently than prescribed A patient deliber ately tak es more medication than prescribed A patient tak es the medication in combination with other drugs or alcohol Any person who is not prescribed the medication tak es it Patients and their caregiv ers must be taught that an o verdose of opioid pain medication is an emergency . If an o verdose is suspected, immediately call 911. Signs of o verdose include: Slow or stopped breathing Slow or stopped heartbeat Limp body Extremely pale and/or clamm y face Blue or purple lips or fingernailsVomiting or emitting gurgling noises Cannot be a wakened Unable to speak Signs of Overmedication Overmedication is a condition that ma y progress to life-threatening o verdose. Signs of overmedication include: Slow or shallow breathing Slow heartbeat Low blood pressure Unusual sleepiness, nodding off Confusion Slurred speech Behavior resembling into xication Pupils pinpoint siz e Difficult y awakening from sleep Patient education must include the following points: Take medicine only if it has been prescribed b y a doctor . Do not tak e more medicine or tak e it more often than instructed. Call a doctor if pain gets worse. Never mix pain medicines with alcohol, sleeping pills, or an y illicit substance. Store medicine in a safe place where children and pets cannot reach it. Know the signs of o verdose and how to use nalo xone to k eep it from becoming fatal. Teach family and friends how to respond to an o verdose. Dispose of unused medication properly . (SAMHS A, 2014d) Patient-Prescriber AgreementsThe use of a patient -clinician agreement helps to reinforce patient education. The FDA has convened a working group to dev elop tools for patients and prescribers when considering opioid analgesics for the treatment of pain. In 2012 the working group dev eloped a model Opioid P atient -Prescriber Agreement (PP A) that is patient -focused to increase a wareness of risks and benefits of opioid analgesics and serv e to emphasiz e the responsibilities of both patient and prescriber (FDA, 2014). Although the FDA 's Safe Use Initiativ e Opioid P atient - Prescriber Agreement is in progress, at the time of this writing it w as not y et finaliz ed. Other agreements are a vailable online. Periodic Review and Monitoring of Patients Any treatment for pain should periodically be reviewed and ev aluated b y the clinician. New information about the patient 's state of health, condition or cause of pain, psy chosocial and mental health, and nature of pain is noted. The clinician should look at the patient 's dosage, the medication schedule (to determine if the patient is indeed taking the prescription as directed and whether the current treatment should be continued or modified). This decision depends on ev aluation of the progress tow ard the treatment objectiv es previously outlined in the plan of care. A t such a review , it is critical to reinforce correct medication usage. According to the Medical Societ y of Dela ware, The licensed pr actitioner shall periodically review the course of pain treatment and an y new information about the etiology of the pain or the patient 's state of health. P eriodic review shall include, at a minimum, ev aluation of the following: 2.5.1 continuation or modification of controlled substances for pain management therapy depending on the pr actitioner 's evaluation of the patient 's progress tow ard treatment goals and objectiv es. 2.5.2 satisfactory response to treatment as indicated b y the patient 's decreased pain, increased lev el of function, or impro ved qualit y of life. Objectiv e evidence of impro ved or diminished function must be monitored and information from family members or other caregiv ers should be considered in determining the patient 's response to treatment. 2.5.3 if the patient 's progress is unsatisfactory , the pr actitioner shall assess the appropriateness of continued use of the current treatment plan and consider the use of other ther apeutic modalities. (MSD , 2013) Monitoring TreatmentRegular monitoring and ongoing assessment to determine if the treatment plan is on tr ack and the patient is achieving results is essential. Pro viders should incorpor ate the following practices in their patient monitoring: Take a psy chiatric history . Opioid ther apy can cause depression and anxiet y, which is especially common in patients taking high doses. Furthermore, addiction to opioids can cause depression due to negativ e impacts on social relationships, financial status, and other areas. Assess patient functioning in multiple areas including work, family , activities of daily living, comparing before and after the medication. Ask the patient if he or she feels an y problems ha ve resulted from the opioid use. Of particular concern are poor work function, interpersonal conflicts, and depression. Assess whether the patient is experiencing an altered schedule of medication, including periods of ex cess use. Determine of the present dosage is controlling pain and to what degree. Ask the patient if she or he experiences an y withdr awal symptoms such as discomfort if going without the opioid. Has the patient ev er used the medication to a void such discomfort or other withdr awal symptoms. Determine whether the patient is experiencing withdr awal-mediated pain. P atients may report intense pain as the opioid wears off , pain all o ver, dysphoria, or sev ere pain and withdr awal symptoms in the morning, with quick relief after taking the opioid. Be aware of and on the look out for aberr ant drug-related beha viors such as multiple prescribing doctors and purchasing opioids from family or friends, or from an ywhere other than a pharmacy . Perform a ph ysical examination and be on the alert for ph ysical signs and symptoms of drug abuse. (CAMH, 2011a) Identifying Diversion and Drug-Seeking Behaviors The purpose of risk assessment is to determine the lik elihood that a patient will dev elop or displa y aberr ant drug-related beha viors. Healthcare pro viders must be observ ant at all times for signs of nonadher ance to treatment plans and dosage instructions. Aberr ant drug-related beha viors include the following: Escalating the dose without a clinician' s order , especially r apidly escalating the dose. Psychoactiv e toler ance dev elops quickly , forcing a drug abuser to tak e more of the medication to achiev e the same effect, often in doses significantly higher than atherapeutic dose for pain. In contrast, analgesic tolerance develops slowly. It would be expected that patients with stable pain would stay on the same dose for months or years. Taking the drug in larger doses than prescribed and running out of medication early. Patients abusing opioids may aggressively request refills earlier than expected, or request additional doctor visits. Acquiring opioids from sources other than by order of the clinician, such as an emergency department, acquiring additional doctors, or buy purchasing the drug on the street. Altering or acquiring prescriptions by means of theft, fraud, or purchase. Using the drug in any method other than that which was prescribed, such as by snorting, injecting, or chewing oral medications for quicker effect. (CAMH, 2011b)Spectrum of Aberrant Drug-Taking Behaviors More suggestive of addiction* Concurrent abuse of alcohol or illicit drugs Evidence of deterioration in the ability to function at work, in the family, or socially that appears to be related to drug use Injecting oral formulations Multiple dose escalations or other nonadherence with therapy despite warnings Obtaining prescription drugs from nonmedical sources Prescription forgery Repeated resistance to changes in therapy despite clear evidence of drug-related diverse physical or psychological effects Repeatedly seeking prescriptions from other clinicians or emergency departments without informing prescriber Selling prescription drugs Stealing or borrowing drugs from others (Passik, 2009) *Documented in patient's medical chart. Less suggestive of addiction Aggressive complaining about the need for more drugs Drug hoarding during periods of reduced symptoms Openly acquiring similar drugs from other medical sources Requesting specific drugs Reporting psychic effects not intended by the clinician Resistance to a change in therapy associated with tolerable adverse effects accompanied by expressions of anxiety related to the return of severe symptoms Unapproved use of the drug to treat another symptom Unsanctioned dose escalation or other nonadherence with therapy on 1 or 2 occasions (Passik, 2009). As is evident above, not all aberrant drug-related behaviors by patients signify addiction. They may instead signify that the patient: Is experiencing increased painHas accidentally been misusing the medication b y taking more than intended Is dev eloping a ph ysical toler ance to the opioid analgesic, which is not as effectiv e as it once w as Is rationing doses to sa ve money , for example, or selling doses for income May have someone in his or her household or living situation who is stealing medication from the patient (Corsini & Z acharoff , 2011) Clinicians need to look closely to determine the reason for the unexpected or aberr ant behaviors. Such beha viors are important clinical signs. It is important to consider all beha viors, and the multitude of reasons that patients may not tak e their medications as they are prescribed. Understanding the specific reason for each unexpected beha vior can help the clinician to tak e the correct next step, and mak e decisions that help minimiz e risk, impro ve safet y, and most of all benefit the patient. (Corsini & Z acharoff , 2011) General Symptoms of Narcotic Abuse Healthcare professionals must be on the look out for the following signs and symptoms of opioid abuse: Analgesia (feeling no pain) Sedation Euphoria (feeling high) Respiratory depression (shallow or slow breathing) Small pupils Nausea, v omiting Itching or flushed skin Constipation Slurred speech Confusion or poor judgment Tools for Monitoring Ongoing Opioid Therapy Prescribers ha ve a number of tools at their disposal to help with ongoing assessment of chronic pain patients who are receiving opioid analgesic ther apy. Here are a few of those tools.Pain Assessm ent and Documentation Tool (PADT) This tool assesses patient progress on long-term opioid treatment for chronic pain, and is used throughout opioid treatment. It in vestigates v arious aspects of the patient 's pain, including lev el of ph ysical pain, the effect of pain on the patient 's day-to-da y living and functioning, adv erse effects of pain, and noticeable drug-seeking beha viors. tool is not predictiv e of drug-seeking beha vior, nor does it predict positiv e and negativ e outcomes of opioid ther apy. Research has shown that the P ADT has strong v alidity and is useful to guide ongoing assessment and documentation (Chou, 2009; P assik, 2004). Addiction Behaviors Checklist (ABC) Developed b y Bruce D . Naliboff with support from V A Health Services R esearch and Development, this is a 20-item, y es/no assessment tool that can increase a pro vider's confidence in determinations of appropriate vs. inappropriate opioid use (W u et al. , 2006). Chabal 5-Point Prescription Opiate Abuse Checklist This is fiv e-point questionnaire that assesses the of opioid abuse through ev aluation of beha viors that are consistent with opioid abuse r ather than answers to specific questions (Chabal et al. , 2013). Pain Medication Questionnaire (PMQ) This is a 26-item self -report assessment tool for ongoing monitoring of aberr ant beha viors. It helps clinicians to identif y whether a long-term chronic pain patient is exhibiting aberr ant behaviors associated with opioid medication misuse (Dowling et al. , 2007). Prescription Drug Use Questionnaire (PDUQ) The PDUQ assesses problematic opioid misuse, abuse, and dependence in chronic pain patients. Evidence suggests the PDUQ' s key screening indicators are ex cellent predictors for the presence of addiction (Compton et al. , 2008). DAST Drug Abuse Scr eening Test A self -administered questionnaire consisting of 28 items with binary (y es/no) answers created b y Harv ey A. Skinner in 1982. Scores of 6 or more indicate the presence of substance dependence or abuse with satisfactory measures of reliabilit y and high lev els of validity, sensitivit y, and specificit y (Yudko et al. , 2007). Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM)A 17-item patient self -assessment that helps clinicians identif y whether a patient, currently on long-term opioid ther apy, may be exhibiting aberr ant beha viors associated with misuse of opioid medications. Since the COMM examines concurrent misuse, it is ideal for helping clinicians monitor patients' aberr ant medication-related beha viors o ver the course of treatment (Butler et al. , 2007). Urine Screens Regular urine drug screening (UDS) is appropriate for patients who are at higher risk for opioid abuse or addiction, and for an y patient who is exhibiting signs of misuse or aberr ant drug beha vior. Urine screening can indicate drug div ersion, misuse, or abuse, and the presence of an illegal drug might indicate addiction. An y nonprescribed opioid ma y signal drug abuse or doctor shopping. Of course, pro viders using routine urine drug screening must remember that all diagnosis and treatment must be based on a careful assessment of the patient. UDS tools can deliv er false negativ es or false positiv es. Patients must pro vide a detailed history of their medication use o ver the previous da ys and hours. Also , providers must inform patients that urine will be used for a urine drug screening and get patient consent before performing the labor atory screening. Ideally , urine drug screening is part of the patient -prescriber agreement that is already in place. Pill Counting Pill counting is one method of ensuring medication adherence and helps to prev ent drug diversion. Counting pills is done to compare the number of doses remaining in a prescription container with the number of doses that should remain, if the patient adhered to the medication schedule perfectly . For this method to work, the prescriber must order the medication such that the patient has doses remaining at the time of the next visit, and then should ask the patient to bring remaining pills to the visit. The limitation of this str ategy is that one cannot be sure that absent pills were consumed; they ma y have been div erted instead. Healthcare professionals must k eep careful records about the amount of medication dispensed, prescription date, date the prescription w as filled, and how man y doses remain before the refill. When Patient Care Is Ending Documentation Nurses ha ve an important role to pla y in k eeping medical records complete and accur ate. Patient medical records should remain current and be accessible for review , and should include the following:Medical history and ph ysical examination Diagnostic, ther apeutic, and labor atory results Evaluations and consultations Treatment objectiv es Discussion of risks and benefits Informed consent Treatments Medications, including date, t ype, dosage, and quantit y prescribed Instructions and agreements Periodic review (MSD , 2013) Referral to Pain Management Specialists Clinicians should be willing to refer patients to pain management specialists if they are uncertain about the pain diagnosis or the prescribing, monitoring, or discontinuing of opioid analgesics for patient pain. Pain specialt y professional organizations and primary care professional associations should work together to support the collabor ation of pain specialists with primary care practitioners and teams when primary care pro viders ha ve exhausted their expertise and the patient 's pain persists (IOM, 2011). Discontinuation of Opioids Discontinuing opioid ther apy is appropriate if there is a lack of ther apeutic effectiv eness or if risk increases. Also , if the patient reports continued sev ere pain despite a trial of sev eral different opioids, discontinuing the opioid ther apy by careful, safe tapering is indicated. Another reason to taper is if the patient is experiencing unmanageable adv erse side effects, complications such as depressed mood, sleep apnea, sedation, or is displa ying aberr ant drug-related beha vior or signs of addiction despite a reasonable dose. Clinicians must ex ercise the following precautions in tapering opioids: Tapering decisions must be made on an individual basis. Clear, written and v erbal instructions should be giv en to patients and their families to educate them about tapering and to minimiz e withdr awal symptoms. Be prepared to pro vide supportiv e counseling and frequent (weekly) follow -up visits. Ask about pain, withdr awal symptoms, and an y beneficial effects of the tapering, suchas impro ved mood, energy lev el and alertness and decreased pain. Prepare a detailed tapering plan, including t ype of opioid, scheduled doses, and a frequent dispensing schedule. Switch to morphine if the patient is dependent on h ydromorphone or o xycodone. Use slow tapering for patients who ha ve cardio-respir atory conditions. Adjust dose up or down as necessary to reliev e withdr awal symptoms without inducing sedation. Refer patients with complicated withdr awal symptoms to a pain specialist or a medical center that specializ es in treating withdr awal. Refer patients with opioid addiction for substance abuse disorder treatment. Addiction is best managed b y opioid agonist treatment such as methadone or buprenorphine. (VA/DoD , 2013) Compliance w ith State and Federal Laws To prescribe, dispense, or administer controlled substances, the prescriber must be licensed in the State of Dela ware and comply with all applicable state and feder al regulations. The Pr actitioner 's Manual of the U .S. Drug Enforcement Administr ation provides specific regulations go verning the medical use of controlled substances (DEA, 2006). Prescribers who hold an activ e Controlled Substances R egistr ation (CSR) must register with the Dela ware Prescription Monitoring Progr am established in the Dela ware Prescription Monitoring Act (16 Del. C.\u00a7 4798). Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) Clinicians should request a report of a patient 's medication history from the state' s PDMP before prescribing opioids. PDMPs tr ack controlled substances prescribed b y authoriz ed practitioners and dispensed b y pharmacies. PDMPs assist in patient care, pro vide early - warning signs of drug epidemics, and help to detecting drug div ersion and insur ance fr aud. Delaware's Prescription Drug am, known as Prescription Monitoring Progr am (PMP) authoriz es the Office of Controlled Substances to establish, maintain, and monitor the PMP for the purpose of reducing the misuse of controlled substances in Delaware and promoting impro vements in patient care and professional pr actice standards. When Drug Diversion Is Suspected If a healthcare professional suspects that drug div ersion has occurred, he or she must document the suspicion and mak e a report to the following agencies:Local la w enforcement and local fr aud alert networks DEA ( theft or loss of controlled substances) on the DEA Office of Div ersion Control website. HHS-OIG National Hotline (800 HHS- TIPS, or 800 447 8477) or T TY 800 377 4950 or at this website. More information can be found here (HSS CMS , 2014). Drug Take-Back Programs Combating prescription drug abuse necessitates the proper disposal of unused, unneeded, or expired medications. P atients must ha ve a secure and con venient w ay to dispose of controlled substances. The Drug Enforcement Agency has strict regulations for drug tak e- back progr ams, including National Prescription Drug T ake Back Da ys (ONDCP , 2013). Healthcare pro viders should encour age patients to use such tak e-back disposal services when a vailable. If no tak e-back progr am is a vailable, patients should be w arned to tak e precautions that help prev ent en vironmental impact and drug div ersion, including mixing pharmaceuticals with undesir able substances such as coffee grounds or cat litter; sealing them in a bag, empty can, or other nonleaking container; and remo ving all personal information (name, phone number , prescription number) from product packaging and labels (FDA, 2011). According to the U .S. Drug Enforcement Agency , the most recent National Prescription Drug T ake-Back Da y on September 27, 2014, in Dela ware collected 4,707 pounds of unwanted, unused, and expired prescription drugs from citiz ens (DEA, 2014). The previous National Prescription Drug T ake-Back ev ents ha ve remo ved over 2,411 tons of prescription drugs from homes nation wide (DEA, 2014).
