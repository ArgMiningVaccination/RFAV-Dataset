At this level. the Trust is making a significant impact on the medical mearch scene in Britain. This situation arises, not only because of the rire of the sum. but also because government policy for the funding of research has been restrictive. Dunng the last two years the funds provided to universities by government have been cut, the Medical Research Council has received las far growth thari it needs, the National Health Service has bgn curtailed and all three organisations have been the subject of considerable -thy and changing organisation. The effect of these changes and cuts is quite apparent in the morale of those undertaking research and the mmplain\u00fc have been vociferous. One hopes that the new pattern that is evolving will be an improvement because, if not, a great amount of time will have bm wasted without significant savi@ from the upheavals that have kept these organisations pie-oecupied. Uuring a time of hanciai retrirtion and reappraiml it is difficult to launch the new pians that are essential for the continual renewal needed for the evolution of research. The task of the Tmt has therefore been two-fold. We have tried 10 maintain the morale of those most noticeably affected by the pericd of uncertainty and have shown by specific major activities that new ideas can he funded at the present time. In the first category we have launched a consolidated fellowship supp-m scheme from the immediate post-graduate student phase (WcUcome PrUe Studentships) to the senior level (Wellcame Principal Fellowrhips) by expanding our coverage and incorporating ail our former schema into a progressive research career pattern. We have also increased our provision for short-term (3 year) project support to make up some of the short-fall anticipated by the restriction of MRC funds - our awards having increased from 681 to l\u00fb22 at an average e011 OP \u00ee38,741 and the toll has increased from f19.6m to f39.6m for the two-year period. Thirdly, we have introduced a higher proporlion of s~pporl for longer- term projects, the earliest being the Molecular Parasitology Unit in Glasgow (Professor Andrew Tait. Director) and the Weiicome TNW Cancer Research Campaign Institute of Cancer and Deveiopmenll Biology in Cambridge (Professor John Gurdon. Chairman). Thirty-one other major grants to the total offll.9m have been made. an indication of the Trust's willingnesr to give more prolonged larger-scale support for worthy projects. An attempt to introduce a major f3m programme for non-invasive studies of the brain proved less easy to develop on the large scale that had been thought necessary. But in addition, the Trust has recognised that the future of medical research in this country is no longer ~olely 8 matter for government policy making. The size of the charitable input overall and the changing ~tructure ai university funding has meant that the charities are not only an alternative IOWCC of fundi but a significant voice in policy making. It became necessary during this period Io establish the Association of Medical Research Charities because of the Department of Health's failure Io recognise the role of the charities in the research training of doctors. This organisation has also been significant in bringing to the notice of the government the el\u00efecis of changer in government funding On the activities of these private organisations. Of particular significance would be a change in policy an overheads in the duai support system of research in the universities. The Trust has spent a large amount of time negotiating about this problem. In the meanwhile the Trust is an active member of the Association of Medical Research Charities (the Director is an the Executive Committee). It has close informal links with the Medical Research Council - the Director was invited to take part in a special session of ils Anniversary meeting al Leeds Calk - and various officials have visited the TNS~ for discussions. The Trust awaits with intc\u00efest the government's pronouncements on the reports by the Advisory Board far Rerearch Cauncilr on 'A Strategy far the Science Bare' and the House of Lords Sub-Committee on Science and Technology on 'Priorities in Medical Research'. Ta the latter the Trust gave evidence but was not consulted about the former. We hope that the decisions will mt damage the Trust's long-standing supporl of the universities. During the part two years the Trwt has tried to encourage a greater public interest in medical research. With this purpose in mind it was pleased to act as joint sponsor with the Medical Research Council of a book for schools on medical research, and to sponsor a meeting at the Royal Society on Priorities in Medical Research organised by The Foundation far Science and Technology. II also put an display in the Wcllcome Building posters '4 3iid nrieiacir the *Wellcome holders of Socm and Tcchnolopy mcdiu ~ard\\ and recognised isincc the >tir1 of ihe AIDS rpidmiel.

OVERSEAS AFiIVITIES The overseas activities of the Trust in the Tropics and elsewhere took some new turns during this period. It war decided to fund a Unit al Kilifi on the coast of Kenya, north of Mombasa. The co-operative programme between the Kenya Medical Research Institute and the Depanmenl of Tropical Medicine a1 Oxford University has developed through the eKorU of Profermr David Warrell, formally head of the Tmst*s Unit in Bangkok. It will work on the natural history of malarial infection. Teams from London and Oxford are also working an AIDS in Nairobi. The Trust also supported a meeting organised by the Commonwealth Secmadat which led 10 the Commonwealth Health Derciopment Plan - but this is finding difficulty in coming Into action. In Australia the scheme of Australian Fellowships was extended for a further four years and a speeial bicentennial award for aboriginal studies war provided. 5 SUPPORT OF INDIVIDUALS In 1988 the Tmrt revised ita scheme for the support of individuals so as to provide competitive wards at all stages of a research career. Ail Trust awards will in future be called Studentships or Fellowships. The Truiees wit1 he pleared if individuals supported by the Trustees are awarded honorary university titles in recognition of their contribution to the university in which they work. hut expect this aspect of their professional life not to be so great as to impede the progress of the research work for which they are funded by the Trw. The revised schemes for the support of individuals are summarised in the following two diagrams in which they are compared with equivalent university popilionsi The Bgurer shown against each award give an indi- cation of the age at which it is most likely to be made hut there are indicative only, and particularly EO in the case of Principal Research Fellows. The criteria for and conditions of each type of award are given in detail in the Trust's current booklet, 'Grants and Support for Research'. 6 7 8 A CENTRE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH The Trustees having agreed the importance of taking a more visible role in the affairs of medical research, it in very opportune that space will become available to do so in the Wellcome Building in Enston Road. The Trustees believe that it is necessary for medical research to have a central organisation which can act ar a fouis far overall activity in this kkl. They therefore propose to refarhion the Wellcome Building to create a meetings, exhibition and information centre, to which all who are con- cerned with the organisation, management and funding of mearch cm resort. to discuss common problems and expose to the public thqimpwt- ance of past and present achievement. There is a necessity - if the government is going to reduce its dominance - far ail those who contribute and participate to have a centre in which to be informed and to inform One another. The Tmst hopes that this new initiative will set a pilive pattern far the future in which once more we can be excited by the PrOspecLS rather than bemoan the strictures and dream of the past days of plenty. Unity will come from co-operation and the importance of the private sector MW needs to be recognised if we are to make the mat of I. During the next three years the Centre will be planned and developed for opening in 1992. Those concerned with medical research will be brought together to develop their common interests and give their opinion on what is needed. We have the concept and the outline but now we nml to fill in the spaces. The activities of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine and the Wellcome Tropical Institute are recorded later in the report. Their future role in the Wellcome Centre is under active consideration. 9 FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION The two years 1986.88 have been a period of continuing change, partieu- larly relating to the Trust's financiai health. The sale of shares in Weilmme plc In February 1986 created a large fund which was then invested using four firms of investment managers in the City. By the end of Septmixr 1986 over 3W investments were held. valued at f211 million. The investment powers under which theTrust operated had hen established in 1956 by decision of Mr. Justice Upjohn and, broadly speaking, there powers recognised the investment opportunities as they mined at that time. Thus the Trust was not allowed to invest in equities anywhere in the world other than through the London or New York stock exchanges, and further. at least one third of the fund had to he held in Government Securities. The Trustees decided that these restrictions would, over the long term, be of considerable financial disadvantage and therefore an application was made to obtain wider investment powers. In July 1987 MI. Justice Hofiman ordered, in the Chancery division, that the investment powers of the Trust should he altered. This effectively gave the Trustees Power to invest in any area which proper external advisors considered advantageous (although at all timer remembering the charitable status of the Trust). The award of there powers gave cise to a eonsideraMe re- investment of the funds under management and, in particular. divemi- fication from Government Securities. By the end of the i986/7 financial Year a very healthy growth had taken place in the asrets under management and they were then valued at \u00ef293 million. On Monday, 19th October 1987 ('Black Monday'), all the major stock markets throughout the world collapsed and, as a result. a very large proportion of the gains In the T~it'i investment ponfolio achieved rince the Rotation of the Company, war lost. However, subsequently the Managers have succeeded in recovering a large pan of the values lost, 60 by the end of the 1987/88 financial year the investment fund of the TNS~ has recovered to f245 million (comprising Some 350 holdings throughout the world). It was fortunate for the Trust that. at a time when the valuer of international portfolios were under attack and when profits on investments disappeared and were replaced by losses, the dividend of Wellcome ph continued to grow. The effects of these events are clearly shown in the analysis of income for the two years covered by this report: i986/7 198718 Income from Wellcome plc 18.8 25.7 Dividends and interest received 15.7 15.3 Realised profits (losses) - 13.3 0 47.J- In spite of these changes the Tmrteer were able to confirm their commit- ment to the expenditure plans for 1987/8 and to approve further increases for 1988/9. The grant records of the Trust, which have for many Years been Partly computerised, and the financial records are now being prepared far a fully integrated computer system. This will assist the staff to maintain the high standard of recording of the increased volume of grants and, further, will enhance the management information systems. Dunng the two-year period, the total number of staff employed in the administration ofthe Trust has remained unchanged in spile of the increase in many of the activities. This is a remarkable achievement of which all should be proud Planning has now started in connection with the major redevelopment of the buildings in Eurtan Road awned by lhe Trustees. When completed in the early 1990s it is intended lhat the Trust offices will move from its present premises to the Wellcome Building in Euston Road. Thus, for the first time, all the In~tit~fi~ns created under Sir Henry Wellcome's will, will be housed under one roof in a Centre which will focus attention on the imparlance of the objectiver set out in his will, 14 I I I5 WELLCOME PLC The Trustees maintain a regular connection wilh Weilcome pb and make an annual visit to both the Beckenham and Nosh Carolina rewareh laboratories. They are naturally pleased with the way the company is thriving and were glad that Her Majesty the Queen bestowed a knighthood on Sir Alfred Shepperd, Chairman and Chief Executive of the Wdlmme Foundation. in the 1989 New Year's Honoun. They were also pleased 10 learn of the award of the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology 10 Sir James Black, Dr. George Hilchings and Dr. Gertrude Elion for lheir work an drug deveiopment. Drs. Hilchings and Elion spent almosl the whole of their scientific working life in the laboratories of the United States of America Company. II STAFF OF THE TRUST D~re\u00e7Ioc P.O. Williams, MA, MB.

Sir William Paton, FRS, retired on 30th September 1987. He had hm a Trustee since 1978 when he was appointed to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Sir John McMichaei. He brought to the Tmt B broad experience and a depth of learning that few could match. His specid experience in physiology and pharmacology replaced that available a\u00efir from Henry Dale and Henry Barcroft and so he was able to lead the development of the Trust's policy in there fields during the initial phase of the aciivities of the Physiology and Pharmacology Panel. His special interest in books and history was also of unique value and led IO him acting as honorary director of the Welieome Institute for the History of Medicine from October 1983. This special knowledge was combined wiih a wide experience of the world of medical science gained through his diverse researches on such subjects as the physiological effects of deep rea diving and drug addiction. He also had been or still was a member of significant organisations such as the Royal Society% the MRC and the Research Defence Society and therefore had a long-standing hwledee of the affairs of the medical rereareh community. With this background and a willingness to give deep thought to the serious problems involved in the evolution of the Trust and then to prepare a considered opinion made him a very valuable member of the Board. Unfonunately during his time as a Trustee he suffered a serious illness and in the latter years was not able to devote as much energy to its affairs as he and we would have liked, But it was often said that Bill Paton at half pace left most of us far behind. His special interest and concern for the history Of medicine which led to him taking on the Honorary Direetorship of the WlHM muSt be especially mentioned. II helped to give that Institute a feeling of direct interest from the Trust and a champion at coun and his depanure has left a difficult gap to fill. During his final year he chaired a Working PW of the Trust an the History of Medicine and the repon of that Working Party is a significant force in the development of the future History of Medicine programme. In recognition of his services the Trustees arranged for his portrait to be painted in the robes for the honorary degree of Doctor Of Science al Edinburgh University which was awarded at the time of the Tmt's 50fh Anniversary meeting at Edinburgh in July 1987. The portrait war Prewnted at a special dinner at the Tmst in November 1987. His rage advice is much missed. 27 Sir William has been replaced as a Trustee by Dr. luiian Jack of University College, Oxford. Dr. Jack has been a member of the Physiology and Pharmacology Panel far werai years and was known to the Trustees for his wise advice and interest in the physiological field. His pincipal interest is in the physiology of the central nervous system. DI. lack has taken over the Chairmanship of the Physiology and Pharmacology Panel. Dr. Peter Bali resigned from the Trust's senior staff in September i987 after two years in charge of its Clinical Research and Senior Lecturer programmer. He took over from Dr. Harold Edwards, who had retired, and Dr. David Gordon, who transferred to look after physiology and pharmacology. Peter Bail brought a highly developed intellect to bear on his Reidr of responsibility and helped those for whom he was respansibie in many ways. David Gordon took responsibility for the clinical sphere when Peter Bali left and Bridge1 Ogilvie the Senior Lecturers. The Trustees were then able to recruit Professor Laurence Smaje as Assistant Director in charge of the Physiology and Pharmacology Panel and he ha\u00ee settied in very well and already taken initiatives about aisesment and feedback which will help the Trust to fulfil its mie. Laurenee Smaje has been Professor of Physiology at the Charing Cross Hospital Medical School since 1980. His principal interest is in the field of the mieracircuiation and he continuer his research on a part-time basis in the Department of Physiology at SI. Mary's Hospital Medical School. Dr. I. Scott joined the stalf in February 1987 as a Scientific Officer to work with Dr. Morgan. The Trustees decided to reorganise their committee structure for the History of Medicine IO that the activities of the WlHM might have a more appropriate management after the retirement of Sir Wiiiiam Paton. To do this the History of Medicine Panel and the WlHM Committee have been replaccd by the History of Medicine Committee with Sir David Steel as Chairman. Two panels on Grants and Units and the Library will repon to the Commitlee. Mr. Eric Freeman. Deputy Director of the WlHM and Chief Librarian, was asked to take overail charge of the History of Medicine Programme as Deputy Director for the History of Medicine and act as Secretary of the History of Medicine Committee, chaired by Sir David Steel. David Alien - who has recently been awarded a PhD by Cambridge University for his published work -will continue to look after the Grants and Units Panel, chaired by D\u00ef. W.H. Brack. Dr. F.W. Ratclilfe - Librarian of Cambridge University - has agreed to chair the Library Panel. On the administrative side ofthe office. Peter McNeiiy has been appointed a5 Financial Controller reporting to Mr. Macgregor. He joined the Trust on is1 March 1988. 28 The general management of the Trust now falis into three main sections, under the Director: 1. Science (Dr. B.M. Ogiivie, Deputy Dircaar) 2. Finance and Administration (Mr. 1. Macgregor. Deputy Dimor) 3. History of Medicine (Mr. E. Freeman, Deputy Director) with a proactive group for planning the new Centre. Thme sections together comprise the Directorate, which is responsible to the Tmsteer overali for the management and development of the Trust. The Trustees wish to thank Severai members of staff who have either retired or resigned.

SENIOR BASIC BIOMEDICAL FELLOWSHIPS SENIOR BASIC BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE FELLOWSHIPS in 1985 the Trustees responded to repreientationr from the universities concerning the serious decline in the number of research posts available to young investigators by reintroducing a fellowship scheme. with the purpose of supporting outstanding young basic scientists with an estab- lirhed record in biomedical research. The fellowships are tenable for five years in the first instance, with m extension to eight years following a successful review. The Trust provides the fellow's salary and subitanliai funds to cover the cost of an associated research programme The scheme was fiml advertised in October 1985, and attracted 59 appii- cations, including 3 from North America and 3 from Europe. Seven fellowships, total value f900,0W, were awarded in 1986 following SUCEOSE- ful interviews, 2 of the awards going to candidates who had spent a post- doctorai period abroad (Europe). Applications from scienti~t~ working abroad and wishing to return to the UK, and from those wishing to move to other institutes were particularly encouraged. The response to the second round (1987) was very enthusiastic. Ninety- five preliminary applications were received, 16 of which were from North America, 5 from Europe and 1 from Africa. Twenty-four people were asked to submit a formal application. Of these, 18 were interviewed, including 5 from North America, leading to the ofler of awards to 5 candidates, one of whom had been working in the USA. The fields of immunology, parasitology, molecular, cellular and developmental biology were strongly represented by the successful candidates. Sir interviewees, not oflered Senior Fellowships. were offered other support, including 2 University Awards of five years' duration, 3 Research Assistantships (2 of five years', 1 of three years' duration), and I Travelling Research Fellow- ship to Europe. The third round (1988) attracted 96 applications, 21 of which were from aspirants in North America. and 4 from post-doctoral scientists working in Europe. Fifteen people, including 5 in the USA, were asked to come forward with a formai application. The TNStees had hoped, when the scheme was introduced, that a high prworlion of the domestic UK applicants would wish to move to neiv institutions. but only 2 of the 53 domestic applicants for the 1986 awards 54 showed such an intention. The situation improved in 1987 and 1988 with respectivcly I5 out of 73 and 18 out of 71 of the domestic applicants wishing to move.

At present there aie 44 Senior Lecturers still in post. When the scheme was initiated, il WQ hoped that those appointed 10 it wouid be of such a calibre that they wouid cvenliially obtain established university posts. The Trustees did not seek a guarantee from the universities 10 this effect. but noted that the SUCE~SI of the scheme would depend on a Row of individuals through the posts. TO some extent this purpose has been fulfilied in that 16 have moved to tenured posts, which is particularly pleasing as the employment situation in the universities continues to be serious. Appointments were made initially for five years with subsewenl reviews al three year ininvais on a rolling contract. As the scheme has progressed, it has been clear that at the rcview at six years. the future of the Senior Lecturers needs to be carefully examined jointiy by the Trust and the university. This review takes into account the plans of the university and the unique qualities of each individual. The last appointments under this scheme were made in 1986 and il has been decided not to make any more appointments of this type. The Trw recently revised its schemes for the support of individuals. Scientists who would previously have been eligible for supporl under this scheme are now supported either as Senior Clinical or Basic Biomedical Feliows or a5 Principal Research Fellows, a scheme which will come into effect in 1988-89. The Trustees were pleased to hear of the foilowing appoinlments of Senior Lecturers and past Senior Lestniers: Dr. B,i~\"B~,~h~ii~pp~i\"t~ Io the Chair of Biochemical Medicine at the Univerriiy Dr. Dovid C.A.

It was introduced in 1983, with the intention of promoting teaching and research in subjects selected by the universities, and providing additional appointments for younger ScientistS seeking opportunities fox an academic career in biomedical and veterinary research. During the operation Of the Lectureship scheme. a total of 48 appointments were funded in a range of biomedical and clinical sciences at 26 universities. ai a cost of about f4.8 million. Each award provided a sulaw and associated costs, and some research expenses, for up to five years. In setting up these lectureships, the Tru\u00eetecs hoped that on the termination of their mpport. universities would inmrporate the pst in their establishment and take financial responsibility for the Lecturers. So far 5 Lecturers have been granted established posts. and undertakings have been given in respect of another 6 appointments. Five Welicome Lecturers have resigned to take up similar or more senior appointments in other universities. and 1 whose post was not established, has moved to the pharmaceutical industry. Currently there are 38 Weilcame Lecturers in POEL. AWARD Unlwmity of Cambridge: far five years. IO Study the molecular genetics of haekaphiiia A and B, under Profemx R. W. carrell. E. RESEARCH TRAINING FELLOWSHIPS IN CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY WELLCOME RESEARCH TRAINING FELLOWSHIPS IN CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY These awards, with tenure for three years, are intended to provide support for medical graduates, under ihe age of 34 and with post-registration experience, with the opportunity 10 undertake a programme of research involving the application of epidemiological principles and techniques to prohiems of clinical medicine. A formal course of training in epidemiology is generaiiy a prerequiriie 10 the research programme and awards may include provision for the payment of fees and travelling expenses incurred in pursumce of lhe course. Since the introduction of Ihe scheme in 1979, the Trustees have made 25 awards at a Lotai cost of about f1.5m. Of the 12 Fellows whose awards have terminated, IO have taken up academic or research appointments: 6 have been appointed to Senior Lectureships or LeclUreshipi in United Kingdom medical schools, 2 have taken up university research posts and 2 are engaged in research over sea^, During the period under review, 12 nominations were received and the TNsieer made 8 awards. The Trustees were pleased to learn that one of their farmer fellows, Dr. Kay-Tee Kaw, had been appointed to lhe Chair in Clinical Gerontology at the University of Cambridge.

TRAINING FELLOWSHIPS IN HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH TRAINING FELLOWSHIPS IN HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH In 1986, at the mggeaion of Dr. Gordon Smith, the Trustees decided to explore ways in which they might support the fieid of Health Services Research. Asafirst stepa meetingwas held ai theTrust with representatives of universities, medical rehaair, government funded departments and interested charities. They agreed that the mo5t urgent need was to establish 8 cadre of expen workers who had eompleled an appropriate programme of training in the underlying disciplines and techniques of Health Services Research. The general view was expressed that the availability of funding foi high quality research in the field was adequate. in the light of this view, thc Trustees agreed to allocate funds for a trial scheme of Research Training Fellowships and severai university departments were invited to formulate training programmer and nominate suitable candidates for awards. In 1987-88, 4 nominations were received and 2 swards were made. The Trustees have recently reviewed the operation of the triai scheme and. with some revision of the conditions, have agreed to its continuation in 1988-89.

RESEARCH TRAINING FELLOWSHIPS FOR MEDICAL ANDDENTALGRADUATES MEDICAL AND DENTAL GRADUATE RESEARCH TRAINING FELLOWSHIPS The Trustees provide Rerearch Training Fellowships for Medical and Dental Graduates who wish to punue an academic career in the United Kingdom. This general scheme covers a11 clinical subjects including the Trun'r former research training fellowship schemes ill surgery and pafhol- ogy. Separate arrangements a\u00efe still made for vision research. mental health, clinical epidemiology and health services research. In their last report. the Trustees expressed some disappointment at the calibre of applicants for there training fellowships. They are pleased to he able to report that large numbers of good candidates are now coming forward and that individuals receiving Fellowships are undoubtedly of high promise. Applications are considered four times each year, and Fellows and their sponson appear to find the flexibility of the rclieme a considerable convenience. During the two years under review, 34 new Fellowship awards have been made. The Tnistw have been pleased 10 learn of the foilowing award: Dr. A. Duncombe (Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine).

WELLCOME PRIZE STUDENTSHlPS WELLCOME PRIZE STUDENTSHIPS The Trustee\u00ee have been concerned by the progressive reduction in the number of Research Council Studentships that has occurred in recent years. They therefore decided 10 set aside fi million p.a. for three years. beginning in 1987-88, to provide support far postgraduate research training. The new seheme of Wellcome Prize Studentships aims, by means of a higher level of stipend and increased research EYPPO~~ cosls, ta encourage the best young rcientirlr IO embark upon research at post- graduate level. The introduction of the scheme war very warmly received in the scientific community. The iirsi round of applications proved so successful and produced applicants ai such a high quality that the Trustees agreed to increase the number of awards from the proposed 30 to 49: 42 of the piaees oKered were accepted. Each year institutions will be invited to nominate candidates; applications from individual candidates or potential supervisors will not be considered. The recipients of these awards are detailed an the following pages. 82 AWARDS OF WELLCOME PRIZE STUDENTSHIPS MI. D. Alessi.

Neuroscienee research is developing rapidly in scale and scope. and the Trustees are most grateful foi the expert advice on the development of this subject provided by the Panel. Reseorch Support Large numbers of applications far ad hoe pmject grants continue to be received: in their last report, the Tnislee~ expressed some disappointment that the Panel were oniy able to recommend few of the giants reousted. They are now pleased to report that the awarding rate har increased in response to the higher quality of the applications received. The Trustees are now supporting a number of programmes of neUroscience research. In their last repart. they noted the award to Professan hicCuiIoeh and Brooks of the University of Glasgow for a multidisciplinan, pro- gramme of studies in AWieimer's disease. The Trustees have alsa agreed a substantial award to Dr. Chr\u00fctopher Pairburn in Oxford. who will Inid the largest and most detailed investigation into eating disordm and abnormal eating behaviour yet mounted in this country. A programme grant from the Trust allowed Dr. lohn PhiiPpr to return to the United Kingdom from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and he is now working in the University of Oxford an the mechanisms for the Iepresen- tation of form in the somatorensory system. For some years, the Trustees have wished to stimulate research on the human brain using non-invasive techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance. positron emission tomography, magnewencephalomphy, and other methods. In 1986 they advertised the availability of the sum of f3.000,WO far an award in this area. Despite a number of good awl!- catiots. none war excelim in ail respects and the Trustees were at that time unable to make an award. However, the advertisement was outstandingly successful in attracting project and programme mnl appii- cations using such non-invasive techniques. Dr. Peler Liddle of the 91 Department of Psychiatry al the Charing Cross and Weriminater Medical School WYIE awarded a grant for studies in schizophrenia using positron emission tomography: in these experiments he hopes to obtain additional evidence for the functional changer underlying the phenomenology of schizophrenia. work which he began as a Wellcome Trust Research Training Registrar in Oxford. Mr. David Deipy of the Department of Medical Physics at University College London, with a number of COI- leaguer. was awarded a grant of nearly f1.4 million far study of the brain of new born babies in intensive care. The techniques used by this group include nnclear magnetic resonance - the funds for their first NMR magnet were provided by the Trust in 1982 - and near infrared absorption speclroic<~py. Infrared rpeclrarcopy of the brain was developed by this group, and allows measurement of blood flow and oxygenation of the neonaial brain by completely non-lnvaiive and safe methods. Professor Gordon Donaldron al the University of Slrathclyde and Dr. Andrew Weir in ihc University of Glasgow, with a number of colleagues, have been awarded a substantial grant for their work in devciapment of new devices and techniques for magnetophysiological recordings in man. Dr. Michael Rugg in the Universily of St. Andrews and Dr. Richard Roberts in the University of Dundee will be continuing their studies of event-related electrical potenliais, particularly extending this work to palients with defined neurological lesions. The Trustees have also supported some very fundamental work towards the development of new techniques: Professor Marty\" Symons of the University of Leiccsler has continuing suppori for a programme to develop applications of electron spin resonance to biological systems. The Wellcome Trust was represented at a meeting sponsored by the Neurosciences lnitilute in New York in January 1988, where experts from both rider of the Atlantic discussed the present state and likely future progress of the various techniques used to sludy the brain in life. The lively and informed discussion al this meeting was a great help to the Trustees in formulating lheir policy in this subject, and they are grateful to the Neurosciences lnrlilute of the Neurosciences Research Prog~am for sponsoring and organising this meeting. Resemi# Troininp and Amdemic oevelopmenr The Trust suppon~ schemer in Oxford, Manchester. and at the lnStilUte of Psychiatry for registrars to obtain a short period of research training 92 a during their clinical rotation. A number of trainees exposed to rereareh in this way have been proposed for Rerearch Training Fellowship and subsequently moved to academic positions: the work of Dr. Peter Liddle is mentioned above. Excellent candidates continue to apply for the Trustees' Mental Heaith Fellowships. and the Trustees hope that these individuals will provide a pool of trained clinical neuroxientists who will conInbute to the development of the subject in future years. 93 MENTAL HEALTH AND THE RELATED NEUROSCIENCES Lis1 of Gmnls Aworded Over f2,WO LONGER-TERM SUPPORT MI.

In i987-88,58% of grant applications received support at least in part, representing 36% of the total rum applied for. For parasitology and related diseases, the funds provided fall into approximately 3 equal paris for malaria, other protozoa and helminthr. The following table of awards iliustrates the active centres of rerearch in this field: London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine 30% Wellcome Overseas Research Units 13% Imperial Coilege of Science, Technology and Medicine 7% Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine 6% Elsewhere 44% Over the period 1986-88 there war a decrease in the iiumber of awards for research on non-infectious tropical diseases. accompanied hy an increase for non-tropical infectious diseases, mainly viralogical. Panel members identified four areas which nced greater research effon or recruitment. These are: 1. Biochemical aspects of parasiter relevant to passible chemotherapeutic controi. 2. Medical bacteriology, in particular, molecular approaches to pathogen- icity. 3. Entomology involving new technological considerations. 4. The continuing need for clinicians to undertake research careers in tropical medicine. Funds available for 3-year Projecl Grants are being reduced in 1988-89 by ISQo to provide increased s~ppoti for langer-term awards in confomiv With Trust policy. Infectious disease, which had been selected as a subjeet IO5 for special 'earmarked' status, has now had this slatns removed. This decirian rcfleets the SUEC~SI of the scheme in career development and research undertaken, ar well es the increased awareness of the importance of infectious diseases. Applications for awards to individuals will now be considered in open competition within the Trust's general schemes. It was considered that a special el\u00efort is needed to stimulate research in medical bacteriology involving molecular approaches in view of the disproportionate emphasis given to clinical service ~EPCC~S of the subject in the UK. In 1987-88 a Major Award of f250,000 was advertised. This competition was wan by Professor S. Tabaqchali, Si. Barthoiamew's Hovilal Medical College. to work on the molecular cloning and genetic analysis of virulence determinants and key antigens from Cimtridiwn diflciie. An award of f100,000 was made to Professors Sir David Wcatherall and D.A. Warrell towards the earl of iaboratory space within the new Institute of Molecular Medicine building for developments proposed in infectious discases research. The Trustees donated f100.000 to the University of the West lndier in Jamaica towards thc cost ai restoration work following the hurricane disaster of September 1988. 106 UNITS A meeting at which the Unit Directors presented their work was organised jointly with the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene as part of the Trust's fiftieth anniversary celebrations. It was held at the Sodety'r premises in Portland Piace on Sth-7th May 1987, and published in the Transactions of the Society - Vai.82.,1.1988. Unidade de Estudos Esprciais dr Wellcome, Belem, Brazil This Unit was established in 1965 by Professor R. Lainson, FRS. to study the ecology and epidemiology of human leishmaniasis in the Amazonian region of Brazil. in long-term collaboration with Dr. J.J. Shaw, many major contributionr have been made on the idcntifieation and taxonomy of leishmanial parasites. randfly vectors and animai CeSeNOiTS ar well BI the delineation of four distinct clinical types of human direare. Studies in vadous field sits we supported by a comprehensive range of laboratoly studies in Beiem, ranging from isoenzyme profiles to maintenance of seven ciosed sandfly coionier. Dr. Catherine Hanham has been producing manaclonai antibodies against newly isolated parasite Species. Her work had led to a method for direct identification of leishmania in infared sandflies. A number of new species are being charaeerired. some of them associated with human disease. One of the latter, Leirhinonio loinsoni. has been fully dercdbed. Visceral leishmaniasis due to Leishmonia cllogosi is a major inlerest of the Unit and is being studied on the island of Marajo. Investigations on the fox Cerdocyon thous as a likely primary reservoir are being conducted in collaboration with Dr. D.W. Macdonald (University of Oxford). Work is currently cancentrating on the ecology of the fax and the sandfly vector-fox interface. Cutaneous leishmaniasis due to Leishmonio brozilienris Is studied in the Serra dos Carajas region of Para. The Unit has a field station in a newly opened area of primary forest where there are major iron ore and hydroelectric dam developments. The animal reservoir for L. brnziliensis is still unknown and its identity remains a major objective. Dr. J.O. Howard visited Belem in October 1988 to see the work of the Unit and its field a~tivitiei as well as the lnsfit~t~ Evandra Chams which accommodates and collaborates with the Wellcome group. The Agreement with the Brazilian Ministry of Health was extended to 1992. 107 601 The Trust's Nairobi iaboratoriei are led by Dr. W.M. Watkins and are concerned with research on the chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis of malada. These riudicr are carried oui there in vim with culture-adapted mains of P./oieipnriot~r, while in vivo studies aie undertaken in a coastal laboratory at Kilifi where there i( a high local incidence of the disease. Current emphasis is on the comparative activities of dihydrofoiate reduc- tare inhibitors. the pharmacokinetics of biguanide antimalariais and the efficacy of halofanirine. The Unit collaborates closely with Professors AM. Breckenridge and R.E. Hoiveiia (Liverpool). The Unit was visited by Dr. P.O. Williams and Dr. B.M. Ogilvie in March 1988 and by Mr. A.1. Macgregor and Dr. 1.C. Howard in July 1988. Olher Trust-supported Research in Kenya A reiearcb group has been esiabiished in the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), Nairobi, IO work on clinical aspects of AIDS in Kenya. This is a collaborative vcnturc between the Trust and KEMRI bared on a programme proposed by Professors K.P.W.J. McAdam and D.A. Warreil. It will concentrate on delineating disearc patterns of AIDS and its impact on other infectious diseases, in particular tuberculosis. A second collaborative research programme with KEMRI is being inaugu- rated at Kilifi to study the paihogenesis of SCW~ P. /alciparum malaria in children. This work will involve Professor D.A. Warrrll, Dr. K. Marsh and Dr. G. Pasval and will receive laboratory support from lheir Oxford iaboraiories. This malaria programme is railing additional funding from ihe World Health Organisation to enable epidemiological studies to be included.

Gordon, MA, M\u00fc, 1987 # #From Octobcr 1988 VISION RESEARCH The formation of the Trustees' Virion Rerearch Working Pany was noted in the last Biennial Report. The first three yean of this group have MW passed. and there are some Signs that ihey have been able to suppon much worthwhile research both in ophthaimolopu and in the basic Sciences relevant to virion. Professor Fergur Campbell kindly chaired the Working Parly for the kt two years, and played B Crucial role in the formulation of policy in this subject. His place has now been taken by Professor Semir &U OC University Colle&e London. There have been a number of other changes in the membership of the Working Pany. because the TNIW wished Io take a wide raw of advice while developing their suppon for this subject. Research Troininp The Working Party proposed to the Trustees the establiShment of a new scheme of Vision Research Fellowships to be advertised annually. These awards are particularly inlended for medical graduates wishing to pu~susuc an academic career in ophlhaimoiogy or neurc-ophthalmology, and foi optometrists with a higher degree who wish to obtain additional research expedrnce: basic scientists with post-doctoral experience can dm bc considered for these Fellowships. in the fiml year of theSe awards, twenty- five applications were received and seven Fellowships were awarded. There was a dramatic fall in the number of applications for the Fellowships in the second year, but the Trustees will conlinue to provide this form of support in the hope that good applicants will continue to come forward. Reseorrh Supporl The Working Party is attracting large numbers of god project grant applications, and is pleased to report that much of the research MI only has a ciinical component but brings scientific meihods to bear on dinid problems. The Working Party advenised a major award for research in vision rcience, in part to make the Trust's interest in this area better known in the scientific community. Few applications were received. but all of high quality. In the event, the Working Pany was able to make two awards. One was to Dr. John Stein and his colleagues in Oxford, who are siudying the role of the cerebellum and posterior parielal conex in the 145 of Biorhemisiiy umlvertlly of Soulhsmplon. for three years, for a study of the hiochcmirlry if the signai-rranrmir\u00eeian ani termination years far an analysis of one for an invesligalim of cikirni colour vision testing with a three years for a study of the moi~cuiar biology of a years, riudy of identification of candidale icner for retinifis a study or fine matrix perimc~iy.

The Trustees are greatly indebted to their Clinical Research Panel both for advice OD specific applications and for help in formulating their policy for support of the clinical rewar\u00e7h community. The pressurer on clinical research workers are often greater than thore on their colleagues in basic biomedical science. As well as research of the highest quality, together with dulies in teaching and administration. uic clinical researcher must usually devote a substantial p8n of his or her time to the care of patients. Much clinical research haj rulfered through being conducted in groups of inadequate size. In these circumstances. Increasing clinical demands inevitably impair the research effort. The Trusten have seen much evidence of the harm donc to clinical research by the dwindling numbers of staff in academic clinical departments. The Trustees and the Clinical Panel have therefore endeavoured to devote pan of their suppm to building up groups of reasonable sire. where individual researchers are protected from clinical over-commitment by the numbers of their colleagues available 10 take the ciinieai load, and where a critical mass of clinical and basic scientists working alongside each other are able to make reai contributions to knowledge. At a lime when the Trustees are endeavouring to provide more support for clinical research, it is particularly troublesome that new constraints on medical manpower in the ro\u00eeaiied training grades have placed additional difficulties in the way of the young daclor wishing to develop a research career. The unthinking equation of a clinical research worker with his or her full-time coiieague who has ne commitments outside the wards and outpatient dinicr is doing neat harm to the progress of research. Rerwrch Supporl Ar well a6 the more substantial elforts referred to above. the Panel mgnise the continuing need for small-scale project grants. often supporting work of great originality. Of the larger enterprises, the Trustees would pmicu- lariy note a substantial grant to Professor A.W. %gal of the Depmment of Medicine at University College, London.

Augus1 September 1988 ##From October 1988 170 I BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY The basic biomedical Sciences have been sl\u00efongly supported during the years 1986-87 and 1987.88 because the Trustees have been able IO meet the increasing demand for research grants. Project grant support for fint- cim proposais has been provided through the od hoc budgets administered by the Trustees' advisory panels. which were eilabiirhed in 1985. The capacity of the Trustees Io rupporl University research through their syslem of advisory panels was greatly enhanced as a result of the increased income available to the Trust. The three years since the inception of the panel system has, however. borne wiines~ to P serious erosion in central government support of basic Science through rhe dual-support syiiem. The Trust has consequently received a considerable number of scientifically merit-worthy proposals which the research councils have had to turn down for want of funds: proposais which have then been considered in common competition with de nova submissions to the Tml. The Trusirer consider that the role of the charities is to complement, rather than Io supplement the research support provided by government agender, and they arc determined to ensure that ihe Tniri is not perceived as a private substitute for those agencies. The trend during the past decade towards a heavy reliance upon short- term funding is considered by the Trustee to be very damaging: they will therefore piace a greater emphasis in future upon longer-term support and larger groups of research workerr. At the June 1988 policy meeting the Trustees endorsed the decision to dedicate up to one-third of their funds to long-term research. Eight long- term awards were made during the review period (see page 176). in October 1986, the Biochemistry and Cell Bioiagy Panel entered the Trust year 1986.R7 with an allocation for nd hoc project support of U.7 million, some fi.2 million more than the original allocalion for the year 1985.86, The funds committed at the October meeting totalled about f1.2 million: of 44 requests, total value fZ.65 million, 29 awards were made, 15 being met in full. The remaining three meetings of the year handled 30.39 and 35 applications respectively, with about half the proposals receiving an award on each occasion. 171 Zll (Edinburgh, f200,OWl. Professor C. Wylie (Cambridge. f969,681), Pro- fessor f535,351). Moleei~lor Eiology Applied Io Clinical Medicine In response to the autumn 1986 advertisement of the competition for a major award in this field, 122 preliminary proposals were received. Four groups (in London, Cambridge and Aberdeen1 were invited to submit formal applications, and Professor R. Williamson of Si. Mary's Hospital Medical School was awarded f450,000 for his proposal to study the genetics of dyrmorphologier. The Trustccs no longer believe that it is necessary to have a special scheme for support in this area. 174 FIRST WELLCOME SUMMER SCHOOL The Trustees accepted a p~oposal put fomard by Dr. Michael Morgan, an Assistant Director on the TNIt staff, to establish a series of intensive. laboratory-based CUU~S~E in advanced techniques to facilitate the dissemi- nation of modern methods from the basic sciences inte the clinical sciences. The firit of these COUTS~S: DNA Related Methods in Human Genetics. was held in September 1988. The school was organised by Dr. P. Fait of the Wellcame Laboratory for Molecular Genetics. Division of Blochemisttry, UMDS, and direeteed by Dr. K.E. DavieS. Nufield Department of Clinical Medicine, Oxford. and Dr. Anna Maria Frischauf, Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories, London. The COUTSO lasted one week, and was held in the Immunology Laboratories In the Dental School an the Guy's Hospital Campus. Some lwelve riudenrr from Europe and the UK attended, five of whom were clinically qualified from a variety of disciplines. The intensive laboratory sessions were augmented by tutods given by both the instructors and students, and by evening seminars given by B distinguished group of visilors: Professor E.M. Southern, Oxford; Professor M. Dlsen. SI. Louis; Professor AIE Jeffreys, Leicester: Dr. Paul Travers. London: Dr. Nick Hasfie. Edinburgh. and Dr. Jane Gilschiec, San Francisco. The principal methods taught on the coarse Were the use of Pulse field gel electrophoresis and the polymerase chain reaction. These techniques are revolutionising the way in which it is pnsible 10 analyse, in fine detail, the human gemme and individual genetic loci. The course was judged to be a considerable succeis, and il is aimed to offer it again in 1989 along with a new coume on Molecular ParasitOlOgY.

PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY PANEL # ProreSLsror Sir William Paton, CBE, DM, FRCP, (Chairman) (Wellcome Trustee) *'From October 1988 #Uniil Sepiemk 1987 # #Uniil September 1988 1 94 PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY PANEL Physiology and pharmacology continue to receive a substantial proponion of Trust funds bnt an increase in the number and size of applications has meant that there has been 8 reduction in the proportion of project grants that could be funded. Nevertheless, in the two years 1986-88 a total of f8.57m was awarded. In the Same period, foilowing their dension to spend about one third of their income on longer-term grams, the Trustees have accepted rsommen- dations from the Physiology and Pharmacology Panel for grants totalling f2m. These range from studies of the properties of ion channels in the membrane of single liver celis (Professor D. Jenkinwin) via studies on the receptors in the nervous system (Professors Kelly. Maedemot and Nahorski) through fundamental and applied prahiemr of the microcircula- lion (Professors Michel and Williams) to the ekts of high haromelfie pressu~e on nervous system funciion (Dr. Smith). Some of the programmes address fundamental problems, others are more practicaliy orientated. but what they have in common is an important question lhat needs answers, and Icientiiti with the ability Io provide those answers. If is ais0 worth drawing attention to the fact that five Univerrity Awards have been made dsring the period. These awards enable universities to make appointments in advance of vacancies becoming available and UP to 5 years' suppan is provided, after which the university is pledged to take over the funding. In this way security for talented researchers can he provided rather than the unceriainty of repeated projen grant SUppoTt. The rerearch programmes here have been even more varied than the ion* term awards and include studies on respiration in Conlcious man (or. Gardner), the mie of small electric Beidr in nerve growth and regeneration (Dr. McCaig) and fundamenlai studies on the physics and chemistry of the interstitial matrix (Dr. Winlove). Reorganisations within univerSilies and changing patterns of research activity have led to an increase in interdisciplinary research classicai whole animal experimentation is being displaced (IO some extent) by the use Of techniques involving cell and molecular biology. Advancer in this area have an exciting range of new questions to he asked in both in and in vim systems. Currently, for example. a number of muPr are probing receptor properties by introducing into amphibian eggs the for their normal production in the mammal. The gene transfer leads to of large amounts of the rffeptor whose 195 properties cm then be explored by classical techniques under normal or pathophysiological circumstances. Toxicology has been identified by the Trustees 8s an area they wish to develop and in 1987 a new scheme of advanced training fellowships in toxicology was instituted. One aim of these fellowships is 10 altm men and women whore previous experience has not been in toxicology but who now wish to develop a career in the subject. The Trustees have been pleased with the response 80 far. in 1987 one Fellowship was awarded and in 1988 ihere vers three, one 10 a biochemist, one to a molecnlar biologist and one to a ceil biologist whose original training was in veterinary medicine. An increasing number of good quality applications for grant support in toxicology has been noted over the pas1 two years and the Trustees have recognised this by increasing the toxicoiogy budget for 1988-89.

EUROPEAN PROGRAMMB B. OTHER OVERSEAS AWARDS A. EUROPEAN PROGRAMME SUPPORT FOR NON-TROPICAL RESEARCH OVERSEAS EUROPEAN PROGRAMME The Trustees. amre of the importance of international exchanges to scientilic research and of the need for greater collaboration amongst European Scientists, have continued Io provide funds 10 support an active European exchange programme. At the time of the previous biennial report, it was already clear that the level of demand was outstripping the funds available. Fonunateiy. the Trustees were willing and able to agree to increase the provision of funds far the European programme. In the period of this report f1,2M1,W was awarded, mainly as fellowships. This was an increase over the previous two years of 30% and reflects an increase of alman 100% in the budget since 1984. The distribuiion of awards by countries for the periods September 1984 Io August 1986 and September 1986 to August 1988 is shown on page 238. A number of noteworthy trends can be discerned. There is a marked increase in the number of awards to scientists in Czechoslovakia. This presumably reflects the incremed interest following the implementation of an agreement between the TNS~ and the lnrrilute for Further Education of Doctors and Pharmacists, Prague (see below). There is a significant increase in the number of applications from Finland this probably reneets the increased contact between the Trust and the Sigri'd Juselius Foundation in Helsinki. A mast encouraging development is the increase in the number of awards that have been made to British scientists to go abroad: although the numbers themselves are small, they represent an increase of some 140% over the previous period. The opportunities to obtain travelling fellowships have been more widely publicised and efforts are continuing to ensure that the exchange programme attracts well qualified applicants. The Trustees are particularly anxious to encourage collaboration between laboratories in the United Kingdom and on the Continent. Tiiey provide grants to assist European laboratories to pool resources and to establish closer links by the exchange ofscieniists. In the period of this report some IS awards were made, compared with only 6 in the previous period. The ProYision of relatively small Sums of money through this reheme ir an extremely eflective means of promoting European collaboration, and the Trustees are always ready to examine new C~SCS for such support. The countries involved in these collaborations as partners with UK labs include the following: Belgium (I). Czechoslovakia Il), East Germany (2) France (21, Israel (I), Italy (I), Netherlands II). Norway O). Poland (2). &mania (I). West Germany Il) and Yugoslavia (I). 222 SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS The special links estabiished by the Tmstee~ with a number of organisations throughout Europe continue to nourish and receive active support. In the preceding report reference was made to the declining inlmst shown for visits between Scandinavian countries and the United Kingdom. and the inteniiontotrytorcetifytherituatian. Thisled toameelinginCopenhagen in January 1987 al which representatives of the Trust. the Swedish Medical Research Council, the Riksbanken Jubileumsfond (Sweden), the Anderrs Jahre Fond (Oslo, Norway), and the Sigrid Juselius Foundation (Helsinki. Finland) met with representatives of the host organisation. the Carlsberg Foundation. Copenhagen. The meeting was arranged through the Weilcome Trust in order to discuss matters of mutual interest and in particular whether there were ways to increase the level of interest in the various exchange schemes which the organisation5 offer. Each OrganiSalion outlined the scope of its activities. in relation both to its awn domestic programmes and its international programme. All panies were agreed on the benefits that would ame from an increased activity in the exchange of scientis\u00fc betwen European laboratories. Such exchanges are necessary Cor the health of European science, panicuiariy in regard to the pereeived attraction^ of aflen From the USA and Japan. It was agreed that the iesourw available in Europe were generally adequate. but were perhaps Spread too thinly: woperation between centres was a sensible way fanvard since individual governments. let alone individual organisations, were unable to provide funds to match thore available in the United States or Japan. Li was not possible to identify particular cetsons underlying the low uptake of fellowvshipr within Europe, nor appropdate remedies other than the suggestion that greater publicity would help. There was general recognition that many senior scienti5tr had during their early career established links with American laboratories in particular (partly due to the inadequate facilities available in Eucope~n centres in the immediate Fm-war yean), leading to a tendency for senior scientists to advise their younger colleague^ to take fellowships in the USA raiher than in Europe, where thw had perhaps fewer personal ~onlact~, It was agreed that if publicity and other devices increased the demand for fellowships then thevarious organisations would be ready 10 respond by increasing the number of fellowships available. 223 The meeting thus provided an opportunity to 'tune' prwcnl arrangements. and it also provided the first opportunity for the Scandinavian organisations to meet together. Funher meetings are planned in an attempt to increase the number of exchanges between Britain and Scandinavia. Dr. Morgan undertook to make some individual visits on behalf of the Trust and the first of these was to the Sigcid luseliur Foundation in luis 1988. Mr. Widen, the Managing Director of the Foundation. Professai Albert de la Chapelle, thc Former Secretary of the Advisory Medical Committee, and Ur. Morgan had wide-ranging discussions about the agreement between the two organiSationS and how it might operate more cffectivcly. it is hoped that as a result of there discussions there will be greatly enhanced oppoilunilies for visiting fellowships and collaborative programmer between scientists working in British and Finnish laboratories. it is evident that the quality of science in the Finnish universities is of B high international standard. and since the English language is spoken everywhere, British scientists should have no qualms about seizing oppor- tunities 10 work with colleagues in Finland. It is aim necessary to demonstrate to Finnish scientisls that opportunities still exist to work in well equipped laboratories in Brilain. and that there is na need to go to the USA. Folloiving the visit of Dr. Morgan and Ur. Ogilvie to ihe Czechoslovakian Socialist Republic, an agreement war finally approved by the Trust and the Czech authorities establishing a framework for scientific exchanges between the two couniries. The agreement seems to have stimulatcd the interest of Czechoslovakian scientists to come to Britain, and although the scheme has had a few teething problems, it is hoped that these will have been overcome by the time of the next biennial repart. The long-standing afiieement between the Trust and the international Cultural lnstitutc in Budapert, which niables exchange visits between British and Hungarian scientists. was renewed for a funher three years. SUMMARY Although this programme requires only inadcst funds to Sustain it, it is regarded a1 a very important contribution that the Trust makes Io facilitate the growth of European science. The Trustees also provide funds for the ruppan of symposia in Europe and for travel grants. 224 EUROPEAN PROGRAMME Lis1 of Gmnls Awsrded Bwseis, Belgium.

A solution has not yet been found, but it has been agreed that il would he useful for 8 reprerentalive of the Trust to visil the New Zealand unirerrities to elicit iheir views on Ihe type of support which would be helpful. To this end Dr. P.O. Williams visited New Zealand during 1989.

This has been an exlremcly successful scheme, but il il regrettable that there is no reciprocity of exchanger between British scientists and Japanese. It is hoped 10 remedy this situation in the near future. The overseas \u00efcllow\u00eehip programme is a very modest operution, although the level of itlierest is se\u00eedy in total numbers: however, individual countries show great variation in the level of interest. The increase in interest from scienti~ls in China was noted in the last report, and there is a growing tendency for the Trust to receive enquiries from China. Many of there are from ineligible candidates, particularly those wishing to study for higher degrees, but there hus been a modest increase in the number of awards made.

It is sad to record the death, on 15th Augui1 1988. of Dr. Renate Burgess, a former senior membcr of the itai\u00ef of the iconographic Department of ihc Library. She is remembered with alfeetion for her human qualities and with respect far her work which culminated in her monumental Porlrails of docion and saenlisls (19731. In 1988 the Trustees reshaped the committee structure which administers their history of medicine intcrcsts. Library matters are now dealt with by a Panel who~e members include senior and distinguished people from Cambridge University Library, the Warburg Institute and the British Library of Political and Economic Science. The Library Pand reports to a History Committee (analogous to the kientiiic Trustee5 Committee) which includes two Trustees and is respon\u00eeibie far general and academic policy. Mr. E.]. Freeman has been given overall responsibility for the TNriees' activities in the iieid of hirtary of medicine, and acts as secretary to the History of Medicine Committee Library and the Panel. The Library Problems of automation continued to absorb time and energy. The OCLC Caiulogning Project. reported in tlie Sixteenth Report, ended in December 1987. Since the beginning of 1986, however, much thought had been given to the future urc of thc database created with the help of OCLC. Investigations narrowed down the possibilities to the choice of a stand- alone, turnkey library system, marketed by McDonneil Douglas under the name URICA. This choice $vas endorsed by two external ~QS~SSO~S from the University of London. Contracls Were signed in August 1988, and delivery, training and implementation are expected to take up much of 1989. The System will evrniuaily greatly enhance publie access 10 the database. Provide aulamaicd library routines. facilitate analysis of the contents of the database, and provide a series of management reports and statistics 254 More conwntionai library activities in acquisition and prwssing con- tinued. Major purchaser proved difficuit in a fiercely competitive \u00fceld. but the Library was successful in acquiring the Corhyn Papers with a special grant of f10,193.W from the Trustees. This archive consists of the detailed business papers of an 18th century apothecary, and has already attra~ted research attention. Public exhibitions over the past two years have included No roughing Mutter: hislorical aspects of onnesthesia: A Mirror and Hygieia's Hondmaids: Women, hwlih ond healing. The Library. in close association with the Academic Unit, continuer to attract steadily increasing numbers of users. Since 1986 the daily average of readers recording requests for help has risen from 32 to 41. The Academic Unit The Institute's Academic Unit his continued its wide range of activities. The Unit offers, through the University of London, a large number of courses in the history of medicine for medical. science and ans students. A paper on thc History of Islamic Medicine has been added for history undergraduates. The whale-year history of medicine programme for third year (intercaiatcd) medical students has remained popular. Thirty students, the majority OC them with studentships from the Wellcane Tma, have completed the EOUTSI. Six of them achieved first-class homurs dgrwr. The total undergraduate enrolment for courses offered by staff in the Unit has been more than 225 per annum. From October 1988, MSc teaching will beoffered through thcnewlyatabiished LondonCentrefortheHisl(on of Science, Medicine and Technology. a collaborative effort tuween the institute's Academic Unit, the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at University College. and the History of Science and Technology group at Imperial College. The Centre was established in 1987. to U>- ordinate the impressive resourcei - human and material - in these d\u00ffei- piines in London. Nineteen MPhil, PhD. and MD candidata have been supervised by staff, and two PhD and one MPhii degrees have hm awarded. The academic community within the institute is also leavened by the presence, each year. of ahout ten port-doctoral Fellows and visiting academics on sabbatical leave. 257 Members or the slat have also been active in research and publication; they have written or edited fifteen books and published about iW articles. There are now six volumes in the Wellcome Institute Series in the History of Medicine, published by Routledge, and other monagraplis are in the final stager of preparation. The institute's broad programme of symposia. research seminars, dir- cussion groups and publie le~l~ra has maintained. Nine one-day, two two.day and one three-day symposia have been held on a variety of topics ranging from the World of Ibn Tufayl to modern topics such as the Hl~tory of Pathology. Medical Charities and Medical Research, and the History of the Pharmaceutical Industry. The latter two Symposia were organised in conjunction with the WellcomC Trust's 50th Anniversary activities. In four instances, the papers given at the Symposia have been collected for publication a$ a volume of essays. The fortnightly research seminar has also continued. The theme in 1986-87 war the History of Hospitals, while that of the following session was Disearer in History. The fortnigliiiy rcminar series on Arahic Medicinc, Science and Technology has its own specialist audience. AS part of a new informal exchange programme between the Wellcome Institute and the InEtitUte of the History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University, Pro\u00eeessrsor Gert Brieger went a month al the Wellcome Institute in 1986: Dr. Vivian Nuttan went to the Institute in Baltimore in 1987.

Awards under this head took a varietyofforms, reflecting thediversity ofthermrt'seoncerns as Weil as the di\\\"ersity of the field itself: Researeh Scholarships (far Postgraduate training), Research Fellowships (in the main for postdoctoral work), SUpport for research projects, travel grants, mntnbutions to research expenses and - a ncw departure for the Trust in the hirioncal field -Research Leave Feliawihips. Nurturing and strensthening the subject as an academic discipline, both in the UK and internationally, has continued to be the Tmsteer' mirai aim, to which the grants programme contributes more especially through the periods of support it provides for those specialising in the history of medicine in preparing for a teaching and research career. Many (though by no means ail) of the Scholarships and Fellowships awarded for this purpose are held in the Welicome Units for the History of Medicine, and the research resulting substantially reinforces the work that is accomplished through the support of the Units directly. Although the number of posts around the world in the history of medicine specificaily are still extremely few in number, an encouraging proparlion of those who have opted to train in the subject are continuing to find their way into appointments at least in cognate fields; despite the severe narrowing in academic career opportunities generally, moreover, an encouraging number of applifants for training support are continuing to come forward. All the same, whiic seeking to eniure that the subject does not cease to gain recruilsi it would be idle to pay no regard 10 the p~ospe~fs far academic employment, and Scholarships are therefore being made available rather more sparingly than previously. At the same time, with a view to attracting candidates Of the highest quality, the step has been taken of advertising these awards internationally and making them the subjxt of an annual competition. On this new basis, two Scholarships were awarded in 1988. As thc discipline gradually expands, the TNSI has begun to reap its reward in the shape of an increasing flaw of grant-worthy research prolmak. Nolably more of ihese than before are for the 5upport of projects involving the employment of a research assistant. Mort historical research is not conducted on that pattern and this new trend reflects On the one hand the more extensive funds now available to the Trust for the supporl of the subject and an the other the wider range of scholars. in panicular demographers and geographers. whose needs can now be catered for in 263 WELLCOME UNITS FOR THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE university Collage London (set up 1966) Director: Dr. W.F. Bynum This Unit is vinually amalgamated with the Academic Division of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine. Its presence as a sub- depanment of the Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology is, however, very important as an interface to undergraduates. It is responsible with the Institute for a number of courses. Unirenits of Ox\u00eford (set up 1971) Director: Dr. C. Webster During the two years, Unit members have continued their high level of publication and teaching. Fifteen historical dissertations were completed by pre-clinical medical students and three postgraduate doctoral and one MLitt dissertations were successful. Publications include Dr. 1. Aurtakei's A Hislow of /Ire Iinperiui Cancer Research Fund, 1902 la 1986, Dr. T. Paltcrsan'i translation of Zeis' Monunl of Plosrie Surgery, Dr. BririM 1957, An lnlroducfion Io ike Sociol Hislory of Nursing by Dr. R. Dingwali. Mirs A.M. RaLrty and Dr. Webster, and the volume edited by Dr. Aurtoker and Dr. L. Bryder on The Role of a study of the ceil biologist Oscar Herlwig will be published early in 1989. Major research areas include the history of the biomedical sciences, early modern medical science and practice in England (under the Deputy Director, Dr. Margaret Peiiing) and Islamic societies, and the history of public health services and the National Health Service. On his election to a Senior Research Fellowship at Ail Souls College, DI. Charles Webster's term as Iirst Director of the Unit finally came to an end after 17 Years in September 1988. He will, however, be continuing with it as an Honorary Associate. Dr. P.J. Weindling has been appointed interim Director. 266 Universily of Cambridge (set up 1970) Director: Dr. R.K. French Since the last report the main line of the Unit's development has been as a centre of medieval and renaissance studies. Fellowrhipr awarded to Dr. C. O'Boyle and Dr. G.A. White for research into medieval surgery and medical disputation have strengthened the research ride of the Unit's aeliYities in this field. Coilaboration With the Conseja Superior de Inveniga- ciones Cientificar in Barcelona has resulted in the planning of a senes of joint conferences, the first - on medieval medicine in the Latin Mediterranean - 10 be held in Barcelona in April 1989. The UN1 has grown somewhat in sire in the two years. Dr. A.R. Cunningham is Wellcome Lecturer in the History of Medicine and the third teaching post is held by Dr. J.P. Williams. Postdoetoral Fellowships have been held by Dr. A. Wilson (ChiidhiRh in early modern England). Dr. L.A. Pollock (home medical treatment in the 16th and 17th centuaes) and Dr. J.S. Henderson (plague in renaissance Fiorence). Wellcome Research Scholarships have been heid by C. O'Boyle (lhe eStablishmm1 of medical facilities in medieval French universities). R.L. Kilpatrick (the clinical revolution in hospital medicine in early 19th Century London) and R.J.J. Martin (Francis Bacon's natural philosophy). The Unit's series of conferences continues. That on 17th rrnlury mediane will appear in early 1989 as a book by Cambridge University Press as a companion volume to that on 16th century medicine, in an informal series. conferences an laboratory medicine. medicine in the enlightenment and medicine in the age of reform were also organised. The Unit's extensive teaching at the undergraduate level continues, hut plans have been mede to reduce the burden on the teaching offieen in tk coming year. At the research level the MPhil Continues 10 attracI capable scholars, largely from oversess. There are aim students working for the MLitt and PhD degrees. University of Manehesler (set up 1986) Director: Dr. J.V. Pickstone This Unit operates as pan of the Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine and in association with teaching and research stall in science and technology policy. Its brief is to serve the North ai England by rerearching and teaching in history of medicine, concentrating on the recent history of medical science and technology and on the social history of medicine in industrial society. In its first two years the Unit has made rapid progress. It now comprises two UGC-funded stafl, four core posts supparted by the Trust, one Wellcome Research Fellow and a substantial group of postgraduate students, associates and visitors. It provider courses for the Medical School. the biological science departments, the History Department. the Health Care Ethics Programme and the degree in Science and Technology Policy. Unit stall are also active in the various national and international aswiatims for history of medicine and history of science. In July 1988 the Unit helped host a major Angla-American conference on history of science, technology and medicine, which brought 300 scholars to Manchester. It gratefully acknowledges the support it received from the Trust far this Current mearch topics include: - Hospitals and asylums in North West England -Women, medicine and the city -Social history of orthopaedics - Physiology and clinical medicine - Embryology in nineteenth century Germany - Medirol, industrial and agricu1t\"raI bacteriology - Genetier in twentieth century Germany - Genetics and the seed industry (ESRC funded). Manchester University Press are now to launch a series of books. edited from the Unit, which will ConCentrate on the retent history of medicine in relation to the recent histary of science and technology. 268 University of Glesgow (set up 1985) Director: Dr. D.N.H. Hamilton During its first two years. the staflof this Unit has comprised Dr. D.N.H. Hamilton (Director). Dr. Marguerite Dupree and Dr. S. Jacyna (Research Fellows) and MIS. Ann Mulholland (Secretmy). Dr. K. Collins war subsequently appointed as a Research Associate. Ils research has centred uwn the history of surgery, the interrelations of iaboratory and clinical medicine in the nineteenth and iwenticth centuries. and the history of the vol~ntary hospitals in Scotland. It also mm a fortnightly series of seminars. Unit stall have taught in the history departments of the University. and in parricular Dr. Dupree has estabiirhed close links with the History Computing Laboratory established under the join1 auspices of the Depart- ments of Modern History and Economic History and the University Archives. A formal place for the teaching of the history of medicine in the medical curdculum shouid be established within the next twelve months. A role for the Unit in the teaching of the new portgraduate COUM in Law and Medical Ethics is also anticipated. In addition. a numbcr of postgraduate students have been jointly supervised by Dr. Hamilton and the staff of the Department of Economic History and the Dental School. Early in 1988 the TmS1 learned with regret that Dr. Hamilton wished to relinquish the Directorship in order to resume his Sumical career. It is gratefnl to him for successfully steering the Unit through ils inaugvral period. Dr. S. Jacyna has been appointed interim Director. 269 HISTORY OF MEDICINE Lis1 of Grants Awarded LiBRARIES DI.

E.H.O. Parry, OBE, MD. Bettinsan, Resoums Peler aclivities have grown substanlially during the last 2 years. but there have also ben considerable changes which have becomeinevitable on account of the plans to move the Tmsi to the Wellcome Building and preparations for this. 279 WELLCOME TROPICAL INSTITUTE MUSEUM The exhibition of tropical diseases has had a turbulent two Years. In the first place it had to be dismantled fiom the Wellcome Building and IR erected in Bentley House and then when that building had to be emptied for refurbishment il had to return 10 operate in curtailed space. It has, however, continued to attract many students as a source of learning about tropical diseases. A special exhibition. 'Malaria', was opened in March 1987: this included history, epidemiology, molecular biology and an introduction 10 the disease for the inieresled, non-specialist student. It proved very popular and is to be published as a monograph in 1989 by the Oxford University Press. A learning resources centre WBI established in ihe former Trust Labora- tories in Nairobi and was furnished with new panels and handbooks made at the Insiiiute. This war opened by the Vice Minister of Health of Kenya in FebNarY 1987 and has been used by a wide range of students. New teaching Panels on maiaria, leprosy and hepatitis B were also provided for Makerere University, Kampala. through the kindness of the British Council. The plans for the re.development of the buildings in Euston Road mean that the tropical exhibition will not, in future. be exhibited in its present form. Its very valuable collection Of pictorial material is now being organised so that it can be used for teaching and reference purposes, possibly using up-to-date audio-visual technology. The microscopie slide collections and pathological specimens are being placed an permanent loan in various appropriate institutions, nie historical library and archive colleciions of tropical medicine have b+en built UP during the pst two years and will be incorporated into the WlHM library in due course. A speciai activity has been the Royal Amy Medical Corps archives with a view to arranging far their most suitable future storage and use. The chanse of a long established institution to a new format to meet Present day needs inevitably causes anxiety and distress. In the couse of these devefapments SfaR whose careers had been geared to creating and running teaching exhibitions in porter form inevitably kame inappropri. ate and had to leave. 280 The Trustees regret having to muse this trauma in their lives and how that they will find satisfactory new positions. They also hope that the new arrangements wiii fulfil the needa of those who used the Museum in the past. Disiance Learning The distance learnlng programme has grown rapidly and ir now beginning to achieve its aim - to provide continuing education for the rural or district medical officer, with guidance for the problems he or she meets. intellectual support and stimulus, and the challenge of a field research project in a major issue a\u00ef health and disease. After negotiations with the Ministry of Health, University or Medical Association, pilot projects were started in Kenya and Ghana in October 1987. and were completed in 1988. A limited pilot project for medical assistants was undertaken in 1987-88 in collaboration with their training school, and the ODA team, at Mbeya, Tanrania. Workshops were heid in thesc three countries and ah in Zimbabwe, which will uart its own programme in 1989, when Ethiopia also, will probably Start is Own programme. All programmes and iearnillg are carefully evaluated the results will be used to pian national programmer later. Fellows from Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia and Ghana. specially chosen by their Ministry because they muid lead nationai programmes. worked at the Institute to prepare themselves for running theu programmes. Every student in a programme will da a field research project reiatd to his or her area of study or interest. It is expected that there studies will provide interesting and new data, and alva bring the talents of many previously unused doctors into active medical research. The materials (modules) used by students have been prepared and assembled in the Institute and are in subjects identified as major problems: topic moduler, finished or in preparation, are acute respiratory infection, burns, abitrucied labour, sexually transmitted disease%, the redeye, sur#cal emergencies, malaria, anaemia and nutrition. Care moduler, which will be used more for reference. are epidemiology and management. The In~titute has many enquiries from other countries about its work in continuing education, through distance learning, and has contnbuted to 281 plans for a Caribbean programme in partnership with the University of ihc Wesi indics and McGill University. A Workshop for nationai leaderr of distance learning programmes was held in May 1987. Four papers were presented by staff on their work in Africa at one session of the World Tropical Medicine and Malaria Conference in Arnrlerdarn in September 1988. A most successful Workshop was arranged by the inititute on Malnutrition Related Diabetes Meilitur in lune/luly 1988, jointly sponsored by the Wellcome Trust and WHO. in addiiion to these activities, the staff of the institute are also involved in e\u00fcarir to develop the science and practice of medicine in the tropics in collaboration with other national and international institutions and agencies.

In 1978, following a gap of twelve years and discussions with the Royal Anthropalogical Inslitnte, the Tnist~ agreed to revive the award as a biennial medal ta be known as The Wellcome Medal for Research in AnthropoIo8y as Applied to Medical Problem. Medal winners also receive a prize of fZ\u00fc\u00fc. The Royal Anthropoiogical Institute announced that it had decided not to recommend the award for 1988. 289 The Biochemical Soclety The Wellcome Trust Award for Research in Biochemistry Related to Medicine WBE instituted in 1977 and the first biennial award was made in 1978. This award, which is for f5OO and a medal, is intended to recognise distinguished research in the field of biochemistry which leads to new advances in medical Science by biochemists under the age of 45 years. Such work must normally have been published in the United Kingdom or Ireland during the seven years preceding the date of nominaiion. The award far 1987 was made to: Professor A.W.
