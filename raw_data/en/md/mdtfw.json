Please call your physician's office or your health or insurance plan to verify coverage information prior to scheduling your visit or procedure. Not all members participating in contracted networks have \"in network\" access. In network participation may change from time to time without prior notice. Independent providers (which could include, for example only, anesthesiologists, radiologists, pathologists, emergency medicine physicians, advance practice professionals, and other independent providers of health care services) may deliver part of your care, and such providers may be considered out-of-network on your health and insurance plans even if the Facility may be considered in network. If you desire additional information as to the providers who may be involved in providing your care, you can either ask your treating provider (who may know some of the specialists or groups who could be involved) or you can request a list of Facility-based physician groups by calling the following toll free number: (877) 810-0372. This list is updated annually and is subject to change without prior notice. Baylor Scott & White Health does not manage the insurances accepted for this doctor. Please contact the office directly to confirm coverage. "}
