However, a deep dive into the ingredients found in common household cleaning products reveals a dirty truth. Products used every day in homes often contain toxins with health concerns that range from skin irritation, developmental/endocrine/reproductive effects, cancer, and damage to DNA, according to the [Environmental Working Group](https://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/). Yikes. Luckily, you can greatly reduce your family's exposure to toxic chemicals and fumes with effective products that are made with naturally-sourced ingredients that are better for you and for the planet. Check out these botanically-scented, gentle, and safe products, many of which received a grade of \"A\" from the EWG's ranking of cleaning products. All-Purpose Cleaners Advertisement Article continues below this ad Before using a disinfecting product, you should know that the dirtier the surface is, the less effective the disinfectant is. Clean and deodorize surfaces with Clean Republic's All-Purpose Cleaner. The brand's products are made by applying a low electric charge to a combination of salt and water which creates hypochlorous acid, a replica of the chemical compound naturally produced by the human immune response. These unscented products are all-natural, do not contain any carcinogens or harmful synthetic chemicals, and are safe to use around kids, pets, and plants. Dr. Bronner's Sal's Suds is a concentrated biodegradable household (not body) cleanser that uses plant-based surfactants to cut grease and grime. Dilute the fir and spruce-scented liquid to mop floors and clean hard surfaces. Oven cleaners and degreasing products are some of the most toxic and potentially harmful to your health so why expose your food to them? Make the switch to ECOS Non-Toxic Orange All-Purpose Cleaner, the powerful plant-based formula is free of ammonia, phosphates, chlorine, glycol, petroleum and instead relies on the superpowers of pure orange oil to cut grease and grime.

Cleaning agents derived from soap bark, corn, and coconut get the job done without the inclusion of ingredients like sodium lauryl, laureth sulfates, petroleum solvent, parabens, ethers, alcohol, or ethoxylated. Wipe up household messes in the kitchen and bathroom with these non-toxic, biodegradable wipes that are safe enough to use on high chair trays. The wipes use the multitasking power of vinegar to cut through any mess while leaving a fresh, never-chemical scent. Disinfectants CleanWell's active disinfecting ingredient is thymol, a component of botanical thyme oil that was approved earlier this year by the EPA as an effective disinfectant against SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It also disinfects bacteria and viruses including MRSA, Salmonella, H1N1, Influenza A, Staph, E-Coli, Norovirus, Rhinovirus, and more. And, the scent of thyme is actually really pleasant. CleanWell's thymol-based disinfectant cleaner in convenient wipe form.

No chlorine bleach, harsh abrasives, phosphates, fumes, or harsh chemicals means you can safely clean hard, non-porous surfaces around your home. (Hydrogen peroxide can etch marble and granite, shouldn't be mixed with vinegar, and can bleach fabrics, so use your best judgment!) Kitchen Puracy smells great, the packaging is minimalist, and it's a super-effective dish soap that's free of all the yucky stuff like sulfates (SLS, SLES, SCS), triclosan, parabens, petrochemicals, animal by-products, perfumes, or caustic ingredients. And the naturally-derived formula is hypoallergenic, biodegradable, made in the US, and not tested on animals. ATTITUDE's dish soap is safe and gentle while \"designed to effectively remove milk residue, grease, and odors on baby bottles and other accessories.\" This hypoallergenic soap is also free of fragrance and SLS.

The starter kit includes a gorgeous-to-behold baby blue steel tin that you purchase refills for, which aren't individually wrapped, thus cutting back on waste. The tablets are made without any triclosan, parabens, phosphates, ammonia, VOCs, petroleum, phthalates, artificial dyes or fragrances because...why do your dishes need to be scented? Bathroom The high toxicity found in commonly used blue toilet cleaners is shocking and unnecessary when you have safe and effective options like Better Life Toilet Cleaner. This tea tree and peppermint scented busts build-up, rings, and odor with naturally-derived active ingredients. Laundry Some of the most popular laundry detergent brands use ingredients known to have harmful effects on skin, the respiratory system, and more. Get peace of mind by switching to a gentle detergent you know is safe for the delicate skin of babies as well as those with allergies and skin sensitivities. Biokleen is eco-friendly, non-toxic, plant-based with no artificial fragrance, colors, or preservatives. It is also 100% free of metasilicates, borax, and caustic. You already know what's coming...fabric softener sheets are awful.

Do Nemo and yourself a favor and swap out sheets for wool balls. They help loads dry faster while removing static and wrinkles without irritating artificial fragrances.

Don't worry, the vinegar smell evaporates leaving only a light eucalyptus scent that will remove dirt, grease, and grime from hardwood, tile, concrete, linoleum, bamboo, vinyl, laminate, and more. If you own a carpet cleaning machine and used the \"big name\" liquid carpet cleaner, your home likely smelled like a chemical spring breeze for weeks. Aside from the strong artificial fragrance, your family and pets were exposed to toxic chemicals. Biokleen's Natural Carpet Cleaner doesn't rely on sketchy chemicals to get stains and odors out of carpets. The plant-based formula is non-toxic, biodegradable, and leaves only a subtle, citrus oil scent. Fun fact: Begley's line of natural cleaning products was founded by actor Ed Begley, Jr. (Better Call Saul, A Mighty Wind, Portlandia) who is also an author and environmentalist.

The citrus-based solvent cleans hardwood and engineered wood floors without toxic fumes and no residue. Clean dog and cat \"accidents\" without harsh chemicals using Greenshield's Organic Pet Stain and Odor Remover.

The lemon-scented stuff in the yellow aerosol has terrifying health hazards. This furniture polish is plant-based, of petroleum ingredients. The EWG considers ammonia, found in common glass cleaners, as a harmful ingredient that contributes to respiratory issues as well as skin irritation. Err on the side of caution with an ammonia-free natural glass cleaner that doesn't leave streaks and works on plexi, mirrors, chrome, and more. "}
