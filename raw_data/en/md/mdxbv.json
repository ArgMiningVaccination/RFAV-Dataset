Category: Magazine - Organic Lifestyle Magazine1 Holistic, Natural Remedies for Hyperhidrosis (Excessive Sweating) | Hyperhidrosis, or excessive sweating, is a medical condition that affects an estimated 3% of the population. Night sweats, sweaty hands and feet, dripping sweat from the face or excessive underarm sweating may not sound like such a big deal if you have never experienced it, but drenched clothing is embarrassing as is sweat dripping off your nose and chin when the person next to you is totally comfortable. Aside from the social ramifications and embarrassment, excessive sweating can be very disruptive. Night sweats can be so severe you wake up with a drenched pillow and sheets, your hair or pajamas soaked through. Hands can sweat so much that simple tasks are difficult. Imagine trying to do paperwork, type on a keyboard, shake hands, dress your child, or turn a doorknob. According to conventional medicine, the cause may be an underlying medical condition or it may be caused by a mild dysfunction of the nervous system. If doctors cannot find an underlying medical condition such as diabetes, menopause, Parkinson's disease, medications, certain cancers, hyperthyroidism, etc., they really don't know the cause. As usual, not knowing the cause does not get in the way of the medical profession treating the symptoms. Current conventional treatments include the following: Antiperspirants: Many useover the counter antiperspirants. Others use prescription grade aluminum chloride solution on the hands, feet, underarms, and hairline. It is believed that they work by absorption of the active ingredients and plugging up the sweat glands. The body recognizes the sweat glands are plugged and stops producing sweat. Despite many claims made over the past decades to the contrary, The National Cancer institute denies any link between aluminum and cancer (specifically breast cancer), and the Alzheimer's Association denies any link between aluminum and Alzheimer's. Iontophoresis: Used for the hands and feet, this is a process where hands or feet are immersed in a tub of water. A low dose of electricity is passed through the water. The patient feels a tingling sensation. Patients initially receive 2-3 treatments per week. Subsequent treatments are needed once a week to once a month. If this treatment works, patients may choose to purchase the device to treat themselves at home. Botox: Botulinum toxin injections are said to inhibit sweating. Shots are effective for 4-5 months. Pharmaceuticals: Oral medications must be taken with care as they inhibit sweating so well patients can overheat. Surgery: Surgical procedures include severing nerves to affected areas as well as removing sweat glands. Obviously, we can't recommend any of these treatments. Causes of Hyperhidrosis If no cause of excessive sweating can be identified, primary hyperhidrosis is diagnosed. The current belief for the cause of primary hyperhidrosis is that a particular type of sweat gland, the eccrine glands, are overstimulated by the nervous system. There does appear to be an inherited or genetic predisposition, therefore a mutated gene may be indicated. Secondary hyperhidrosis is diagnosed when a cause or trigger for the excessive sweating is identified. Triggers or causes include: Candida Abundance Obesity Pregnancy Hyperthyroidism Menopause Anxiety Hypoglycemia Certain prescriptions like anti-depression medication Certain illegal drugs Withdrawals from drugs or alcohol Certain infections (like TB, HIV) Parkinson's disease Blood or bone marrow disorders such as Hodgkin's lymphoma Smoking (marijuana, tababccoo, smoking anything) Gout Diabetes Tumor Mercury poisoning Lymphatic Infection Endocrine Infection The truth is, there is always a cause. Doctors, especially Western conventional doctors, are just not good at finding causes for ailments. From a holistic perspective, there are a couple of direct causes of excessive chronic sweating. Oftentimes the body is running hot due poor liver and kidney health, which makes the blood sluggish causing poor circulation. There is a host of hormonal imbalances that can cause it. Like with every disease, sickness, or ailment, there are always many causes, but it all comes down to cellular malfunction due to toxicity and a lack of nutrition. Picture a car engine that's struggling to produce enough power, getting hotter and hotter as it tries. If one were to get the body to stop sweating without addressing the cause, like removing the car's radiator, this could be dangerous. And excessive sweating can also be the body's last-ditch effort to rid itself of enough toxins to keep functioning. Another reason for excessive sweating can be an endocrine system flaw, causing the body to sweat when it does not actually need to. On the other hand, this indicates a very toxic body, and arguably, is just another case of the body being overwhelmed and needing to detoxify through sweat glands. In other words, anyone who suffers from hyperhidrosis is dealing with a toxic, overwhelmed body that needs healing. Alternative Treatments Begin with Diet and Detox Seeking an herb or a natural supplement to \"get rid of the problem\" mimics the conventional path. To heal the body, it is important to treat the whole body through a combination of nutrition and detoxification and allow the body to heal itself. Hyperhidrosis indicates a body with much wrong. As Raymond Francis states, \"One cell, one disease,\" and this wisdom proves to be true. In every case of disease, something is wrong at a cellular level. We begin with nutrition. A plant-based, whole food, organic diet delivers the most bioavailable nutrition. The healthiest diet consists of 80% fresh, raw, organic produce, more vegetables than fruits, healthy fats, and plenty of clean water. If meat is eaten, it is important that it be organic. This means preparing your own food. Do not trust businesses to do it! Last, but not least, it is vital to stop polluting the body. Soap, deodorant, shampoo, hair colorings, lotions, powder, make-up - everything you place on your body is absorbed. If you put chemicals on your body, chemicals will seep into your body. Whatever you inhale enters your body. Smoking, chemically scented perfumes and air fresheners (included scented candles), off-gassing from chemically treated furniture, carpets, paints, glues, etc. Do not pollute your environment. Purchase supplies, building materials, and furniture wisely with indoor pollution in mind. You should be sleeping 8 hours a night. Is your bed filled with chemicals? Or have you purchased an organic mattress? Back to the food you put in your body. Avoid all fake food! Eliminate all artificial flavors, coloring, and preservatives. No MSG. GMOs, or trans fats. Limit or eliminate alcohol and caffeine. If you have any kind chronic condition, there is a good chance your gut is sick and overrun with Candida. If all of these dietary restrictions sounds like too much to consider, just simplify it. Eat real food! If it comes in a box, a can, or a bottle, trade it in for something that comes right off the vine or the tree. Real food heals the body. More specifically, your diet should consist of huge, diverse salads with fresh herbs, cranberry lemonade, and fruits and nuts in moderation. Try some quinoa stir fry's, rice and beans, and other whole food options for dinner. Check out Detox Cheap and Easy Without Fasting - Recipes Included. Skin As mentioned, everything you place on your body is absorbed. Consider this when picking out clothes. Unnatural fabrics play havoc on our endocrine system and our lymphatic system. You can't rid the body of toxins well with a layer of toxins on the skin. Natural, breathable fibers are a must. This also includes bedding and mattresses. Breathable, all natural fibers with no toxic off-gassing may be just the trick to getting a dry nights sleep. There is a huge toxic load we contend with when we sleep on conventional mattresses, or with conventional bedding and clothes. Fitness Sweat may be just what an excessive sweater needs to quit excessively sweating. For anyone dealing with hyperhidrosis, a serious fitness regimen is in order. Squats, yoga, and running are awesome exercises to stimulate organ and system functionality to facilitate detoxification. Supplemental Alternative Treatments for Hyperhidrosis Once the need for proper nutrition and detoxification has been addressed, supplementation to speed the process can be considered. Vitamins & Minerals B vitamins should be considered first and foremost. Hyperhidrosis indicates severe hormonal imbalances. Anyone with hormonal imbalances has a problematic endocrine system and poor gut health, which makes B vitamin production and assimilation difficult. Vitamin D is a potent modulator of the endocrine system. After diet and exercise, improving vitamin D and vitamin B levels often eliminates hyperhidrosis. But with a very toxic body, there is more work to be done. Herbs for Hyperhidrosis Witch hazel is a powerful astringent that can be applied in liquid form to the skin. Traditionally, witch hazel was used to for insect bites, irritated skin, and bruises. Some are reporting witch hazel can help eliminate excessive sweating as well. Burdock helps to jump-start the endocrine system and the lymphatic system, and some claim that burdock actually helps the body to redirect sweating fluids through lymph nodes, kidneys, and bowels. Astragalus, from northeast China, has many health benefits, and one of those benefits is balancing and reducing sweat response. Excessive sweating is often thought to be the result of an unhealthy spleen. Astragalus can help heal and detoxify the spleen. Sage is typically considered one of the best herbs to treat hyperhidrosis. Sage is an adaptogen, which calms the nervous system and helps the body deal with emotional and physical stress. Sage contains lots of thiamine and magnesium. These minerals soothe the sweat glands and calm the nervous system. Sage also contains rosmarinic acid which is known to inhibit sweat. Schisandra grows in China and in the United States. The tiny red berries from the tree have many beneficial medicinal properties. The berries are also an adaptogen, which helps the body to cope with stress and reduce excess sweating. Though not really an herb, asparagus has been used traditionally used in Chinese medicine to treat excessive sweating. Asparagus contains the chemical, asparagine, that decreases sweat production. We recommend eating them cooked and raw; try putting them in your salad. Candida If you suffer from hyperhidrosis, it's a very safe bet that you have toxic got biology and suffer from an abundance of Candida and are dealing with a host of other symptoms and ailments. Your endocrine system is overwhelmed and your lymphatic system is toxified. You won't get over any of this without fixing the gut, which means killing excess Candida and developing a healthy gut ecosystem. Fungal Supplement Stack - Knock Out Yeast, Candida, Mold, Fungus The first three should be plenty for most people, but for a very sick gut, or for impatient people with a bigger budget, I'd recommend all of these: Chronic illness tells us the body is heavily burdened and radical changes need to take place to achieve homeostasis. When hyperhidrosis is present, it is a good indication that the body is in serious trouble. Health starts in the gut. If you suffer from regular excessive sweating, your body is way over-taxed and it's time for an overhaul. While the aforementioned supplements can help alleviate discomfort without side effects, anything short of a holistic approach will result in new ailments. Be sure to ccheck outHow To Heal Your Gut. We've all heard of the lymphatic system, but few understand how it works or why and how a properly working lymphatic system is vital to the body. The lymphatic system is a network of tissues and organs that transport lymph throughout the body. Its responsibilities include cleaning the cellular environment, returning proteins and excess tissue fluids to the blood, providing a pathway for the absorption of fats into the bloodstream, and the production and transportation of antibodies (white blood cells called lymphocytes) throughout the body to fight infection. Our blood contains red blood cells that deliver oxygen around the body, white blood cells that fight infections, platelets that help you stop bleeding if you get a cut, and plasma. Plasma is the liquid portion of blood. It's a yellowish liquid in blood that suspends the red blood cells and carries nutrients and oxygen throughout the body. Plasma contains water, salt, enzymes, immunoglobulins (antibodies), hormones, clotting factors, and plasma proteins. Interstitial fluid, also known as tissue fluid, was plasma before it entered tissue. Interstitial fluid is a solution that bathes and surrounds the tissue cells. Tissue fluid and blood are not the same, and not all of the contents of blood pass into tissue. Red blood cells, platelets, and some of the plasma proteins do not pass through capillaries. The resulting mixture that does get through is, in essence, blood plasma minus its clotting agents and some of its proteins. Lymph was interstitial fluid before it became lymph. Lymphatic Anatomy The lymphatic system is made up of lymph capillaries, vessels, and nodes, the spleen, thymus, tonsils, Peyer's Patches, and lymphocytes (white blood cells). Red bone marrow is also a part of the lymphatic system. We have hundreds of lymph nodes. Lymph nodes can be found all around the lungs and heart, in the gut, in the armpits and groin, and pretty much all over the body. Blood pressure causes plasma liquid to leak into tissues, and this pressure causes excess fluid in those tissues to move into the lymph capillaries. As this fluid leaves the cells, it takes cellular waste products and used proteins with it. The lymphatic capillaries pick up approximately 20% of the fluid that was delivered to the interstitial space. The venous system picks up about 80% of the fluid in the interstitial space. The unique structure of the lymphatic capillaries permits interstitial fluid to flow into them but not out. Blood pressure, temperature, activity of muscle and joints, diaphragmatic breathing, and pulsation of adjacent arteries all cause lymph to move up to the subclavian veins at the base of the neck. Valves and pressure keep lymph moving in the right direction. Along the way, the fluid is interrupted by lymph nodes that filter dust, cancer cells, pathogens, and other unwanted matter. Lymph nodes also produce lymphocytes (white blood cells). The spleen, tonsils, and red bone marrow help produce lymphocytes as well. The spleen, which is about the size of our fist, is the largest lymphatic organ. It is similar in structure to a lymph node, but it filters blood, not lymph. The spleen contains two main types of tissue, white pulp and red pulp. White pulp is lymphatic tissue containing white blood cells - B and T cells. T cells attack pathogens (such as bacteria and viruses) while B cells make antibodies that fight infections. Red pulp tissue removes old and damaged red blood cells and stores platelets. It also produces red blood cells in unborn babies and when certain diseases are present. The thymus is both a lymphatic organ and an endocrine gland. The thymus plays a major role in immune system development, starting before birth. Unlike other organs, the thymus reaches its functional peak, and largest size, during childhood. After puberty the thymus reduces in size, replaced by fat. Tonsils are a familiar lymphatic cluster. Their position, hanging from the mouth and pharynx, allows them to be the first line of defense against inhaled and swallowed foreign bodies and toxins. The final goal of the lymphatic system is to recirculate lymph back into the plasma of the bloodstream. There are two specialized lymphatic structures at the end of the lymphatic system, called the lymph trunks and ducts. Lymph ducts empty lymph into one of the subclavian veins. There are two lymph ducts, the right lymphatic duct and the thoracic duct. The right drains lymph from the right upper limb, the right side of thorax, and the right halves of head and neck. The thoracic duct drains lymph into the circulatory system between the left subclavian and the left internal jugular veins. Lymphatic trunks are large lymph vessels that made up of the convergence of many efferent lymph vessels. There are five sets of lymph trunks. Jugular lymph trunks located in the neck Subclavian lymph trunks located beneath the clavicle Bronchomediastinal lymph trunks located in the chest Lumbar lymph trunks drain lymph fluid from the legs, pelvic region, and kidneys Intestinal lymph trunk receives chyle (lymph mixed with fats) from the intestines, and receives lymph from the stomach, pancreas, spleen, and the liver. Lymphatic trunks drain lymph fluid into the lymph ducts, the final part of the lymphatic system. For more on lymphatic system anatomy and function: The Gastrointestinal Lymphatic System After filtration by the lymph nodes, efferent lymphatic vessels take lymph to the end of the lymphatic system to recirculate lymph back into the plasma of the bloodstream. The intestinal lymphatic system serves vital functions in the regulation of tissue fluid homeostasis (keeping tissue properly hydrated), immune surveillance, and transportation of fats and other nutrients into plasma. When the gut's not healthy, the body is not healthy. A sluggish and toxic gut will slow the lymph's ability to provide clean, infection-free blood, and fats will not as easily be absorbed and assimilated, causing weight gain and poor cellular health that can lead to an array of problems from diabetes to cancer. Diseases and Disorders of the Lymphatic System The lymphatic system removes infections and other toxins from the blood. A sick body is a toxic and infected (or soon to be infected) body. Arguably, most every chronic disease and every infection is indicative of an overwhelmed lymphatic system. When the system is overwhelmed, the body is overwhelmed. With any chronic illness, getting well includes improving lymphatic function. Edema, or Oedema - Swelling that results when tissues cannot drain fluid into the lymphatic system quickly enough - see image above. Lymphedema - Caused by a blockage in the lymphatic system, part of the immune and circulatory systems. Lymphedema is most commonly caused by lymph node removal or damage due to cancer treatment. Elephantiasis - Medically known as lymphatic filariasis, a condition characterized by enlargement of an area of the body, typically the limbs. It looks like a severe case of edema, and it is. Glandular fever - A type of viral infection that mostly affects young adults. Symptoms include tender lymph nodes. Hodgkin's disease - A type of cancer of the lymphatic system. Tonsillitis - Infection of the tonsils in the throat. Lymphadenopathy - Occurs when the lymph nodes swell due to infections. Viral infections like measles, rubella, glandular fever, and HIV may also cause lymphadenopathy of the lymph nodes. Lymphadenitis - Inflammation of the lymph nodes usually caused due to infections. Filariasis - An infection of the lymphatic channels by a worm or parasite. Splenomegaly - Swelling of the spleen due to a viral infection like infectious mononucleosis. All lymphatic disorders equate to a slow moving, less efficient lymphatic system. This immediately leads to toxic blood and tissue with cancerous and otherwise sickly cells that should have been filtered out. Symptoms of a Sluggish Lymphatic System Humans have twice as much lymph fluid in the body as blood. Unlike the circulatory system, the lymphatic system does not have a pump. In order to move, lymph relies on blood pressure and the relaxation and the contraction of the muscles and joints. Your lymphatic system can easily become stagnant, especially when it becomes overwhelmed with toxic debris. The combination of a toxic lifestyle and lethargy is a recipe for chronic disease. All things in nature have a natural progression. When this progression is inhibited, health deteriorates. Think of a river. A healthy river runs clean and clear compared to stagnant water. Imagine them clogged and the resulting backup. Picture an engine and car oil, and you can equate our lymphatic system to an oil filter. Imagine how sluggish and constrictive the engine would be if the oil wasn't constantly filtered. Sluggish lymph fluid is a breeding ground for infection. Stagnant lymph interferes with every system of the body. Because lymph cleanses nearly every cell in the body, symptoms of chronic lymph blockage are diverse. While most people prefer to identify one specific cause of a disease, there are rarely fewer than three and can often be hundreds. The point is, if the body is unhealthy, the lymph is unhealthy, too. If the body is sick, the lymph is sick, too. Symptoms of lymphatic congestion include: Rings get tight on fingers Skin is puffy, showing edema Soreness, stiffness, achiness in the mornings Arthritis Lethargic, drained, sluggishness Bloating, water retention Itchy skin Bad skin (dryness, acne, premature aging, etc.) Breast swelling or soreness with hormonal cycles Brain fog Cold hands and feet Chronic headaches and/or migraines Cellulite Cancer Diabetes Chronic inflammation Every one of these health concerns can be linked to other diseases as well, but any disease leads to a taxed lymphatic system, and a healthy lymphatic system is necessary to eliminate any disease. How to Restore the Lymphatic System to Optimum Health Doctors in Europe and in the Far East recognize the importance of lymphatic function and how it supports detoxification and every other system in the body, including the immune, digestive, and nervous systems. Natural practitioners know that poor lymph health underlies most health conditions from poor skin to cancer. By contrast, conventional practitioners in America don't even consider the lymphatic system until a lymph deficiency shows up such as a swollen lymph node, cancer developing in a lymph gland, or obvious signs of lymph blockage. And of course, when something does go seriously wrong with the lymphatic system, western conventional doctors typically say the ailment is incurable. This is not true. Be Careful What You Put On Your Skin When the lymphatic system becomes sluggish it will \"off-gas\" through the skin. When unnatural fibers (like nylon or polyester) are worn and when chemical creams and soaps are applied to the skin, toxin release through the skin is inhibited. Much of the toxic load that should have been eliminated is re-absorbed along with some of the new toxins from the chemically laden clothes and skin products. This creates a backlog of needed detoxification. A tight fitting bra and underwire bras will impede normal lymphatic flow. Make sure bras fit properly, and avoid underwires. Go braless whenever possible. Wear natural fibers, and don't put toxic chemicals on your skin. Almost every skin care product in the skincare isles is toxic. Most \"all natural\" moisturizer creams, and soaps are also toxic. With few exceptions (like essential oils), when it comes to skin care products, if you can't eat it, don't put on your skin. This also includes sunblock, deodorant, and laundry detergents. Speaking of deodorants, they need to be all natural. Conventional deodorants, especially antiperspirants, inhibit lymph detoxification. On a side note, it's no wonder, understanding how the body works, that antiperspirants do in fact lead to breast cancer. We need to sweat, and that sweat leads to an ecosystem of flora on the skin that can promote good health or bad health. Check out How To Make Your Own Natural Deodorant at Home. Your body is a collection of organs that ideally work in harmony with one other. The lymphatic system keeps organs healthy, but an unhealthy organ, or many unhealthy organs, will overload the lymphatic system. Most people with a slow lymphatic system have a leaky gut. In fact, most people with any health problems have a gut that is overly permeable, allowing undigested particles, and toxins to enter the blood and lymph. See Best Supplements To Kill Candida and Everything Else You Ever Wanted To Know About Fungal Infections for more on gut health. The first step for almost anyone experiencing health problems should be to balance gut flora. If your body is toxic, your gut is toxic, and the microbes in there are not going to be your friends. As previously mentioned, the intestinal trunk receives the lymph from the stomach,intestine, pancreas, spleen, and liver. None of these organs will be well if the digestive system is in turmoil. The diet for a healthy lymphatic system and a healthy human body includes far more fresh, raw vegetables than anything else. This how a healthy diet should look with the most often consumed foods listed first: Raw, fresh vegetables and herbs Raw fresh fruit Cooked vegetables Nuts, seeds, and legumes (all properly soaked, sprouted, etc.) Brown rice, amaranth, quinoa, millet, oats Meat Obviously, meat is optional. Most of us do not get enough water. Clean water is imperative for lymphatic health, too. Fungal Supplement Stack - Knock Out Yeast, Candida, Mold, Fungus If you have a sluggish lymphatic system you've got Candida. In fact, that's probably one of the main causes. The first three should be plenty for most people, but for really prominent fungal issues or for impatient people with a bigger budget I'd recommend all of these: While there are supplements that help, a healthy body will not be achieved without the right diet. The right diet is the foundation of an effective detox. Check out Detox Cheap and Easy Without Fasting - Recipes Includedfor a recipe for salads and for a cranberry lemonade that will radically improve the body's elimination of toxins. Salads, when made right, provide a plethora of synergistic nutrition that rebuilds the body while pulling out toxins (for instance, many vegetables and herbs chelate heavy metals). The cranberry lemonade, made with unsweetened cranberry juice and stevia, will help flush and detoxify the liver and kidneys, allowing the lymph to move much more freely. Avoid all refined, processed foods. Cook and prepare all food at home. Do not eat out until all symptoms are gone and health is restored. At home, eat salads, cranberry lemonade, and fresh fruit. Make stir-frys for dinner. Avoid vaccines, at least until the lymphatic system is running smoothly. Regardless of your vaccine stance, vaccines are toxic and they slow lymph. The same is true for GMOs. GMOs harm healthy gut flora, and they need to be avoided. For more on vaccines and GMOs, check out People Against... Foods That Support the Lymphatic System Water, while not a food, is vital to life. A lack of water inhibits lymph from flowing smoothly. Cranberries emulsify fat, which helps break down excess fat so the lymphatic vessels can carry it away. Cranberry also helps the kidneys, which helps with overall hydration. Avoid cranberry juice that has any added ingredients, and try to get some fresh, whole cranberries to juice whenever possible. Leafy greens are cleansing. Chlorophyll, the green nutrient that captures sunlight, has powerful cleansing properties and beneficial effects on the blood and thus on lymph fluid as well. Look for dark greens like kale, spinach, wheat grass, barley grass, turnip greens, dandelion leaves, broccoli, and mustard greens. Garlic boosts immune function, chelates heavy metals and some other toxins, and kills harmful microbes. Anything that boosts immune function will take a load off of the lymphatic system. Ginger reduces inflammation, and like garlic, ginger is also antimicrobial. Turmeric is related to ginger. It also helps reduce inflammation, thins the blood, improves circulation, and is a well known and very effective cancer fighter. Fresh produce has many different benefits for the lymphatic system and the whole body, but enzymes are critical to good health. More enzymes in the diet means more enzymes are available to the body to break down food and fibrin, which allows for easier flow of blood and lymph. Lymphatic Supplemental Support Systemic enzymes help to restore lymphatic transport capacity and break down undesired excess proteins that contribute to swelling and inflammation. Systemic enzymes also remove debris throughout the body that slow down circulation. Oregano oil supports digestion and the immune system. Oregano oil is absorbed directly into the lymphatic system from the digestive tract. The powerful antioxidants and antimicrobial properties can help clear up the intestinal lymph capillaries. Oregano oil also contains terpenes that dissolve fatty sludge in the lymph system and in the gall bladder. Burdock is a powerful multi-system detoxifier that supports the liver, kidneys, digestion, and the lymphatic and endocrine systems. According to the University of Michigan Health System, burdock a blood and lymph purifier. Wild indigo stimulates the glandular and lymphatic systems. This herb is an antimicrobial immune system modulator and lymphagogue that helps regulate immune and inflammatory responses. Licorice root is one of the most broad-spectrum natural detoxifying agents known to herbalists. It has been said to gently rid the body of over 1,000 known toxins. Goldenseal and astragalus are excellent lymphatic system and blood cleansers that also boost the immune system. Echinacea alleviates congestion and swelling in the body, and it boosts the immune system. Echinacea will ward off bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. Echinacea helps strengthen certain kinds of cells in the lymph nodes called macrophages, which are responsible for getting the toxins out of the lymph. Aloe vera is a natural cleansing food that encourages, supports, and increases lymphatic circulation. Prickly ash bark is a traditional Native American remedy that boosts lymphatic function, stimulates digestion, and promotes joint manjistha, bupleurum, rehmannia, and stillingia root are popular herbs for lymph stimulation and detoxification. Other Ways to Stimulate the Lymphatic System Get upside down. Bounce and jostle. Just move! Inversion Table An inversion table is a padded table that allows one to invert upside down while strapped in by the feet. This decompresses joints and stimulates the lymphatic and circulatory system. Lymphatic Massage We all love a good massage, and a massage will help with the lymphatic system. But, a lymphatic massage specifically targets the flow of lymph in the body. With rhythmic circular movements at just the right pressure to stimulate the lymph, this kind of massage can encourage lymph movement. Lymphatic massage, when done correctly, has been proven to push up to 78% of stagnant lymph back into circulation, which mobilizes toxins for clearance, lessening the burden on the body. Dry Brushing Dry skin brushing is a technique commonly utilized in Ayurveda for assisting in lymphatic flow. The procedure uses a dry brush with coarse bristles to brush the skin gently towards the heart. This stimulates the sweat glands, opens up skin pores, and helps remove dead skin cells as it stimulates the movement of lymph and blood in underlying organs and tissues. Exercise Rebounding is the practice of jumping on a trampoline for ten to thirty minutes. This stimulates the circulation of blood and lymph throughout the body. Numerous studies have proven its efficacy, and some believe there are many other benefits as well. Other bouncing exercises like jumping rope, jumping jacks, and dance stimulate like rebounding. A hard surface makes for a better bounce to the system, but a trampoline is better for those who need to start with exercises that are more gentle. Squats massage and stimulate internal organs and bodily systems. Humans were meant to squat and run regularly. Our body works better when we do. Yoga increases the flow of the lymph. Inverted positions, stretching and contracting the core, and other positions involving stretching are all very beneficial to the lymphatic system. Running and jogging get the lymph moving. Sweating and breathing heavily also improve lymph condition. Be sure to breathe properly! How To Eliminate Chronic Illness and Heal Lymph Here are three articles I put together on diet. This is indicative of how my family eats every single day. We start off with cranberry lemonade and a huge salad every morning. For lunch, we sometimes do a smoothie or we snack on some nuts and/or fruit or we just finish our massive 11-cup salads. For dinner, we always cook from scratch, which takes preperation and time, but it gets easier. Rice and beans, quinoa, lentils, millet, oatmeal, and amaranth are common staples for our cooked meals. We add lots of raw vegetables and herbs to our dinners as well, for instance, the rice and beans go great with chopped tomatoes and avocado, diced onions and garlic, and shredded turmeric and ginger. Eat raw herbs and cooked herbs together for maximum health benefits. This is truly a lifestyle, not a diet, and it's one we live every day. You may not need to go to this extreme to rid your body of disease, but I find that most who are dealing with chronic illness need to take it this far, at least for a few months. The salads are the most important part of this protocol. More than supplements, more than anything save getting enough water, the salads are imperative. Eat lots of it. Make sure they are diverse with at least 15 different vegetables and herbs. If you could see what packing your gut with salad does to your ecosystem under a microscope, you'd understand why I'm so passionate about them. There is nothing more beneficially life-changing than developing a salad habit when the salads are big and diverse and homemade. They do more than any supplement or any other food to clean the intestinal walls of filth and develop a beneficial gut ecosystem. The cranberry lemonade helps keep the kidneys and liver working optimally. These organs typically get sluggish quickly when lots of Candida are killed. If salads are #1, this cranberry lemonade is #2, and supplements are a distant #3. For those with very serious gut issues, legumes and grains will be a no-no for the first few weeks at least, but when enough salad has been consumed, the gut should be able to reap many benefits from cooked foods like the dinner meals aforementioned. Sweet fruit should be severely limited, and for the very ill, avoided until the gut is working better. Grapefruit, cranberry, avocado, lime, and lemon do not fall under this category. Juicing with fruits is not much better than refined sugar, so don't make the common mistake of thinking a fresh-juice fast is going to get you well. Now that diet is covered, here's the supplement part: SF722 - 5 capsules three times a day, once on an empty stomach, the other two times with or without food. SF722 kills yeast, and if you have a slow lymphatic system you have Candida! Abzorb - take two capsules with harder to digest meals, and also take two on an empty stomach twice a day, like early morning and late night. When taken on an empty stomach the Abzorb acts as a systemic enzyme and a probitoic. When taken with food it helps digest food. Both are great. For anyone on a tight budget I recommend putting the money to food, and if affordable, add Abzorb and SF722. That's enough with the right diet to eliminate fungal overgrowth in almost everyone. There are some who work or live in environments that constitute more environmental stressors on the body, and therefore need a lot more help. There are also many living in areas of the country where the healthy food selection at the local grocery store is sparse. I recommend more supplements and growing your own food in such a case. And I recommend growing your own food for a hundred other reasons as well. If you're someone who needs more supplementation or, like me, you just tend to prefer overkill, here's a step-by-step protocol that includes all of the previously recommended supplements, and a bit more to address Candida die off and healthy defecation. Each day has two supplement routines that are repeated. Each supplement routine has an objective. Clean and Gut Populate with Good Guys: If your lymphatic system is toxic so is your gut. In fact, that's where the toxins are most likely coming from. Also, take absorb with any food that is difficult to digest. Protocol 6am - Clean and Populate With Good Guys Start with Abzorb and a big glass of cranberry lemonade and the 9am - Antimicrobials, Kill the Bad Guys Salad time! The MycoPhyto Complex company recommends to take on an empty stomach, but I like it with salads and smoothies too. 12pm - Antimicrobials, Kill the Bad Guys Homemade Smoothie Time! If you're extremely ill you may need to wait on the smoothies and just double up on the salads for the first week, but I've found that many people who were suffering from a plethora of ailments and having trouble recovering responded very well to pineapple smoothies. Pineapple smoothies (made with fresh pineapple), like the ones I have recipes for in the above link, pack a massive amount of enzymes and can help break down a lot of junk in the gut, while delivering large amounts of nutrition. But, smoothies have plenty of sugar, so it's a good time to repeat the supplements from 9am. Use pineapple, coconut water, water, cranberry juice, or if you can withstand some sugar try granny smith apple juice, but don't use sweet fruit juices for smoothies. 3pm -Week 1 - Antimicrobials, Kill the Bad Guys 3pm -Week 2 - Populate With Good Guys 6pm - Antimicrobials, Kill the Bad Guys Dinner time! Everything from scratch, nothing pre-made in any way, all whole food ingredients. 9pm - Populate With Good Guys Finish of the night with probiotic support and leave them alone for the night to do their thing. Three More Supplements to Consider - Die-0ff, Heavy metal Detox, & Bowel Movements If Candida die-off is a concern be sure to drink plenty of cranberry lemonade and I also recommend adding Total Nutrition Formula and the Intestinal Detox. Here's a recipe to make your own Total Nutrition. This way you'll get bentonite clay, charcoal, chlorella, spirulina, and more, which are all great for mitigating the die-off effects of a Candida detox, and they also chelate heavy metals. You can take the Total Nutrition Formula with the smoothie or sprinkle it on the salad (or choke it down with water), and take the Intestinal Detox anytime throughout the day as directed. If you're not defecating easily and at least twice daily, I also highly recommend the Intestinal Cleanse. It kills parasites and moves the bowels better than anything else on the market that I know of, by far. I recommend taking it with the antimicrobials. Conclusion To help clear out a sluggish lymphatic system, get more exercise, get a good massage, eat more produce and drink lots of cranberry lemonade. For chronic illness, a holistic approach that involves fitness, diet, and supplementation is in order. Sometimes people seem to be doing everything else right, but their bodies won't get healthy until they start moving. For a clogged lymphatic system, exercise may be critical to get things moving freely. For most other health issues, exercise is more of an option, one with benefits but not totally necessary. If you find your lymph system to be sluggish, you need exercise. Squats, yoga, and running help detoxify the body and get lymph flowing better. Running is particularly good for the lymphatic system. We were built to run, and don't let any doctor tell you differently. Check out Running Without Knee Pain. Both sprinting and jogging have a host of positive benefits to lymph. The following recommended products, if used as instructed with a proper diet, will clear the lymphatic system, strengthen the immune system, and help alleviate almost all other health issues, given enough time. The supplements are listed in order of most likely to be most important. While the time varies from person to person, most feel a huge sense of rejuvenation within 3 to 10 days on this protocol. Holistic Guide to Healing the Endocrine System and Balancing Our Hormones | Is your endocrine system healthy? If you suffer from regular insomnia and other sleep issues, dull skin, depression, low energy, alopecia, a low sex drive, weight gain, puffy skin, excessive fear, anger, or ADHD, the answer is no. These are just some of the many symptoms that pretty much guarantee a sluggish endocrine system. Basically, if you're not healthy, your endocrine system is not healthy. An unhealthy endocrine system means congested and otherwise degenerated glands are causing imbalanced hormone levels. The holistic approach to ridding the body of disease is all about achieving homeostasis of the body through proper diet, elimination of toxins, and targeting specific,underlying issues through supplementation to reduce the most prevalent symptoms and aid healing. In other words, the goal is to rebuild the body's cells. This is always the goal with achieving or retaining good health. As Raymond Francis taught us, there is only one disease, and that's cell malfunction, which has two causes: nutrient deficiencies and toxicity. How sickness manifests itself depends on which cells are failing. If you rebuild the cells, the body works properly. For most people this can be done with diet alone. On the other hand, sometimes a specific gland, organ, or an entire system (and it's often a combination) within the body becomes so depleted, infected, and toxic, the body needs targeted assistance. When the body is overwhelmed with toxins, parts of the body will become so dysfunctional that simply functioning produces more toxins than the body can properly evacuate. Picture a car engine with a blown head gasket (or the wrong gas, or whatever makes sense to you). For many people, their endocrine system, or one or more of the glands within, are so dysfunctional that autoimmune disease is just around the corner. The head gasket is about to blow. How do you know if your endocrine system needs help? As mentioned earlier, if you're not feeling well, your endocrine system is taxed. Even if the problem is originating within an organ or another part of the body, if you don't feel well, your endocrine system doesn't feel well. A look at the endocrine system will explain why. Endocrine Anatomy 101 The endocrine system is the collection of glands and glandular organs that produce hormones to regulate metabolism, tissue function, growth and development (which includes repair), sexual function, reproduction, sleep, mood, the immune system, and more. The glands of the endocrine secrete hormones directly into the spaces surrounding their cells where the bloodstream picks them up and circulates them throughout the body, ultimately reaching the organ or cells designed to respond to the particular hormone. Hormones, much like the nervous system, tell the body what to do, and when. The endocrine system does this through chemicals, while the nervous system does this through electrical nerve impulses. Nerve impulses execute their effect immediately, but those effects are generally short-lived. The endocrine system takes longer. Hormones have to make their way from the gland that produces them into the bloodstream and eventually into the organ or cells where the hormones will take effect. A common way to look at the difference between the two is that the nervous system causes short-term responses, and the endocrine system is responsible for the body's longer-term responses. The two systems are mutually interconnected. Endocrine glands are glands of the endocrine system that secrete their hormones into the bloodstream. The major glands of the endocrine system include the pineal gland, pituitary thyroid, adrenals. When most people consider detoxifying the endocrine system to balance their hormones, these are the body parts that come to mind. The endocrine system includes a few organs that are not exclusively endocrine in function, meaning, they don't just release hormones. The hypothalamus, ovaries, and testes are included in this list, but the liver, pancreas, stomach, small intestine, kidneys, and the placenta are all also part of the endocrine system. The hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and pineal gland are located in the brain. The thyroid gland is located in the anterior neck, spanning between the C5 and T1 vertebrae, with the four parathyroid glands situated behind it. The adrenal (AKA the suprarenal) glands lie on top of the kidneys. The pancreas, stomach, ovaries, and testes are located in and beneath the abdominal cavity. The thymus is a gland in the chest. It contains glandular tissue and produces several hormones. But the thymus is much more closely associated with the immune system than the endocrine system. How Hormones Work Hormones are chemical messengers created by the body to transfer information from one set of cells to another in order to regulate the functions of different parts of the body. This includes hormones that are created only for the purpose of telling another gland to produce another hormone. (In this case, this would be only to tell a glandular organ to produce a hormone.) The endocrine system is regulated by feedback. Take the pituitary gland for instance. A signal is sent from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland to secrete a hormone, which signals the target gland to secrete its hormone, which we will say is T4 in this case, a hormone produced by the thyroid. When hormones enter the bloodstream they come in contact with many cells, but our hormones can affect only a few very specific cells called target cells. These target cells contain highly specific receptors, surface glycoproteins. The geometry of the glycoprotein molecules allows only for very specific hormones to attach to the receptor in the target cell surface. Target cells have up to 100,000 receptors for any one specific hormone. If the desired hormone molecules are lacking, the receptor sites of the individual cells will multiply to raise the level of sensitivity. When there is an excess of a hormone, the receptors for that hormone decrease, reducing the target cell's sensitivity. Back to our pituitary example, the levels of the T5 hormone should eventually rise in the bloodstream, and this tells the pituitary gland to reduce or stop producing the hormone responsible telling the thyroid to produce T4, and that's a feedback loop. Of course, this is a very simplistic explanation of only one of a few ways the body reduces hormonal response. There are many different kinds of hormones, and different hormones perform very different tasks. For a better understanding of these hormones, it's on to the hormone creators. Hypothalamus The hypothalamus is a part of the brain about the size of an almond, located below the thalamus, at the center for many critical bodily functions. The hypothalamus monitors the amount of salt and water in the body (by sensing the concentration of electrolytes in the blood), hormone concentrations in the blood, and the body's temperature. It is associated with rage, aggression, hunger, and thirst. The hypothalamus creates \"releasing hormones\" that stimulate or inhibit the secretion of pituitary hormones. The pituitary gland used to be considered the master gland, but now we know that the pituitary is receiving its orders from the hypothalamus's hormones. The hypothalamus is an intermediary between the endocrine system, the nervous system, and the immune system. Its responsibility includes certain activities of the autonomic nervous system like growth, metabolism, childbirth, milk production, circadian cycles, and more. If you feel fatigued, sleepy, emotional, hungry, or thirsty, your hypothalamus is communicating with you. Conventional doctors and holistic health practitioners agree that the hypothalamus functions pretty much problem free for most people, but, anorexia, bulimia, malnutrition, infections, inflammation, chronic insomnia, an excess of iron, excessive bleeding, head traumas, genetic disorders, tumors, radiation, and surgery can cause problems for the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus and the pituitary gland are tightly integrated. Together they regulate all processes having to do with our primitive reactions like fight or flight, body temperature, thirst, hunger, sexual activity, and survival in general. When the brain becomes inflamed, hypothalamic cells are disrupted, which leads to disease. Research recently elucidated the effects of hypothalamic inflammation and how it can lead to diabetes and cardiovascular disease. If the hypothalamus is failing, there are a lot of other problems within the body that need to be addressed, including the entire endocrine system as a whole, but reducing inflammation with healthy fat supplementation, the right diet, and B vitamins should be a good first step. Grounding and sunlight are also extremely beneficial and sometimes imperative for its optimal function. Pituitary Gland The pituitary is about the size of a pea. This gland lies in the sella turcica, known as the \"Turkish saddle\" at the base of the brain, behind the optic chiasm. The pituitary gland contains two functionally different body parts known as the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary. As far as we know, these two, while right next to each other, do not really work together. At one time, the pituitary gland, also called the hypophysis, was thought to be the \"master gland\" that controlled all of the other endocrine glands. Now we know that the hypothalamus takes messages from the brain and tells the pituitary which hormones to excrete. For instance, the hypothalamus will secrete growth-hormone-releasing hormone or growth-hormone-inhibiting hormone to tell the anterios pituitary to release or stop releasing growth hormones. The hypothalamus and the pituitary are tightly integrated. Together, they regulate all processes having to do with primitive reactions, such as stress, rage, flight, body temperature, thirst, hunger, sexual activity, and survival in general. Anterior Pituitary - Adenohypophysis The anterior pituitary gland is controlled by negative feedback mechanisms that make up three-quarters of the pituitary gland. Once triggered by the hypothalamus, hormones are released by the anterior pituitary into the bloodstream. For example, the hypothalamus releases hormones that tell the pituitary to release hormones that stimulate the thyroid to release hormones. These hormones enter the bloodstream to boost metabolism within the body where required. The negative feedback loop we spoke of above is how hormones in the blood communicate to the brain. When the metabolism has been successfully increased to the desired state, hormones in the blood tell the hypothalamus to tell the pituitary to stop stimulating the thyroid gland. Principal Anterior Pituitary Hormones Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone TSH stimulates the gland to release thyroid hormones. Follicle-Stimulating Hormone FSH&LH (luteinizing hormone) are known as gonadotropins because they stimulate the gonads (testicles and ovaries). They are not necessary to sustain life, but these hormones are essential for reproduction. Prolactin PL stimulates milk production. Adrenocorticotropic ACTH stimulates the hormones by the adrenal glands. Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone MSH is a collective name for a group of peptide hormones produced by the pituitary gland, the hypothalamus, and the skin. This hormone is an anti-inflammatory hormone that gets its name because of its effect on melanocytes, skin cells that contain the black pigment, melanin. Melanocytes are responsible for moles, freckles, and suntans. Melanin helps protect our cells from DNA damage from sunlight. Studies have recently shown that MSH can also suppress appetite. In all likelihood, MSH is also responsible for a range of other processes in the body. Human Growth Hormone HGH (somatotropin) stimulates growth of the body and helps regulate metabolic processes. People feel younger and the body heals much faster when there is enough (or excess) growth hormone. The most important function of HGH is to tell the liver to produce IGF-1, or insulin-like growth factor 1. IGF-1 is considered by many to be the key anti-aging hormone. Together these two hormones influence every system in your body. Increase Your Growth Hormones Naturally If you get a prescription, injections given twice a day by a doctor can increase your IGF-1 hormone production by 20 to 40 percent. Professional athletes and movie stars swear by growth hormone injections. They may be the untold secret to many people's success, but there are health problems with injecting hormones into the body. One of the many problems is that the pituitary can lose its ability to produce its own GH. Some take pills and supplements that contain growth hormones, which are available over the counter like other supplements. Users should do their due diligence before taking any product containing human growth hormones. There are also many supplements designed to increase the body's growth hormone production (Growth Hormone Production Nutrition). When someone is matched with the right supplements, the right formula can increase IGF-1 levels by 20 percent or more. A good alternative to HGH injections, these supplements are amino acid-based precursor formulas that contain ingredients such as glutamine, tyrosine, GABA, arginine, and lysine. Working out can dramatically increase growth hormone prevalence. A thirty-minute aerobic session can increase IGF-1 levels by more than 100%, and a serious weight training session can increase levels by 400 to 800%. On that note, everyone should be doing squats for a multitude of reasons, including but not limited to growth hormone production! HGH Protocol Squats have a myriad of health benefits including an increase in growth hormone production. It's one of the most important movements we can do for our health. Try with just a few bodyweight squats if you're out of shape, and work your way up to being able to do 100 squats at one time without getting sore. If you can't do squats, try lying on the floor and then standing up, then lying back down to repeat, alternating legs each time. If you're really serious about kicking up your growth hormone production, try sprints with high-intensity-interval training and low rep Olympic barbell squats with deadlifts, rows, pull-ups, and bench presses. The more muscles involved in the action and the heavier the load, the more HGH is released. Specific nutrition is known to increase growth hormone production under the right circumstances; these supplements are much more powerful when combined with the right exercise program. L-arginine is an essential amino acid that can increase the release of HGH, but do not take with sugars. L-arginine should be taken only with low glycemic nutrition. Glutamine is your body's most abundant amino acid. Studies have shown that even modest amounts can significantly increase HGH levels. Glycine plays a critical role in initiating normal patterns of REM sleep and has shown some promise in increasing HGH. We're not sure if the high-quality sleep is what's improving the hormone levels, or if there are also other factors when supplementing, but proper sleep is a critical factor in the body's ability to regulate the circadian release of HGH. Adequate sleep is a must! The highest concentration of HGH activity occurs when we are sleeping. Growth hormone and testosterone production peak during sleep. You can actually get people to test pathologically low for growth hormone by waking them repeatedly during the night. I always tell people that if you want to maximize your growth hormone, get a good night's sleep.\" - University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas Avoid high glycemic load foods, which is good advice for most anyone who's not healthy or wants to stay healthy. Insulin inhibits HGH secretion. High glycemic foods (which are generally processed foods with refined sugars) wreak havoc with our insulin levels. Hawthorn berries, horny goat weed, and maca are also known to aid the body with HGH production. Anterior Pituitary Nutrition Conditions such as acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome, and prolactinoma occur when the pituitary gland produces too much of one or more of its hormones. Adult growth hormone deficiency, diabetes insipidus, hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, and hypogonadism may result from the pituitary gland producing too little of one or more of its hormones. There are many more diseases that stem from a dysfunctional pituitary gland, like acromegaly, which gave Andr\u00e9 the Giant his stature and early death. As previously mentioned, high glycemic foods and refined foods should be avoided for healthy pituitary function, but this is true for all glandular function, and for the entire body, for that matter. It should be noted that fruits with high glycemic loads have other benefits that make moderate consumption healthful, provided the person does not have an illness that requires limited natural sugars. Adaptogens like ashwagandha, eleuthero, holy basil, maca, as well as glandulars (desiccated glands), are generally used for naturopathic healing of the pituitary. Check out Shillington's Brain Tonic and Desiccated Pituitary. Considerable recent research has shown that the pituitary is extremely sensitive to diet. (Someday science will recognize that this is true for every cell in the body.) If you don't assimilate enough protein, your pituitary can't produce enough pituitary hormones (which are made up of amino acids). The pituitary is also known to need manganese, vitamin E, vitamin A, vitamin D, and B vitamins for proper healthy function. Posterior Pituitary Gland - Neurohypophysis The posterior pituitary gland is slightly smaller and lighter in color than the other half of the pituitary, and it is not technically a gland, though it is a vital part of the endocrine system (and everyone still calls it a gland). This \"gland\" does not synthesize hormones. Instead the posterior pituitary stores and secretes two hormones, oxytocin and vasopressin, which are actually produced in the hypothalamus (master gland) and transported to the pituitary. Diabetes insipidus is the only clinical disorder that is generally conceded by the medical community to be of neurohypophyseal origin, but more and more evidence suggests that the posterior pituitary may have functions now scarcely appreciated. Treatment for the posterior pituitary gland is lumped in with treatment for the entire endocrine system, and the nutrition recommended is the same as mentioned above for the anterior pituitary gland. Oxytocin OXT is a powerful hormone with a lot of responsibilities. During childbirth this hormone increases the strength of uterine contractions and stimulates the ejection of milk after delivery. Incidentally, pitocin is a synthetic form of oxytocin, used to induce labor. Oxytocin is known as the \"love hormone,\" or the \"bonding hormone,\" because it's said to foster maternal instincts and sexual pleasure during and after intercourse. It's not just a sex hormone, oxytocin levels in the body increase when we hug or kiss a loved one like a spouse, parent, or child. Oxytocin plays a role in healing as well: As mice age, the amount of oxytocin in their blood decreases. But what does that mean for their health? Researchers injected oxytocin under the skin of elderly mice with damaged muscles and discovered the muscles healed much faster than those of mice left untreated.\" - Mental Floss We're just beginning to find out that oxytocin radically affects many aspects of our lives. This hormone inhibits the brain's fear center, has been shown to influence how men remember their mother's affection toward them as children (likely true for women, too), makes it easier for us to lie, makes it easier for us to trust, has been shown to make men more loyal to their spouses, is released when we feel safe and unobserved (causing shyness and a desire for privacy), increases the pain threshold, relieves stress, helps us relax, alleviates depression, increases generosity, and generally makes us feel good. While oxytocin is partly responsible for a man's courage to ask a woman out, this dynamic also helps give men the loyalty to stay with their loved ones. Dads who got a dose of an oxytocin nasal spray were shown to play more closely with their infants than dads who did not get the hormone spray. Another study found that men in relationships, when given a burst of oxytocin, stay farther away from an attractive woman. It stands to reason that oxytocin plays a key role (though certainly not the only one) in women being able to handle the strain and pain of childbirth. Antidiuretic Hormone ADH: (aka vasopressin, argipressin) is responsible for water concentration and blood vessel constriction. While precise control of the body's water concentration is a function of several hormones acting on both the kidneys and vascular system, ADH is a key player in this process. Blood vessels increase re-absorption of fluids by the kidneys, which decrease urine production to improve hydration. The effect raises blood volume and blood pressure. Not-so-fun fact: alcohol inhibits this hormone, producing the profuse urination we experience from a drinking binge, which can lead to severe dehydration. Pineal - Conarium or Epiphysis Cerebri The conarium, is an endocrine gland in the vertebrate brain about the size of a grain of rice. It is shaped like a tiny pine cone (hence its name), and it's located in the center of the brain behind and above the pituitary gland. Mystics consider this gland to be the third eye and the connecting link between the physical and spiritual worlds, but until recently the medical community considered it vestigial (an organ that has become functionless through evolution). Now the medical community knows the pineal gland is our major source of melatonin production. Since its discovery in 1958, melatonin has been studied extensively and shown to be widely beneficial to the body. The pineal gland releases melatonin with a clear circadian (daily) rhythm. The trigger for the production and release of melatonin from the pineal gland is darkness. The darker it is, the more melatonin is released. Streetlights, nightlights, and ambient lights from cell phones, TVs, computers, and other electronics disrupt melatonin output. If you're thinking that covering the eyes will solve this, think again. It turns out that light falling on any part of the body will inhibit the hormone. While the physiological function of the pineal gland remained unknown until recently, considering this gland seems to be able to see, the \"third eye\" concept once again gives credence to thousands of years of ancient wisdom. It seems most health professionals agree that melatonin levels decline as we age, but this isn't completely accurate. A Harvard study back in 1999 proved that melatonin levels do not necessarily decline with age. Previous studies had not excluded those on medications that suppress melatonin, nor did they control for factors such as sunlight and fluoridation. On the other hand, our own melatonin may lose some of its potency as we age. Our receptors for melatonin don't create the same power from the dose of the hormone they receive. In other words, as we age, the effect of melatonin in our body may diminish some. We don't know much more than that yet, but it shouldn't surprise anyone within the natural health community that this too is much more heavily influenced by lifestyle factors than age. Melatonin offers many other benefits other than sleep. It is one of the most powerful antioxidants produced in the body. It is both water and fat-soluble which allows this neurotransmitter to reach almost every cell in the body, and some studies suggest this hormone may improve the immune system's health. Nighttime melatonin levels are low in people with mood swings, depression, panic disorders, seasonal affective disorder, and many other mental health issues. Unlike sleep medications, supplementing with melatonin does not affect rapid eye movement, REM sleep, or dreaming, but many experts suggest limiting supplementing to no more than three months straight unless recommended by a professional, as melatonin supplementation may have long-term effects on the pineal gland's production. (Like with other glands, you use it or lose it.) How to Decalcify and Detoxify the Pineal Gland Calcification is the biggest problem for the pineal gland, and the main cause is suspected to be fluoride, which accumulates in the pineal gland more than any other organ, leading to the formation of phosphate crystals. There are foods and supplements that can help decalcify the pineal gland, as well as other steps you can take to help rejuvenate and restore health to the third eye. Don't wear sunglasses. Light reflected by the retina stimulates the pineal gland. We're supposed to get sunlight daily, on our skin and with our eyes. Just don't stare directly at the sun of course. Fluoride, chlorine, lead, pesticides, synthetic calcium, artificial sweeteners, synthetic fragrances, and mercury, are well-known endocrine disruptors that can lead to pineal calcification. Eat organic produce (from small, responsible farms), and drink only clean, healthy drinking water. When drinking or cooking with tap water, use a filter that removes fluoride and chlorine. A whole house filter, or at least one for the bathtub/shower, would be advisable since we breathe a lot of fluoride and chlorine and other chemicals into our lungs when we shower with tap water, and chemicals are absorbed through the skin. Antioxidants are a big help to the pineal gland and the endocrine system as a whole. Oregano oil is a powerful antioxidant with a host of other healthful properties that can aid a detox. Oregano oil and neem oil are said to be able to remove existing calcification within the pineal gland. Spirulina, chlorella, wheatgrass and blue-green algae are chlorophyll-rich foods that can also assist in the decalcification of the pineal gland due to strong detoxification properties and massive nutritional benefits. Raw apple cider vinegar is another natural detoxifier that can assist with decalcification of the pineal. Iodine is also imperative for strong pineal function, but supplementing with too much can cause problems as well. Vitamin K2 is imperative for the body's ability to properly assimilate calcium. K2 also helps remove calcification and puts that calcium to work elsewhere. Vitamin K2 deficiency is common in modern society and has been connected with a wide array of health ailments. K2 is the new D. Boron, naturally present in beets, can also be taken in supplemental form and can help decalcify and remove fluoride from the gland. Most importantly, avoid refined, processed foods. Eat a diet with lots of organic, fresh raw produce, which will alkalinize the body and alleviate almost every other symptom of poor health. Thyroid The thyroid gland is located in the lower front part of the neck. Thyroid hormones are best known for regulating the body's metabolism, which is your body's ability to break down food and convert it to energy. It also plays a role in breathing, heart rate, central and peripheral nervous systems, muscle tone, muscle control, menstrual cycles, body temperature, cholesterol levels, bone growth, body growth rate, nervous system development, brain, reproductive functions, and more. Thyroid hormone receptor sites are found in every cell of the body. Every single cell of our body depends on thyroid hormones. If your thyroid doesn't operate optimally, neither will the rest of your body. Three Thyroid Hormones Thyroglobulin is a protein (not a hormone) that's produced by the thyroid, synthesized from amino acids and an iodide, and stored in the follicular lumen as colloid. This protein is used only within the thyroid gland for production of thyroid hormones. T3 and T4 are the two most well-known hormones the thyroid produces, and there's also calcitonin. Triiodothyronine or T3 T3 affects almost every physiological process in the body. The thyroid produces about 20% of the T3 in our body. The rest is converted to T3 from T4 in our cells throughout the body. Thyroxin or T4 T4 (AKA tetraiodothyronine) is a prohormone (a committed precursor of a hormone, usually having minimal hormonal effect by itself) that the body converts to T3, a much more active and viable hormone. T4 is synthesized from residues of the amino acid tyrosine. A normal thyroid gland produces about 80% of and about 20%of body's T3. Calcitonin Calcitonin lowers blood calcium and phosphorus levels by decreasing the rate of re-absorption of these minerals to bone. Hyperthyroidism Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid makes too much T3 or T4 (or both). This leads to elevated blood pressure, rapid heart rate, hand tremors, and many other symptoms. Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Graves' disease causes antibodies to stimulate the thyroid to produce and secrete too much. Other causes of hyperthyroidism can include: Excess iodine Thyroiditis - inflammation of the thyroid gland (causes T4 and T3 to leak out of the gland) Benign tumors of the thyroid or pituitary gland (causes pressure, hormones leak out) Large amounts of tetraiodothyronine taken through dietary supplements or medication A tumor of the ovaries or testes Hyperthyroidism can't last forever; it's sure to wear out a thyroid eventually, leading to hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism Around 20 million Americans and about 250 million people worldwide have low thyroid function. Up to 90% of all thyroid problems are autoimmune in nature. Hashimoto's is the most common thyroid disorder. In people with Hashimoto's, the immune system attacks the thyroid. List Of Hypothyroidism Symptoms Allergic rhinitis Asthma Angina pectoris Atherosclerosis Bursitis Conditions related to the cardiovascular system Carpal tunnel syndrome Carotenodermia (slight orange tinge to the skin, usually on the palms of the hands and soles of feet) Neck pain, stiffness, aches (especially in the back of the neck) Knee pain (due to fallen arches) Pallor (an unhealthy pale appearance) Pain in the trapezoid and/or neck area Psoriasis Poor mental concentration Polycystic ovary syndrome Postpartum depression Premenstrual syndrome Reactive hypoglycemia tiredness Shoulder pain Tinnitus Urticaria Vasomotor rhinitis Vertigo Weakness Weight gain How to Heal the Thyroid Learning about the endocrine system is one the best ways to understand how incredibly connected each and every part of the body is and how imperative a holistic approach to healing is to repair the body. You can't really heal the thyroid gland without taking care of the adrenals, the pituitary - the whole endocrine system. Fresh, raw, organic produce heals. Produce heals everything. Other than that, foods high in iodine and foods that are high in selenium are known to aid in thyroid function. The thyroid gland requires iodine to function. Iodine taken by itself or ingested through fortified salt can be problematic. Good food sources include the usual: meat, seafood, yogurt, milk, and eggs, but there are vegan sources as well: Blackstrap molasses Seaweed Himalayan sea salt Navy beans Cranberries Selenium is required for the body to convert T3 into T4. Without enough selenium in the diet, the thyroid suffers. Seafood and meat are high in selenium, but there are also some vegan choices: Vegan Food Sources of Selenium Brazil nuts Shiitake/white button mushrooms Lima/pinto beans Chia seeds Brown rice Seeds (sunflower, sesame, and flax) Broccoli Cabbage Spinach Supplements For Hypothyroidism A number of vitamins and minerals are critical to thyroid health, and many herbs can help boost thyroid function as well. Vitamin B12 is found in every cell of the body. It is required for cellular metabolism and energy production, so obviously, without B12, the thyroid can't function optimally. B12 deficiencies are very common with hypothyroidism. A lack of B12 can cause and worsen hypothyroidism. Even though most people actually consume enough vitamin B12 in their diets, a deficiency occurs in many due to an inability to absorb the nutrient in the blood. This goes back to gut health. The body cannot absorb and assimilate nutrients properly with a poorly functioning digestive system. In addition, a poorly functioning liver radically inhibits the body's ability to utilize B12. Unless a knowledgeable naturopath recommends it for a limited amount of time, do not take vitamin B12, or anyone B vitamin, without the entire B complex. Over a billion people worldwide do not get enough vitamin D. A recent study showed that vitamin D levels were significantly lower in people suffering from hypothyroidism than the general population. While vitamin D deficiencies and hypothyroidism do tend to take place together, a lack of vitamin D and pretty much every other disease (including cancer) coincide as well. It's unlikely anyone's hypothyroidism is primarily caused by a lack of vitamin D, but it's a certainty that the body will not fully heal without enough vitamin D. We all know vitamin A is required for good vision. We also need vitamin A for the immune system, hormone synthesis, and the production of T3. Without enough vitamin A, thyroid hormone levels quickly drop. Ashwagandha is an adaptogenic herb that has many benefits, including the ability to significantly improve liver function, and it can help stabilize cortisol levels. This helps stimulate T3 and T4 hormone synthesis. There are many varieties of ginseng, all with their different strengths, but Siberian ginseng root, Brazilian ginseng root, Korean or Asian ginseng, American ginseng, and Chinese ginseng all benefit the endocrine system, and therefore the thyroid. A zinc deficiency has been shown to inhibit T3 production. Zinc also contributes to immune modulation, which may reduce thyroid antibody levels. Additionally, like selenium, zinc contributes to 5'deiodinase activity. A lack of iodine inhibits the body's natural detoxification, leads to cancer cell growth, and causes hypothyroidism. The thyroid absorbs iodine and, in doing so, replaces other toxins it has accumulated. It's also important to avoid excessive iodine intake for anyone with Hashimoto's or hyperthyroidism. As stated above, we highly recommend that any iodine consumed come from whole food sources unless otherwise recommended by a knowledgeable, competent professional. Gluten, Hashimoto's Disease, and Leaky Gut When the thyroid is not functioning properly, there is a good chance the gut is hyper-permeable, or \"leaky.\" Many suspect leaky gut to be the main cause of Hashimoto's. In this state where the gut is too permeable, undigested food proteins leak into the bloodstream. Human tissues have proteins and antigens very similar to those in foods, bacteria, parasites, and Candida. When the body senses these foreign molecules, it develops antibodies that attack the body, hence the name \"autoimmune disease.\" Gluten proteins are very similar to Candida proteins and proteins that make up the thyroid. This is probably why the immune response to gluten can last up to 6 months each time you eat it. When healing the thyroid (or the body in any way), regardless of whether or not it's due to Hashimoto's, modern wheat is a bad idea for a multitude of reasons. Important Notice About Gut Health! If you restore gut health, in most cases, everything else will follow. Chances are you can ignore the rest of the article and just fix your gut to restore health to your entire endocrine system. Fungal Supplement Stack - Knock Out Yeast, Candida, Mold, Fungus The first three should be plenty for most people, but for impatient people with really prominent fungal issues and bigger budgets could use all of these: I recommend taking the SF722, Berberine, MycoCeutics, and Microdefense with meals, and the Abzorb and Syntol separately, on an empty stomach (like in the morning and before bed). The Abzorb and the Syntol are a bit redundant, but I find good results using both if the budget can afford it. If money is really tight, just get the SF722 and put your money into your diet. There are four parathyroid glands; they're located two on each side of the thyroid. Although the parathyroids are attached to the thyroid gland anatomically, and the glands are connected to the thyroid, they have no related function. The parathyroid release parathormone, or PTH, or parathyroid hormone. PTH has the opposite job of calcitonin (the lessor known thyroid hormone); PTH increases levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood. It accomplishes this by increasing the cells of the bone (osteoclasts), which reabsorb calcium. It also increases urinary re-absorption of calcium by the kidneys. In addition, it causes the kidneys to form calcitriol, a hormone made from vitamin D that increases absorption of calcium from the GI tract. Parathyroid Adenoma Hyperparathyroidism refers to increased PTH production, usually because of a benign tumor of one or more of the parathyroid glands (parathyroid adenoma). When PTH is excessively produced, calcium is reabsorbed back into the blood from the kidneys, bones, and stomach. This leads to a condition sometimes called \"stones, bones, groans, and moans,\" which refers to the classic set of hyperparathyroidism symptoms: kidney stones, osteoporosis, groansof pain due to intestinal distress, and moans due to psychosis. Removing a parathyroid adenoma, a fairly simple, typically successful surgery, can cause an immediate return to healthy function. Natural remedies for hyperparathyroidism generally include anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, vitamin C, desiccated glandsg, and vitamin D supplementation (extreme caution should be taken with large dosages of vitamin D when blood calcium levels are high). A holistic approach for tumors on the parathyroid will take time, but fortunately, hyperparathyroidism has a very slow progression. Adrenals - Suprarenal Glands Our two adrenal glands are on top of the kidneys, hence, the terms \"adrenal,\" as in \"added\" to the renal glands The adrenal glands are composed of two entirely separate sections, the cortex and the medulla. Like the pituitary gland, the two sections of the adrenals evolved from two entirely different types of tissue. Adrenal Medulla The adrenal medulla evolved from the nervous system. The adrenal medulla works with the autonomic nervous system (the unconscious processes like breathing and digestion). The inner adrenal medulla has a direct connection to the brain. Adrenal Medulla Hormones The adrenal glands produce adrenaline (80%) and noradrenaline (20%), more commonly known among the medical establishment as epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones together are known as catecholamines. The medullary hormones are not essential for life, but life without them would be difficult. Without stress, these hormones wouldn't be necessary, but there are varying degrees of stress. The adrenal medulla hormones compensate when we stress our bodies with a simple act like standing up from a reclining or sitting position. Without these hormones, your blood pressure would drop when you stand because gravity causes your blood to pool at the feet and legs. Adrenaline Epinephrine, more commonly called adrenaline, can increase heart rate, contract blood vessels, dilate air passages, and get the nervous system ready for a fight or flight response. Epinephrine acts on almost every part of the body. Noradrenaline Norepinephrine, also known as noradrenaline, works with epinephrine and adds its own stimulus to the brain. Like adrenaline, noradrenaline responds to the fight-or-flight stimulus. Noradrenaline increases our heart rate, triggering the release of glucose from the body's energy stores, and increasing blood flow to our muscles. Noradrenaline also affects the parts of the brain where attention and response actions are carried out. Noradrenaline is also an anti-inflammatory agent for the brain. Adrenal Medulla Disorders When the medulla is in trouble, so is the nervous system. Pathology of the adrenal medulla is primarily caused by neoplasm (tumors) or otherwise poor nervous system functionality, but there are many other issues that can cause too much or not enough of the two hormones. The nervous system will compensate for a lack of adrenal hormones for some time, but healing the thyroid, healing the entire adrenal gland, and if need be, healing the endocrine system as a whole, is the only way to ensure returned health to the adrenal medulla. Adrenal Cortex The adrenal cortex is divided into three zones and produces three main types of steroid hormones. In medical school, one way we learned to remember these three layers is: 'Salt, sugar, sex... the deeper it goes, the sweeter it gets.' Not important, but catchy.\" - Precision Nutrition Zona Glomerulosa & Mineralocorticoids Mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone, which makes up about 96% of the hormones in this mineralocorticoid group) produced in the zona glomerulosa help regulate blood pressure and electrolyte balance. Aldosterone controls water and electrolyte (sodium and potassium) concentration. The mineralocorticoids act upon the kidneys, which under the direction of these hormones excrete sodium or potassium as required to maintain optimal balance. Adrenal adenomas (benign, actively secreting growths in the cortex) cause hyper-production of aldosterone, which may account for as much as 25% of patients with high blood pressure. Zona Fasciculata & Glucocorticoids Cortisol (also called hydrocortisone) makes up 95% of the glucocorticoids hormones produced, but there's also corticosterone and cortisone. What does cortisol do: Depresses the immune system. Anti-inflammatory by reducing immune system response. Retards allergic overreactions, but this may slow wound healing. Promotes the breakdown of protein (catabolism). Promotes the conversion of triglycerides to stored fatty acids. Promotes glucose formation (gluconeogenesis). Promotes resistance to stress which results in higher blood pressure. Two well-known diseases of the adrenals are Addison's disease and Cushing's syndrome. Addison's disease results from acute adrenocortical insufficiency. Cushing's syndrome is caused by excessive adrenal cortical function. John F. Kennedy may be history's most famous Addison's disease patient and required regular cortisone injections to deal with stress. Since one of the side effects of cortisol injections is a \"tanning\" of the skin, JFK looked his best (tanned and relaxed) during times of stress \u2014 immediately after injections.\" - John Barron Full blown Addison's disease is rare, but adrenal fatigue is extremely common. Cushing's syndrome is rare, too. Zona Reticularis & the most well-known androgen. Androgens are masculinizing hormones. In adult males, not many of these hormones are produced in the adrenal gland. Men produce most of their androgens in the testes while women produce their androgens in the adrenal glands. Adrenal Fatigue Many health care professionals estimate that 80% or more American adults suffer from some level of adrenal fatigue. With our addiction to caffeine, nicotine, and other stimulants and our tendency to bathe in Wi-Fi and cellular radiation, it seems likely. Get the diet right. No stimulants like coffee, caffeinated teas, energy drinks, tobacco, etc. In fact, no drugs period. Eat more fresh raw vegetables than anything else, and eliminate refined and processed foods like white rice, HFCS, and even that bag of organic, super healthy, ancient grain, non-GMO quinoa chips. If you didn't make it, don't eat it. Make sure the body is working right in other areas that affect adrenals. The endocrine system as a whole, and especially the thyroid, kidneys, and hypothalamus, must be in decent working order to heal the adrenals all the way. If necessary, kill Candida and balance the gut. (it's likely very necessary if you have adrenal fatigue with our toxic, sugar-laden, antibacterial crazed society, which is often the underlining cause of endocrine disorders). Start grounding regularly, at least 15 minutes a day (more is better). Do some sun gazing while you're at it (but do not look directly at the sun). Get out in nature a little every day or as often as possible (again, more is better). Avoid or compensate for Wi-Fi, cellular, and other EMFs (salt lamps help, grounding probably does, too). Learn to breathe properly by breathing in deeply in a manner that causes your stomach to expand when you breathe in. If your symptoms don't improve quickly, glandular supplementation can help (if you're not vegan) and a few adaptation herbs can help as well. The Pancreas The pancreas produces enzymes for digestion (exocrine) and makes hormones (endocrine). The pancreas makes more exocrine than endocrine. Ninety-eight to ninety-nine percent of the pancreas is used for the digestive juices, but the pancreas also contains scattered groups of neuroendocrine cells called pancreatic islets, or islets of Langerhans. The pancreas is about 12 inches long and tapers to your left. It's located in the upper abdominal cavity, towards the back, in the C curve of the duodenum. Physiology of the endocrine pancreas \u2014 four cell types The islet of Langerhans is comprised of four distinct types of cells, alpha, beta, delta, and gamma. Alpha cells Alpha cells constitute 20% of the islet's cells. They secrete a hormone known as glucagon which is a polypeptide made up of 29 amino acids, which raise blood sugar as needed to maintain normal levels. The pancreas releases glucagon when glucose levels in the blood fall too low. Glucagon causes the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is released into the bloodstream. High blood glucose levels stimulate the release of insulin. Beta cells Beta cells constitute around 80% of islet cells. They produce and secrete insulin, a small protein hormone that regulates how the cells in the body utilize glucose. Seventy-five percent of this glucose is used for brain function, while the rest is used for muscle function, red blood cell production, and fuel for every single cell in the body. Beta cells also produce insulin-like growth factors (specifically, IGF-2), which are available in many body tissues at concentrations that far exceed insulin. IGF -2 shares the molecular structure and shape of insulin and is involved in growth. Delta cells Delta cells, which constitute less than 1% of pancreatic islets, secrete somatostatin, the same growth-hormone-inhibiting hormone secreted by the hypothalamus. This hormone inhibits insulin release and slows the absorption of nutrients from the GI tract. Gamma cells (F cells) Gamma cells also constitute less than 1% of pancreatic islets. They secrete a pancreatic polypeptide to inhibit somatostatin release. Delta cells and Gamma cells regulate each other. Diabetes Mellitus As of 2015, diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. and it's moving up, especially throughout the rest of the world. If stats took into consideration cardiovascular disease (when caused by diabetes) and kidney failure, those numbers could be considerably higher. There are two main types of diabetes. Type I is insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and Type II is non-insulin-dependent diabetes, which used to go by the name \"maturity-onset\" or \"adult-onset diabetes,\" but with our modern diets, it's not just adults over 40 anymore, or even just adults who are diagnosed with Type II. The third type of diabetes, gestational diabetes, is a temporary condition that occurs during pregnancy. Type I and Type II diabetics end up at essentially the same place, though they arrive there in a very different manner. With Type I, the body can't produce enough insulin to drive the sugar into cells where it needs to be used for energy production. With type II the body produces enough insulin (at least in the beginning), but cells become insulin resistant, so sugar stays in the blood. Natural protocol for dealing with diabetes Alternative methods for dealing with both types of diabetes are similar, but there are a few additional needs for anyone with type I due to the fact that it's an autoimmune disease as well as an endocrine disease. Metformin is the first-line medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, generally used to keep blood sugar levels low. Like almost every other pharmaceutical, it's toxic and has a list of side effects. The good news is the following herbs are shown to work just as well, or even better when you consider the lack of side effects: Gymnema sylvestre, also called \"miracle fruit\" (note that this is a common name for two unrelated plants), is an herb native to the tropical forests of southern and central India and Sri Lanka. Studies have shown that this plant can help maintain healthy blood sugar levels. The prickly pear cactus, known as nopal in Mexico, offers many medicinal effects including the ability to lower blood sugar. It has been well documented by many studies, and it's used for treating type-2 Diabetes in Mexico. Other herbal supplementation known to stabilize blood sugar levels: Remember, adrenaline suppresses the release of insulin. Some say to reduce stress, which is always a good idea, but more importantly, handle stress well without losing your temper. Specific Additions for Type I diabetes (insulin dependent) Since Type I diabetes is an autoimmune disease, addressing autoimmune activity makes sense. But, the following nutrition wouldn't be a bad idea for type II diabetes or for almost any autoimmune disease. Immunomodulators The following can balance immune system activity and reduce inflammation. Viruses may be a cause of Type I diabetes (and Lyme, and many other autoimmune diseases). It's not at all the whole story (and our bodies can turn off and on viruses depending on our health and genetics, and incidentally, our genetics change with our health as well). Candida, bacterial infections, other fungi, parasites, and/or viruses are likely to be running havoc on anyone with diabetes. Proteolytic enzymes (aka systemic enzymes) to break down protein. (Better assimilation of proteins, and helps break down virus proteins, too.) Probiotics, because anyone who's eaten enough sugar to get a diabetes diagnosis needs to take a good probiotic for a long time! Coenzyme Q10 may help with blood glucose control, and it's got a massive amount of other benefits, many of which help with diabetic issues. Gonads - Reproductive Organs Although the gonads are part of the endocrine system, their primary purpose is to produce gametes (semen and eggs). The woman's ovaries are located on both sides of the uterus below the opening of the fallopian tubes. They are oval or almond-shaped. The ovaries produce estrogen and progesterone. These two hormones affect many of the female characteristics and reproductive functions. The male's testes are egg-shaped organs that hang in a pouch of skin called the scrotum outside the male body. The testes produce testosterone, which affects many of the male characteristics and sperm production. Women synthesize most of their estrogen in their ovaries and other reproductive tissues. Since men lack this female anatomy, they need to produce estrogen through a process involving an enzyme called aromatase that transforms testosterone into estradiol. In women, testosterone is produced in various locations. One-quarter of the hormone is produced in the ovaries, a quarter is produced in the adrenal glands, and one-half is produced in the peripheral tissues from the various precursors produced in the ovaries and adrenal glands. Testes The testes secrete testosterone, which is necessary for proper physical development in boys. Testosterone maintains libido, muscle strength, and bone density. Disorders result from a lack of testosterone production. Here are the common causes: Defects in the pituitary, hypothalamus, thyroid, and adrenals can affect testosterone production. Medications can affect testosterone production. Testes-based conditions, such as severe injury, radiation, or chemotherapy can all deplete testosterone levels. Besides the case of an injury, if the testicles aren't working there's almost always a problem within the endocrine system. The ovaries are a pair of ova-producing organs (that is, they produce egg cells) that maintain the health of the female reproductive system. The ovaries, like their male counterpart, the testes, are known as gonads. This simply means they are the primary reproductive organs. In addition to their role in producing ova, the ovaries also have the distinction of being an endocrine gland because they secrete hormones\u2014primarily estrogen and progesterone\u2014that are vital to normal reproductive development and fertility. Estrogen (estradiol, specifically) plays a vital role in breast development, fat distribution, and the development of the reproductive organs. Diseases and Disorders of the Ovaries Diseases associated with the ovaries include ovarian cysts, ovarian cancer, menstrual cycle disorders, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and osteoporosis. Menopause is a rapid loss of estrogen production at a certain age, typically around 50; better health can delay it. The ovaries play an immensely important role in the female reproductive system, and in the endocrine system as a whole. The hormones they secrete ensure the proper development of the female body and promote healthy fertility. Natural Remedies for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Avoid AGEs: Women with ovarian cysts have higher levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in their blood. These are cancer-causing compounds formed when glucose binds with proteins, typically caused by high-heat cooking methods with meat and sugars. Just try it for two weeks. Today's wheat is wreaking havoc on our bodies, and many women dealing with ovarian cysts have issues with gluten. Eliminate refined sugars as well, detoxify the gut, and take care of the endocrine system. Supplemental Increasing progesterone in the body, which decreases estrogen, can help as well. You can do this with a progesterone cream applied to the skin, but the following herbal remedies are a better choice than ingesting or absorbing a hormone. Maca root (Lepidium meyenii) helps the body produce progesterone, balances the hormones, and helps balance the endocrine system as a whole. Black Cohosh root (Actaea racemosa): helps regulate the menstrual cycle, and is really good at relieving ovarian pain. Dong Quai root (Angelica sinensis) is a Chinese herb known to aid hormonal balance and, specifically, congestive fertility issues. Dong Quai also supports healthy circulation to the reproductive organs and promotes healthy menstruation cycles. Dong quai should not be consumed by women with fibroids or blood-clotting problems. Wild yam root(Dioscorea villosa) promotes a healthy menstrual cycle and hormonal balance and reduces ovarian pain. Naturally Alleviate Menopause Symptoms Menopause can be both a blessing and a curse. The right diet can usually alleviate symptoms, but the bad news for some women is that when health is restored fully, menopause may be delayed. It may be a choice between hot flashes or periods, but know that PMS symptoms dissipate as well with better health, and so does heavy menstrual bleeding. Black Cohosh(Actaea racemosa, Cimicifuga racemosa) has received considerable scientific attention for its effects on hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms. Red Clover (Trifolium pratense) has been reported to help women with hot flashes. Studies report few side effects and no serious health problems with use. Dong Quai(Angelica sinensis) has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat gynecologic conditions for centeries. Dong quai has blood thinning properties, and should not be consumed by anyone with fibroids or blood-clotting problems. Evening primrose oil or black currant oil provide gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), an essential fatty acid that can influence prostaglandin synthesis and help moderate menopausal symptoms. Ginseng (Panax ginseng or Panax quinquefolius has been shown in research to alleviate some menopausal symptoms, but it has not been found to be helpful for hot flashes. Most women deal with headaches, mood swings, bloating, and other hormonal problems that threaten their relationships, work life, and well-being every month due to PMS. It's not a curse. It's not something women have to live with. Difficult monthly cycles are a sign of poor health. The healthiest women barely notice their cycle, do not feel as though emotions run away with them every month, are exceptionally regular, they do not cramp, and they spot, as opposed to a heavy bleed. Along with a healthy diet, make sure you have the basics covered, including B vitamins (get a complex with extra B6), healthy fats (with DHA and EPA) vitamin D, Vitamin E, Magnesium and exercise, along with lots of fresh, raw, organic produce every day (more vegetables than fruit). And as always, avoid stimulants, soy and refined processed foods. PMS is also a symptom of an unhealthy gut with too much Candida. Cutting out sugar and other foods that feed yeast, and high-quality probiotics taken regularly also work wonders for many women with difficult PMS. Also for cramps, cranberry lemonade with stevia, and Mountain Rose Herb's pregnancy tea works amazingly well. This is also great for detoxifying the liver and kidneys, and alleviating morning sickness. Chasteberry fruit extract (Vitex Agnus-astus) can help balance the hormones released by the pituitary gland that control your overall hormone function. Studies of over 5,000 women have found it effective. Take 100 mg twice a day of a 10:1 extract. Wild yam (Dioscorea villosa) and cramp bark (Viburum opulus) can help regulate cycles and relieve cramps. Dandelion root can help with liver detoxification and also works as a diuretic. Flax seeds contain lignans that balance hormone metabolism and block some negative effects of too much estrogen. The fiber in flax seeds helps too. Black Cohosh(Actaea racemosa, Cimicifuga racemosa) has received considerable scientific attention for its effects on hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms. Red Clover (Trifolium pratense) has isoflavones that improve estrogen detoxification. Dong Quai(Angelica sinensis) is an antispasmodic herb that eases cramps and other symptoms of PMS. It dilates blood vessels to increase flow and helps replenish blood after the period has ended. Some swear by progesterone creams to calm raging PMS. As previously mentioned, increasing progesterone reduces the problems associated with estrogen. Extreme care should be taken with this or similar hormone therapies. Endocrine Abilities of the Liver, Heart, Stomach, and Kidneys The kidneys release erythropoietin and calcitriol. Erythropoietin stimulates the red bone marrow to produce red blood cells (erythrocytes), and calcitriol is a hormone involved in regulating the amount of calcium and phosphate ions found in our blood. The heart produces a peptide hormone called natriuretic peptide (ANP) that's involved with regulating blood pressure and blood volume in our blood vessels. The stomach produces many hormones, including gastrin which is involved in stimulating parietal cells in the stomach to secrete gastric acid (HCl), which increases the acidity (decreases the pH) and gets the digestive system ready to absorb and assimilate nutrition. The liver releases thrombopoietin, which is involved in the production of platelets required for blood clotting. When the endocrine system does not perform well, it can set off a chain reaction that affects all of the body's hormone production, which can affect every gland, every organ, and obviously the entire body. While specific detoxification and healing protocols of these hormone-secreting organs are a bit out of the scope of this article. A holistic protocol that addresses the endocrine system as a whole will address hormonal activities of the heart, liver, stomach, and kidneys, and improve their entire functionality as well. Heal the Endocrine System and Balance Hormones Step By Step As OLM always says, it starts with diet. Supplemental therapies are much more effective with a healthy diet, and for most people, the right diet is all they need. But there are plenty of people who do not have access to healthy foods, and there are many who have such a depleted endocrine system that the body is just plain going to need a lot of help. Eliminate and Flush Out Endocrine Disrupters and Detox the Body Endocrine disruptors (EDs) are chemicals that mimic our own hormones. They bind hormone receptors and disrupt the body's normal hormonal actions. Endocrine disruptors may cause a more powerful response than the natural hormone would have or a diminished response. In some cases, they cause a completely different response than its natural counterpart would have created. EDs are typically measured in parts per trillion, which is indicative of the fact that very small amounts can have a disrupting effect on us. EDs are very stable. They don't break down quickly. This is, in large part, why they are in so many products. They also get stored in our fat cells. They tend to stick around for a long time. How to Avoid Exposure to Endocrine Disruptors Keep your home clean, and vacuum often. Always avoid artificial fragrances Avoid plastic (I know, easier said than done) Avoid touching, breathing the air, or consuming foods or liquids that have come in contact with warm or hot plastics (make sure that a hot car is well ventilated) Avoid canned foods Avoid any and all BPAs and most products that replaced BPAs with other petroleum based products Filter tap water before drinking Get a whole house water filter (we breathe chemicals from tap water when we shower) Avoid chemical cleaning products Avoid conventional personal care products like makeup, shampoos, soaps, moisturizers, etc. Avoid food sprayed with chemicals Avoid BPA paper receipts (some receipts contain 250 to 1,000 times the amount of BPA typically found in a can of food) As usual, eating right makes all the difference. Science is finding that people who eat well, and include copious amounts of various vegetables in their diet, have less concentration of BPAs and other EDs in their body than people exposed to similar levels who do not eat well. Get Your Gut Right A healthy gut expels toxins better than an unhealthy gut. A healthy gut has beneficial bacteria, which science is finding makes a big difference in the amount of EDs we retain. Specifically, there's been some big research on probiotics: In one study, lab rats were exposed to BPA and some of them were later given probiotics. The results found that the amount of BPA excreted through urine and bowel movement was 2.4 times greater in the rats given probiotics, and the percentage of BPA bound to the excrement was significantly greater. This equated to lower BPA concentration levels in the blood for the rats administered probiotics. Eat Right - Always Be Detoxifying Eat a salad every day with lots of raw vegetables and herbs, many of which help moderate estrogen and other hormone levels, and these salads will help flush out chemicals. Drink lots of water, and try cranberry lemonade with stevia to aid the body with detoxification. Avoid and Remove Toxic Heavy Metals Arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, and many more of these kinds of waste from industry have detrimental effects on our endocrine system. We work all day. Our body works all night to regenerate. When we don't get enough sleep, we need adrenalin to make it through the day. This wears out the adrenal glands and eventually disrupts the entire system. Adrenaline, as common as it is, can be toxic to us after some time. Get plenty of quality, deep, regenerative sleep and don't compensate with stimulants. Exercise and Be Active If sleeping well is difficult, exercise is most likely the answer. But that's not all exercise has to offer. Breathing heavily and sweating profusely during an intense exercise program can expel a tremendous amount of toxins. Exercise also resets our hormones, balances our mood, and makes our brain work much better. While most turn to alcohol, television, and drugs during times of stress, this is when we need exercise the most. Here's a tip: next time life gets too stressful, take a squat break. Squats release tons of hormones and will help alleviate stress and cravings for vices. Top 10 Herbs, Vitamins, and Minerals for Better Endocrine Health Before we get into this, know that every vitamin and mineral is important. We tend to be low in some more than others due to the way we live, but taking vitamin D won't make up for not getting enough calcium. For that matter, taking a calcium supplement won't make up for not getting enough calcium either, because we need to get most of our vitamins and minerals from our food. Supplements can supplement our food, but they don't make up for a toxic diet. B vitamins: Always use a complex unless otherwise recommended by a professional. Fatty acids with DHA and EPA: There's a million reasons, but the bottom line is that we need the right fats to create healthy cells. Since cells are what we are made of, healthy cells = healthy body. Magnesium: Like vitamin D, Magnesium is one of those nutrients that we tend to be pretty low in, and the results from fixing the deficiency are usually pretty dramatic. Maca root: Most often taken to improve libido, energy levels, mood, and fertility, maca does not affect the hormones directly, but it has hormone-balancing effects that help alleviate a range of stressors including fatigue, anxiety, stress, depression, and sleep issues. Chasteberry: This herb has been used for thousands of years by women to relieve menstrual problems and it's also used by natural health practitioners to reduce a male's testosterone levels when need be (not recommended for most men of course). Black cohosh: First used by native Americans, and now very popular in Europe, this herb has commonly been used to treat symptoms of menopause, PMS, painful menstruation, acne, weakened bones osteoporosis, and for starting labor in pregnant women. Black cohosh also has many positive benefits for men as well. Saw palmetto: While the previous two are typically used by women, saw palmetto is known as a male supplement, primarily for better prostate health and to balance men's hormones. But it's not just for men, as it's also useful for women with hair loss, acne, menopausal symptoms, and more. It also keeps women from producing too much testosterone but does not seem to impede normal production. Glandulars: Glandulars are desiccated glands, typically derived from pigs, cows, or sheep. They are obviously not for vegans, but if they are an option, glandulars provide the nutrition that the glands need, obviously, since they are made up of that nutrition. Stress You see every professional talking about eliminating stress when you look at articles about balancing hormones. For those who like to cause stress, this is great advice. On the other hand, the idea of eliminating stress for most people is fool hearty. Accidents happen. Children go missing. People get fired. Wars happen. People die. Stress will always be around, ready and waiting to consume us. The trick is in how you handle it. People who are dealing with a lot of stress often attempt to balance their hormones in part by avoiding stress, but the stressful situation that may have helped set off the hormonal imbalance still needs to be dealt with, and chances are, dealing with stressful situations is going to be stressful. Handle stress better. Breathe properly (deeply, like a singer or a martial artist). A well-trained massage therapist can help detoxify the body, and we all know how relaxing a massage can be. Grounding helps open our energy pathways, which has a tremendous effect on our glands. Spend lots of time in nature. Try yoga. Meditate. And don't quickly make big decisions when you are stressed. Conclusion It takes time for the endocrine system to heal; it's rarely a quick process. Since our endocrine system is responsible for our hormones, when our hormones aren't working, we really aren't ourselves. Or at least, we're not our best. Hormones influence us so powerfully that a balanced endocrine system can be the difference between happiness and misery. When our hormones aren't working right, we can't think straight. We make poor decisions. We lash out. We live in fear. We excite too easily. We sleep too much or not nearly enough. Hormone balance is critical! But that's the catch.We tend to self-sabotage when our hormones aren't working properly. Someone who's head isn't working right tends to have a very hard time getting well. It often makes a long road to health even longer. And for those who are overweight, hormonal problems will continue to be an issue until well after that excess weight is lost because of how we store toxins in our fat. Be patient. The good news is that it virtually always takes a heck of a lot less time to get well than it took to get chronically ill. And if you read this far without skipping ahead, then patience is something you obviously have! P.S. The following is a list of supplements that could all be taken together (save the male and female formulas, obviously you'll pick one). Not everyone will need more than a few of these to see significant results. Most importantly, nobody will notice significant results without a healthy diet. It's imperative that the gut is taken into consideration for any holistic approach to healing. Gut health comes first, and ignoring the gut will result in a lot of problems.

Naturally Treat Multiple Sclerosis - Therapies, Diet, Pain Management, Alternative Medicine | One day you stumble when you're walking down the street. The curb seems a bit higher than it used to be. Maybe your first symptom is blurred or double vision. Or perhaps it's the sudden onset of weakness, fatigue, or physical sensations like pins and needles. Multiple sclerosis, commonly referred to as MS, is an autoimmune disease with a range of symptoms. It may present with a sudden onset or its course may be slow or intermittent. Symptoms may appear, disappear, and return years later. There is no specific progression with definite symptoms. Episodes can last for days, weeks, or months and alternate with periods of reduced or no symptoms. Because of the nature of the disease and how it attacks the central nervous system, it can affect many parts of the body, including the bowel, the bladder, or the eyes, and it can interfere with speech and swallowing. Multiple sclerosis affects approximately 70,000 people in the UK and around 400,000 in the United States. The disease is usually diagnosed in young adults. Women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with MS than men. Dysesthesia - burning, aching, or \"girdling\" around the body Trigeminal neuralgia - a stabbing pain in the face that can be brought on by random facial movements, like chewing, yawning, sneezing, etc. Joint Pain - MS does not affect joints directly like rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, or fibromyalgia. However, joint pain, typically in the knees and hips, is very common in people with MS. But this is only a partial list. There are many more symptoms, which is one of the reasons diagnosing multiple sclerosis is difficult. Here are a few more reasons a diagnosis is hard to reach: Many MS symptoms are the same or very similar to symptoms that occur with other diseases. There is no blood test for MS. Symptoms usually come and go, and this cycle can go on for very long periods of time with little progression of the disease. More than 50 symptoms are linked to MS, and each person develops symptoms differently. MS symptoms include fatigue, sexual dysfunction, depression, cognitive difficulties, and other similar symptoms that are typically attributed to stress and often not taken seriously by health car practitioners. Like many other autoimmune diseases, a definitive MS diagnosis may not be reached for years. \"...39% of people with MS wait more than a year for a correct diagnosis, during which time we are often dismissed, accused of malingering, told that we have suffered strokes, or are depressed and anxious.\" - Penny Anderson What is MS? MS is both an autoimmune disease and a chronic neurological disorder. In the case of MS, the immune system attacks the central nervous system - the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerves. MS attacks the fatty myelin sheaths which insulate the nerve axons in the brain and the spinal cord, as well as the nerve fibers themselves, resulting in interference with the transmission of signals along the neuropathways. This leads to the production of hard scars or scleroses (aka plaques or lesions) in the central nervous system. Relapsing - Remitting MS The most common form of MS is relapsing-remitting. Symptoms occur and remain for days or weeks followed by a partial or complete remission that lasts for months or years. Secondary - Progressive MS Secondary - progressive MS involves a steady progression of worsening symptoms, with or without periods of remission. Around 60-70% of those with relapsing - remitting MS develop secondary - progressive MS. Primary - Progressive MS A minority of people with MS (10-20%) fall into the category primary progressive MS with a gradual onset of symptoms that steadily progresses without relapses. Progressive - Relapsing MS Progressive - relapsing MS is the least common type. With this type of MS the neurological decline is steady though there are signs of attacks as well. What Is Known About MS? Little is known about this disease. According to conventional medicine, there is no accepted cause and no known cure. Although MS is thought to affect 2.3 million people worldwide, this number is merely an educated guess due to difficulties faced in the study of the disease and the fact that mandated reporting is not required. However, gender, genetics, age, geography, and ethnic background all suggest possible factors that may influence susceptibility. Although MS is generally diagnosed in adults age 20-50, it is also found in young children and in the elderly. Women are twice as likely to develop MS as men, except in the elderly. Elderly men and women are equally affected. MS is more common in Caucasians of Northern European ancestry, though it does occur in most ethnic groups. Geography is an interesting aspect. The farther away from the equator, the greater the risk of developing MS, which suggests vitamin D deficiency may play an important part in the development of this disease. \"In general, MS is more common in areas farthest from the equator. However, prevalence rates may differ significantly among groups living in the same geographic area regardless of distance from the equator. For example, in spite of the latitude at which they live, MS is almost unheard of in some populations, including the Inuit, Yakutes, Hutterites, Hungarian Romani, Norwegian Lapps, Australian Aborigines and New Zealanders \u2014 indicating that ethnicity and geography interact in some complex way to impact prevalence figures in different parts of the world. Migration from one geographic area to another seems to alter a person's risk of developing MS. Studies indicate that immigrants and their descendants tend to take on the risk level \u2014 either higher or lower \u2014 of the area to which they move. The change in risk, however, may not appear immediately. Those who move in early childhood tend to take on the new risk themselves. For those who move later in life, the change in risk level may not appear until the next generation. While underlining the complex relationship between environmental and genetic factors in determining who develops MS, these studies have also provided support for the opinion that MS is caused by early exposure to some environmental trigger in genetically susceptible individuals.\" - The National Multiple Sclerosis Society Genetics Genetic factors seem to play a big role in determining who develops multiple sclerosis. In the United States the likelihood of a developing MS is a little more than 0.1%. For those with relatives who suffer from MS, the risk increases. For first-degree relatives such as children, siblings, or non-identical twins, the risk rises to approximately 2.5-5%. The identical twin of someone with MS (who shares all the same genes) has a 25% chance of developing the disease. (Note: If genes were solely responsible for this disease, that last statistic would be 100%.) Potential Causes and Contributing Factors of Multiple Sclerosis Like most health conditions, illnesses, or diseases; it appears that many factors combine to produce this disease, rather than one factor alone. People with multiple sclerosis have been found to have a variety of abnormalities in their neurotransmitters, including increased levels of noradrenaline, glutamate, aspartate, glutamine, glycine, and asparagine. There also seems to be a correlation between these imbalances and the severity of their neurological symptoms and progression of the disease. Professionals speculate many different causes for MS, and often a combination of causes including infection (viral, bacterial, parasitic, or fungal), leaky gut, food allergies, and nutrient decencies. Parasites Could Be Behind MS Steven Fry has discovered a previously unknown protozoa in the blood of patients suffering with autoimmune disorders such as lupus, chronic fatigue, multiple sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease, and others. In his research, Dr. Fry found 75 medical papers dating back to the 1880s that discuss finding a malaria-like organism in the blood of those diagnosed with MS. Dr. Fry identified a malaria-like protozoa that may be transmitted by mosquitos or ticks. Dr. Fry is not the only researcher to suggest that multiple sclerosis and other chronic conditions might be caused by a parasitic infection. Lyme Disease or Other Bacterial or Viral Infections May Cause or Contribute to MS It's not uncommon for Lyme disease to be misdiagnosed as MS and for MS to be misdiagnosed as Lyme disease. Some doctors and researchers go so far as to say it's the same thing or that the Lyme bacterium causes MS. Our research didn't come up with credible evidence that any one specific type of bacteria, including Lyme, causes MS over any other major factor, but it does seem likely to be a contributing factor. Treatment should address the probability that anyone suffering from Multiple Sclerosis is dealing with an underlying infection. Considering how weakened the immune system is and how much more prevalent infection is within the body than most doctors realize, it behooves anyone with multiple sclerosis to take the right nutrition to help the immune system fight and kill bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections while keeping gut flora balanced and healthy. Candida, or Other Fungal Infection When Candida and other fungi overtake the body, they release a variety of toxins that result in many of the same symptoms that are listed for MS. Many fungal proteins are similar to certain grains and some proteins within our own body. Many speculate that fungal infections in the body turn on an autoimmune response by overwhelming and confusing the immune system. The theory is that the immune system responds to similar proteins that are not the infection. The immune system may be attempting to fight Candida, but ends up attacking itself in the process. Leaky Gut Our gut flora is only as healthy as our immune system. Anyone with a damaged immune system has a damaged gut. Eventually, when the gut is damaged from poor diet or other factors, it becomes more permeable, or \"leaky.\" Anyone who is dealing with a chronic infection or an autoimmune disease (which is also likely involving a chronic infection) should assume they have a \"leaky\" gut. Where there is systemic Candida, there is a leaky gut. There are many theories on the cause of autoimmune diseases, but we know the immune system is \"tricked\" into attacking healthy tissue. In the case of MS, the immune system seems to consider the myelin sheathing in the central immune system as a foreign invader, an infection, and it tries to get rid of it. A virus may trigger the process in susceptible people (with the right genetics). A parasite, a bacteria, and Candida may do this, too. The body becomes much more sensitive to food, especially food with proteins that are similar to the proteins casing the problem, and these proteins will leak into the bloodstream, undigested, from a leaky gut. Gluten, Celiac Disease Research has indicated strong links between multiple sclerosis and celiac disease. Researchers in Spain analyzed the prevalence of celiac disease in people with confirmed multiple sclerosis and in their first-degree relatives. The researchers included 72 MS patients, 126 of their first-degree relatives, and 123 healthy control subjects. The study found the following: 1% of MS patients had celiac disease compared to 2.4% of control subjects 32% of 1st degree relatives of MS patients had celiac disease If the body's intestinal tract is not healthy, as in, the gut is leaking, then gluten molecules are getting into the bloodstream undigested and causing serious problems in the body. Many studies have shown improvement in MS patients when gluten is eliminated from the diet. This can also be said for eliminating gluten from the diet of those afflicted with many other autoimmune diseases. It all makes sense when you connect the dots with gut flora (and specifically how Candida causes a permeable gut), gluten (and how it can cause and exacerbate a leaky gut), and how our immune system works. Deficiency Many studies have shown that people with multiple sclerosis have lower levels of vitamin D, vitamin B12, vitamin B9, magnesium, vitamin E, and other key nutrients as well (including many more antioxidants). Many professionals also speculate that a lack of healthy fats may play a role. Acidity Many professionals believe that acidity plays a clear role in the disease's onset and progression. The myelin sheath is an electrically insulating phospholipid layer that surrounds the axons of many neurons in the central nervous system. The body is electrical, and the central nervous system runs on electricity. The myelin sheath is kind of like the rubber coating on a power cord that keeps the electricity contained, controlling the body's electrical signals. Hypothyroidism The process of myelination (the process of forming a myelin sheath around a nerve) is dependent on the thyroid hormone. Many have been initially diagnosed with thyroid disorders only to find out that they have MS. Many of the symptoms are the same, and anyone with multiple sclerosis should pretty much count on having a slow thyroid as well. If the central nervous system is not working right, this will disrupt thyroid function. If the thyroid is not working right, this will disrupt the central nervous system. If the immune system is not working correctly, neither will the thyroid or the central nervous system and visa versa. Neck pain, hip pain, and many of the previously mentioned MS symptoms are also symptoms for serious thyroid problems. Oral Infection Dr. Hal Huggins, a Colorado dentist, has treated thousands of people with multiple sclerosis with a cure rate of approximately 85% by safely removing mercury fillings and properly treating infections. Cavitations are infections of the jawbone caused by lingering or perpetual infections of anaerobic bacteria from root canals and incomplete or incorrectly performed extractions and fillings. These ongoing infections have been linked to multiple health issues including heart disease, breast cancer, and MS. Mercury and Other Heavy Metals Mercury is not only highly neurophilic (meaning it is attracted to and binds tightly to nerve tissue) and highly lipophilic (attracted to and binds tightly to nerve tissue), which is bad news for the nervous system. Mercury is attracted to the neurons themselves, as well as the fats that make up the myelin sheaths. Mercury exposure can come from many different sources including seafood, food grown in toxic soil (food from China and many parts of the U.S.), and dental mercury amalgams. Other Heavy Metals It is believed by many experts that autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, lupus, and Alzheimer's may be due at least in part to toxic metals such as mercury, aluminum, and lead. Heavy metal toxins cross the blood/brain barrier, resulting in a wide variety of symptoms including all of the symptoms mentioned for MS. Heavy metals produce free radicals and damage the myelin sheaths (remember, the body is electric), and disrupts the CMS signals, degrading the body's nervous system, disrupting the body's ability to communicate with itself. The immune system recognizes myelin sheath tissue damaged by the free radicals as foreign proteins, which results in an autoimmune process. Anyone with multiple sclerosis would do well to consider heavy metal toxicity as one of the primary contributors. Vaccines Vaccines contribute to heavy metal toxicity and more. Vaccines include aluminum, mercury, formaldehyde, GMOs, and many other toxic substances that are directly injected into the bloodstream or inhaled. There has been considerable suspicion about a link between hepatitis B vaccination and the development of multiple sclerosis. A recent study examined data regarding a mass vaccination in the mid 90s. Twenty million French adults were vaccinated between 1994 and 1997 thanks to the World Health Organization's recommendation in 1992 to mass vaccinate for hepatitis B to eradicate the virus. The result was a sudden increase in multiple sclerosis. In 1998, the French media exposed the phenomenon (apparently the media is not controlled by Big Pharma over there). Vaccination numbers fell. A firm link between the rise in vaccinations and a corresponding rise in the number of MS cases was established. Environmental Toxins Any toxic load amplifies free radicals, and free radicals are linked to MS. Limiting toxic exposure is imperative for those suffering from an autoimmune disease. Studies have shown that exposure to organic solvents or other toxic chemicals increases the risk of developing MS. It's well known that those who live or work within toxic environments are much more likely to develop autoimmune diseases. Some get so sick that the mere smell of mattresses, books, car interiors, particle board furniture, and other everyday items are simply too toxic and overwhelming for the body. Therapies, Herbs, Vitamins, Minerals, and Other Nutrients for Multiple Sclerosis Sick people have an imbalance of vitamins, minerals, fats, and PH, along with an abundance of toxins. The modern lifestyle most of us live causes these imbalances, but also, once the person is sick, the disease exacerbates the imbalances. A sick body uses lot of nutrition and maintains acidity, toxicity, and other imbalances. In other words, even if you always got plenty of a certain nutrient growing up and well into the onset of MS, you may still benefit from said nutrient. Vitamin D Study after study shows that when people are chronically ill they are or were vitamin D deficient. Vitamin D is a hormone produced when we get sunlight. We can also get vitamin D from foods like fatty fish, mushrooms, beef liver, cheese, and egg yolks. Vitamin D is stored in fat and released as needed, but this does not work right for particularly toxic people or overweight people. On top of this, most of us in the modern world do not get nearly enough vitamin D in the summer regardless of our ability to store it, and most of us do not get enough in our diet to make up for our lack of outdoor life. People with MS or any other autoimmune disease will likely feel an immediate improvement by supplementing with a low to medium dose of vitamin D. Very high doses of vitamin D for long periods of time can be problematic. Omega-3 Fatty Acids Many studies have shown those with MS and other autoimmune diseases respond well to healthy fats. You can find many studies specifically on just omega 3s or DHA or linoleic acid or coconut oil, etc. for autoimmune disease treatments, but the key to getting well is to get a wide range of beneficial fats. Different fats play different roles in our health. Antioxidants Studies have shown that those with MS need more antioxidants. Selenium, vitamin C, vitamin E, Lipoic acid, N-acetylcysteine, and lycopene supplementation have all shown positive results in studies for those with MS. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant and it's essential to healthy mitochondrial function and energy production. A lack of CoQ10 is associated with many disease states including heart disease, hypothyroidism, cancer, and many neurodegenerative diseases. Several clinical trials with CoQ10 have yielded positive results for those who suffer from neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Alzheimer's. CoQ10 can also regenerate the antioxidant capacity of vitamin E in the body. Vitamin B12 Those who have MS have low levels of vitamin B12 in their cerebrospinal fluid, blood serum, or both. A vitamin B12 deficiency is often mistaken as MS. Studies have shown patients with MS given vitamin B12 supplements have experienced clinical improvements with symptoms. Those with MS are also likely to be low in other B vitamins, and should consider a B vitamin complex with extra B12. Taking just one B vitamin for long periods causes problems. Magnesium Magnesium is essential for a wide variety of functions. Some research indicates that magnesium deficiencies may be associated with some of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis and a number of other chronic and progressive ailments. Ginkgo Biloba It is believed that Ginkgo biloba improves blood flow and can influence neural activity and improve cognitive performance. Ginkgo leaf has shown in studies to improve brain function for those with Lyme disease, depression, dementia, and many more diseases including MS. Curcumin (Turmeric) Curcumin, an active component of turmeric, is anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic and is a powerful antioxidant that boosts the immune system and much more. Curcumin has powerful anti-inflammatory effects. Countless resent research with many different health issues has shown that curcumin can significantly reduce symptom severity and in some cases reverse disease. From studies on cancer to lupus to fibromyalgia to MS, studies have shown that turmeric spice should be a staple in everyone's pantry. Ginger Ginger is a powerful herb that reduces pain, inflammation, and nausea. Ginger has a warming effect as it stimulates blood circulation. It boosts the immune system, inhibits the common cold, Salmonella, stomach ulcers, and gastrointestinal discomfort. Ginger can help reduce many symptoms of MS, and it also plays a substantial role in guarding against brain oxidative stress and neurological degeneration. Cinnamon Cinnamon is another amazing herb that should be in everyone's kitchen. Researchers are just starting to get excited about cinnamon, and more and more research is being done. In regards to MS there's limited research, but one study with mice was very interesting. True cinnamon (Cinnamonum verum) powder was fed to mice with the animal equivalent of multiple sclerosis. The cinnamon altered the abnormal immune response we see in those with MS. The spice preserved regulatory T cells, inhibited damaging immune cells known as Th17), and blocked inflammatory cells from invading the spinal cord. Cinnamon also promotes remyelination of damaged myelin. Mice had an overall significant reduction of symptoms. Echinacea For MS patients, Echinacea research generally supports the plant's ability to promote immune cell health and its anti-inflammatory potential for the central nervous system. Chelation Therapy Chelation (pronounced key-LAY-shun) therapy is a treatment for removing heavy metals from the blood. With conventional medicine, chelation therapy involves injections of a chelating agent called ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) into the bloodstream. EDTA binds to heavy metals and minerals in the blood, which are then excreted in the urine. Side effects can include nausea, vomiting, pain around the injection site, headache, hypotension, and hypoglycemia as well as serious and potentially fatal effects including hypocalcemia (a drop in calcium levels so low it can affect the heart and brain), damage to the kidneys that may result in kidney failure and the need for a transplant or lifelong dependency on dialysis, and bone marrow depression. Alternative medicine uses supplements and foods to chelate heavy metals from the body. In fact, a proper diet with a wide range of produce and herbs constantly removes heavy metals from the whole body without disrupting its mineral balance. Garlic, cilantro, amino acids, onions, activated charcoal, and chlorella are excellent at removing heavy metals. Marijuana Many report relief from pain and muscle spasms from marijuana, but ingesting or smoking marijuana is hard on the thyroid and the entire endocrine system as well as the immune system. Frequent use of marijuana may accelerate MS. Other Therapies That May Improve MS Symptoms Oxygen therapy, acupuncture, magnets, chiropractic, essential oils, various message therapies like reflexology, pressure point messaging, and other treatment modalities have been shown to slow progression of MS. These treatments do not focus on the root cause of MS, but they can help accelerate healing and potentially help reverse the disease when a proper diet is followed. How to Treat Multiple Sclerosis Naturally - Step by Step Protocol When people are sick they tend to look for the easiest solution - the absolute minimum they can do to feel better. Never really healing all the way, they find themselves chasing health, believing it to be elusive, an impossible condition to attain or maintain. When someone is so sick that they have multiple sclerosis, a complete, holistic, and long-term approach is critical. Some treatments may improve symptoms in the short run, but to truly get better and to ensure that the body does not relapse, a new lifestyle needs to be adapted. Daily Journal It's easy to forget how sick we were. This tendency to minimize can seriously impede getting well and accepting what needs to be done in order to stay well. Keep a journal. Write down what you ate and how you felt with specific symptoms and severity. This will have many benefits, including the ability to identify trigger foods without relying on memory, and a better understanding of how your body responds to foods and new activities. It also makes it much harder to forget how damaging one night of drinking, or one cheeseburger can be when you're trying to repair the body. Diet A healthy diet is a diet consisting exclusively of a wide variety of produce and other whole foods. Ingredients should be bought separately in most cases, and as unadulterated as possible. A full 80% of the diet would be raw produce, with more vegetables than fruit. Put your juicer to good use daily but sweet juices (most of the fruits, carrots, and beets) should be restricted or eliminated due to their high sugar content until the gut flora is balanced and the gut lining is healed. Include ginger, turmeric, and cinnamon in your foods, and check out this golden milk tea recipe. Eat salads, like this one, with lots of garlic and other foods that balance the gut and chelate heavy metals every day. The Intestinal Tract Anyone suffering from a disease of this magnitude has an impaired digestive tract. Fixing the immune system means fixing the gut. The immune system is only as healthy as the gut, and a damaged gut overworks the immune system. Your body will continue to be inundated with infectious flora and undigested protein molecules, which the immune system perceives as foreign proteins, foreign invaders it must attack, as long as the intestinal tract is damaged. No one can properly digest gluten, MSG, refined sugars, chemical additives, GMOs, or other toxic ingredients when the gut is damaged. The sicker one is, the sicker one's gut is. The sicker one's gut is, the greater the negative effect of toxic foods and other poor lifestyle habits. Candida In our toxic, antibacterial, chemically laden world, fungi is able to flourish in our guts. Candida, in particular, is an incredibly resilient and opportunistic creature that resides in anybody's body in abundance when they suffer from MS. Testing for an overabundance of Candida does not yield accurate results unless the person is at the time of the blood test so overwhelmed with Candida that it shows up in the blood work. Anyone who has too much Candida, and consequently has Candida infecting his or her body (which can happen the same way viruses, bacteria, and parasites can infect anywhere in the body), has moments when the blood is overrun with Candida, but this is not the typical norm. If you're sick enough to have MS, or any other autoimmune disease, assume you are dealing with an overgrowth of Candida and other fungi. Undecylenic acid (SF722) is very good at killing Candida and other fungal infections. Wormwood is one of the best for killing parasites, and probiotics should be utilized as well to ensure the non-beneficial flora gets replaced by the good guys. Addressing Imbalances Many of the vitamins and minerals needed for optimum health are hard to come by in food alone thanks to our current farming practices. Whenever possible, buy whole organic produce grown by small farmers who take organic standards, nutrition, environmental issues, and food quality very seriously. If the budget is tight, before spending money on a slew of vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, etc., get your diet right and get your gut flora balanced. Then consider what vitamins, minerals, fats, etc. you need. Supplements that address the immune system are a good idea considering the chance of an underlying infection. But don't forget, even if it is an infection causing all these problems, an infection is still a symptom. Heal the immune system with the right diet, and then supplement that foundation with herbs that help the immune system. Echinacea, oil of oregano, and vitamin C will go a long way to boosting the immune system, and providing other benefits as well. In fact, oil of oregano and vitamin C are also powerful antioxidants, which is something anyone with MS needs a lot of. Heavy metal chelation without injections can be done with supplements including food grade charcoal, food grade clays, and concentrated foods with chelation properties. I am yet to meet anyone with MS who wasn't vaccinated or who doesn't have a history of oral infections with metal fillings. (Usually both). Conclusion If you think you may have MS, or if you know you have it, it's time to be strict. If you want to get well, to actually be well, or to at the very least, radically slow the progression of the disease, you need to completely eliminate toxic foods from your diet for a very long time. This includes gluten, sugar, high fructose corn syrup, soy, artificial sweeteners, MSG, GMOs, any chemicals that don't belong in food, and alcohol. It's also time to do a lot more reading. See the further reading list below and read all of the articles. Find out everything you can, not just about MS, but about how the body works. Keep refining and perfecting a holistic approach, not a here-and-there approach. If money is very tight, skip supplements and put every extra penny you have towards the healthiest, freshest food you can find. Most of all, don't accept conventional medicine's sentence. You do have a choice. You can choose to heal your body. Insomnia - A Comprehensive Look with Natural Remedies | I must have counted millions of sheep back when I regularly suffered from insomnia. I would lie in bed staring at the ceiling, or worse, staring at the clock. Minutes passed. Hours passed. I'd count the hours until I had to get up. Six hours. Five hours. Four. Regardless of how tired-how utterly exhausted my body and mind felt- I could not sleep. Insomnia can be both debilitating and dangerous. According to The National Highway Safety Administration, 100,000 or more auto crashes each year are due to fatigue, with a resultant 1,550 deaths and 71,000 injuries. Some studies have shown that driving while exhausted can be even more dangerous than driving under the influence of alcohol. When you have insomnia, you're never really asleep... and you're never really awake. - Fight Club A chronic lack of sleep not only affects your work, your relationships, and your enjoyment of life, it also wreaks havoc with your hormonal system, your immune system, and your body's ability to heal in every way (we regenerate while we sleep). You don't need to resort to pharmaceuticals with dangerous side effects and residual fatigue upon waking. Use these natural remedies to reset your sleep cycle and end insomnia. Let's cut to the chase before we get into everything else.For most people, camping is simply the best cure for insomnia. If you can get away for a few days, bring lots of organic produce and other healthy foods, forage if you know how, and go sleep outside! Leave your electronic devices at home. Leave your phone in the car. Take some time to meditate. Write. Do some yoga. Most importantly, sleep on the ground - not in a camper, your car, or a cabin. Get grounded. Reset. Your goal is to de-stress, to take a break from distractions and the EFTs, to avoid artificial light, and to use natural light and magnetic fields to re-set your circadian rhythms. By the third day, almost anyone will be falling asleep shortly after nightfall, as nature intended. Camping and proper diet will work for most people's insomnia, but for many people, camping is not an option right now. And for some, the need for significant dietary and lifestyle changes may need to happen before the benefits of camping. The Different Kinds of Insomnia There is onset insomnia, which is trouble falling asleep, and there is maintenance insomnia, which is waking from sleep prematurely and not being able to go back to sleep (marijuana and alcohol). Onset insomnia is often caused by anxiety, depression, pain, sleep-shift disorder, and an active mind. Some studies have shown that very intelligent people often have a very hard time going to sleep, not so much because they can't, but because they choose not to. After time, this can disturb the body's sleep rhythm causing insomnia. When they try to get to sleep earlier, regardless of how tired they are, their bodies don't cooperate. Imagine how much easier it was to go to sleep at the most opportune time before technology, before artificial light, even before candlelight. Camping is an obvious choice for those who just need to reset their biological rhythms and find some peace. Depression, anxiety, and other altered mental states can cause insomnia by working the overactive mind that doesn't want to go to sleep, but these conditions can be connected to health issues. When someone regularly gets depressed their brain is not working right, and this can typically be traced back to vitamin and mineral deficiencies and toxicity in the body. Short-term Insomnia and Chronic Insomnia Short term maintenance insomnia could be a result of drug use, chemical exposure, allergies, and sleep shift disorder. Short term onset insomnia is typically due to stress. Chronic onset insomnia can be caused by a wide variety of factors from poor health to an overactive imagination to high intelligence. Chronic maintenance insomnia is a sign that one's health is seriously flawed. Causes for Insomnia Marijuana - While marijuana can cure insomnia, chronic use of marijuana can lead to chronic maintenance sleep insomnia, and it can lead to onset insomnia when the person quits using it. Allergies - A runny nose; itchy, watering eyes; painful sinuses; and itchy rashes are not conducive to sleep. Diet - Poor diet equals poor health, and anything can go wrong. Toxicity - Chemical toxicity and heavy metal toxicity interferes with the neurological system, the endocrine system, the immune system and every function of the body. Medications - Pharmaceuticals are toxic, which is why all of them have side effects. Gastrointestinal problems - Candida overgrowth, leaky gut, bacterial and parasitic infections, and autoimmune disease lead to insomnia and originate with poor diet. Asthma - It is very difficult to sleep when breathing is impaired by bronchiospasms and mucous. Neurological conditions - Multiple Sclerosis, Restless Leg Syndrome, Parkinson's disease, etc. Chronic pain - Lower back pain, headaches, arthritis, migraines, injuries, etc. Coffee - Other stimulants including nicotine, teas, energy drinks, and drugs. Hormones - Thyroid, adrenal system, endocrine system (see gut health). Brain Health - If the endocrine system (see above) is unwell, or blood is toxic, so is the brain. Vitamin B deficiency - Almost anyone with any mental or emotional issues from schizophrenia to depression has a vitamin B deficiency. Depression - See brain health. Sleep Shift Disorder - When the circadian rhythm is disrupted, hormones that aid in sleep are not released at the appropriate time. Natural Remedies for Insomnia There are many more well-known causes of insomnia than we can go over here, and the same is true for solutions. From meditation to warm milk, everyone has their solution to prevent a sleepless night. Most will also admit, if probed, that their solution doesn't always work that well. If camping is impossible, prolonged exposure to early morning light and regular contact with the earth (try grounding for 15 minutes a day) will reset your biological clock. Spend two hours in the early morning sun for one or two days. Set your alarm if necessary, and go back to sleep outside (on the deck or in the yard). Eliminate stimulants from your diet. Coffee, tea, chocolate, soft drinks, energy drinks... If you won't give these up, be sure to limit them to the early hours of the day. For those who are too stressed out to sleep due to anxiety, consider stress management. Chronic anxiety should also be addressed as a physical health issue and addressed with nutrition. Don't underestimate exercise, which has been proven in multiple studies to beat many prescription drugs in studies involving anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Studies also support the importance of getting out into nature. Take a walk in the woods, breathe the cleaner air, and just feel connected with nature. It's also a good time to get grounded. Earthing, absorbing the energy, the electrical fields that we have been connected to for most of our existence, can improve health in a multitude of ways. The aforementioned we should all be doing regularly regardless of how well we sleep. But, the best way to put an end to insomnia is to address the cause, or in most cases, the causes. While typically one of most common multiple causes of insomnia is a result of EMF exposure and not coming into contact with earth regularly, but there are many other common factors at play as well. Thyroid and adrenal fatigue can lead to insomnia and poor quality sleep, so address those glands, and the whole endocrine system, if needed. B vitamins are essential to the nervous system and deficiencies can result in disruption of sleep cycles. Take a high-quality B complex vitamin each day. If you do not get daily exposure to sunlight or you live north of Atlanta, Georgia or Los Angeles, California, supplement with vitamin D. A lack of healthy fats can also impair hormone production and proper vitamin B and D assimilation. The only problem with getting healthier to get better sleep is that health doesn't happen overnight, especially when said night is not restful, and it's pretty hard to make good choices and take care of yourself when you're chronically exhausted. Fortunately, there are plenty of herbal approaches that have been shown to put most to sleep without the side effects of pharmaceuticals. Herbal Remedies and Supplements for Insomnia To fix the biological clock long term, diet is key. B vitamins, thyroid health, and exercise are paramount, but the right combination of the following herbal remedies will knock almost anyone out at least for the first few nights they're used, without the pharmaceutical side effects. Tryptophan Our bodies require tryptophan, an amino acid, to make serotonin and melatonin. It can help you fall asleep and improve your quality of sleep by lengthening the time you spend in deep sleep. In addition, studies have shown an increase in alertness upon waking. Tryptophan is plentiful in many different foods including tart cherries, spirulina, soy, many different kinds of meat, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, eggs, oats, lentils, and much more. The problem is that eating foods with tryptophan has been shown to not increase the tryptophan levels in the blood. Supplementation works better, but the need for tryptophan shows a need to address the endocrine system and balance the body's hormones. 5 HTP (hydroxytryptophan) 5 HTP is produced in the body from tryptophan. You won't get 5 HTP directly from your diet. The 5 HTP used in supplements is obtained from the seeds of Griffonia simplicifolia, a plant native to Africa. 5 HTP is a direct precursor of serotonin and it's an intermediate for synthesis of melatonin. Valerian Root Valerian root aids in sleep onset as well as the quality of sleep. The best results are found when combining valerian root with melatonin or hops. Take 400-500 mg at Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland and may be also synthesized in the gastrointestinal tract from L-tryptophan. There are those who cannot convert tryptophan into melatonin as well, which is likely the reason why many find melatonin works better than tryptophan. For some, melatonin can help with the length of sleep or the quality of sleep, but many say it helps with sleep onset, but they find themselves waking after four or five hours. Side effects may include strange dreams, nightmares, and daytime drowsiness. Dosage ranges from 1-10 mg. Hops extract is another sleep aid that helps one get to sleep and improves sleep quality. It works well with valerian extract and the combination may help increase alpha brain waves. Black Cohosh Black cohosh minimizes sleep disturbances which is great for relief from maintenance insomnia, and it also reduces irritability and mood swings. Passionflower Passionflower clears anxiety and restores the body to a more peaceful state. Ashwagandha Ashwagandha is known as an adaptogen that blocks stress messages in the body, promoting relaxation and peacefulness. Chamomile flower Chamomile flower and leaf soothes anxiety and has sedative properties. Check out Organic Solutions Cal-Calm Tea, with chamomile, red clover, and raspberry leaf. Skullcap Skullcap promotes calmness and increases the body's ability to adapt to stress. It also acts as a sedative for aches and pain. Marijuana for Insomnia Cannabis works so well to put people to sleep that is truly a miracle drug/plant for many. Unfortunately, it's not without its problems. Smoking anything is toxic to the body. Vaporizing is too, but with the right equipment, \"vaping\" can be much less toxic (the industry is new, and there are lots of toxic vaporizing products out there, so be careful). THC has both positive and negative side effects on the body. Using marijuana is very hard on the thyroid, the pineal gland, the prostate, and probably the entire endocrine system (the endocrine system regulates our hormones and much more). Marijuana acts a lot like alcohol and other drugs to the body with sleep quality. The sleep isn't deep enough and sleep is often interrupted. Many also find that marijuana use makes them more tired, groggy, and sometimes irritable during the day. On the other hand, it really does work amazingly well to put someone to sleep. Used sparingly, combined with the right diet, exercise, and a few supplements will result in fewer side effects than simply smoking oneself to sleep. This is a very smart approach for anyone who is suffering from chronic pain, and need the powerful effects of marijuana to sleep while trying to repair the body and get well. Having a family with a small child and having a business I love makes insomnia much less common. I don't get nearly enough sleep, but it's typically by choice. It's hard for me to stop working at night when everyone else is finally quiet and letting me work undisturbed. Growing up, I suffered from severe insomnia and depression. It was more of a health issue. Today, if insomnia does grip me, it's usually because I've been staying up working too late for too long and I need to push back my sleep schedule. When I was younger, I used this protocol to reset my sleep rhythms and improve my sleep quality, and to ensure that I slept for as long as I needed for optimum health and woke up feeling alert and refreshed. Anytime I need to get to sleep on time, no matter what, I make sure I exercised that day. I also stay active throughout the day, too. I like naps, but of course, I skip them if I am having trouble sleeping at night. When I am adjusting my internal sleep clock from weeks or months of going to bed too late, I always make sure to wake up at the same time every morning, and I stay up, regardless of when I went to bed. Make sure your bedtime allows for enough sleep, regardless of when you fall asleep, and get up at the same time every morning no matter what. I also get grounded and take that time to do some peaceful meditation in the mornings and before bed. I make sure I get sunlight during the day, and I take vitamin D and B vitamins. Before going to sleep, all the lights should be turned off or covered (those little blue, red, flashing lights on electronics inhibit proper sleep rhythms). Absolute darkness aids in melatonin production. If thoughts are swirling in my mind, I write them down. A bedside journal can be a great sleep aid. L-Tryptophan or melatonin, Shillington's Nerve Sedative Formula, and some B vitamins will knock me out within a half an hour every time. I like L-Tryptophan better than a melatonin supplement because it increases production of melatonin and serotonin, and I know my gut is healthy enough to convert it as it should. I have also had very good results with using both. 30 mins Before Bed I take 1,000 to 3,000 mgs (some need 3k but many people only need 1k) of L-Tryptophan When I lay down to go to sleep, I make sure I am breathing properly (see How to Breathe) and I do math in my head. If the math problems are big or complex (or both), it's something I can focus on without drifting into thoughts that are more likely to keep me up, and it will eventually put me to sleep. I also like to make up a dream for myself, roleplay it out in my head, and imagine it is a dream. I try to feel it like a dream, which is not easy to explain, but it also works well for me. A \"part\" is a measurement by volume. Blend all ingredients together and make into a tincture using a 50 - 50 blend of alcohol and distilled water. For more, see How to Make a Tincture. A dropperfull is considered to be about 1/2 way up the dropper from a two-ounce bottle. Be sure to shake well before each use. Other Steps You Can Take Eliminating EMFs can help keep your sleep schedule consistent and rejuvenating. Try pulling mattresses away from outlets and keep electronic devices at a distance, or better yet, out of the bedroom. A humidifier can help some people with dry sinuses, allergies, and those who snore. Sleep on nontoxic bedding with nontoxic pillows, sheets, and blankets. This is a big deal! As previously mentioned, there are multiple causes for any one case of insomnia. One of those causes, and in fact, one of the causes for overall poor health and diseases is toxicity. Conventional mattresses are very toxic. Laying on them and breathing in the offgasses all night makes for a very toxic toll on the body. Fortunately, our bodies can take a very high toxic load without much complaint if the diet is healthy. Unfortunately, for those who suffer from autoimmune diseases and other health issues, a toxic mattress may inhibit them from restoring their body to optimum health and getting enough sleep even when their diet is improved for a consistent period of time. Conclusion For those who just need to reset their sleep rhythms, once you get your biological clock reset, your new sleep habits will require discipline, but you will reap the benefits of healthy, restful sleep. The trick to having a set sleep schedule (besides health) is all in the wakeup time. If 7 a.m. is when you want to wake up, then that's when you wake up, no matter what, for the next 6 weeks. This includes your days off work and the morning after staying up late on purpose. If you suffer from chronic insomnia, be it onset, maintenance, or both, your hormones are off, your health is not well, and your gut flora is unbalanced. The thyroid, the adrenal glands, and the entire endocrine system will need to be healed, and to do that, you'll need to fix the digestive system. The following articles will help you address these conditions. Let us know the tricks and tips you have to get to sleep easily. If none of these tips work for you, the least you can do is spend your time wisely. You can always develop a case of multiple personality disorder and spend your nights setting up a band of violent misfits to topple our banking system via high-powered cheap explosives. (Yes, I saw Fight Club too many times.) Lyme Disease - Holistic Protocol to Completely Rebuild the Immune System | Lyme disease is no longer an obscure malady that can only be caught in Connecticut. In 2013, the year with the latest available data, the CDC predicted an estimated 300,000 actual new cases, though only 30,000 per year were reported and confirmed. Cases have been diagnosed in all 50 states, but as of 2013, 95% of the confirmed cases came from the following states: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Lyme disease is an infection from the Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium. It is not known to be a contagious disease spread from person to person. Its only known transmission is through the bite of an infected tick. (Though there is now argument that other insects, including mosquitoes and fleas, may also be carriers, and that it may be sexually transmitted). Although symptoms can and do vary, the majority of cases adhere to the following pattern: Phase One - 3 to 30 Days Also called early localized infection 70-75% develop a rash. A characteristic bull's eye rash develops, starting at the site of the tick bite. It is not itchy or painful but may be warm to the touch. Many infectious disease specialists believe that \"chronic Lyme disease\" does not exist, and that Lyme disease from a tick bite can be cured with a short course of antibiotics. It is possible that those who have undergone antibiotic treatments are suffering from the side effects of antibiotics, but more and more experts are coming around to the idea that Lyme disease can survive and cause long-term autoimmune symptoms when antibiotics don't work. We all know (or at least, we all should know) that antibiotics do not always work and can cause more problems. Facial paralysis may also occur in this stage or stage two. History of Lyme Disease In the 1960s and 1970s, something was very wrong in Connecticut. In a population of 12,000 living in three contiguous towns: Old Lyme, Lyme, and East Haddam, 39 children were diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and 12 adults were diagnosed with arthritis of unknown cause. In 1975, frustrated by the lack of answers from their medical community, two mothers became patient advocates, gathering information from residents that they passed on to the Connecticut State Department of Health and the Yale School of Medicine. Researchers were able to identify the disease and recognize its symptoms, but it wasn't until the early 80s that the actual cause was discovered. Willy Burgdorfer, a scientist who was studying Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, discovered the tick connection along with the bacterium, a spirochete, that caused Lyme. The bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, was named after him. The Lyme Controversy A quick review of current articles about Lyme reveals a great deal of frustration on the part of both patients and doctors battling the disease. First of all, there are serious problems with diagnostics. Since 25-30% of patients who have been infected with Lyme do not exhibit a rash - the first and most specific symptom is missing. Of those who present with a rash, many do not exhibit the characteristic bull's eye rash. Blood tests to identify the bacteria produce both false negatives and false positives. Therefore an initial, correct diagnosis may be hard to come by. Lyme disease also imitates other diseases and is therefore regularly misdiagnosed as MS, fibromyalgia, arthritis, ALS, and other illnesses. There are multiple tests for Lyme. The CDC recommends screening with the ELISA test and confirming with the Western blot test, but during the first 4-6 weeks of infection these tests are unreliable because they measure the patient's antibody response to the infection, not the bacteria itself. Lyme disease is notoriously difficult to diagnose using conventional tests. And there's great variation in the presentation of the disease as well, depending on where you contracted it, and whether or not you have any other coexisting infections. There is a group of seven or eight microbes that are the most common. The worst ones are Babesia microti and the different forms of Bartonella. It is said that an initial course of antibiotics given in stage one cures the disease most of the time, but why not all the time? Is the course of antibiotics too short? Should more be given? Should they be given long term, especially for those who have stage 3 symptoms? What if blood tests no longer show spirochetes? If the antibiotics don't work, the patient now has to combat Lyme with a very depleted immune system.\" - Dr. Dietrich Klinghardt, MD, PhD Why Antibiotics May Not Work for Lyme Disease Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, has a corkscrew shape that allows it to bore deep into tissues and cartilage (including the brain and nervous system), safely out of reach of most antibiotics. Borrelia burgdorferi can give up its corkscrew shape and convert to a form that is able to live inside cells (\"intracellular\") where again, antibiotics have less reach. Borrelia burgdorferi, along with other similar microbes, can form dormant cysts that are completely resistant to antibiotics; the harder you hit it, the more resistant it becomes. Borrelia burgdorferi is usually accompanied and aided by co-infections of other stealth microbes that also live inside cells. Antibiotic resistance occurs at a high rate with these types of microbes. An antibiotic is one single chemical substance. Bacteria, such as Borrelia (and also its co-infections), respond slowly to antibiotics and have more time to develop resistance to the antibiotic. In other words, the longer they can hang on, the more likely they are to become completely antibiotic resistant. Using multiple antibiotics at once seems to accelerate this process and alternating antibiotics doesn't seem to help. Resistant bacteria become even more entrenched. Antibiotics destroy the normal flora (friendly bacteria) in the gut and skin, causing bacterial imbalance and a host of other symptoms in the body. Most importantly, use of antibiotics suppresses immune function, which may present the greatest hurdle to recovery\u2014you cannot get well without optimal immune function. Borrelia burgdorferi can exist in biofilms, which are protected colonies of microbes that form on a surface (such as plaque on your teeth), but what role this plays in Lyme disease is controversial. The symptom profile of Lyme disease suggests that it is not a biofilm disease and that biofilms are not a big factor in overcoming Lyme. Doctors Treating Lyme Disease ...he is treating the patient, not the disease. Some doctors complain that patients who have never been definitively diagnosed with the disease demand treatment for chronic Lyme disease. Other doctors contend that it is rare for a patient with Lyme disease to only suffer from one singular infection as ticks often carry and can infect us with several pathogens at once. In addition, there is not one \"Lyme Disease.\" There are five sub species of Borrelia burgdorferi. Of these subspecies, there are more than 100 strains in the U.S. and 300 worldwide. And many of them are now antibiotic resistant. Even the worst infections may not test positive for Borrelia burdorferi. They may not test positive until initial treatment has occurred, a situation called the Lyme Paradox. Dr. Richard Horowitz, of Hyde Park, New York, is one of the most sought after Lyme specialists. He states that at least half of his patients are infected with babesiosis. Rather than a bacteria, babesiosis is a microscopic parasite that infects red blood cells. Since most of his patients present with multiple infections and an overwhelmed immune system, he focuses on strengthening the immune system, knowing that he is treating the patient, not the disease. Patients who are not lucky enough to see a doctor as knowledgeable as Dr. Horowitz often get caught in the crossfire that occurs when doctors are faced with limited understanding of a pathogen, a complicated infectious process, and a treatment modality that does not work the same for every patient. Stories abound of doctors accusing Lyme sufferers of being hypochondriacs or malingerers when they are experiencing very real, debilitating, painful symptoms. On top of all of this, spiders, mosquitoes, fleas, and mites may also be spreading the same or similar bacterial infections. How to Cure Lyme Disease Naturally The bacteria that cause Lyme can be found in the skin, heart, joints, and nervous system. On top of that, Lyme disease specialists are finding that what we call Lyme disease may be caused by several different infectious organisms and may even be caused by a combination of different infectious pathogens. Some speculate that Lyme disease is an infection from the bacteria along with an overabundance of fungi (like Candida) or a parasite. Everyone plays host to countless viruses, infectious bacteria, fungi, toxins, and cancer cells in their body. Many may be carrying Lyme, along with or many other scary diseases, and not know it. Those with stronger immune systems often pass on infections they didn't even know they have to others with weakened immunity. Currently, specialists are saying Lyme cannot be passed from person to person. Some are challenging this belief, especially in regards to sexual transmission. Regardless, those infected can carry the disease for years without knowing it. The good news is that a holistic approach to fixing the body's immune system and ridding it of infectious agents can cure almost any disease. The approach to Lyme should be similar to the approach to curing HIV, fibromyalgia, chronic strep, lupus, Chlamydia, and many other diseases. The first step is to heal the gut, balance the gut flora, and rebuild the immune system. Your Gut and Your immune System Chronic infection is an underlying factor in most chronic illnesses. Our sugar-laden diet, GMO foods that kill beneficial bacteria, antibiotics, other antibacterial products, and many of the chemicals in our food supply deplete our beneficial bacteria, which wreaks havoc on our immune systems. This sets the stage for systemic, chronic fungal infections and parasites to multiply, permeate the gut, enter the body's bloodstream, and spread infection throughout the body. The immune system is only as healthy as the gut. Conventional doctors are very bad at finding and diagnosing parasitical and fungal infections that cannot easily be seen on the surface of the body. The average person is dealing with Candida overgrowth at the very least (the most common fungal infection in our bodies) due to the aforementioned modern diet and lifestyle. Obviously, to treat a difficult bacterial infection such as Lyme (or whatever combination of bacteria, viruses, and parasites causing Lyme symptoms) the immune system needs to be as strong as possible. The immune system is only as healthy as the gut. The body's intestinal tract mirrors the body's health and dictates the power of the immune system. Step one is to balance the gut flora and eliminate most of the harmful pathogens in the body. Diet A healthy diet relies on a foundation of on raw, fresh, organic (when possible), whole foods and herbs. Salads are one of the best ways to do this. Not your typical iceberg lettuce salads with a few carrots shreds and some ranch dressing, but a salad with a wide variety of at least 10 different vegetables along with fresh garlic, turmeric, ginger, unrefined sea salt, and healthy fats. It is the best way to get a wide array of the best nutrients that will repair the gut and rebuild the body's immune system. Don't underestimate this; a large salad every day, done right, will do more for the body than any supplement regimen, and when followed long enough, the right diet with these kinds of daily salads can completely heal the body from disease, in most cases. But the right supplement protocol can radically speed things up and is often necessary for the very ill. A perfect diet would not be complete without lots of clean drinking water. For detoxification, cranberry stevia lemonade is very good for rejuvenating the kidneys, cleaning the liver, purifying blood, and flushing out the whole system. For most people, a gallon a day will yield remarkable results, but for smaller people, or those who have rare conditions that make this dangerous, use common sense and don't ever drink too much water (or any fluid). And for everyone else, a gallon of cranberry lemonade every day will have amazing benefits, second only to salads and cutting out other junk food, but again, use common sense. Drinking that much water in a very short period of time can kill people, believe it or not. Supplements When healing the gut, you want to kill fungi and parasites, balance the bacteria, and begin healing the intestinal walls. Undecylenic acid is the best supplement on the market for killing Candida and other fungal pathogens. Wormwood, barberry root, black walnut hull, cape aloe leaf, and garlic are all very powerful, broad-spectrum antimicrobials that kill the bad guys and help reset the balance of gut flora. Many of these also have other healing benefits on the digestive system. Garlic, bentonite clay, and activated charcoal are all powerful toxin removers with a host of other benefits. A high quality probiotic designed to make it past stomach acid will help restore the balance of the body's naturally occurring beneficial bacteria by crowding out, and competing with and even feeding off of the harmful flora. The bacteria from these supplements don't last very long (regardless of what the manufactures tell you), but the idea is that your body's natural bacteria can proliferate once the probiotics do their job. This is why a prebiotic diet is so important, and raw, fresh, organically grown produce provides the best prebiotics. Don't underestimate the power of beneficial bacteria for a properly working, strong immune system. Your beneficial bacteria play a major role in our immune system. The appendix is a safe house for good bacteria. The body releases these bacteria when the body needs it. If you don't have an appendix, it behooves you to take probiotics every day for the rest of your life. But take them at the right time. If you take probiotics at the same time you take antimicrobial supplements, the antimicrobials will kill the probiotic bacteria. When doing a supplement protocol that employs antimicrobials, take the probiotics at night, just before bed, a few hours after taking other supplements that can harm the bacteria. Take the other antimicrobial supplements throughout the day. Or how ever you can work it out to give the probiotics ample time to do their thing before you kill them with antimicrobials. How to Kill Lyme Since the bacteria that cause Lyme can be so difficult to kill, a multifaceted approach should be taken with supplements. As mentioned, anyone suffering from Lyme disease is bound to have other issues depleting their immune system as well. The severity of Lyme symptoms will correlate with the overall toxicity in the body. Toxin elimination (which includes toxins released from the Lyme bacteria itself, and all other toxins) is imperative, along with building a healthy gut. Common Co-Infections Must Be Addressed Dr. Klinghardt (if you suffer from any disease, check out his research as well) states that common co-infections include, \"roundworms, tapeworms, threadworms, family, B 19, active measles (in the small intestine), leptospirosis, chronic strep infections mutations, Babesia, mycoplasma, Rickettsia, Bartonella, and As mentioned previously, fungi including molds, Candida, and other yeast are always part of the picture, and other toxicity issues such as heavy metal contamination are typically a heavy burden on a Lyme infected host as well. A holistic Lyme protocol has a healthy diet as the foundation, focusing on vegetables, herbs, and whole foods, with the elimination of processed and refined foods, especially those with toxic chemicals added to them. When the diet is dialed in, the supplements have much more effectiveness, and the body is able to purge toxins more easily, and the immune system is radically stronger. Diet is key, and with almost all diseases, the right diet will prevent the disease in the first place, and can usually cure the disease given enough time. But, with today's toxic loads, supplements are often needed, and even when diet could do the job on its own, again, supplements will radically speed up the process. Specific Lyme Disease Protocol This protocol will flush toxins and alleviate the body's toxic load, replenish nutrition and ensure your body can absorb and assimilate nutrients, strengthen the immune system, and kill pathogens that cause us harm. It will work to rid the body of any infection, including viruses, but the protocol does emphasis effectiveness against difficult bacterial infection, molds and fungal infections, and parasites. This means that this protocol will be extremely effective against bacterial infections such as syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and any ailments caused by fungal infections as well. If a known viral co-infection exists, this protocol is strong enough to eliminate viruses, but you could do so faster by adding St. John's Wort, Pau d'Arco, colloidal silver, zinc, olive leaf extract, and systemic enzymes. Personally, if it were me, I would just up the systemic enzyme dosage with the following protocol to combat viruses. Step One - Lyme Disease Diet It's time to tighten the diet. Dial it in. Get strict. This doesn't mean you won't enjoy food; it means it's time to learn to enjoy salads! Make a salad every day, using at least ten different vegetables and at least five different herbs and spices. Variety is key, and be sure to mix it up, but always include garlic, turmeric, pepper, healthy fats like avocado, flax, and coconut oil, and get organic, fresh (recently picked from the ground, not frozen or canned) vegetables whenever possible. Fruit is great to consume with this diet, but every time fruit is eaten, SF722 or another powerful fungal fighter needs to be taken with it. Juicing is a common problem for us health nuts. Sweet juice is a refined sugar, even fresh squeezed organic orange juice. Beets, carrots, and all fruits (save lemon, lime, granny smith apple, and cranberry), feed fungal infections, bacteria, and promote viruses. Juicing is fine, when done right. Juice regularly, but instead of those sweet juices, try ginger and turmeric shots (see the golden milk recipe below). On the other hand, you're not likely to have much room for juicing because you will be drinking a lot of cranberry, stevia lemonade. Every day, make a gallon of cranberry lemonade sweetened with stevia, and a very large salad (at least 6 cups). Obviously your size should be taken into consideration, don't kill yourself trying to drink a gallon a day if you only weigh 80 pounds, but for most people a gallon of water a day will do them a world of good. Absolutely no alcohol is allowed on this diet save what little bit is in some of the recommended tinctures. Recipe links for recipes that don't feed infection Beans and rice (when made right, soak and sprout beans, soak rice), quinoa, amaranth, eggs, homemade nut milks (only if nuts are sprouted first, and cashews and pasteurized almonds will not sprout), and organic free-range meats are all okay on this diet. Review: Eat a big, diverse salad every day (fresh, organic whenever possible, never GMO foods). Consume fresh fruits and vegetables throughout the day. Gallon of cranberry, stevia lemonade with cayenne to taste. Turmeric and ginger juicing regularly, daily is best. No processed, refined, foods. No pasta, no breads, no cereals, no white rice. Prepare your own foods - this is not the time to be going out to eat. No chemically laden foods, fake foods, GMO foods, or even \"healthy\" junk foods (such as organic chips, organic cereals). The aforementioned diet will go a long way to heal the gut, and given time, will typically heal the gut on its own, especially in cases where the body is not dealing with a heavy load or a systemic infection. Since we're dealing with a systemic infection, the supplements below are highly recommended. Do not underestimate the importance of this step. This is, in fact, more important than the proceeding steps that specifically address viruses. In fact, most people that find themselves with disease only make it through this step and then feel so much better that they tend to stop the protocol. This is probably fine if you spend the rest of your life eating extremely well, which you should do regardless, but even when the body feels better than it has since you can remember, that doesn't mean the infection is gone. It means the infection(s) is at bay, but ready to bounce back at the first chance. The following are supplements that will clean out the gut, help detoxify the body, remove parasites, fungi, and begin the removal of heavy metals and other contaminates. SF722 is the best supplement I know of for taking care of any kind of fungi (yeast, mold, Candida). You can take a lot of it at once. I've taken up to 30 at once with no side effects. For someone with obvious signs of Candida overgrowth I recommend people take 30 a day for the first few days, and then cut back to 10 a day for a few weeks. For cases where someone is unsure of a Candida infection, take 10 a day for a few days and cut back to 5 a day thereafter. Take this supplement whenever consuming foods that may feed Candida (like sweeter fruits such as pineapple), and always have this supplement on hand. SF722 is very powerful against fungal infections, but it does kill some other bad guys as well, which means it can kill some good guys too, so I recommend taking it with other antimicrobial supplements throughout the day, and replenish beneficial bacteria every night with a probiotic like FloraMend. Whatever probiotic you choose, be sure it is designed to make it past the stomach acid. Stomach acid kills most of the beneficial bacteria in fermented vegetables and cheaply made probiotic supplements. Bio-K (we don't have this one at our sister site, Green Lifestyle Market, but most health food stores carry it) is an example of a bacteria specifically designed to make it through stomach acid. FloraMend is a probiotic with a capsule designed to pass through stomach acid and release in the more alkaline environment of the gut. The benefit of FloraMend it that it stores easily and is tolerant to fairly extreme weather temperatures (up to 110 F). The benefit of Bio-K is that you can add it to your smoothies, feed it to young children and infants, and use it to strengthen the probiotic nature of other yogurts for a treat every now and then (but occasional treats should come after the body burden is substantially lessened, and the host is feeling much better). Shillington's products should be taken exactly as directed. His Intestinal Detox has activated charcoal, but I recommend getting more of it on this protocol than the intestinal detox would give by itself, so I added an additional supplement of just the charcoal. I recommend 5-10 a day depending on the body's burden. The following supplement regimen should be done for 1-2 weeks, depending on the severity of the flora-imbalance. If most symptoms do not significantly decrease, tighten up the diet and consider adding some more SF722 to the daily protocol. Shillington's Intestinal Detox - This is necessary only for those with seriously damaged intestines, anyone who has recently been vaccinated, or those looking to do a thorough detox. Pulls out heavy metals, positively charged protozoa, and other toxins. Activated Charcoal - Activated Charcoal is highly porous, negatively charged, and attracts and adsorbs unwanted substances, carrying them out of the digestive tract. Blood Detox Formula (tincture) & Blood Detox Tea - This is an absolutely amazing formula for cleaning out the blood, keeping things detoxifying and moving well, and assisting the elimination organs such as the kidneys and liver. I consider this formula to be essential for any detox. Clean blood makes for a clean body. You can use one or the other, but the combination of the tea and tincture is even more powerful. Do not take this formula for more than two weeks, practice two weeks on and one week off. Tip: the instructions on the bottle say to take externally, but it is designed to be taken orally. Step Three - Kill Lyme, and any other infection Foundational supplements should be taken for months and could be taken indefinitely. They provide the body with a foundation of the minerals and vitamins and other nutrients needed so that, along with the right diet, the body remains at peak performance, able to fend off new invaders and rid itself of any current infection and toxins. For those on a tight budget, looking for a stopping point, I recommend completing the first phase of the protocol (above) and then always having on hand the activated charcoal and the SF722. If affordable, add the Total Nutrition Formula and the Fish oil as well, and take every day for a year. A lack of nutrition or an abundance of toxins at any time before the Lyme bacteria is completely eliminated will likely result in resurgence of infection along with renewed symptoms. For most people, a very strict diet and just a few supplements (after balancing the gut flora as previously advised) will eventually rid the body of any and all Lyme. Foundational Supplements Total Nutrition Formula - This is actual food, perfectly balanced to provide a nice foundation of the most important vitamins and many other essential nutrients. You can also make your own, see below. Liquid Light - The most common minerals Lyme patients tend to be low on include copper, magnesium, manganese and iron. Liquid Light has these and many other minerals the body needs. It's one of the best mineral supplements on the market. Activated Charcoal - For the same reason mentioned above, this will just continue to pull out toxins as your body heals and fights infection. SF722 - Always keep it on hand. With today's modern diets and lifestyle, Candida and other fungal infections are an extremely common problem. Systemic Enzymes - These enzymes are designed to pass through the stomach acid and release in the intestinal tract (like the aforementioned FloraMend). While this is one of the least important supplements for specifically killing bacteria, it is a powerful antiviral supplement with an incredible array of other benefits and detoxification capabilities. For more information on this, check out our Vaccine Detox article. Floramend-Prime - For those without an appendix. If you don't have your appendix then you should be taking a probiotic for the rest of your life. Fish oil with D - Vitamin D is a common vitamin to be low on, even for those eating the healthiest of diets, and the fats are extremely important for building healthy cell structure so that the body's cells are less susceptible to infection and toxin damage from infectious organisms. For vegans, there are separate vitamin D and fat supplements. Anti-microbial and Immune Boosting Supplements The previous list of \"foundational supplements\" can be taken indefinitely for better health and vitality. They are in fact the supplements that my family, my dog, and I take regularly. This next group of supplements should be taken for two weeks at a time, and then halted for one week. When the body is functioning well, these supplements will eliminate unwanted pathogens, but they also kill our good micro flora, too. Some of the supplements lose their effectiveness after a couple of weeks, and it's a good idea, after two weeks of these supplements, to build up beneficial bacteria in the body. One of the reasons this phase of the protocol is so good at eliminating bacteria, even the hard to kill kind, is that we're attacking it with a wide array of natural chemicals. Many protocols call for three or four different supplements that are known to kill bacterial infections, but do so in the same way with the same chemicals. For instance, Oregon grape, coptis chinensis, and goldenseal are sometimes recommended in the same protocol to kill bacteria, but they use the same naturally occurring chemical called berberine to do so. This regimen utilizes supplements with very different chemical compounds to attack the infection in different ways. Mushroom Complex - This mushroom formula called MycoPhyto Complex uses a mix of six different medicinal mushrooms to improve and maintain the immune system. The phytochemicals in these mushrooms limit the spread of tumors and infections on a microbial level, strengthening the body's defense system. Oil of Oregano - The beneficial effect of oil of oregano resonates in several of the body's systems. It's a powerful antioxidant and a powerful anti-microbial. Berberine - This is the alkaloid known to kill bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites that is present in a number of plants including barberry, tree turmeric, Oregon grape, goldenseal, and goldthread. Liposomal Vitamin C - This vitamin C is highly bio-available, and will strengthen the immune system and provide a host of other benefits. Colloidal Silver - Most are familiar with its antimicrobial properties. I've never found it to be as effective as other compounds, but combined with other supplements, colloidal silver makes it nearly impossible for infection to flourish. Olive Leaf Extract - This is one that can be taken indefinitely. Olive leaf extract is one of those rare supplements that supports the immune system and kills the infections without harming beneficial microflora. Shillington's Echinacea Plus - Minimize the severity and duration of a current illness and enhance your immune system - a great addition for anyone detoxifying and looking to keep their immune system strong while the onslaught of toxins works through the elimination organs. The whole protocol above is overkill. It's expensive, and it's more than enough for most. On the other hand, if you have the money and want to knock out chronic disease fast, there's no better protocol, and all of the recommended supplements have immense benefits to the body for a multitude of reasons. If not, try getting through the first two phases, and then maybe choose just one or two of the supplements for the third phase. EMF's should also be limited, and grounding, or Earthing should be done as much as possible. Himalayan salt lamps can be very beneficial for those suffering from Lyme. Be sure to get enough sleep, and make sure the water you're drinking is clean, beneficial water. There are new approaches for diagnosing Lyme in development. They look promising, but you do not have to wait for a proper diagnosis to heal your body and feel vibrant and healthy again. It really doesn't matter if it's Lyme or anything else. Healing the body is about restoring the immune system, reducing toxins, and feeding the body right. Vaccine Economics - Lots of Money, Lies, and Politics | Imagine if you had a product to sell that didn't require advertising or marketing, but the majority of people thought they had to have it. Better still, millions of children and adults are forced to obtain your product in order to keep their jobs or go to school. The government is one of your guaranteed buyers. Your product doesn't need to be 100% effective or 100% safe. If your product hurts your consumers, you won't be held liable for damages. Instead, your product is taxed and the money goes to consumers or family members of those who were harmed or killed by the product. You don't even need to be involved in the court cases, to determine who gets the money. The government will do that for you. Vaccines operate under a different business model than anything else that is bought and sold in America. And don't fool yourself into believing pharmaceutical companies don't make a profit off vaccines. Each vaccine is worth billions of dollars. The Market Economy, Better Known as the Free Market In a free market, the public is never coerced into buying anything by government. There are multiple manufacturers, buyers, and sellers of every product. In order for companies to stay in business, their products must stand on their own. Companies compete with each other and are free to enter and leave the marketplace. No industries or companies receive special protection from the government, so safety becomes a financial responsibility as well as a moral one. A free market is competitive, with companies competing with one another for customers and employees. In order for this system to work, the marketplace must be decentralized, with market power spread out over many businesses and households, not concentrated in the hands of a few politically powerful businesses and government agencies. Free Markets Produce Favorable Efficient Outcomes, as if Guided by an Invisible Hand The free market system is far from perfect, but it is the most efficient means of allocating resources. The father of economics, Adam Smith, explained how this system leads to desirable outcomes for society. \"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages.\" \"Every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it ... He intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end, which was no part of his intention.\" The same year Adam Smith published his seminal work on economics, An Inquiry Into The Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, American rebels signed the Declaration of Independence. More than 200 hundred years later, many of Smith's insights still ring true, and his initial research remains fundamental to modern economics. We could call it a coincidence, but both documents shared the view that individuals are usually better off when left to their own devices, without heavy-handed government interference. This philosophical approach, which places a high value on freedom, provided the intellectual foundation for the market economy and for a free society. [i] Less Than Free Markets This is, of course, not the only way to buy and sell goods. Communist economies were built on the notion that the government knew best, and they should be the ones to decide what is bought and sold, and how it is done. This idea has been shown to be a colossal failure, and most centrally planned economies have abandoned this system in order to develop market economies. (China and Russia are good examples of failed centrally planned economies). Healthcare makes up a substantial portion of the American economy. In 2013, U.S. health care spending reached $2.9 trillion or $9,255 per person. This accounts for 17.4% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). [ii] Increasingly, government has been taking more and more control over our healthcare decisions, mandating insurance and vaccines. This is being done under the guise that they know best. This level of coercion is not the endgame for government regulators and vaccine manufacturers. As of 2012, there were nearly 300 vaccines in development[iii], and pharmaceutical companies lobby endlessly to make all vaccines, even the flu vaccine, mandatory for everyone. Obviously, this would make pharmaceutical companies more money. Some people believe it would increase our so-called herd immunity, but many feel our freedom is worth more than that. Patrick Henry once boldly proclaimed, \"Give me liberty or give me death!\" Mandated Vaccines Do Not Belong in a Free Country So far we have seen mandatory vaccines for hospital workers, childcare workers, government employees, public school children, and college students. Australia has instituted a no jab no pay policy, making government benefits dependent upon vaccine compliance. Many child protective services have begun medical kidnappings, forcing vaccines on the children of uncooperative parents. This is not how a free market, or a free society functions. Our freedoms, especially our medical freedoms, have been eroding for some time now, sold off to the highest corporate bidders. Years ago, a leading economist wrote a book warning us about what happens when government becomes too heavily involved in our affairs. Milton Friedman's book, Capitalism & Freedom, won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1976. In the conclusion of his book he writes: The importance of government as a buyer of so much of our output, and the sole buyer of the output of many firms and industries, already concentrates a dangerous amount of economic power in the hands of the political authorities, changes the environment in which business operates and the criteria relevant for business success, and in these and other ways endangers a free market.\" The Revolving Doors of the CDC, FDA, and the Pharmaceutical Industries No one can be an expert in everything. We live in complicated times. Since the majority of us don't have time to research everything, most of us turn to our government regulators to tell us, in their expert opinion, if a product, service, or practice is safe. After all, the CDC and other government agencies are paid salaries provided by taxpayer revenue to know these things and to give us objective advice. Theoretically, they work for us, the American people. In practice, however, government regulators like the CDC actually work for the pharmaceutical industries. There are several independent studies showing conflicts of interest among vaccine regulators. Several government studies going years back have shown extensive CDC corruption. Consider the results of the following report from the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform. This report reveals how the members of influential advisory committees such as the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) and the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunizations Practices (ACIP) have been completely corrupted by industry. This report notes that members of these advisory committees have extensive financial ties to the pharmaceutical industries. A few examples of this include: \"The CDC routinely grants waivers from conflict of interest rules to every member of its advisory committee. CDC Advisory Committee members who are not allowed to vote on certain recommendations due to financial conflicts of interest are allowed to participate in committee deliberations and advocate specific positions. The Chairman of the CDC's advisory committee until very recently owned 600 shares of stock in Merck, a pharmaceutical company with an active vaccine division. Members of the CDC's advisory Committee often fill out incomplete financial disclosure statements, and are not required to provide the missing information by CDC ethics officials. Four out of eight CDC advisory committee members who voted to approve guidelines for the rotavirus vaccine in June 1998 had financial ties to pharmaceutical companies that were developing different versions of the vaccine. Three out of five FDA advisory committee members who voted to approve the rotavirus vaccine in December 1997 had financial ties to pharmaceutical companies that were developing different versions of the vaccine.\"[iv] There are several studies following this report that back up these findings. In June 2007, Senate minority leader Tom Coburn released an oversight report of the CDC. The findings bring many questions to mind concerning the CDC's effectiveness and how they spend our money. The study was named CDC Off Center: A Review of How an Agency Tasked With Fighting and Preventing Disease has Spent Hundreds of Millions of Tax Dollars for Failed Prevention Efforts, International Junkets, and Lavish Facilities, but Cannot Demonstrate it is Controlling Disease. Here are a few highlights of this study: Yet while CDC has been given millions, and in some cases billions, of dollars to help prevent certain diseases among Americans, for many of these diseases the rates have not decreased, but have stayed the same or even increased under CDC's watch. In the case of HIV, despite spending billions of dollars, CDC cannot even report how many Americans have the communicable disease. Perhaps there is a budgetary reason why CDC does not \"count\" over a $1.8 billion dollars it has received and spent over the last few years on HIV/AIDS, but doing so makes it complicated for researchers to compare actual CDC expenditures from year to year. Since 1996 the CDC had a visitor center which drew 15,000 visitors a year. The agency itself is located in Atlanta, Georgia, home to one of the largest 24-hour cable news networks. Yet when faced with static HIV transmission rates, e-coli outbreaks, and the threat of bioterrorism, CDC spent $106 million of taxpayers' dollars to build a lavish new visitor center, which includes a 70-foot-wide by 25-foot-tall video wall of rear-projection and plasma television screens inside its new communications center, which houses a $20 million new studio for communicating CDC information.\" Other questionable expenditures include 10 million dollars on furniture, and 3 million dollars a year leasing a private jet. According to the Congressional Research Service, the CDC has spent more than $1 billion on building construction and repairs of its buildings and facilities from fiscal years 2000 to 2005.\" The report includes many other examples of questionable spending. In December of 2009, The Office of the Inspector General set out to ascertain the extent to which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its special Government employees (SGE) on Federal advisory committees complied with ethics requirements. Nine years following the U.S. House of Representatives Majority Report the conflicts of interest at the CDC have not gotten any better. Consider the following highlights of the report: \"For almost all special Government employees, CDC did not ensure that financial disclosure forms were complete in 2007. CDC certified OGE Forms 450 with at least one omission in 2007 for 97 percent of SGEs. Most of the forms had more than one type of omission. CDC did not identify or resolve potential conflicts of interest for 64 percent of special Government employees in 2007. \" \"CDC did not ensure that 41 percent of special Government employees received required ethics training in 2007. CDC did not ensure that 41 percent of SGEs had ethics training certificates on file to document that SGEs received initial or annual ethics training within required timeframes in 2007.\" \"Fifteen percent of special Government employees did not comply with ethics requirements during committee meetings in 2007.\" \" In addition, 3 percent of SGEs voted on particular matters when their waivers prohibited such participation. Four SGEs both participated in committee meetings without current, certified OGE Forms 450 on file and voted on particular matters when their waivers prohibited such participation.\" To their credit, The Office of The Inspector General had some specific recommendations on how things can be improved at the CDC. \"We found that CDC had a systemic lack of oversight of the ethics program for SGEs. That is, CDC and its SGEs did not comply with ethics requirements in 2007. To address our findings, we recommend that CDC: Ensure that special Government employees' Confidential Financial Disclosure Reports are complete before certifying them. Require special Government employees to disclose their involvement in grants and other relevant interests that could pose conflicts but that are not disclosed on the Confidential Financial Disclosure Report. Identify and resolve all conflicts of interest for special Government employees before permitting them to participate in committee meetings. Increase collaboration among CDC officials and with the HHS Office of the General Counsel. Ensure that special Government employees and CDC employees receive ethics training. Monitor special Government employee compliance with ethics requirements during committee meetings. Track special Government employee compliance with ethics requirements.\"[v] One might be tempted to think that what's needed is a hard-working public servant to come in and reform the system. That is what many observers hoped would happen when David Wright took the job as the director of the Office of Research Integrity. Reforming the system is beyond the influence of one director. Two years into his job as director, Wright wrote a scathing letter of resignation, which included the following: ...working with the research community and the remarkable scientist-investigators at ORI has been the best job I've ever had. As for the rest, I'm offended as an American taxpayer that the federal bureaucracy\u2014at least the part I've labored in\u2014is so profoundly dysfunctional. I'm hardly the first person to have made that discovery, but I'm saddened by the fact that there is so little discussion, much less outrage, regarding the problem.\" [vi] From these findings, I think it is clear that we have problems at the systemic level, not just with a few bad regulators. We have a clear problem when regulators from the CDC and FDA profit from the decisions they make on advisory committees. These conflicts of interest are the norm and not the exception. The CDC is certainly well funded, but how they spend their tax generated revenue is questionable, and there is little evidence that their efforts are actually controlling disease. Finally, there is the bureaucratic atmosphere that encourages a wasteful kind of work - the look busy but do nothing kind of mentality that is pervasive in our bureaucracies. Agencies like the CDC and the FDA are given billions of tax dollars to serve the American public, to protect us. If they cannot or will not do their jobs, they need to be defunded. Bureaucrats who work for the pharmaceutical industry must be stripped of their authority and put on industry payroll, not the government payroll. Conclusion There is a tremendous amount of money in vaccines, especially due to mandatory vaccinations. Billions of dollars is on the line, and while Big Pharma tries to convince the nation that vaccines are a dire necessity and that pharmaceutical companies are just altruistically trying to help us, there are a few arguments that we can make, not only in defense of our rights, but in defense of the free market. Mandatory vaccinations infringe on our rights, not only as consumers, but as individuals. The most basic right is control over one's body. Years after slavery and the Tuskegee experiments, the government is overstepping its bounds again. Whether pro vaccine or anti-vaccine, the right to refuse a medical procedure is a right that affects us all. If vaccines are as safe and effective as many in the medical community claim, why do vaccines receive special protection from liability from the U.S. Government? Because they aren't safe and effective. Vaccines are so dangerous they are not profitable when subject to the same standards as other medical products under U.S. courts. As a result, vaccines get their own court - the Vaccine Court. Economics teach us that government run markets have been shown to be horribly inefficient. Healthcare amounts to a large and growing sector of the U.S. economy. Mandated health insurance and forced vaccines are communist methods of running an economy, and they have no place in a free society. We are not, in fact, living in a free society. We have not been for some time. Instead we live in a plutocratic oligarchy, a society run by a wealthy elite. The economics of vaccines are the economics of many different corporate interests run amok. In a free market, the only things that can't be for sale are the integrity of the market and the freedom of the market. These things are priceless. "}
