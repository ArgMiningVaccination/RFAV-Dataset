Group DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 4| P a g e Introduction Delaware, one of the thirteen original states, is located on the eastern Atlantic coast of the United States, occup ying part of the Delmarva Peninsula between the Delaware and Chesapeake Bay s. Delaware is divided into three counties: New Castle, Kent, and Sussex. Historically, industrialized New Castle County has contrasted with the other two predominantly agricultural counties . Today approximately 60% of the population live in New Castle County, the northernmost county. Wilmington, the state's largest city, with more than 70,000 people, is in New Castle County. Dover, located in Kent County in the center o f the state, is the capital of Delaware. According to the 2019 Delaware Population Consortium, the population of Delaware is 972,332. This represent s an increase of 8.3% percent over the 2010 census figure of 897,934. Delaware's beaches and boardwalks make the state a popular tourist destination during the summer months. The southern portion of the state, particularly the coastline in Sussex County, sees a significant increase in the summer population. In addition to the tourists that visit the coastline, D elaware is host to thousands of foreign students employed by local businesses to assist with the economic boost associated with the tourism influx. These students staff restaurants, retail stores, and other associated businesses in and around the most heav ily affected tourist destinations. During this current COVID -19 pandemic , effective allocation and administration of a vaccine will play a vital role in reducing COVID -19 effects on Delaware's health, society, and economy. Although the overarching aim of Delaware's Division of Public Heath 's vaccination program is to vaccinate all persons in Delaware who choose to be vaccinated, the vaccine supply continues to be insufficient to meet this goal. The Delaware Department of Health and Social Services ( DHSS ), Division of Public Health (DPH) is a unique organization in terms of the responsibility, size, and scope of operations. While most states have municipal or county health departments in addition to a state health department, DPH serves as the public health entity for both state and local initiatives. DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 5| P a g e Section 1: COVID -9 Vaccination Preparedness Planning Instructions: A. Describe your early COVID -19 vaccination program planning activities , includ ing lessons learned and improvements made from the 2009 H1N1 vaccination campaign , seasonal influenza campaigns, and other responses to identify gaps in preparedness . Since the COVID -19 outbreak, the DPH Immunization Program has been working internally to improve processes. During normal operations, each position in the program had a singular purpose, but with an advanci ng vaccine response, the Immunization Program needed to make some changes. One such change was the personnel structure. With the increased need of dose level accountability, several personnel have been cross -trained to assist with vaccine inventory, orderi ng and storage and handling of the vaccine. DPH's two C enters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Public Health Advisors and the two health program representatives have been educated on the intricacies of maintaining dose level accountability into the Immunization Information System (IIS), which is referred to as DelVAX. During DPH's last CDC site visit in 2019, they recommended that the additional staff be hired that were budgeted in the 2020 cooperative agreement to assist with vaccine management and to increase storage and handling presence out in the community. Based on lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 vaccination campaign and an analysis of the current Immunization Program in advance of COVID -19 vaccine av ailability, DPH identified the need to decrease the immunization data reporting time to DelVax from a community clinic or Point of Dispensing (POD) exercise. The program has worked with the CDC and the DelVax vendor, Envision Technologies, to create a system to where administered immunization data can be reported directly from a clinic site. This process was not part of the COVID -19 response, but it aligned with current response activities. This new process wil l allow real time submission into DelVax if a Wi -Fi connection is available. If not, the administered data can be uploaded to DelVax at the end of the clinic day . DPH has held weekly internal meetings since the release of the COVID -19 Vaccination Program Interim Playbook for Jurisdiction Operations - one for the DPH COVID -19 Vaccination Task Force which comprises of many members from the Influenza Advisory Committee and one for DPH leadership , within which many members are part of the COVID -19 Vaccination Task Force to ensure coordination between the two main groups . DPH has also met with certain stakeholders to provide a preliminary and ongoing approach to COVID -19 vaccine distribution . These stakeholders include the Delaware Public Health and Medical Et hics Advisory Group, Delaware Healthcare Association, Healthcare Associated Infection Advisory Committee, Post -Acute Care Task Force, and the Delaware Healthcare Preparedness Co alition . DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 6| P a g e B. Include the number/dates of and qualitative information on planned w orkshops or tabletop, functional, or full -scale exercises that will be held prior to COVID -19 vaccine availability. Explain how continuous quality improvement occur s/will occur during the exercises a nd implementation of the COVID -19 Vaccination Program . Dose level accountability was an issue of concern during the H1N1 campaign, where many doses went to sites that were not enrolled as vaccinating providers and these doses could not be tracked by the Immu nization Program. With the increased attention to dose level accountability, through the creation of a new CDC Vaccine Tracking System (VTrckS), a dose of vaccine can be traced from the time it leaves the CDC Vaccine Depot, arrives at a provider site, and then is reported to DelVax as a dose that was administered . DelVAX has the ability of accepting either the Unit of Use or Unit of Sale information submissions using Health Level 7 (HL7) protocol messages to allow for flexibility in dose level accountabili ty. Reporting of immunizations has been a manual process of reporting by paper to the Immunization Program for several years. With the C enters for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS) Meaningful Use initiative, it gave providers an opportunity to connect their Electronic Medical Record (EMR) to the IIS. While this has been a successful project, it has not been a quick one, with an average time of 34 days req uired to onboard providers using HL7 messaging. Delaware still has several providers reporting man ually after the implementation of DelVax . The Immunization Program is continu ing to reach out to onboard providers as an ongoing process . Increas ing participation involve s the COVID -19 vaccine enrollment process, outreach to providers, and development of an online training program ; these initiatives are currently in place to support the transition process, which is anticipated to be ongoing as we evolve to complete electron ic reporting after COVID -19. The program also has worked with the CDC and the DelVax vendor, Envision Technologies, to create a system where administered immunization data can be reported directly from a clinic site. State Service Centers that house the public health clinics wanted the responses from the questions prior to vaccination ; this new enhancement allowed DPH to do that. DPH developed the Delaware COVID -19 Vaccination Task Force to engage additional internal and external partnerships in the operational and logistical processes specific for vaccine distribution ; its first meeting was held on October 23, 2020 . Additional subcommittees and groups have been developed as needed , including the insertion of vaccine distribution discussions in establ ished COVID -19 working groups involving health systems, long -term care, corrections, mental health, community groups, faith -based organizations, commercial pharmacies, other governmental agencies, schools and institutes of higher education, professional or ganizations, and businesses. Many of these groups already have COVID -19 vaccination as a standing agenda item, so these discussions will continue to evolve as more information is available for planning. A tabletop exercise for DPH was held on October 29, 2020 to focus on internal processes. Another exercise for the Delaware COVID -19 Vaccination Task Force w as scheduled after the introductory meeting on October 23, 2020 and was focused more on vaccine operations involving these stakeholders such as professional medical organizations, health systems, Federally Qualified Health DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 7| P a g e Center s (FQHC ), third -party payers, health care associations, community groups, and other governmental agencies . Regular weekly facilitated discussions with DPH leadership will be conduct ed to review updates to the Vaccine Allocation Framework and strategies to engage stakeholders in the vaccine administration process. C. Explain how continuous quality improvement occurs/will occur during the exercises and implementation of the COVID -19 Vaccination Program The Delaware COVID -19 Vaccination Program Committee is a diverse and well -rounded group, with every organization committed to providing vaccine for immunization in the most efficient manner. The key objec tive to this initiative is that processes in the COVID -19 vaccination program be fluid and adaptable to be able to fit every situation as changes occur. The Vaccination Program Committee has been meeting weekly since November 25, 2020 for a facilitated dis cussion to review and walk through some of the objectives, specifically when it comes to critical populations and vaccine allocation . Further facilitated discussions/ exercises will be planned as needed in order to achieve the best outcome. Many different scenarios , including those involving operational, logistical, political, and technological/informatic challenges, must be tested and approved to develop processes before implementation in order to achieve desired goals. Once implementation begins , each process will be screened for validity and modified as situations warrant. Continuously retesting processes during implementation allow for the phasing out of issues as they arise, ensuring that processes meet the objective. Process will be reviewed and discussed during the weekly vaccine planning committee meetings to ensure that every step that needs to be corrected is identified and presented to the committee for resolution. DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 8| P a g e Section 2: COVID -19 Organizational Structure and Partner Involvement A. Describe your organizational structure. Using the current DPH organizational chart (Appendix C) , the Office of the Medical Director (OMD ) is taking the lead for the vaccination effort , with the Immunizations Program and Emergency Medical Services and Preparedness Section (EM SPS) supporting the required processes and reporting up to OMD through the structure. The DPH's State Health Operations Center ( SHOC ) also has the organization structure (Appendix D) to show the agencies responsible for different a reas when activated for the vaccine response. B. Describe how your jurisdiction will plan for, develop, and assemble an internal COVID -19 Vaccination Program planning and coordination team that includes persons with a wide array of expertise as well as backu p representatives to ensure coverage. DPH has held weekly internal meetings since the release of the COVID -19 Vaccination Program Interim Playbook for Jurisdiction Operations - one for the DPH COVID -19 Vaccination Task Force which comprises of many membe rs from the Influenza Advisory Committee and one for DPH leadership , within which many members are part of the COVID -19 Vaccination Task Force to ensure coordination between the two main groups . DPH also met with certain stakeholders to provide a prelimin ary approach to the initial COVID -19 vaccine distribution . These stakeholders include the Delaware Public Health and Medical Ethics Advisory Group, Delaware Healthcare Association, Healthcare Associated Infection Advisory Committee, Post -Acute Care Task Force, and the Delaware Healthcare Preparedness Coalition . The current team for influenza vaccine planning encompasses expertise in mass vaccination and pandemic planning/response (OMD, Immunizations, EMSPS, Community Health, etc.) so that this team is the appropriate conduit to expand into COVID -19 vaccination. Also, key members of the Pandem ic Task Force and H1N1 response will be involved, which include: DPH Office of Communications OMD Immunization Program Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology (OIDE) Office of the State Epidemiologist EMSPS Delaware Attorney General's Office Office of the Governor Constituent Affairs As mentioned above, an internal public health leadership call has been occurring weekly and as of October 23rd, additional external partners were added. DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 9| P a g e C. Describe how your jurisdiction will plan for, develop, and assemble a broader committee of key internal leaders and external partners to assist with implement ing the program , reaching critical populations, and developing crisis and risk communication messa ging. Partnerships created during the COVID -19 response specifically for testing - testing collaboratives, Pandemic Resurgence Advisory Committee , etc. - have been engaged in vaccination initiatives as the objectives are similar, especially regarding acc ess by vulnerable populations. Partnership s include DPH , Delaware Emergency Management Agency (DEMA) , other state agencies, health care systems, FQHCs, governmental representatives, academic universities, professional organizations, community organization s, etc . Also, existing partnerships related to immunizations and influenza , such as the Healthcare Associated Infection Advisory Committee and the Immunization Coalition of Delaware , provide subject matter expertise in clinical and operational aspects of vaccination distribution . The Delaware Public Health and Medical Ethics Advisory Group (Ethics Group) was involved in the review of the priority groups for H1N1 vaccination and were included for COVID -19 to allow for transparency and standardization of the phased approach . The first meeting regarding COVID -19 vaccination was held on November 2, 2020 in advance of the finalized guidance from federal partners on approach to allocation and has met four additional times to discuss and affirm ethical approaches to vaccine administration based on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP ) recommendations . DPH develop ed the Delaware COVID -19 Vaccination Task Force to engage additional internal and external partnerships in the operational an d logistical processes specific for vaccine distribution ; the first meeting on was held on October 23, 2020 . Additional subcommittees and groups have been developed, including the insertion of vaccine distribution discussions in established COVID -19 worki ng groups involving health systems, long -term care, corrections, mental health, community groups, faith -based organizations, commercial pharmacies, other governmental agencies, schools and institutes of higher education, professional organizations, and bus inesses. D. Identify and list members and relevant expertise of the internal team a nd the internal/external committee. Experts will include, but are not limited to, those from h ealth systems, medical community, community -based organizations, correctional facilities, homeless shelters, faith -based leaders, FQHC's, Governor's Office, Legislators, academic institutions, health care associations, professional organizations, commercial pharm acies, etc., for which many are currently involved in COVID -19 testing strategies, with goals to include others as appropriate. Many of these stakeholders have been invited to participate in the COVID -19 Vaccination Task Force given experience with the cu rrent COVID -19 pandemic, the previous novel H1N1 influenza pandemic, public health, mass vaccination, crisis standard s of care, community health and vulnerable population needs, delivery of health care, and communications , with others already DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 10| P a g e participating in other groups involved in COVID -19 planning and response that can become subcommittees to support the overall COVID -19 Vaccination Program. The introductory meeting for the COVID -19 Vaccination Task Force was held on October 23, 2020. E. Describe how yo ur jurisdiction will coordinate efforts between state , local , and territorial authorities. Collaboration has been on -going between state and federal authorities through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) Region III ( mid-Atlantic State Health Officers), specifically the Region III Vaccine Task Force, and various weekly to monthly calls with partners such as CDC, HHS, Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO ), etc. The DPH Medical Director has been assigned as the designated state lead for vaccine distribution planning, with scheduled calls with federal and national partners (CDC, HHS, ASTHO, etc.) on a weekly to monthly basis based on the call. Since DPH is the only designated health departmen t in Delaware, it is responsible for local public health activities as well and continue s to work in that same capacity with local partners. One advantage to this structure is that DPH does not need to coordinate with a local public health entity to reach the community level, and DPH has been successful in maintaining those relationships and communication channels with individual communities. F. Describe how your jurisdiction will engage and coordinate efforts with leadership from tribal communities, tribal health organizations, and urban Indian organizations. Representation from the state -recognized Lenape Indian Tribe of Delaware and Nanticoke Indian Tribe has been included in the DPH COVID -19 Vaccination Task Force, and further outreac h to these communities continue to enhance engagement. The Immunization Program Manager has reached out to both tribal communities, hoping to discuss current COVID activity, and the need to immunize their population. These tribes are not federally recogniz ed, are small and integrated into the communities . While engaging with tribal leaders, each tribal nation has the sovereign authority to provide for the welfare of its people and, therefore, has the authority to: Choose among the jurisdiction or Indian H ealth Service (IHS) options for accessing vaccine. Determine the population(s) it chooses to serve. Choose how vaccines are distributed to its community. Establish phased groups when there is a limited supply of COVID -19 vaccine or other accompanying resou rces. G. List key partners for critical populations that you plan to engage and briefly describe how you plan to engage them, including but not limited to: DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 11| P a g e Pharmacies - Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid Correctional facilities/vendors - Delaware Department of Corrections Homeless shelters - DHSS Division of State Service Centers (Hotels) and Housing Alliance are communicated with at least monthly via meetings and phone conversations Community -based organi zations - National Coalition of 100 Black Women Faith -based leaders - similar organizations for testing opportunities FQHCs - Westside Family Health, LA Red Health Center, Henrietta Johnson Medical Center Health systems - Delaware Healthcare Preparedness C oalition facility members and their internal SMEs for vaccination efforts EMS/Police/Fire - Engaging with county paramedic agencies to become Closed PODs for first responder agencies. Delaware Public Health and Medical Ethics Advisory Group - recommendations on phased groups for vaccine DPH has a list of contacts for these partners and will either invite them to discussions or offer to participate in their meetings to share information and expertise. DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 13 | P a g e Section 3: Phased Approach to COVID -19 Vaccination Instructions: A. Describe how your jurisdiction will structure the COVID -19 Vaccination Program around the three phases of vaccine administration : Phase 1: Potentially Limited Doses Available Phase 2: Large Number of Doses Available, Supply Likely to Meet Demand Phase 3: Likely Sufficient Supply , Slowing Demand The SHOC anticipated and planned for significant challenges with vaccine distribution , especially in phase 1 in which there may be a limited number of doses available. The state is following the CDC ACIP recommended1 phase groups listing , as modified by the Delaware Health and Medical Ethics Advisory Group (see Figure 2), for distribution. In preparation , the state has coordinated with strategic partners (especially hospitals, first responders etc.) regarding the identification of those individuals that need and want to be vaccinated. DPH will determine the specific amount of vaccine that will be allocated to each phase group base d on the anticipated weekly vaccine allocations offered to the state by the federal government , the organizations participating as enrolled providers in DelVAX , and the ability of the enrolled provider to speedily vaccinate the designated phase group . Section 3.1: Vaccine Allocation Framework 1.0 Purpose 1.1. DPH will maintain s comprehensive and dynamic Vaccine Allocation Framework (see Appendix F) that outlines the phased approach to vaccine allocation for high -risk and subsequent groups . The most recent versio n of the Vaccine Allocation Framework can be found on the Delaware Coronavirus webpage https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/wp - content/uploads/sites/177/2020/12/DPH_COVID -Vaccine -Allocation - Phases_Public_122920_With -cover.pdf 1.2. The Vaccine Allocation Framework i s updated regularly for the following reasons: 1.2.1. Updates from the CDC ACIP on recommendations for phase groups and sub - groups. 1.2.2. Updates from the vaccine manufacturers on allocations projected to be delivered to Delaware in the upcoming weeks. 1 The CDC recommendations come from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). The Delaware Public Health and Medical Ethics Advisory Group made recommend ations for approval with suggested modifications (see Figure 2) . DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 14| P a g e 2.0 Vaccine/ Medication Groups 2.1. DPH, with recommendations from the Ethics Group , will review the CDC list of phased population groups and recommend the ethical allocation of vaccine(s). 2.2. High -risk w orkforce groups will include, but are not limited to the following: 2.2.1. Paid and unpaid persons serving in health care settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials and are unable to work from home. 2.2.2. Health care workers 2.2.3. Public Safety/Emergency Services including, but not limited to the following: A. Law Enforcement (LE) B. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) C. Fire/Rescue Departments (FD) D.

Promote justice \u2014 Treat affected groups, populations, and communities fairly. Remove unfair, unjust, and avoidable barriers to COVID -19 vaccination. D. Promote transparency \u2014 Make a decision that is clear, understandable, and open for review. Allow and seek public participation in the creation and review of the decision processes. 3.2.2. Situations and Assumptions A. The COVID -19 vaccine allocation phased groups fo r Delaware were developed based on ethical decision -making only; logistics were not a consideration. B. The initial allocation of COVID -19 Vaccine to the State of Delaware will not be adequate to protect all the Phase 1 groups3. C. The initial allocation of vac cine must be distributed and administered in a very short period due to storage and utilization requirements and urgency to reduce transmission during the pandemic. D. Operational decision -making is used to consider the physical ability to vaccinate within th e Phase 1 sub -groups in order to efficiently utilize the anticipated vaccine supply with the resources available and within the limited timeframe. E. The vaccine delivery timeline will drive the allocation of resources among the phases; overlap of phased gro ups is likely (see Figure 2). F. There will be individuals who abstained from vaccination during their appropriate phase (such as Phase 1a healthcare workers with vaccine safety concerns) who will remain unvaccinated as later phases are initiated . G. Flexibility is permitted to adjust phased groups based on current trends and public health needs. 3.2.3. The Ethics Group has developed recommendations for vaccine(s)/medication allocation based the abo ve framework , to include phase group and sub -groups as needed . The recommendations are provided through the Public Health Medical Director to DPH leadership . 3 Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Center for Health Security (2020). Interim Framework for COVID -19 Vaccine Allocation and Distribution in the United States. Retrieved https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our a g e 3.3. SHOC and/or DPH will implement specific actions outlined in the Delaware Pandemic Influenza Plan, the Delaware Division of Public Health Mass Distribution of Medications/Vaccines Standard Operating Guideline, and other applicable plans, procedures, and guidelines to achieve widest distribution of available vaccines . The Vaccine Allocation Framework (Appendix F) includes proposed strategies and potential timelines for vaccine administration efforts to the phase groups . 3.4. Decisions about use of initially available supplies of COVID -19 vaccines were partially informed by the proven efficacy of the vaccines coming out of vaccine trials ; populations of focus for initial COVID -19 vaccination include those listed in the Vaccine Allocation Framework (Appendix F). 3.5. All planning will be conducted within the context of the three phase s: 3.5.1. Phase 1: Potentially limited supply of COVID -19 vaccine doses available A. Concentrate efforts on reaching the initial populations of focus for COVID -19 vaccination listed above, including those who may be part of other critical populations that might requ ire additional vaccination efforts to ensure access to vaccine. Ensure vaccination locations selected can reach populations, manage cold chain requirements, and meet reporting requirements for vaccine supply and uptake. 3.5.2. Phase 2: Large number of vaccine dos es available A. Focus on ensuring acceptance of and access to vaccine for all critical populations who were not vaccinated in Phase 1, as well as for the general population; expand provider network. 3.5.3. Phase 3: Sufficient supply of vaccine doses for entire population (surplus of doses) A. Focus on ensuring equitable vaccination access across the entire population. Monitor vaccine uptake and coverage; reassess strategy to increase uptake in populations or communities with low coverage. 3.6. Transitioning to the next phase 3.6.1. DPH will implement t he approved transition from one phase to the next . Transitioning to the next phase and potential overlap with previous phases may be impacted by the following4: 4 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (January 2021, V.1.0). COVID -19 Vaccination Program Interim Playbook for Jurisdictional Operations Annex. Considerations for Increasing COVID -19 Vaccination: Reaching and Increasing Uptake in Priority - PLAYBOOK 18| P a g e A. Current phase strategic target vaccination % has been met and vaccin ation supply is adequate for transition to the next phase. B. Vaccine supply increases beyond existing phase demand and is logistically feasible to begin vaccinating the next phase. C. When current phase demand has decreased below strategic target levels despite efforts to increase demand and access D. When vaccine supply within specific locations where vaccine is at risk for going unused unless transition to the next phase occurs. E. When vaccine uptake and coverage data indicate that it is appropriate to transition to the next phase, as identified by vaccine phase strategy. 3.6.2. As transition to later phases occurs, DPH will continue to focus efforts on fully vaccinating those in the previous phases to increas e access and vaccine acceptance. DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 19| P a g e Section 4: Critical Populations Instructions: ACIP, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) have determine d populations of focus for COVID -19 vaccination and ensure equity in access to COVID -19 vac cination availability across the United States. CDC has established an ACIP work group to review evidence on COVID -19 epidemiology and burden as well as COVID -19 vaccine safety, vaccine efficacy, evidence quality, and implementation issues to inform recomm endations for COVID -19 vaccination policy. A key policy goal was to determine critical populations for COVID -19 vaccination, including those groups identified to receive the first available doses of COVID -19 vaccine when supply is expected to be limited. Despite increases in vaccine availability, demand for vaccinations cont inues to significantly exceed vaccine supply. Vaccination efforts are being expanded to include additional critical populations as well as the general public. Delaware is develop ing plans to ensure equitable access to vaccination for each of the critical populations identified in the Vaccine Allocation Framework . Current efforts are focused on ident ifying solutions for vaccine hesitancy, transportation barriers, communication with those who do not speak English , literacy -level and culturally appropriate messaging and overcoming vaccination scheduling roadblocks. In anticipation that the vaccine allocation during Phase 1 would be insufficient to vaccinate all those included in the init ial populations of focus, Delaware identif ied and estimate d the subset groups (i.e., Phase 1 a, Phase 1 b) within the initial populations of focus to allocate the first available doses of COVID - 19 vaccine. Delaware utilized the most current ACIP work group c onsiderations for assistance in identifying, prioritizing, and estimating Phase 1 sub -population groups. Considerations for Phase 1 subset groups include paid and unpaid persons serving in health care settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials; people who play a key role in keeping essential functions of society running and cannot socially distance in the workplace (e.g., emergency and law enforcement personnel, food packaging and distribution workers , teachers/school staff, childcare providers); adults with high -risk medical conditions who possess risk factors for severe COVID -19 illness; and people 65 years of age or older (including those living in Long Term Care Facilities [LTCF]). Due to insuffici ent COVID -19 vaccine supply initially to vaccinate all those who fall into sub -population groups, Delaware identified additional subsets within that group utilizing the Cyber security and Infrastructure Security Agency ( CISA ) guidance for categories of health care personnel22. Phase 2 planning includes the possibility of vaccine supply/demand mismatch when identifying subsets of population groups (see Figure 2 ). The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Adm inistration has information on classifying workers at risk (low to very high based on position within an organization) for exposure to SARS -CoV-2 which was utilized to determin e subsets of critical populations for vaccination. Also, Delaware will consider enumeration by place of employment rather than residence, as accounting for workers by place of employment will help to minimize underestimation of these critical populations. The convenience of receiving vaccination at the place of employment may also res ult in increased vaccination coverage. DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 20| P a g e A. Describe how your jurisdiction plans to: 1) identify, 2) estimate numbers of , and 3) locate (e.g., via mapping) critical populations. Critical population groups may include: Health care personnel Other essential wo rkers Long -term care facility residents (e.g., nursing home and assisted living facility residents) People with underlying medical conditions that are risk factors for severe COVID -19 illness People 65 years of age and older People from racial and ethnic minority groups People from tribal communities People who are incarcerated/detained in correctional facilities People experiencing homelessnes s/living in shelters People attending colleges/universities People living and working in other congregate settings People living in rural communities People with disabilities People who are under - or uninsured Several divisions, sections, and programs across the state, and specifically within the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services, were utilized to assist the state in identifying, estimating numbers of, and locating critical populations. The D HSS Division of Healthcare Quality oversees long -term care and assisted living facilities. The DPH's Community Health Services utilize trusted members of populations in vulnerable communities to connect with this group. The Medical Director with the Department of Corrections has provide d information on correctional facilities. The Division of Developmental Disabilities Services and Division of Services for Aging and Adults with Physical Disabilities maintain information on th ese population s. The Division of Med icaid & Medical Assistance, as well as several programs within DPH , provides assistance to those who are under - or uninsured. The state connect s with programs and sections that serve specific populations, such as those mentioned above, to better aid unders tanding of these populations. The internal workgroup is connecting with statewide divisions, sections, and programs to identify, estimate numbers of, and locate critical populations. DPH's Community Health Services has existing partnerships with several of the populations described above, such as people from racial and ethnic minority groups, and can assist in identification, estimating numbers of, and locating critical populations. Identifying, estimating numbers of, and locating critical populations are c ritical to determining the resources needed during the early phases of vaccination, including the number of vaccine doses, and the approach to vaccine administration. The resources and approach to administration will evolve as the vaccine supply expands. DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 21| P a g e Broadly speaking, epidemiologists with DPH currently leverage various data sources, such as My Healthy Community, to identify, estimate numbers of, and locate critical populations and subpopulations. Epidemiological data sources provide demographic information such as age, sex, race, and ethnicity, which will allow for ident ification of critical populations. Epidemiologists have been collecting surveillance data and conducting case investigations since March 2020; this data provides a wealth of information about the demographics of COVID -19 cases in the state and may provide insights into critical populations that can be served by the COVID -19 vaccine. Since July 2020, DPH has onboarded 16 new epidemiologists, data analysts, and public health professionals to assist with conducting the state's COVID response. The current COVID epidemiology team includes a data team comprised of three epidemiologists and two data analysts and is overseen by the State's Deputy Epidemiologist. The data team meets twice weekly to review data -related activities, such as analyzing testing event data. Additionally, the data team disseminates daily outbreak detection reports which drill down into specific locations and populations that may be at risk for COVID -19. The State Deputy Epidemiologist provides a daily update to state public health leadership on the number of new cases overall and by demographic group and geographic region. Thus, the results produced by the data team help create a better understanding of the state's critical populations and will be used to inform vaccine allocation/distribution efforts in the coming months. B. Describe how your jurisdiction will define and estimate numbers of persons in the critical infrastructure workforce, which will vary by jurisdiction. DPH utilize s connections with health systems, EMS agencies, and employers o f other essential personnel to estimate the number of persons in the critical infrastructure workforce, including identifying subgroups of individuals at greater risk for COVID -19. DPH solicit s input from employers to determine who is included in the critical infrastructure workforce . As the vaccine becomes available for distribution to certain populations, DPH will engage in the aforementioned activities to estimate the number of persons in the critical infrastructure workforce and incorporate this group with critical populations into the risk strat ification process . DPH has already sent out an online survey through the Medical Society of Delaware (see Section 5 below for greater detail) to assi st with provider recruitment and enrollment. Information gathered in the survey includes the number of staff at numerous health care organizations and practices across the state, therefore providing insight on the number of people in the critical infrastr ucture workforce as it relates to health care. DPH is in a unique position as it is the centralized health department (i.e., one department for the whole state as opposed to county or local health departments), and therefore has more streamlined channels of communication with partners across the state. Decisions about dissemination of information and coordination of immunization -related activities occur at the state level, which allows for a timelier and coordinated response as there are fewer avenues of co mmunication to maintain. Delaware hospitals provided estimates for risk stratification groups by a) number of direct patient care, b) support for direct patient care, C) essential employees that cannot work from DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 22| P a g e home and may come in contact with COVID pati ents, and d) others. Estimates for first responders (EMS/Fire/Police/Dispatch) have been completed. DPH has contracted with a vendor to assist with estimating v ulnerable population numbers , which was utilized to for vaccine planning in advance of the fir st vaccine allocation s at the end of 2020. C. Describe how your jurisdiction will determine additional subset groups of critical population s if there is insufficient vaccine supply . The Vaccine Coordination Unit within SHOC provide s recommendations for vaccine allocation in subset groups of critical populations if there is insufficient vaccine supply. Given that there is likely to be substantial overlap between subgroups in the critical populations identified above, targeted efforts may focus on specific populations most at -risk. DPH will also communicate with community leaders across the state to identify subset groups of critical populations based on COVID -19 prevalence and the status of the virus among these groups. DPH staff, incl uding leadership and epidemiologists, maintain s communication with employers of members of groups in Phase 1, such as health care systems, schools, and food packaging and distribution plants. The state will continue work ing with employers to estimate the n umber and composition of subset groups of critical populations based on vaccine availability. DPH has already collected some of this information with the survey mentioned above and described in greater detail below (Section 5). Key metrics of COVID -19 in t he state at the time that the vaccine becomes available, such as prevalence, positivity rate, and demographics of those infected, will also help identify additional subset groups of critical populations. The DPH Ethics Group will be activated to provide re commendations to the DPH Director when vaccine is in insufficient supply to administer to all members within an identified population group . The Ethics Group will also take into consideration the current ACIP workgroup recommendations to make decisions abo ut additional subset groups of critical populations. The state will continue to solicit input from employers of critical populations (such as health care workers) about specific subgroups that are most at risk for COVID -19 within the overall critical popul ation. D. Describe how your jurisdiction will establish points of contact (POCs) and communication methods for organization s, employer s, or communit ies (as appropriate) within the critical population groups. Community Health Services and the EMSPS Vulnerable Populations Coordinator will leverage existing relationships with community leaders who advocate for their communities, which may include individual s at increased risk for COVID -19. The State has created many partnerships with community members and leaders prior to and during COVID -19 and currently utilize these partnerships to identify points of contact (whether the current ones or new ones based on needs and expertise) within the critical population groups. Leadership and staff within Community Health Services can use their connections with community members to establish communication methods within critical population groups as appropriate. DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 23| P a g e Section 5: COVID -19 Provider Recruitment and Enrollment Instructions: A. Describe how your jurisdiction is currently recruiting or will recruit and enroll COVID -19 vaccination providers and the types of settings to be utilized in the COVID -19 Vaccination Program for each of the previously described phases of vaccine availability , including the process to verify that providers are credentialed with active, valid licenses to possess and administer vaccine . DPH is continually reaching out to potential COVID -19 vaccination providers and target ing the appropriate settings so that COVID -19 vaccination services are accessible to the initial populations of focus . Providers and settings that maximize the number of people who can be vaccinated have been identified for enrollment; it is important that jurisdictions ensure social distancing and other infection control procedures can be maintained in selected settings (see CDC guidance on vaccination during a pandemic). DPH has developed the Vaccination -Point -of- Dispensing Toolbox (Appendix G) to assist providers and organizations with vaccination planning and decision -making. All providers/settings, especially those enrolled for Phase 1, must be able to meet the reporting requirements discussed in Section 9: COVID -19 Vacci ne Administration Documentation and Reporting and Section 11: COVID -19 Requirements for Immunization Information Systems or Other External Systems. DPH is partnering with the private sector and with local hospitals and health systems to provide COVID -19 va ccination in the closest proximity possible to the initial populations of focus. Delaware is recruit ing additional COVID -19 vaccination providers to expand equitable access to COVID -19 vaccination as vaccine supply increases and will consider engaging both traditional and nontraditional vaccination providers and settings. To recruit interested providers, an online survey link was sent through the Medical Society of Delaware newsletter, Delaware Health Alert Network (DHAN), the email addresses of long -term care facility (LTC F) contacts, and kidney/dialysis centers in Delaware. The survey responses are used to determine interest and capacity to administer COVID -19 vaccine to patients and staff. Once the provider has received and agreed to completing the COVID -19 vaccinator checklist, they will be eligible for enrollment. The survey was released on September 1, 2020 without a deadline. The program will continue to monitor responses and enroll potential providers on a rolling basis. As March 2 , 202 1, 749 respons es were collected with 406 respondents approved, 94 respondents pending, and 73 expressing interest in administering COVID -19 to either patients, staff, or both. Once the vaccination provider was identified through the recruitment process, Phase 1 providers were sent the enrollment form to be filled out and return ed and loaded into VTrckS. Phase 2 and Phase 3 providers will receive an email containing a link to COVID -19 enrollment documents within the DelVAX . Both the Provider Agreement and Provider Profile information are in DelVAX as a PDF and can be downloaded for signature of the chief medical officer and chief executive officer. The enrollment template in DelVAX is built to require an Immuniz ation DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 24| P a g e Program User (user from the program approving the enrollment) to confirm the medical license. The medical license will be verified by the program user utilizing the Delaware Division of Professional Regulation License Look -Up webpage https://delpros.delaware.gov/oh_verifylicense . The information on this website will verify that the license is valid and supplies the issue and expiration date. Utilizing the online survey, interested providers will be screened to verify the ir specialty ( i.e., Geriatric, Family medicine, LTC F, etc.), approved vaccine storage units and staffing capacity to ensure proper vaccination of patients. Additionally, the provider will be screened to ensure their patient demographics meet one of the thr ee criteria: people at increased risk for severe COVID - 19 illness; people at increased risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID; or people with limited access to routine vaccination services. B. Describe how your jurisdiction will determine the provider types and settings t hat will administer the first available COVID -19 vaccine doses to the critical population groups listed in Section 4. DPH is currently collaborating with partners and EMS agencies in the three counties on initiatives to adminis ter vaccine in closed POD -type settings for selected populations. The DPH Office of EMS (OEMS) has developed the capabilit y to have adequate infrastructure and supplies to hold three PODs simultaneously . See Section 4C. DPH has established Closed POD agreements with hospitals, health care systems and first responder agencies to positively affect the administration of vaccine to critical work force populations. Hospitals have demonstrated with 2019 flu vaccine efforts that they can vaccinate approximat ely 75% of their workforce within three (3) days. Outlined below are the federal entities (and their respective populations) that will receive a direct allocation of COVID -19 vaccine. DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 25| P a g e C. Describe how provider enrollment data will be collected and compiled t o be reported electronically to CDC twice weekly, using a CDC -provided Comma Separated Values (CSV) or JavaScript (JSON) SAMS -authenticated mechanism. To receive/administer COVID -19 vaccine, constituent products, and ancillary supplies, vaccination provider facilities/organizations must enroll in DelVAX. Enrolled COVID -19 vaccination providers must be credentialed/licensed in the jurisdiction where vaccination takes place, and sign and agree to the conditions in the CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement. The vaccinating providers will enter their enrollment data and upload this information directly into DelVAX. Once this information is reviewed and approved, it will be downloaded directly to CDC using DelVax . A vaccine coordina tor is the POC for receiving vaccine shipments, monitoring storage unit temperatures, managing vaccine inventory, etc. The Immunization Program will encourage enrolled facilities/organizations to designate a vaccine coordinator role at each location as well as a back -up vaccine coordinator. To support more efficient distribution of vaccine, locations should offer full day receiving hours to the extent possible. When that is not possible, COVID -19 vaccination providers must be available to receive vaccine shipments during a 4 -hour window on a weekday other than Monday DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 26| P a g e D. Describe the process your jurisdiction will use to verify that providers are credentia led with active, valid licenses to possess and administer vaccine. The Immunization Program will use the information reported on the CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Profile Information Form to verify that the medical license number(s) are active and valid to both possess and administer vaccines by checking this information with the Delaware Division of Professional Regulation License Look -Up webpage https://delpros.delaware.gov/oh_verifylicense. A printable version of the verification is available and can be saved with the provider enrollment information. If any of these providers licenses are found to be invalid or if the provider is unable to possess or administer vaccines , the Chief Medical Officer and/or the CEO will be notified that the identi fied provider will not be able to administer and/or receive vaccine until the license information can be updated or resolved . Pharmacist licenses on enrollment forms will be verified through information provided by the Division of Professional Regulation . E. Describe how your jurisdiction will provide and track training for enrolled providers and list training topics. Providers will be notified of all required trainings through correspondence with the primary vaccine coordinators identified at every enroll ed CDC COVID -19 vaccine provider site. Prior to the enrollment process, providers that do not report administered doses electronically via HL7 or flat file will have to complete training for direct data entry into DelVAX. There is currently a Training Mate rial module built into DelVAX which contains training guidance (Quick Reference Guides) for vaccine ordering and inventory management, CDC's You Call the Shots , and a Reports Training section that contains training information on using the reminder/ recall functions within DelVAX. Training documents for the provider enrollment process have been developed. The You Call the Shots training materials will be updated to address specific COVID - 19 vaccination once CDC makes this information available. The Immunization Program will require the providers to submit their training certificates from CDC You Call the Shots training to the pr ogram office. Completion of all other required provider trainings will be self -reported from the vaccinating providers by utilizing and submitting a completed Provider Training form to the program. This data will be entered into an Access or E xcel database so it can be monitored. CDC has develop ed a variety of clinical educational and training resources for health care professionals related to COVID -19 vaccine(s). Each manufacturer has also develop ed educational and training resources for its individual vaccine candidate. The list may change or be updated as appropriate (see table below). DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 27| P a g e F. Describe how your jurisdiction will approve planned redistribution of COVID -19 vaccine (e.g., health systems or commercial partners with depots, smaller vaccination p roviders needing less than the minimum order requirement). All COVID -19 vaccine transfers will be coordinated through the Immunization Program utilizing a process similar to the transfer of publicly funded vaccines guidance and will be provided to all vaccinating provider sites regarding the procedures and requirements for redistribution of COVID -19 vaccines. This guidance will adhere to the Vaccine Transport section of the CDC Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit (see Appendix A). Once the provider contac ts the Immunization Program via email or phone requesting to redistribute vaccine, the provider will DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 28| P a g e be emailed a Vaccine Transfer Form (See Appendix B) to complete and return to the Immunization Program. G. Describe how your jurisdiction will ensure there i s equitable access to COVID -19 vaccination services throughout all areas within your jurisdiction. The DPH Ethics Group is being consulted, along with the Health Equity Bureau to assess availability and equitable access for the available vaccine. The Vaccine Allocation Framework (Appendix F) is regularly updated and publicly shared in this document which has been placed on the DPH webpage . H. Describe how your jurisdiction plans to recruit and enroll pharmacies not served directly by CDC and their role in your COVID -19 Vaccination Program plans. CDC has collaborate d with CVS and Walgreens to provide on -site vaccination clinics for L TCF residents. CDC is working closely with LTCFs, jurisdictions, CMS, professional trade organizations that serve LTCFs and assisted living facilities, and pharmacy partners to inform facilities o f their options to receive COVID -19 vaccine. Depending on when LTCF staff is prioritized to receive vaccine, they will be covered under this plan (if prioritized at the same time as residents) or covered under Delaware's plan for vaccinating health care workers/essential populations (if prioritized before residents). If staff is prioritized before residents, any staff not already vaccinated may be vaccinated through the on -site clinics offered by pharmacy partners. To vaccinate a broader population group in Phase 2, vaccine will be allocated and distributed directly from the federal government to select pharmacy partners ; allocation through this program is separate from Delaware's weekly allocation . Direct allocation opportunities will be provided to retail chain pharmacies and networks of independent and co mmunity pharmacies (those with a minimum of 200 stores). There a re 20 small Delaware pharmacie s currently partnering for vaccin e administration. All partners must sign a pharmacy provider agreement with the federal government. As part of such agreement, before receiving COVID -19 vaccine, the partner must propose, in writing, its minimum capacity for vaccine administration, including a) the number and location of facilities that will administer COVID -19 vaccine, b) the estimated number of COVID -19 vaccine do ses that each facility will be able to administer within defined periods, and c) estimated cold chain storage capacity. On a daily basis, pharmacy partners must report to CDC via designated methods the number of doses of COVID19 vaccine a) ordered by store location; and b) on hand in each store reported through VaccineFinder. Pharmacy providers will also be required to report CDC -defined data elements related to vaccine administration to DelVAX . CDC will provide information on these data elements and report ing methods if stores are not able to directly provide data to DelVAX . Partnerships with pharmacies will need to be synchronized with jurisdictions to improve vaccination coverage and ensure transparency across the COVID -19 Vaccination Program. Pharmacies are enrolled in DelVAX. Designated staff identify smaller pharmacies and train those sites for enrollment in DelVAX. The Delaware Board of Pharmacy and Delaware Pharmacist DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 29| P a g e Assoc iation are partner s; the program will be used to ensure all pharmacies have had an opportunity to enroll in DelVAX. Presently, there are less than five small pharmacies that are not enrolled in DelVAX. DPH does not anticipate using these pharmacies during phase 1. Additionally, Delaware pharmacie s are actively contacting the Immunization Program to express interest in becoming a COVID -19 vaccination partner ; contact information is being collected . An on-boarding process has been developed , which include s license verification through the Bureau of Professional Regulation . DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 30| P a g e Section 6: COVID -19 Vaccine Administration Capacity Instructions: A. Describe how your jurisdiction has or will estimate vaccin e administration capacity based on hypothetical planning scenarios provided previously. B. Describe how your jurisdiction will use this information to inform provider recruitment plans. The DPH utilize s the Pandemic Vaccination Campaign Planning Tool to help determine the vaccination capacity for the COVID -19 vaccine response for the State of D elaware. The results from the tool help ed to target where the vaccine can be most effectively used. The results from this to ol informed discussion s in the COVID vaccination planning group to assist in determin ing the best course in providing COVID -19 vacci nations in every phase of the response. If effective , DPH should be able to ascertain the time it will take to vaccinate the adult population in the State of Delaware. DPH reach ed out to the health s ystems during the week of October 12th, 2020 to discuss vaccine planning and allocation. Further outreach to other agencies has been accomplished , with progress reported to the Vaccine Planning Committee. CDC has also developed a tool to assist with estimating vaccination capacity. The newest versio n of this tool, the PanVax Tool for Pandemic Vaccination Planning (version 3.3), is available on the CDC website. The Immunization Program will enter the information into the planning tool once a consensus is reached on the following areas: 1. Population to b e vaccinated 2. Provider vaccination groups 3. Provider group vaccination scenarios 4. Vaccine availability 5. Vaccine allocation 6. Monthly vaccine availability Once the data is entered and agreed upon, the vaccination planning group can use the information to determine the strengths and shortfalls in provider groups starting in Phase 1 of the response. Knowing the capacity of the provider groups is key, especially in determining to what extent that other provider groups (Example: pharmacies supporting community clinics ) can supplement to fill in the gaps to optimize vaccine availability and allocation. This is especially important in P hase 1 of the response, as the goal is to vaccinate this population as quickly as possible using the vaccine that is available. Once the state enters Phases 2 & 3, and vaccine becomes more readily available, the vaccination planning group can use the data from the planning tool, data from the CDC program Tiberius, and data from the Data Lake to forecast coverage rates, completion dates for differing age groups and have the ability to target areas of need. DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 31| P a g e Section 7: COVID -19 Vaccine Allocation, Ordering, Distribution, and Inventory Management Instructions: A. Describe your jurisdiction 's plans for allocating /assigning allotments of vaccine throughout the jurisdiction using information from Sections 4, 5, and 6. Include allocation methods for populations of focus in early and limited supply scenarios as well as the variables used to determine allocation. The Ethic Grou p utilized the ACIP vaccine allocation guidance to formulate the Delaware -specific vaccine allocation recommendations to DPH leadership on December 22, 2021. The Delaware COVID -19 Vaccine Allocation Framework was approved and instituted following the se recommendations and is continuously reviewed and modified as a result of the ever -changing vaccine landscape. The most recent version of the COVID -19 Vaccine Allocation Framework can be found on the Delaware Coronavirus webpage https://coronavirus.delawar e.gov/wp - content/uploads/sites/177/2020/12/DPH_COVID -Vaccine -Allocation - Phases_Public_122920_With -cover.pdf Ancillary supplies will be packaged in kits and will be automatically ordered in amounts to match vaccine orders in VTrckS. For centrally distribut ed vaccines, each kit will contain supplies to administer 100 doses of vaccine, including needles (#105), syringes (#105), alcohol prep pads (#210), surgical masks (#4), face shields (#2), and COVID -19 vaccination record cards for vaccine recipients (#100) . If a COVID -19 vaccine that requires mixing with diluent is ordered and shipped from CDC's centralized distributor, a mixing kit that includes the necessary needles, syringes, and alcohol prep pads will also be automatically added to the order. Ancillary supply kits will not include sharps containers, gloves, and bandages. Additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be needed depending on vaccination provider site needs. B. Describe your jurisdiction's plan for assessing the cold chain capability of i ndividual providers and how you will incorporate the results of these assessments into your plans for allocating/assigning allotments of COVID -19 vaccine and approving orders. As part of the enrollment process, specific information regarding vaccine stora ge capabilities and equipment is collected. DelVAX has an asset management functionality that is used for those providers capable of uploading temperature monitoring data via a .csv file. The goal is to maintain similar procedures that already exist and a re familiar to providers (e.g., protocols from the Vaccine for Children (VFC) Program. Information collected during enrollment will include type of storage unit (pharmacy grade, household, commercial, etc.); temperature capabilities of the storage units; t emperature DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 32| P a g e monitoring equipment ( hospital -based system, continuous temperature monitoring, etc.); capacity; and appropriate equipment and training to transfer vaccine if necessary. C. Describe your jurisdiction's procedures for ordering COVID -19 vaccine, inc luding entering/updating provider information in VTrckS and any other jurisdictional systems (e.g., IIS) used for provider ordering. Describe how you will incorporate the allocation process described in step A in provider order approval. Entering/ Updatin g Provider Information in VTrckS and DelVAX: Providers will be created in VTrckS and DelVAX utilizing information obtained from the COVID -19 Vaccine Provider Enrollment Initiation form. Once providers are established in VTrckS, provider information will be updated by ExIS file upload from the DelVAX Master Date File (twice daily). Allocations: Allocations will be managed in a process similar to the influenza vaccine allocations. Provider orders are submitted and entered onto an order template (excel spre adsheet). Doses requested or allocated are totaled. If all doses can be ordered, all orders are processed utilizing the template via VTrckS order upload. If only a percentage can be processed due to limited allocation, that percentage is established f or the doses needed, keeping in mind the minimum dose requirement. Balances are determined and the spreadsheet is maintained as a master file in order to send balances once the allocation is updated. To support more efficient distribution of vaccine, locat ions should offer full day receiving hours to the extent possible. When that is not possible, locations identified to receive vaccine and ancillary supply shipments must be available during a 4 -hour window on a weekday other than Monday to receive those shipments. COVID -19 vaccinat ion providers will be required to report COVID -19 vaccine inventory daily using VaccineFinder. Once providers are enrolled in VTrckS, they will be preregistered for a VaccineFinder account and provided instructions via email on how to submit daily supply i nformation. D. Describe how your jurisdiction will coordinate any unplanned repositioning (i.e., transfer) of vaccine . The Immunization Program staff trained and experienced in vaccine transfers utilize an approved process for transferring vaccine. Immunization Program staff responsible for transferring vaccine have been trained on storage and handling of ultra -cold COVID vaccine utilizing revised guidance from CDC. Specific providers may be authorized by the Immunization Program to transfer vaccine from one location to another within their organization. All transfers are coordinated and approved by the Immunization Prog ram staff. Vaccine transfers are entered in DelVAX under the Inventory Management module. DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 33| P a g e Vaccine Transfer reports may be accessed using DelVAX's Inventory Transfer Inquiry. Entities must sign and agree to conditions in the CDC COVID -19 Vaccine Redistribut ion Agreement for the sending facility/organization and have a fully completed and signed CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Provider Profile for each receiving location. E. Describe jurisdictional plans for monitoring COVID -19 vaccine wastage and inventory levels. COVID-19 vaccine wastage and inventory levels are monitored utilizing VTrckS allocation reports daily and requiring vaccine wastage reporting via DelVAX. DelVAX COVID -19 vaccine inventory reconciliation will be required weekly, and the DelVAX Inventory Manag ement reports is utilized by Immunization Program staff to monitor inventory levels. DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 34| P a g e Section 8: COVID -19 Vaccine Storage and Handling Instructions: A. Describe how your jurisdiction plans to ensure adherence to COVID -19 vaccine storage and handling requirements , including cold and ultracold chain requirements, at all levels : Individual provider locations i. Specific information regarding vaccine storage capabilities and equipment will be collected as part of the enrollment process . ii. Information collec ted during enrollment will include type of storage unit (pharmacy grade, household, commercial, etc.); temperature capabilities of the storage units; temperature monitoring equipment ( hospital -based system, continuous temperature monitoring, etc.); capacit y; and appropriate equipment and training to transfer vaccine if necessary. Hospital systems will be contacted about ultra -cold temperature capacity. Satellite, temporary, or off -site settings i. Any satellite or temporary site location will have the appropriate vaccine storage unit for the type of vaccine that is being administered. Digital data logging equipment will be with the storage unit to track the temperature of the vaccine at these locations. ii. The Immunization Program will provide trainings o n vaccine storage and handling and for all personnel responsible for the management of the vaccine before these temporary vaccination sites are conducted. A manual with the CDC Storage and Handling Toolkit information and temperature excursion information will be provided to the team leads of these clinics. Planned redistribution from depots to individual locations and from larger to smaller locations i. The DPH warehouse will have the appropriate vaccine storage unit for the type of vaccine that is being stored and administered . Digital data logging equipment will be with the storage unit to track the temperature of the vaccine at these locations. ii. All personnel responsible for the management of the vaccine will have the appropriate training on vaccine storag e and handling from program and CDC resources . iii. Local transport of vaccine from one location to another within the jurisdiction may be necessary but should only occur only on a limited basis. Only enrolled providers with an approved Redistribution Agreement will be permitted to redistribute COVID -18 va ccine. An approved Redistribution Agreement must include standard operating procedures describing the process for validating cold -chain procedures in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and CDC's guidance on COVID -19 vaccine storage and handli ng. Unplanned repositioning among provider locations DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 35| P a g e i. Any surplus vaccine among provider locations , except for approved redistribution providers, will be transported back to the DPH warehouse in the appropriate transport equipment by Immunization Program personnel . B. Describe how your jurisdiction will assess provider/redistribution depot COVID -19 vaccine storage and temperature monitoring capabilities. Primarily, the redistribution will be managed and conducted by the Immunization Program staff who are train ed and experienced in vaccine transfers. The staff will utilize the current state- approved process for transferring vaccine. In some case, specific providers may be authorized by the Immunization Program to transfer vaccines from one location to another wi thin their organization. These provider transfers must be approved and coordinated by the Immunization Program staff prior to transporting any vaccine. Those providers that are approved to transport vaccines, have demonstrated to the program that they have the proper vaccine transport unit and temperature monitoring devices to redistribute the vaccines and the knowledge of packing out the vaccines as described in the CDC Vaccine Management Toolkit. SHOC survey ed hospital systems to determine if they can store the vaccines at the ultra -cold temperatures. For those with the capability , direct ship ments to these sites were made to avoid the need to redistribute . It is not recommended to transport vaccine s that need ultra -cold chain temperatures to maintain viability ; however, vaccine can be kept for 5 days (120 hours) between 2C and 8C to allow for off -site vaccine administration. If the shipping container is used for vaccine storage, the manufacturer recommends only opening the shipping conta iner twice a day. Vaccine stored in a refrigerator should be used first before additional vials are removed from frozen storage as vaccine cannot be refrozen once thawed. Vaccine should also be shielded from light. Vaccines vials should have beyond -use d ates (BUDs) documented prior to transport of vaccine. Every vaccine storage unit/container must have a temperature monitoring device. CDC recommends digital data loggers (DDLs). One vaccine product is stored at ultra -cold temperatures and will require a D DL that can register these temperatures. CDC is currently exploring options to support acquisition of DDLs for use with ultra -cold vaccines. However, jurisdictions should continue to identify options to obtain DDLs for use with ultra -cold vaccines, in addi tion to the DDLs needed for storage of refrigerated and frozen ( -20\u00b0C) vaccines. DDLs using a buffered temperature probe provide the most accurate measurement of vaccine temperatures. However, many manufacturers use pure propylene glycol (freezing point -59\u00b0C) or a glycol mixture with a warmer freezing point in their probes. For accurate temperature monitoring of ultra -cold vaccines, it is essential that an air -probe or a probe designed specifically for ultra -cold temperatures is used with the DDL. DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 36| P a g e Section 9: COVID -19 Vaccine Administration Documentation and Reporting Instructions: A. Describe the system your jurisdiction will use to collect COVID -19 vaccine doses administered data from providers. Delaware vaccine providers will use DelVAX. B. Describe how your jurisdiction will submit COVID -19 vaccine administration data via the Immunization (IZ) Gateway. C. DPH has approved and submitted the CONNECT Data Use Agreement ( DUA ). DPH has received a confirmation email that the onboarding for the IZGateway Connect is complete for Delaware. In a recent conference call with DPH's DelVax vendor, Envision Technology Partners, DPH was informed that vaccine administration data would no longer be reported via Connect to CDC but via a flat file (CVRS Covid -19 Vaccine Reporting Specifications) to the CDC Data Clearinghouse. This is according to information the IIS vendors have received from CDC. Delaware's DelVax vendor is committed to providin g this extract flat file for Delaware. D. Describe how your jurisdiction will ensure each COVID -19 vaccination provider is ready and able (e.g., staff is trained, internet connection and equipment are adequate) to report the required COVID -19 vaccine admin istration data elements to the IIS or other external system every 24 hours. Providers who are currently onboarded with DelVAX to submit vaccine administration data via their EMR/EHR system will continue to report in this manner. Those providers who have n ot onboarded with DelVAX will be required to perform direct data entry of doses administered. Training for provider staff will be provided. E. Describe the steps your jurisdiction will take to ensure real -time documentation and reporting of COVID -19 vaccine administration data from satellite, temporary, or off -site clinic settings. Delaware is utilizing a web based system to register the Delaware population for immunizing at off-site clinic settings, along with using the Vaccine Administration Management Sys tem (VAMS) to report administration data to DelVax. DPH has the option of utilizing a mobile application that provides patient registration, vaccination reporting and inventory management for use at satellite, temporary, or off -site clinic settings . F. Describe how your jurisdiction will monitor provider -level data to ensure each dose of COVID -19 vaccine administered is fully documented and reported every 24 hours as well as steps to be taken when providers do not comply with documentation and reporting requirements. DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 37| P a g e Where possible, providers are set up as Type III full inventory providers where doses will be decremented from inventory, dose by dose, as the administration is being recorded. Those sites not set up as full inventory ( i.e., VFC providers ar e aggregate reported currently and will need to remain aggregate even if receiving COVID -19 vaccine), the Immunization Program utilizes DelVAX reports (i.e., doses administered, Patients Detail with Services, inventory reconciliation, etc.) to monitor vacc ine inventory and reporting. G. Describe how your jurisdiction will generate and use COVID -19 vaccination coverage reports. DelVAX contains many \"canned\" reports that can be utilized by DPH to monitor and evaluate COVID -19 vaccination distribution, storage/h andling, administration, and reporting. Some example reports available are: Reminder/Recall Patients with Vaccine Refusals Doses Administered Immunization Rates Vaccine Shipments/order status/returns inquiry/return status. DPH also has the availability to have ad -hoc reports created as needed by Delaware's DelVax vendor through the vendor contract .

DELAWARE COVID -19 VACCINATION PLAYBOOK 45| P a g e Section 14: COVID -19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Instructions: A. Describe how your jurisdiction will ensure enrolled COVID -19 vaccination providers understand the requirement and process for report ing adverse events following vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The Immunizations Program has p ublished information on the state COVID -19 webpage on the options for report ing Vaccine Adverse Events, which is standard practi ce for Delaware vaccine providers. They are required to report to VAERS any additional adverse events and/or adhere to any revised safety reporting requirements per FDA's conditions of authorized vaccine use posted on FDA's website throughout the duration of the EUA, as applicable. Vaccinat ion providers should also report any additional clinically significant adverse events following COVID -19 vaccination to VAERS, even if they are not sure if the vaccination caused the event. DPH ensure s that enrolled COVID -19 vaccination providers understan d the procedures for reporting adverse events to VAERS. More information on submitting a VAERS report electronically can be found at https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html . CDC has implemented V-safe, a new smartphone -based tool that uses text messaging a nd web surveys to check in with vaccinated individuals for adverse events after a COVID -19 vaccination. V-safe will also provide second -dose reminders (if needed) and live telephone follow up by CDC if vaccinated individuals report a medically significant event during a V-safe check -in. V-safe asks questions that help CDC monitor the safety of COVID -19 vaccines. Medically significant events will be identified if the vaccinated individual reports that they missed work, were unable to complete normal daily ac tivities, or had to seek care from a health care provider or health care professional. The information will be used to analyze common side effects (soreness in the arm, muscle aches, etc.) and to detect unexpected, serious health problems if they occur.

OWS's goal is to produce and deliver 300 million doses of safe and effective vaccines, with the initial doses available before th e end of 2020. The following high -level distribution update is provided to aid jurisdictions to further refine their implementation plans. This approach for centralized vaccine ordering and distribution will be executed in phases by CDC in collaboration wi th jurisdictions, tribes, federal agencies receiving a direct allocation of vaccine, and commercial partners. The information below covers four key topics: 1. Allocation 2. Ordering 3. Receipt, storage, and handling 4. Operational norms The information within t hese sections will continue to evolve as new information becomes available. Allocation: COVID -19 vaccine will be allocated according to the following principles: Allocations will be calculated pro -rata based on the size of the jurisdiction's population and the quantity of ready -to-ship doses from manufacturer(s). Allocation amounts will be communicated to jurisdictions weekly. These allocations will be immediately available for ordering. If a jurisdiction does not order the full allocation, the remaind er will roll over for future ordering. Unused allocations will not be reallocated to other jurisdictions. For the two initial vaccine candidates, two doses will be required, and the same product must be used for both doses. Two -dose vaccine allocations wi ll be managed in the following way: In coordination with vaccine manufacturers, CDC will reserve and store inventory of second dose product to include in future allocations for ordering at the appropriate time (e.g., 2 weeks after first doses are ordered for a product requiring the second dose on Day 21). CDC does not expect jurisdictions or federal and commercial partners to maintai n physical inventory of second - dose product (i.e., jurisdictions will not be expected to store product for 21 -28 days to prepare for second -dose administration). Ordering: The COVID -19 Vaccination Program will utilize CDC's VTrckS system. 1. Each jurisdic tion, federal agency, and commercial partner will receive allocations (order caps) weekly in VTrckS. 54| P a g e 2. Jurisdictions, federal agencies, and commercial partners will submit orders for vaccination provider sites. These orders will be processed against the al location (order cap). a. Federal and commercial partners may pull order files from the Vaccine Provider Ordering Portal (VPoP) to upload into VTrckS. 3. Orders will be scheduled for delivery Monday through Friday. Direct -Ship Vaccine (Vaccine A): Jurisdictions are asked to identify locations to receive early shipments of this vaccine once the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issues an Emergency Use Au thorization (EUA) but before the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meets and makes recommendations for use and the recommendations are approved. This will ensure that product is available at the jurisdictional level and jurisdictions are ready to support vaccine administration after ACIP recommendations are issued and approved. A. The minimum order volume for Vaccine A is 975 doses. B. Each jurisdiction is asked to identify delivery sites to receive initial shipments of product. Jurisdictio ns can decide what quantity to order for each initial site (in 975 -dose increments), based on what is feasible to administer. Jurisdictions are encouraged to finalize site locations as soon as possible. Jurisdictions will be asked to confirm these sites once an EUA has been authorized. C. After ACIP recommendations have been approved, additional sites will be able to place orders against their jurisdiction's allocation. Vaccine will be delivered within 24 -48 hours of order placement. D. Along with vaccine, each site will receive ancillary kit s and an initial dry ice resupply: Ancillary supply kits will include diluent and administration materials (including appropriate needles, syringes, alcohol swabs, and limited PPE). Ancillary supply kits will be automatically added to vaccine orders and do not require additional action or separate orders from jurisdictions/sites. CDC will provide details on dimensions of ancillary supply kits once the information is confirmed. OWS will provide an initial dry ice resupply to facilitate storage in coord ination with each vaccine shipment. Jurisdictions will have the option to allow sites to opt out of the Final decisions about vaccinat ion timing of populations will not be made until closer to implementation; jurisdictions should have multiple scenarios p repared for local distribution and administration. initial dry ice resupply if desired. Sites will receive this initial dry ice resupply in coordination with receipt of the product, as they will need to replenish the dry ice upon product receipt. Further details about shipping and receipt of dry ice will be forthcoming. Receipt, Storage, and Handling: CDC is updated its Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit , to include a COVID -19 Vaccine Addendum, which will provide guidance on each vaccine product. CDC will also provide additional product -specific materials, including storage, handling and administration job aids. CDC will provide these resources as soon as possible. 55| P a g e The Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/index.html . General Additional web pages with clinical guidance will be added as COVID -19 vaccine products become available. Vaccine A: Thermal shipping containers with Vaccine A will arrive with a GPS -enabled temperature monitoring device that will monitor temperature excursions in transit as well as at the vaccination provider site, if used. If a jurisdiction/site plans to store product in an ultra -low temperature (ULT) freezer, the jurisdiction/site must remove vaccine trays from the thermal shipping container before moving them to the freezer. The jurisdiction/site must then monitor the temperature inside the ULT freezer using standard protocol to ensure temperature excursions are identified quickly. Once the vaccine is removed from the thermal shipping container and put in the ULT freezer, the temperature monitoring device accompanying the vaccine can no longer be used; a digital data logger (DDL), or other appropriate monitoring method, will be needed. A jurisdiction/site may also use the thermal shipping container for temporary storage of the vaccine. Instructions will be provided for monitoring vaccine temperatures in the thermal sh ipping container using the device that is available on the shipper (details will be forthcoming). In addition, storage and handling instructions for vaccine stored in the thermal shipper will be made available by the manufacturer and in CDC's storage and h andling tool kit. Please also see Vaccine information in this CDC Playbook. Operational Norms: Jurisdictions should operate under the following assumptions and account for the following variables: Vaccine will be authorized by FDA (EUA). ACIP will make recommendations for vaccine use, including populations for phased allocation of initial doses. Vaccine is expected to be recommended in a phased approach by ACIP until supplies allow for broader administration. Jurisdiction and federal ag ency plans will need to be updated regularly as additional information becomes available and implemented in a timely manner. 56| P a g e Planning Appendix: The following materials are being provided to inform planning activities.

Other Considerations National/statewide trends and data (at -risk groups) Operational considerations (staff levels, critical services/infrastructure, available supply, etc.) Logistics (vaccination staff/resources, storage, venue support requirements) Time sensitivity (ability to vaccinate large groups within the timeframe) Situations and A ssumptions The COVID -19 vaccine allocation phased groups for Delaware were developed based on ethical decision -making only; logistics were not a consideration. The initial allocation of COVID -19 Vaccine to the State of Delaware will not be adequate to prot ect all the Phase 1 groups8. The initial allocation of vaccine must be distributed and administered in a very short period due to storage and utilization requirements and urgency to reduce transmission during the pandemic. Operational decision -making is u sed to consider the physical ability to vaccinate within the Phase 1 sub-groups in order to efficiently utilize the anticipated vaccine supply with the resources available and within the limited timeframe. The vaccine delivery timeline will drive the allo cation of resources among the phases; overlap of phased groups is likely . Flexibility is permitted to adjust phased groups based on current trends and public health needs. The balance of the Vaccine Allocation Framework is a separate document maintained on the Delaware Coronavirus webpage at https: //coronavirus.delaware.gov/vaccine/vaccination -timeline/ .

A Vaccination POD, or V -POD , is a location for the high -volume administration of a vaccine for your facility staff or a specific group, such as patients, clients, or the public. By choosing to sponsor a V -POD, you can efficiently vaccinate your staff/clients who choose to receive the COVID -19 vaccine. Do I need to do a V -POD? If you have fewer than 10 clients per hour that wish to be vaccinated, a full V -POD is probably not necessary . One clinically licensed staff member will typically be able to manage the vaccination process for this level of client flow per hour (throughput). As throughput demand exceeds 10 clients per hour, an additional clinically licensed staff member can be added to manage the vaccination process without a full V -POD. Once throughput exceeds 20 clients per hour, logistical and administrative support becomes necessary, and a modified or single line V -POD is recommended to maintain organization, efficiency, and safety. Becoming a Provider for Vaccines Enrolled Provider or Partnering? To participate, your organization must choose one of these options: Option 1 Enroll as a \"Provider\" 9 and administer internally. This option assumes that you have a licensed clinical provider authorized to provide vaccinations. Option 2 Partner with a \"Provider\" organization such as a pharmacy or healthcare system who will complete ordering, receive and store the vaccine, and administer the vaccine. How can my organization find an enrolled provider to partner with? Contact COVIDVacci ne@delaware.gov to request enrolled Provider partner list. DPH Vaccination Partner List: https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/vaccine/dph -vaccination - partner -list/ 9 In order to register as a Provider, the organization must have a medical license.

Iden tify the appropriate target population(s) that your organization wish es to vaccinate at the V -POD o Target populations must correspond to the current Vaccination Phase groups. Refer to https://coronavirus .delaware.gov/vaccine/ for the most current phase group information. Determine the total number of appropriate people that wish to be vaccinated at the V-POD . o DPH or the enrolled Provider partner will require this number to order vaccines. What if I still need help planning my V -POD? Email your direct support request to COVIDVaccine@delaware.gov and a representative will contact you to provide assistance. Note - Place \"V -POD Support\" in the email subject line to clearly identify your specific need. What information does my organization need to place a vaccine order? Provider ( self-enrolled or partner?) . Estimated # of clients to be vaccinated . Location, date, time and duration of V-POD (s). V-POD layout and staff ing plan . Point of Contact /responsible party. Note: The process for ordering vaccine can be found here: V-POD Planning Toolbox 63 | P a g e DRAFT - Do not copy, quote, cite, or publish When can my organization place an order for vaccine? Once your organization is enrolled or you establish a partnership with a provider - an order for the vaccine can be placed through DelVAX. Vaccine availability is limited. Delaware is following federal and state recommendations for phased allocation of vaccines. Based on the order requested, t he Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) and Immunization Program will allocate vaccines to your organization when they are available and as appropriate. How does the vaccine get to my organization? Once allocated, the vaccine will be delivered directly to your site either from the vaccine manufacturer or from DPH. V-POD Planning Toolbox 64 | P a g e DRAFT - Do not copy, quote, cite, or publish Section 2 - Prepare for the V -POD Once the planning considerations have been addressed in Section 1, Section 2 describe the key considerations in the V -POD preparation process including: the ordering of vaccine, determining the delivery date, and assuring the integrity of the vaccine cold -chain transport and storage requirements. Key Considerations Your organization (as an enrolled provider) or your enrolled provider partner will submit the vaccine order for the V -POD using the total number of appropriate people for vaccination developed i n Section 1. The requested date of the vaccine must align with your organizations scheduling of persons to be vaccinated and staff to support the vaccination effort. However, the date is also dependent on vaccine availability. Receive notification of when vaccine will be made available and delivered to your organization. Begin steps to prepare for the V -POD. Planning for the V-POD must include the following infection prevention measures : o Social distancing o Personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff and recipients o Enhanced sanitation efforts Infection Control Measures Clean and disinfect vaccination stations at a minimum every hour, between shifts and if station areas become visibly soiled10. Ensure all patients and accompanying attendants wear a cloth face covering or face mask that covers the nose and mouth. If a patient or attendant is not wearing a cloth face covering, ensure face coverings or face masks are available. Ensure staff is wearing appropriate PPE11 including cold/inclement weather gear if operating in limited/unprotected environments Ensure supplies such as tissues, hand sanitizer, and wastebaskets are readily accessible throughout the V -POD. 10 CDC Gui dance for Cleaning and Disinfecting - https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 - ncov/community/pdf/Reopening_America_Guidance.pdf 11 Vaccine Administration: Personal Protective Measures https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/downloads/COVID -19-vaccine -administration -PPE-508.pdf Figure 1 - Vaccine allocation sequence V-POD Planning Toolbox 65 | P a g e DRAFT - Do not copy, quote, cite, or publish Infection Control Measures Brief staff on personal protective equipment (PPE) optimization techniques (when PPE resource availability is limited)12. Make sure there are signs, barriers, and floor markers throughout the V -POD to instruct patients to maintain a 6 -foot distance from others and promote use of hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette. Determine timeframe for vaccination - Based on the target population and how many vaccinators are available, determine the schedule for vaccination . o Plan to use all allocated vaccines within 5 days of receipt . o Consider minimum staffing levels required for continued operations if V -POD(s) are operational during normal business hours. o Schedule vaccinations accordingly. o Consider scheduling staff for vaccine admi nistration the day before a scheduled day off when possible . V-PODs can be setup several different ways to best accommodate the size, goals, and layout of the organization and best fit the facility/location. The general processes and activities of the V -POD will remain the same. In preparation for the V -POD consider the five stages of the V -POD: Select a suitable location based on total volume, access, throughput, vaccine storage and tempera ture control. Specific space considerations include: o Walk -through V -POD : Room for social distancing in all queue lines and Observation areas. Note: Hybrid structure may utilize parking area as observation to meet social distancing requirements and maximize space. o Drive -through V -POD : Adequate vehicle space and traffic flow in lines and Observation area. o Appropriate restroom facilities (drive -through). o Access for those with access and functional needs . o V-POD staff breakroom areas . Set up your V -POD in the l ocation to ensure functionality. Consider the following: 12 Vaccine Recomm endations and Guidelines of the ACIP, Vaccine Administration - https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip -recs/general -recs/administration.html Figure 2: V-POD Stages V-POD Planning Toolbox 66 | P a g e DRAFT - Do not copy, quote, cite, or publish o Set up the V-POD stations, tables with location of equipment marked (use tape/paper to indicate approximate location of supplies/equipment), and observation areas . o Run the V-POD process through for p ractice and to ensure flow/timeframe is realistic and effective . o Take pictures/diagram confirmed layout to facilitate ease of set on the day(s) of the V-POD . o Document set up time and time to return the space and equipment back to normal operations; include this time in your V-POD planning . Secure sufficient supplies to meet the needs of staff and the highest anticipated number of people receiving vaccination . o Refer to Appendix A - Position Tools Ensure V -POD staff are trained13,14 Prepare for vaccine storage and handling15 o Vaccine transportation, storage, and handling requirements change based on the particular vaccine directed to your organization . For additional vaccine planning considerations such as supplies , and materials see : o DPH Vaccine Provider Administration Site Checklist : https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/wp -content/uploads/sites/177/2020/12/Vaccine and C ommunication To promote your V -POD: o Be clear about who the V -POD is for \u2014those who have an appointment, those who have been prescreened, healthcare workers, high -risk populations, etc. Use signage at the V -POD to provide this information, including how to m ake an appointment or where to get vaccinated if someone does not meet the V -POD criteria. o Provide instructions on how to set up appointments if prescheduling will be used. o Consider providing a point of contact and/or resource e -mailbox for questions and assistance with registration paperwork prior to the V -POD. 13 CDC Skills Checklist f or Vaccine Administration - https://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p7010.pdf 14 CDC You Call the Shots, web -based training courses - https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ed/youcalltheshots.html 15 CDC Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit - https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/index.html V-POD Planning Toolbox 67 | P a g e DRAFT - Do not copy, quote, cite, or publish o Scale your promotion to the amount of vaccine that will be available. o Use multilingual and multimedia channels to widely post V -POD purpose, dates, locations, times, and population that will be serv ed. Be prepared to: o Communicate other options if scheduling is unable to meet demands (e.g., direct persons to other facilities, if possible). o Use electronic communication, as appropriate, to share V -POD information such as asking participants to download screening forms or review the VIS(s)16 or Emergenc y Use Authorization (EUA17) fact sheets before coming to the V -POD. V-POD Setup Setup Considerations Utilize an appointment -only approach if possible, to assure appropriate social distancing. Large -scale administration with long lines may not allow for social distancing. For walk -through V -PODs, it is important to establish queue lines that maintain separation between individuals or to ask individuals to wait in their vehicles or another location until called . Consider using online or phone options for s cheduling appointments and completing paperwork, when possible . Type of Setup For i ndoor V -POD s, consider use of a school, church, auditorium, theater, pharmacy, hallway, classroom, or cafeteria with adequate space for each process stage. Curbside or drive -through V -POD . Outdoor walk -through V -POD or V -POD in an outdoor tent outside a facility . Mobile V -POD in a larger vehicle like a bus or trailer that allows for in one door and out another flow. V-POD Organizational Structure Establishing and identifying the organizational structure is critical in ensuring staff understand who to report to, where to go for leadership and questions, and ensure there is oversight of each function and activity of the V -POD. The following is the su ggested organization structure of a high -capacity V -POD.

Supervisor and/or manager positions may be filled and/or added as the V -POD Manager recognizes that they need help supervising sta ff as the number of lanes/lines increase. V-POD Throughput Staffing Considerations Throughput V-POD Structure Staffing <10 Clients per hour No V -POD required ; vaccination team can provide vaccinations and observation in the work or other designated area. Add second team member to manage additional <10 additional clients . V-POD Manager is responsible for the coordination of all vaccination activities including distribution, tracking, documentation and return of unused supplies. Single clinically qualified staff Second clinically qualified staff member may be added to handle <10 additional clients per hour Trigger for expansion At throughput of 20 or more per hour, the vaccine process will require logistical, operational, and administrative support to maintain compliance, efficiency, and safety. A full V -POD is recommended. V-POD Planning Toolbox 69 | P a g e DRAFT - Do not copy, quote, cite, or publish V-POD Safety and Security The organization operating the V -POD is responsible for the overall safety of the V -POD team and security and monitoring of the vaccines allocated to it. o The V -POD Manager assumes overall responsibility for activities related to safety. The appointment of a Sa fety Officer with the authority to end unsafe practices should be considered for high -volume V -PODs. Consider: Overall infection prevention practices (see page 5) including the wearing of face coverings and social distancing for persons in queue lines. Adequate and appropriate PPE for staff to include masks, face shields, gloves, and gowns. Safe handling and sharps containers for safe disposal of syringes/needles. o Designate a space or system to secure vaccine and protect V -POD staff and their valuables.

Upon notice of scheduled vaccine delivery, activate inter nal V-POD processes (staff, setup , etc.) V-POD Operation The basic V -POD functions are described in Figure 4: V -POD Stages and Activities . For further detail, refer to Appendix A - V-POD Position Tools . The V-POD Manager is responsible for monitoring all stages to assure smooth and efficient functioning of the V-POD . The V-POD Manager must also monitor the inventory level of the vaccine throughout the V-POD s opening to assure: o That there is an adequate supply for those to receive the vaccine. o That there is not an undue amount of vaccine leftover at the close of the V -POD. This is not an issue if the V -POD is to reopen in the following days.

V-POD Planning Toolbox 96 | P a g e COVID Vaccine Screening Quick Guide * At this time, it is recommended that the COVID -19 vaccine not be given within 14 days of any other vaccines. Therefore, you should not get the COVID -19 vaccine if you have had another vaccine within the last 14 days, and you should not get any other vacc ines for 14 days after receiving the COVID -19 vaccine. This applies to both the first dose and second dose of the COVID -19 vaccine. * If you have received either monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma as a treatment for COVID -19 infection, you must wait 90 days before getting vaccinated. * If you are a close contact that is deemed to require quarantine due to COVID -19, you should not get the vaccine until out of quarantine. * If you are currently diagnosed with COVID -19 and advised to isolate, you should not get the vaccine until out of isolation. * If someone says they are pregnant, may be pregnant, lactating/breastfeeding -say, \"you are advised to have a risk/benefit discussion with your OB/GYN prior to vaccination. do you still wish to proceed ?\" * You may receive the vaccine if you are taking blood thinners , watch the injection site for bleeding. * TB tests (TST or IGRA) are not a contraindication for receiving the COVID -19 vaccine. A known need for a TB test is generally prioritized when timing receiving the COVID -19 vaccine. It is important to weigh the risks and benefits of delaying TST/IGRA with your pro vider/employer. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid - 19/info -by-product/clinical - considerations.html * Any previous immediate allergic reaction to polysorbate (of any severity) or polyethylene glycol/Miralax is an absolute contraindication. *If you have h ad an immediate allergic reaction\u2014even if it was not severe \u2014to any ingredient in an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine, CDC recommends that you should not get either of the currently available mRNA COVID -19 vaccines. If you had an immediate allergic reaction after gett ing the first dose of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine, you should not get the second dose. *People who have had severe allergic reactions or who have had any type of immediate allergic reaction to a vaccine or injectable therapy should be monitored for at least 30 minutes after getting the vaccine. All other people should be monitored for at least 15 minutes after getting the vaccine. * Information about the date of receiving the second dose is not confirmed but should be at least 28 days.
