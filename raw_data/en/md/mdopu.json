Dexter Peach Assistant Comptroller General Executive Summary Purpose Since 1983, federal agencies with large research and development bud- gets have operated Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programs to strengthen the role of small innovative firms in federally supported research and development. SBIR awards to small business have totaled over $1.35 billion through fiscal year 1988. In reauthorizing SBIR programs in 1986, the Congress directed GAO to study their effectiveness in meeting SBIR goals, which are to (1) stimu- late technological innovation, (2) use small businesses to meet federal research and development needs, (3) increase private sector commercial- ization of innovations from federal research and development, and (4) encourage participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in techno- logical innovation. The Congress also directed GAO to compare the qual- ity of SBIR research with more traditional agency research and to obtain the views of agency and department heads on how SBIR programs have affect+ other research activities at their agencies. To obtain informa- tion ox. IOW well SBIR programs are meeting their goals and on the qual- ity of research, GAO sent questionnaires to firms with SBIR projects and to government project officers responsible for SBIR and other research. Background SBIR legislation gives the Small Business Administration responsibility for issuing directives for the general conduct of SBIR programs, but each agency with an SBIR program is unilaterally responsible for targeting research areas, reviewing proposed projects, and making research awards. The legislation requires a three-phase process for SBIR pro- grams: Phase I is a 6-month test of scientific merit and feasibility; Phase II provides funding for 1 to 2 years of further development; and Phase III consists of either nonfederal funding or federal, non-sBIR, funding for developing applications of the SBR research for either private sector or government use. When an agency's external research and development obligations exceed $100 million, SBIR legislation requires the agency to spend 1.25 percent of those obligations on SBIR projects. In 1988, 11 agencies conducted SBIR programs. The Department of Defense (DOD) is responsible for about 55 percent of all SBIR funding. Together, DOD, the Departments of Energy (DOE) and Health and Human Services (HHS), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NM), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are responsible for 96 percent of all SBIR funds. At each agency a small staff of SBIR program managers coordinates the management of the program, while project officers throughout the agency normally oversee Page 2 GAO/RCED-W39 Assessment of SBIR Programs Executive Summary or monitor individual SBIR projects in conjunction with responsibility for other research. Results in Brief All agencies seek to stimulate technological innovation and to encourage and foster the participation of minority and disadvantaged firms, but the agencies differ in the emphasis they place on the remaining two SBIR goals. DOD and NASA emphasize meeting federal research and develop- ment needs with projects directed toward specific mission requirements. In contrast, programs at NSF and HHS focus on the SBIR goal of private sector commercialization and solicit projects within broader technologi- cal areas. Overall, agency project officers assessed 29 percent of the SBIR projects as being of higher quality than other research under their responsibility and half as being of the same quality. Project officers differed from agency to agency in their overall assessment of research quality and in specific factors, such as the likelihood that projects will lead to new sci- entific or technical discoveries and the skills and expertise of the project staff. At all agencies, however, project officers rated SBIR projects as more likely than other research to lead to inventing and commercializing new products. In general, the 11 agency heads that provided judgments concerning the effect of SBIR legislation on their research programs reported favorable impacts. Although they differed on specifics, most agencies reported that SBIR programs had developed new research areas, placed more emphasis on the application of research results, and led to wider use of small businesses as research performers. Principal Findings Meeting Program Goals To stimulate technological innovation, SBIR programs have adopted pro- cedures to identify and select technically superior and innovative pro- posals. Agency project officers consider many SBIR Phase II projects to be technologically innovative. F'urthermore, firms responding to GAO'S questionnaire reported that they probably or definitely would not have undertaken 64 percent of their SBIR projects without SBIR funding. According to the questionnaire responses, these projects are about as likely as other projects to result in patents or market testing, indicating Page3 GAO/RCED-W39 Assessment ofSBIRRopams Executive Summary that SBIR programs are encouraging technological innovations that might not occur otherwise. Heads of agencies and project officers responsible for SBIR projects reported that SBIR programs help meet their agency research and devel- opment needs. SBIR program managers and project officers identified ways in which SBIR programs helped accomplish this, including support of high-risk research and research on technologies with long-range potential. Agencies differ in their efforts to use small business to meet research and development needs. DOD and NASA solicit and fund SBIR projects that meet specific agency research and development objectives, while NSF and HHS select projects with high potential for private sector commercialization, within broad categories of technological interest to the agency. Other agencies fall between these extremes. These differ- ences in agency emphasis are reflected in proposal solicitation and in research management. In comparison with NSF and HHS, DOD and &GA proposal solicitations are more specific and their projects are more closely monitored. Because only a small portion of all SBIR projects have completed Phase II. it is too soon to make a thorough analysis of how well SBIR programs are promoting commercial innovation. But, preliminary analysis, based on questionnaire responses by firms, indicates that some projects are mov- ing toward commercialization. Agencies differ in the emphasis they place on commercial potential in evaluating proposals. NSF. for example, places heavy emphasis on plans for commercial development that include follow-on funding commitments by outside parties. Other agen- cies vary in the emphasis they place on follow-on funding commitments. The Small Business Administration and agencies with SBIR programs fos- ter and encourage participation by minority and disadvantaged persons through outreach activities to inform them about SBIR activities. Accord- ing to the Small Business Administration, the percentage of money awarded to minority and disadvantaged firms was lower in fiscal years 1986 and 1987 than in the 2 previous fiscal years; however, agency offi- cials believe some inaccuracies may exist in the data on minority firm participation in SBIR. Quality of SBIR Projects To compare the quality of SBIR projects with other agency research. GAO sent questionnaires to 530 project officers who monitor SBIR research as well as other projects at the 5 agencies providing 96 percent of all SBIR funding. Overall, respondents assessed 29 percent of the SBIR projects as Page4 GAO/RCED-8%39Asse~mentofSBIRPrograms Executive Summary being of higher quality than non-sBIR research and indicated that about half of the SBIR projects were similar in overall quality to other research. Project officers at all agencies rated SBIR projects substantially higher than other research under their responsibility regarding the potential for leading to the invention and commercialization of new products, processes, or services, with NSF having the highest level. Agency project officers differed, however, on other factors, such as the likelihood that the project will lead to new scientific and technical discoveries. Judgments of Department The heads of the 11 departments and agencies with SBIR programs and Agency Heads reported generally favorable effects on agency research programs. For example, seven agencies identified ways in which SBIR programs help attain their research goals through filling gaps in other agency research programs, expanding in new research directions, and other means. Recommendations GAO is not making recommendations in this report. Agency Comments GAO asked the 11 agencies that conduct SBIR programs, as well as the Small Business Administration, to comment on a draft of our report. The agencies either had no comment on the report or expressed agreement with its contents.

The Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-219) requires that all agencies with yearly extramural (external) research obligations of more than $100 million establish SBIR programs to solicit research proposals from small business and provide funds for those proposals that are judged most qualified. In 1986 the Congress reauthorized the Small Business Innovation Development Act until 1993. SBIR awards to small businesses have totaled about $1.35 bil- lion through fiscal year 1988. SBIR program goals are to l stimulate technological innovation, l use small businesses to meet federal R&D needs, l increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal R&D, and l foster and encourage participation by minority and disadvantaged per- sons in technological innovation. How the SBIR Program Is Administered Responsibility for SBIR program administration is shared between the Small Business Administration (SBA) and participating R&D agencies. SBIR legislation requires that SBA issue policy directives for the general con- duct of the program. However, each participating F&D agency has unilat- eral responsibility for determining the research areas to be included in its SBIR program, receiving and evaluating research proposals, selecting awardees, and administering payments. SBA has issued directives that include instructions for preparing agency SBIR program solicitations and for accepting and processing project pro- posals. It has also provided guidance for agencies in issuing standard- ized and timely program solicitations and for minimizing the regulatory burden of firms participating in the program. To be eligible for an SBIR award, SBA'S SBIR program policy directive states that small businesses must be l independently owned and operated, l other than the dominant firms in the field in which they are proposing to carry out SBIR projects, l organized and operated for profit, Page 10 GAO/RCED49-39 Assessment of SBIR Pwpuns chapter 1 Introduction l the employer of 500 or fewer employees (including employees of subsid- iaries and affiliates) . the primary source of employment for the project's principal investiga- tor at the time of award and during the period when the research is conducted, and . at least 51 percent owned by U.S. citizens or lawfully admitted perma- nent resident aliens. The SBIR legislation requires agencies to evaluate and fund SBIR propos- als in a three-phase process. Proposals compete for SBIR funding in two phases. Phase I provides funds to test the proposal's scientific and tech- nical merit and its feasibility. After completion of Phase I, the highest rated proposals are selected for Phase II, which provides funds for fur- ther development of the proposed ideas. Phase III consists of either nonfederal funding or federal, non-SBIR, funding for commercial applica- tions of the research conducted under the SBIR programs. According to SBA directives, most Phase I awards should be for $50,000 or less and cover a 6-month work period, while most Phase II awards should be for no more than $500,000 and cover up to 2 years of work. In addition to the $1 billion provided for fiscal years 1983-87, as shown in table 1.1, SBA has estimated that agencies awarded $350 million for fiscal year 1988 SBIR projects, for a total of about $1.35 billion through fiscal year 1988. Table 1.1 shows the number of SBIR awards that have been made and funding levels through fiscal year 1987, the last year for which detailed data are available.

The staff of these SBIR units, which we refer to as SBIR program managers, typically devote most or all of their time to SBIR activities. In addition to the SBIR administrative staff, other agency research personnel are also involved in the selection of SBIR proposals and oversight of projects. These research personnel, which we refer to as SBIR project officers, oversee individual SBIR projects in conjunction with other research responsibilities. The formal titles of the SBIR project officers vary from agency to agency. The SBIR legislation requires that each agency allocate at least 1.25 per- cent of its external R&D obligations for SBIR projects when its total exter- nal obligations exceed $100 million.3 Because agencies differ widely in the size of their external research budgets, their SBIR obligations differ greatly. DOD has by far the largest SBIR program, with fiscal year 1987 obligations of about $194 million. In contrast, the SBIR programs at IISDA, Commerce, DOED, m, EPA, and NRC each received less than $4 million in 1987. As figure 1.1 shows, 5 agencies were responsible for 96 percent of all 1987 SBIR awards. Appendix I contains additional information on fis- cal year 1987 awards by each agency.

In addition, we issued a legal opinion in 1988 in which we concluded that federal agencies were not precluded from vol- untary participation in SBIR. In an October 25, 1985, report entitled Implementing the Small Business Innovation Development Act -The First 2 years (GAO/RCED~~-13), we assessed the extent to which agencies established, funded and moni- tored SBIR program activities. We found that in fiscal years 1983 and 1984, 11 out of the 12 federal agencies that met the criteria for creating SBIR programs had established such programs. During fiscal year 1985, all 12 eligible agencies had carried out SBIR activities. We concluded that the agencies, for the most part, were complying with the act's funding Page 13 GAO/RCED&XB Assessment of SBIR Programs Chapter 1 Im3-oducdon requirements but that most were not fully adhering to the act's report- ing requirements concerning the reporting of small business participa- tion goals. Our March 21. 1986, report entitled Research and Development: A Pro- file of Selected Firms Awarded Small Business Innovation Research Funds (CAO!RCED%-1 13~s) provided information on 19 small firms partic- ipating in the SBIR program and discussed the availability of venture capital funds for commercializing results developed with SBIR awards in response to a congressional request for information. Our report, Federal Research: Effectiveness of Small Business Innova- tion Research Program Procedures (GAO/RCED-~~~~, June 2, 1987), evalu- ated federal agencies' procedures for making SBIR selections and awards. We found that federal agencies with SBIR activities had established eval- uation and selection procedures that reasonably ensured that awards were based on technical merit. However, less than one half of the partic- ipating agencies had awarded their SBIR Phase I contracts and grants within 6 months of receiving the proposal, a goal established by SBA guidelines. In addition, we could not determine the length of time needed to make Phase II awards at many agencies because of limitations in agency data. Federal Research: Small Business Innovation Research Participants Give Program High Marks ~GAO/RCEDS~-~G~BR, Julv 27. 1987) contains infor- mation on the characteristics of SBIR recipient firms, the reported effects of the program on firms' operations and products, and the firms' percep- tions of the administration of the program. On March 15, 1988, we issued a legal opinion (B-230594.2), at the request of the Chairman of the House Committee on Small Business, on whether the NRC could maintain an SBIR program if its extramural R&D budget dropped below $100 million. We concluded that federal agencies are not precluded from voluntary participation in SBIR, even when their external R&D budget is below $100 million. NRC subsequently decided to continue its SBIR program on a voluntary basis during fiscal year 1988. Objectives, Scope, and This report was prepared in response to Public Law 99-443. which Methodology reauthorized SBIR programs until 1993. The law directs GAO to report on the effectiveness of Phase I and Phase II of the SBIR program. including l the extent to which the goals of the SBIR program are being met, Page 14 GAO RCED-9939 Assessment of SBIR Programs chapter 1 Inwoduction l the quality of the research supported by the SBIR program compared with that traditionally supported by the affected agencies, and l the judgments of the heads of departments and agencies as to the effect of SBIR legislation on research programs. Public Law 99-443 requires GAO to report on SBIR Phase III activities by December 31, 1991. Accordingly, this report includes only preliminary information on this aspect of SBIR activities. To obtain information on the SBIR program goals of stimulating techno- logical innovation and increasing private sector commercialization and to obtain information on current project status, we selected 1,406 SBIR projects that had been conducted in fiscal years 1983 through 1985, according to a stratified sampling plan described in appendix V. We mailed the firms that conducted these projects a questionnaire asking for information about the firms' experiences with the SBIR program and the characteristics of the firm at which the project took place. We adjusted the analysis of responses to reflect the stratification of the pro- ject sample, as described in appendix V. The questionnaire, summary of responses, response rate, and selected sampling errors are included in appendix II. To obtain information on the goals of stimulating technological innova- tion and meeting federal R&D needs, as well as the quality of SBIR research projects in comparison with other research supported by R&D agencies, we mailed two types of questionnaires to 530 project officers who had administered SBIR projects in DOD, DOE, HHS, NASA, and NSF- agencies that together administer 96 percent of all SBIR funds. All project officers received one questionnaire asking for responses concerning the SBIR program in general, as well as one or more questionnaires concern- ing individual SBIR projects that they had been responsible for. The ques- tionnaire concerning individual SBIR projects asked the project officers to compare the SBIR project with non-sBIR research for which they were responsible. To measure research quality, we asked project officers to compare specific SBIR projects with other research that they were responsible for according to factors that we identified as potentially rel- evant to research quality by consulting science policy experts, reviewing published material, and pretesting questionnaires. To obtain information concerning incomplete or unclear responses, we followed up with tele- phone calls to selected respondents to all three questionnaires. The ques- tionnaire concerning the SBIR program in general, together with a summary of responses and response rate, is included in appendix III. The questionnaire about individual SBIR projects, with responses and Page 15 GAO/RCELM%N Assessment of SBIR Program Cbpter 1 Introduction response rate, is included in appendix IV. Appendix V contains informa- tion on the selection approach and the techniques we used for all questionnaires. We interviewed SBIR program managers and other officials and reviewed recordsin DOD,DOE,DoED,HHS,NASA,NSF,EPA,NRC, and SBAto obtain information about efforts to foster and encourage participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation and about the extent to which program goals are being met and the quality of SBIR research. We also consulted with experts in research evaluation, technological innovation, and government policies to encourage the com- mercialization of R&D. These experts were located in government agen- cies, academic institutions, and private practice. We also solicited. and received, judgments concerning the effect of SBIR legislation on research programs in 11 agencies: USDA, Commerce, DOD, DOED, DOE, HHS, Dur, EPA, NASA, NSF, and KRC. Their responses are included in appendixes VI through XVI. We performed this review in accordance with generally accepted gov- ernment auditing standards. This review was conducted from September 1987 to September 1988, primarily at the agencies' headquarters offices in the Washington, D.C., area. Page 18 GAO/RCED-89-39 Asoewment of SBIR Prom Chapter 2 Are SBIR Programs Meeting Their Goals? Three of the four SBIR program goals- to stimulate technological innova- tion, use small business to meet federal R&D needs. and increase private sector commercialization of innovations from federal R&b-are comples. interrelated, and hard to measure. For example, the development of new technological innovations may be critical to meeting federal R&D needs. Private sector commercialization, which depends on the development of new technological innovations, may contribute to meeting federal R&D needs in areas such as health or aeronautics. Although all agencies seek to stimulate technological innovation, agencies differ in the emphases they place on meeting federal R&D needs and on increasing private sector commercialization of federal R&D. SBA and agencies with SBIR programs seek to achieve the fourth SBIR pro- gram goal-to foster and encourage participation by minority and dis- advantaged persons- through outreach programs to inform them about SBIR activities. According to data compiled by SBA, the percentage of money awarded to minority and disadvantaged firms was lower in fiscal years 1986 and 1987 than in the 2 previous fiscal years, but SBA officials believe that the data may contain some inaccuracies because of inconsis- tent reporting by participating firms. DOD and NASA have SBIR programs that strongly emphasize the goal of meeting federal R&D needs by soliciting and funding projects that are closely coordinated with agency applied R&D programs to meet agency mission objectives. In contrast, programs at NSF and HHS emphasize the selection of projects with high potential for private sector commerciali- zation within broad technological categories of interest to these agen- cies, and SBIR projects are less closely coordinated with other agency programs, which focus mainly on basic research at academic institu- tions. SBIR programs at other agencies, such as DOE, seek-like DOD and NASA-to meet specific agency R&D objectives with some projects but also try to support private sector commercialization with other projects. Stimulating Technological Innovation Technological innovation is a complex, hard to measure process, and federal agencies seek to stimulate technological innovation in many dif- ferent areas. Although difficult problems in assessing technological innovations exist, and only limited comparisons are possible across the wide range of federal efforts to stimulate innovations! several factors indicate that SBIR programs have been supporting projects that contrib- ute to technological innovation. Page17 Chapter 2 he SBIR PIWIWM Meeting Their Gods? l SBIR programs have adopted highly competitive selection procedures to identify those proposals of highest technical quality and innovative potential, and only about 5 percent of the proposals obtain funding through Phase II. l According to their questionnaire responses, agency project officers rated many Phase II projects as technologically innovative and in general ranked many SBIR projects more likely than other research for which they were responsible to lead to inventing and commercializing new products, processes, and services. . Responding to our questionnaire, firms reported that a high proportion of projects would not have been undertaken without SBIR funding. In analyzing the questionnaire responses, we found that projects that prob- ably or definitely would not have been undertaken without SBIR funding were about as likely as other projects to produce patent applications, or lead to market testing, and somewhat less likely to result in follow-on R&D or commercial products, indicating that SBIR programs are contribut- ing to technological innovations that might not have occurred otherwise. Firms also indicated that they are continuing R&D on some projects after SBIR funding is completed. Difficulties in Measuring Although definitions vary, there is widespread agreement that techno- Technological Innovation logical innovation is a complex process, particularly in the development of sophisticated modem technologies. Technological innovation can involve many steps, including research, engineering, prototype testing, and product development. The steps necessary for technological innova- tion can differ, depending on the specific situation. Technological inno- vation is closely related to the process of commercialization, which includes the development and marketing of new goods and services. It is important to recognize that technological innovation is an uncertain pro- cess so that, even in an ideal world, the results of the SBIR projects would not be all positive: supporting truly innovative, ground-breaking research implies that failed or unsuccessful projects will be a regular. and even frequent, occurrence. Measuring technological innovation is difficult, for several reasons. Because technological innovation occurs in many different ways, no one indicator can accurately assess innovativeness. For example, patents may serve as a good indicator of technological innovation in the devel- opment of some products but be less useful in measuring other innova- tions, such as new computer software. where patents are less relevant. In addition, differences among firms can create'measurement problems. Page 18 GAO/RCED-89-39 Assessment of SBIR Programs Chapter 2 he SBIR Progmma Meeting Their Gods? Some innovative firms will file many patent applications, while others will prefer to retain trade secrets. Because of the wide diversity in the R&D responsibilities of federal agen- cies, the agencies seek to encourage innovation in many different tech- nological areas, making comparisons difficult, NASA, for example, seeks innovation in areas related to aeronautics and astronautics, such as new aircraft designs, power systems for spacecraft, and lightweight con- struction methods. Similarly, DOD, DOE, HH~, and other agencies try to develop new technologies that can help them meet mission responsibili- ties in areas such as defense, energy, and health. In addition to supporting technological innovation to meet a wide range of mission responsibilities, agencies also support research to improve fundamental scientific knowledge that can ultimately lead to technologi- cal innovations. NSF funds basic research at universities in a wide range of disciplines, while HHS provides almost all federal support for basic research in biological areas related to health needs, and DOE is responsi- ble for basic research concerning high energy and nuclear physics. Other agencies also fund lesser amounts of basic research. Selection of SBIR Projects SBIR programs seek to promote technological innovation primarily through the identification and funding of project proposals with high scientific and technical merit. SBA has established the following criteria, which must be considered in the evaluation of Phase I and Phase II SBIR proposals: . the technical approach and the anticipated benefits to be derived from the research, . the adequacy of the proposed effort and its relationship to fulfilling the requirements of the research topic or subtopics, . the soundness and technical merit of the proposed approach and its incremental progress toward topic and subtopic solution, and . qualifications of the proposed principal investigators. When Phase II proposals are of equal technical and scientific merit, spe- cial consideration is to be given to proposals that demonstrate commit- ments from nonfederal sources to support further development after completion of Phase II (Phase III follow-on funding commitments). An SBA official said that a main purpose of these criteria is to identify pro- posals of high technical merit that are likely to lead to innovations. In addition to directing use of these criteria, SBA encourages SBIR programs Page 19 GAO/RCEWJCi9 Aamxwnent of SBIB Prolpam~ Chapter 2 AR SBLB Programs Meeting Their Gods? to adopt proposal selection procedures used in funding other agency research. At all agencies, the selection procedure starts with a widely distributed proposal solicitation, usually issued annually. In some agencies, awards decisions are made by the central SBIR office after the awards are reviewed and rated by technical officers, while at others the decisions are made in a decentralized manner. In a June 1987 report,' we reviewed the selection procedures for SBIR awards at 11 agencies. All agencies used four procedures to ensure selec- tion of proposals of high technical quality: (1) evaluations by technical experts, (2) use of SBA's selection criteria, (3) utilization of a system to rate or rank proposals, and (4) selection based on a ranking system. While we found some differences in emphasis among agencies, we con- cluded that agencies are making a good faith effort to maintain a system that is fair and provides for final selection based on technical merit. Although innovation is not addressed specifically by SBA'S selection cri- teria, all agencies have revised SBA'S criterion concerning technical merit to include consideration of a proposal's innovativeness and originality in making Phase I awards. In addition, the following factors indicated SBIR programs were funding proposals of high technical quality: l the SBIR proposal selection process was highly competitive, because a large \"pool\" of proposals was available for agencies to consider in selecting proposals that meet standards of technical quality; . the high average scores received by successful proposals indicated that quality research was being funded under agencies' SBIR programs: and l SBIR program managers judged the quality of funded proposals as good to excellent.

As table 2.1 shows, since 1984, about 15 percent of the proposals have received the relatively small Phase I awards. In fiscal year 1987, only 35 percent of the projects completing Phase I were selected for the larger Phase II awards. Thus, only about 5 percent of all proposals received Phase II funding in 1987. SBIR Project Officer Our mail questionnaires asked SBIR project officers to assess (1) how Responses Concerning well SBIR programs stimulate technological innovation, (2) whether indi- Technological Innovation vidual SBIR projects were innovative, and (3) whether individual SBIR projects were more likely than other research for which the officer was responsible to lead to innovation and commercialization. As table 2.2 shows, a large majority of project officers responded that the SBIR pro- gram definitely or probably supports technological innovation. The per- centage of project officers that thought that the SBIR program certainly or probably helped stimulate technological innovation was highest at NASA (89 percent), followed by DOD (88 percent), DOE (78 percent), HHS and NSF (73 percent each). Table 2.2: Project Officer Responses Concerning SBIR Support of Technological Innovation Project officer response for all agencies Defimtely yes or probably yes Uncertain Percentage 83 12 Defmltely no or probably no 5 Source GAO questlonnalre When we asked about specific Phase II SBIR projects that the officers had managed, 23 percent of the project officers rated the project as very innovative, while 38 percent believed their project was moderately inno- vative. Only 5 percent reported that the project that they managed was not innovative at all. Project officers at different agencies again varied in their assessments of individual projects. NASA project officers rated Page 21 GAO/RCED-99-39 Assessment of SBIR Programs Chapter 2 Are SBlR Programs Meting Their Goah? the highest percentage of projects in our survey as moderately or very innovative (73 percent), followed by DOD (64 percent), DOE (63 percent), HHS (48 percent), and NSF (48 percent). Project officers believed that over half (53 percent) of the SBIR projects were more likely than non-sBm research under their responsibility to produce inventions or products. Another 29 percent of the SBIR projects were assessed as having the same likelihood of invention or commercial- ization as non-.sBm projects. (Ch. 3 includes more information on these responses as part of our analysis of research quality.) SBIR Firm Responses To obtain information on whether SBIR projects were funding research Concerning Technological that would not be done otherwise, we asked firms whether they would Innovation have undertaken the research without this support and then analyzed the reported results of these projects. We also asked firms whether they were continuing F&D on projects that were no longer receiving SBIR funding. Firms reported that much of the research would not have been under- taken without SBIR. Only 16 percent said they would have definitely or probably done the research without the SBIR program, 20 percent were uncertain, and 64 percent said they definitely or probably would not have proceeded. We analyzed the questionnaire responses to see whether completed projects that firms probably or definitely would not have undertaken without SBIR program support had produced results similar to those of other completed SBIR projects, to determine whether SBIR has encouraged firms to undertake worthwhile projects. Table 2.3 shows these responses for six factors we identified as indicative of the project's innovativeness and technical merit, including the willingness of the firm to continue R&D after SBIR funding has been completed, preparation of journal and conference papers, patent applications and awards, market testing, and sales.

These projects were, however, somewhat less likely to result in continuing R&D or have results that were being sold commercially. To determine whether SBIR programs encouraged firms to invest addi- tional resources in R&D after completion of SBIR funding, we asked firms about the current status of SBIR projects. Firms responding to our ques- tionnaire indicated that SBIR programs encouraged them to continue R&D using their own funds. Firms reported that they are continuing R&D on 49 percent of all SBIR projects that have completed Phase II. In addition, some firms have decided to continue R&D when projects did not receive a Phase II award. Firms reported continuing R&D on 34 percent of the projects that did not receive Phase II funding. In comments added to their questionnaire responses, several SBIR awardees told us that especially risky efforts would not have been undertaken by their firms without SBIR support. For example, one firm said that SBIR funding from DOE had helped it develop a new medical device to the stage at which it could be demonstrated to the private sec- tor. A second company with an SBIR project investigating the use of X- rays noted that the program's support had allowed it to develop projects that investors were often unwilling to back. Page 23 GAO/RCED89-39 Assessment of SBIR Programs Chapter 2 Are SBLR Programs Meeting Their Goals? Using SBIR Programs Agencies with large R&D programs have different needs because of dif- to Meet Federal R&D ferent mission responsibilities and different ways of managing and over- seeing research. These differences are reflected in the solicitation of SBIR Needs proposals, the ranking and selecting of such proposals for funding, and the management of the SBIR projects. Despite these differences, agency and department heads generally indicated that their SBIR programs were helping to meet R&D needs. About three quarters of the project officers also responded that SBIR programs probably or definitely helped meet agency R&D needs. In addition, project officers said that through SBIR programs, agencies support many projects that they would not other- wise sponsor. In their opinion, about half of the projects probably or definitely would not have been funded if the agency did not have an SBIR program. Differences R&D Needs in Agency DOD and hx% conduct a high proportion of applied research and devel- opment to meet specific defense, aeronautic, and space technology needs in addition to some basic research. Much of their applied research and development is performed through contracts with private industry, under the supervision of agency managers. On the other hand, NSF and HHS fund a much higher proportion of basic research through grants to universities than do DOD and NASA. Such basic research is performed with little supervision by NSF or HHS officials. DOE, like DOD and N.&L supports applied research but, like NSF and HHS, also supports basic research, particularly in the field of high energy and nuclear physics. NASA and DOD conduct their SBIR programs primarily to meet specific objectives as an integral part of agency R&D programs. In contrast, SBIR projects at NSF and HHS differ from other research at.these agencies in that they have an applied research focus and emphasize private sector commercialization. NSF and HHS solicit proposals within broad technolog- ical areas and emphasize the selection of proposals with high potential for private sector commercialization. As a result, SBIR programs at these agencies are less coordinated with other agency research, which tends to be fundamental in nature and does not emphasize commercialization. At DOE, SBIfi -ejects in some areas, such as magnetic fusion and basic energy research, are geared toward specific agency R&D objectives. while those in other areas, such as energy conservation and fossil fuel, focus on private sector commercialization. Page 24 GAO i RCED-89-39 Assessment of SBIR Programs Chapter2 Are SBIR Rorpams Meeting Their Goala? Agencies Differ in Management of SBIR Programs The difference in how agencies seek to meet R&D needs is reflected in how they solicit, select, and manage SBIR proposals. For instance, DOD'S annual SBIR solicitation identifies specific tasks in hundreds of different technical areas, such as the design of body armor, self-sealing truck radiators, and underground chemical storage technology. In contrast, NSF'S annual solicitation simply lists about 20 general scientific areas, such as materials research and advanced scientific computing, with a few examples of potential projects from each, and encourages any pro- posals that fall under these general headings. The National Institutes of Health, which manage almost all HHS research, have a policy of consider- ing any proposal in the health area, whether or not it is responsive to a research area specified in its solicitation. In addition to differing in the solicitation of proposals, agencies also dif- fer in how they rank SBIR proposals for funding. DOD and NASA follow a decentralized approach in which research managers throughout the agency rank proposals for funding. NSF and HHS use a more centralized approach that relies upon experts from outside the agency to rank projects. At DOE, SBIR proposal reviews are carried out by experts from both inside and outside the agency. Agencies also differ in their management of SBIR projects. As table 2.4 shows, project officers at DOD and NAS are much more likely to stay in close touch with SBIR awardees over the course of the research project than those in NSF and HHS. DOD and NASA SBIR program managers told us that their agency project officers normally stay in close contact with SBIR and other research contractors to monitor mission-related applied research. In contrast, NSF and HHS project officers normally have less contact with grant recipients because there is no direct agency oversight of research, according to SBIR managers at these agencies.

Attitudes of Agency Officials In their written responses to us concerning SBIR R&D, the heads of 11 agencies and departments provided information on how SBIR programs helped meet their agency R&D needs. Our questionnaire to project officers also asked whether SBIR programs helped meet agency R&D needs and what contribution individual SBIR projects had made in meeting R&D needs. The 11 agency and department heads generally replied that their SBIR programs were helping to meet R&D needs. (See ch. 4.) Their responses differed, however, in the specific contributions reported for SBIR pro- grams. DOD and NASA, for example, emphasized how SBIR projects helped fulfill R&D mission needs. On the other hand, NSF stated that its SBIR pro- gram complemented its basic research programs by providing a linking mechanism to the marketplace. Like NSF, HHS said that the primary pur- pose of its SBIR program was to increase the commercialization of the results of federally funded R&D. Many project officers monitoring SBIR projects also believed that SBIR programs helped meet agency F&D needs. Of the respondents to our questionnaire, 41 percent reported that the SBIR program definitely helped meet agency R&D needs, and another 37 percent thought that the program probably did so. Only 10 percent thought that SBIR programs probably or definitely made no contribution to agency research needs. However, as table 2.5 shows, agency project officers differed in their attitudes.

On the other hand, at NSF and HHS, where SBIR projects are not Page 26 GAO/'RCED8939 Assessment of SBIR Program Chapter 2 Are SBIB Fmgnune Meeting Their Goals? closely related to agency programs to support basic research in universi- ties, fewer project officers believe that SBIR programs are meeting agency R&D needs. When asked about specific projects, officers responded that 23 percent of the projects had made a great or very great contribution to agency R&D goals, while another 65 percent had made at least some contribu- tion. As table 2.6 shows, project officers at DOD and NASA were more likely than those at other agencies to judge their projects as making a large contribution to agency R&D goals. Table 2.6: Responses Concerning the Extent That Individual SBIR Projects Have Contributed to the R&D Goals of the Agency Percent Contribution Very great or great Moderate Apency DOD NASA DOE HHS NSF All agencies 30 36 12 11 8 23 44 42 37 38 31 41 Some 18 15 33 34 37 24 Little or no 8 7 18 17 25 12 Source GAO auesbonnane Comments provided by project officers on their questionnaires indicate that DOD and NASA SBIR projects contributed to R&D goals by meeting spe- cific R&D objectives. For example, an Air Force monitor said that one SBIR project had contributed by significantly advancing bearing technology for turbine engines. A NASA project officer said that a project to develop a new cooling procedure had made a moderate contribution by helping develop new ways to shield superconducting magnets. Because MF does not direct SBIR projects toward specific research objectives, project officer comments identified general, rather than specific, benefits to the agency. One project officer, for example, said that research on a new chemical process made some contribution to meeting agency research goals. He noted that the SBIR mission did not exactly coincide with NSF'S basic science orientation but that the SBIR effort to apply science was healthy for the agency. A larger proportion of project officers at NASA and DOD than at the other three agencies identified the SBIR program as a moderately or very important element of their agency's overall research program-69 per- cent at NASA and 65 percent at DOD. At DOE, 40 percent believed SBIR was a moderately or very important research program element; at HHS, 32 percent; and at NSF, 28 percent. Page 27 GA0/RCED-98-38 Assessment of SBIR Programs Chapter 2 In their comments on questionnaire responses, SBIR project officers indi- cated several ways in which their SBIR programs contributed to research objectives. For example, one NASA project officer noted that the program attracted talent \"hidden\" in small businesses to R&D areas important to his division, while another said that the SBIR program was an excellent vehicle for starting up projects not in the mainline of agency 12&r+ which might become part of the mainline R&D if successful. Similarly, a DOD project officer commented that the SBIR program provided an easy method to forge relationships with innovative small businesses and allowed a method of judging the state of the art. SBIR Programs Fund Projects That Agencies Might Not Support Otherwise Through SBIR programs, agencies support many projects that they would not otherwise sponsor. SBIR project officers reported that 52 percent of their projects probably or definitely would not have been funded by the agency if the SBIR program did not exist and were uncertain about an additional 30 percent. In their opinion, only about 17 percent of SBIR projects were likely to have been funded without an SBIR program There are some differences, however, among agencies over whether projects would have been funded if the SBIR program did not exist. At DOD, project officers thought that the agency would definitely or proba- bly have funded 23 percent of the projects, while at the next highest agencies (NSF and HHS), the percentage was 16 percent. For the five agen- cies, the percentage of projects that probably or definitely would not have obtained funding without the SBIR program ranged from 47 percent to 62 percent. At NSF and HHS, SBIR projects have an applied research focus and empha- size private sector commercialization so they are different from most other agency research. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that many SBIR projects would not have obtained non-sBIR funding at these agencies. However, at DOD and iwu where SBIR projects are more similar to other agency research activities, the large percentage of projects (49 percent at DOD and 59 percent at NASA) that would not have received funding outside the SBIR program is more unexpected. According to questionnaire responses, DOD and IUSA are using SBIR projects to undertake high-risk research-research in areas where results are less easy to achieve. In these two agencies, about half of the Phase II SBIR projects were rated by project officers as having higher levels of risk than non-sBIR projects that they managed. Only 13 percent of the projects in these agencies were assessed as having lower levels of Page28 GAO/RCED&XW AsaesamentofSBIRPwpam Chapter 2 risk than comparable non-sa1R projects. For example, a SYASA project officer commented that a project to predict rotary wing (helicopter) hover performance had made a very great contribution by providing new technology that would not otherwise have been obtained because it was too risky and too expensive to have been supported without the SBIR program. He reported that the new analysis is being used to support a variety of research efforts in NASA and other agencies as well. In con- trast, project officers in HHS, NSF, and DOE regarded their SBIR projects as having about the same level of risk as non-sBIR projects. In our interviews of SBIR program managers, they identified several ways in which their SBIR programs seek to meet needs that were not being met by other agency R&D programs. SBIR programs can be used to support research in technologies for which few immediate benefits appear likely. For example, between 1983 and 1986, DOD, DOE, and SSF supported some SBIR projects on superconductivity, a research area regarded at the time as having little immediate payoff. In addition, the NSF program manager stated that the SBIR solicitation process, through simplified proposals and expedited review can allow an agency to respond rapidly to new developments. For example, when the discoveries of high temperature superconductivity were confirmed in December 1986, SBIR solicitations allowed agencies to respond quickly by expanding support in this area. DOE had included superconductivity as a topic in its solicitation for proposals due November 1986 and decided to fund a much larger share of those proposals as a result of the developments. SBIR funding has also been used to support a wide array of technologies. In particular, DOD has used the SBIR program to examine a wide variety of alternative technological approaches as part of the strategic defense initiative. Private Sector The 1986 SBIR reauthorization directed GAO to make a comprehensive Commercialization of study of SBIR commercialization by December 31, 1991. Accordingly, we did not at this time seek from firms with SBIR projects the information Innovations From needed to make a thorough analysis of the extent and nature of commer- Federal R&D cial products and services that have resulted from the projects. We focused instead on how agencies seek to meet the goal of commercial innovation in their selection of projects for their SBIR programs and have also provided some preliminary information concerning the relatively small number of SBIR projects that have completed Phase II. Page 29 GAO/ECED-8S38 Aeeessment of SBIR Programs Chapter2 AreSBIRProl~~~(~Me&ngTheirGvala? We found that agencies with SBIR programs differ in the emphasis they place on commercial potential in selecting SBIR proposals for funding. However, in response to our questionnaire, SBIR project officers stated that about half of the SBIR projects have high potential for commercial development. Preliminary information on commercialization indicates that some completed projects have resulted in the sale of goods and ser- vices and that firms are taking steps to commercialize the results from other projects. Selection of Projects With According to their responses to our questionnaires, SBIR project officers High Commercial Potential believe that about half the Phase II projects have high potential for com- mercialization. Although all agencies have procedures for considering the innovativeness and commercial merit of SBIR proposals, they differ in the emphasis they place on commercialization potential, especially on the existence of commitments for follow-on funding when selecting Phase II projects. SBIR project officers, according to their responses to our questionnaires. believe that many of the Phase II projects they manage have high poten- tial for commercial development. They rated about half of the SBIR projects as having high or very high potential for commercialization. When the project officers compared individual SBIR projects with other agency research activities, 53 percent of the projects were assessed as having more likelihood of leading to the inventing and commercializing of new products, processes, and services, while 12 percent were judged to have less potential for development. Overall, 62 percent of the project officers said that their agency's SBIR program definitely or probably encouraged the private sector to commercialize the result of federally funded R&D, while only 10 percent thought the SBIR program was unlikely to do so. The remaining 28 percent were uncertain or believed it was too early to tell. When asked to compare SBIR projects to other research for which they were responsible, project officers identified 53 percent of the SBIR projects as having somewhat better or much better likelihood of leading to inventing and commercializing new products, processes, or services. At NSF and HHS, about two-thirds (67 percent) of SBIR projects were judged more likely than other research to lead to commercialization, while about half (53 percent) of the projects at DOD, NASA. and DOE were rated the same way. (This information is analyzed more extensively in ch. 3.) Page30 GAO/RCED-W39 Assessment ofSBlRProgran Chapter 2 Are SBKR h(puns Meeting Their Goals? As noted earlier, agencies with SBIR programs differ in the emphasis they place on commercial potential in selecting SBIR proposals for fund- ing. For example, in making awards for Phase II, NSF places very heavy emphasis upon a proposal's plan for commercial development. In con- trast, when NASA selects projects for Phase II, it emphasizes whether the proposed research will meet the agency's research needs and uses com- mercial potential as a tie-breaker. Unlike NSF, NASA can and does provide the opportunity for follow-on funding by other agency R&D programs. SBIR legislation requires that when two Phase II proposals are of approx- imately equal scientific merit, agencies give special consideration to those proposals that submit a nonfederal follow-on funding commitment with their proposal. In funding Phase II SBIR projects, NSF places heavy emphasis on whether the project has a follow-on funding commitment. NSF considers all proposals rated as \"very good,\" its second highest rat- ing category, to be of equal merit and requires these proposers to submit nonfederal funding commitments. These commitments consist of agree- ments by industrial corporations or other organizations to provide addi- tional development funds for the project if it successfully completes Phase II. For a group of projects initiated in response to a fiscal year 1984 solicitation, 45 of the 49 proposals that received Phase II awards had follow-on funding commitments that had been reviewed and found acceptable by NSF officials. At other agencies follow-on funding commitments are much less impor- tant in making Phase II awards. Most SBIR program managers stated that they did not have tie-breaking situations and any commitments that pro- posers submitted were simply used as additional information in the selection process. At DOE and HHS, for example, follow-on funding com- mitments and other plans for commercial development are given some consideration in deciding which proposals to fund in Phase II, but many projects are funded without such commitments. At DOD and &GA, SBIR program managers said that funding commitments are rarely considered in making awards. NASA'S SBIR program manager told us that Phase II proposals are evaluated by headquarters staff to determine whether the project will meet specific NASA needs for research and technology and only rarely was a follow-on funding commitment used to decide on fund- ing a Phase II project. DOD program managers could not remember ever using follow-on funding agreements in selecting proposals. Page 31 GAO/RCElN3W9 Aasesement of SBIR Programs Chapter 2 Are SBIR Programs Meeting Their Goals? In our June 1987 report,* we found that all agencies consider the innova- tion and commercial potential of their SBIR proposals in their SBIR evalua- tion and selection processes. However. officials at most agencies said that research needs and priorities are usually given emphasis over these factors. Preliminary Information on Commercialization As noted earlier, we did not seek the information needed to make an analysis of the extent and nature of commercial products and services that have resulted from SBIR projects. We will report on Phase III com- mercialization activities in 1991, when more SBIR projects have entered that phase. However, some preliminary information is available. We asked firms to provide information on commercial products resulting from completed Phase II projects. SBIR firms responding to our question- naire report that 285 projects have completed Phase II out of 604 that were selected for that phase. The projects selected for our questionnaire were started during fiscal years 1983 through 1985, the first years of the SBIR program. SBA officials told us that very few of the projects begun since fiscal year 1985 have completed Phase II. Commercialization Activities For 24 percent of the projects that have completed Phase II, firms report that the resulting products and services are now being sold, but we did not obtain any information on the extent of these sales. Agencies differ concerning the percentage of completed projects resulting in products and services that were being sold commercially. For HHS projects. 48 per- cent were being sold commercially, while the rate for DOE, SSF, SM.% and DOD ranged from 24 percent to 16 percent. Questionnaire responses indicate that for most projects that have com- pleted Phase II, the level of commercial activity has remained fairly small. Over half (54 percent) of the projects that had sales were by firms with 25 or fewer employees; and for most projects (78 percent), the firms had 1987 revenues of less than $5 million. For 45 percent of these projects, less than 25 percent of the firms' revenues derived from SBIR awards. These proportions are similar to those for all respondents to our questionnaire: 56 percent of all projects were by firms with 25 or fewer employees; and for 78 percent of the projects, firms had revenues of less than $5 million. *(GAO/RED-87-63, June 2.1987). Page 32 GAO/RCED49-39 Assessment Programs Chapter 2 Are SBIR Programa MeetLne lbirGo&c We also obtained information on some activities that indicate efforts by firms to commercialize the results of projects that have completed Phase II. For example, firms reported that they were market testing results from 16 percent of the projects and that production rights had been sold or licensed for 11 percent of these projects. Firms had formed strategic partnerships, such as joint ventures, and R&D limited partnerships as a result of 18 percent of the completed projects. (Because the same project may be included in more than one of the above categories, these percent- ages cannot be added together.) During fiscal year 1988, SBA began a multiyear study to assess the extent to which SBIR participants have commercialized, or are attempt- ing to commercialize, the results of Phase II SBIR projects. On the basis of a sample of completed projects that were begun in fiscal year 1983, SBA reported preliminary results that indicate that some commercialization has occurred-for about 10 percent of the projects, sales have actually resulted from R&D conducted in the SBIR program. For an additional 10 percent of the projects, SBA reports that commercialization is likely because the company has received capital, or a commitment for capital, or signed an agreement for assistance in commercialization. In another 20 percent of the projects, companies were actively pursuing commer- cialization possibilities.3 In addition, SBA reported that for 45 percent of the projects, companies were interested in commercialization but had taken little or no action toward that goal. Commercialization was not expected in the remaining 15 percent of the projects. Follow-On Funding &nmitments We asked firms about follow-on commitments from nonfederal sources to provide funds after Phase II. Overall, 34 percent of the projects in our survey selected for Phase II had obtained follow-on commitments. The largest number of these commitments (27 percent) was in the range from $100,000 to $250,000. The most common source of these commit- ments was the firm's own internal funds, followed by other firms and venture capital institutions. The percentage of Phase II projects with nongovernment follow-on commitments ranged widely by agency, from 68 percent at hSF to 18 percent at DOD. Of the projects that had completed Phase II, 31 percent had received follow-on funding commitments. Of the completed projects with follow- %fth Year Results, SBA (Washmgton, DC.: June 1988). Page 33 GAO/RCED-89-39 Assessment of SBIR Programs Chapter 2 Are SBIR Rorpame &&.ng Their GO&? Firms With Multiple SBIR Awards on agreements, about 39 percent reported that the products or services resulting from the SBIR project were being sold commercially. In compari- son, for 18 percent of these Phase II completions that had not received follow-on funding commitments, firms reported that they were selling the results of their SBIR project commercially. In its 1987 annual report to the Congress on SBIR programs4 SBA pro- vided information on efforts by firms that had received seven or more Phase I SBIR awards to commercialize their SBIR projects. SBA made these observations in response to concerns that firms with large numbers of SBIR awards were not taking adequate steps to ensure the commercializa- tion of the resulting projects. SBA determined that no particular prob- lems existed with the management and commercialization of multiple awards. In SBA'S opinion, companies with multiple awards were \"just as committed, or more so, to the successful performance and commerciali- zation of SBIR projects.. . .\" Firms that responded to our questionnaire concerning their SBIR projects indicated that the number of SBIR awards received makes little differ- ence in the rate of commercialization. We examined the data reported by firms that had received 11 or more Phase I awards. Of the projects that had completed Phase II, 25 percent had been performed by firms with 11 or more Phase I awards. For both groups of firms, about 25 percent of the completed projects resulted in products or services that were being sold commercially. Fostering Minority and Disadvantaged Participation SBA and agencies with SBIR programs seek to accomplish the program goal of fostering and encouraging participation by minority and disad- vantaged small businesses through outreach efforts to inform them about SBIR programs. SBA defines a minority and disadvantaged small business concern as one . that is at least 51 percent owned by one or more minority and disadvan- taged individuals or, in the case of any publicly owned business, at least 51 percent of the voting stock of which is owned by one or more minor- ity and disadvantaged individuals and 4Fourth Year Results Cnder the Small Busmess InnovatIon Development Act of 1982. SBA (wash%- ton, D.C.: June 19871, p 11 Page 34 GAO/RCEJH939 Assessment of SBIR fioW Chapter2 Are SBIR Program Meeting Their Gala? l whose management and daily business operations are controlled by one or more of such individuals. A minority and disadvantaged individual is defined as a member of any of the following groups: Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Pacific Americans, and Subcontinent Asian Americans. According to SBA data, the percentage of money awarded minority and disadvantaged small businesses was lower in fiscal years 1986 and 1987 than in previous years. However, SBA officials believe that firms have little incentive to report their minority status correctly and that the data on minority firm participation in SBIR may contain some inaccuracies. The amount of SBIR money awarded to minority and disadvantaged firms increased each year from fiscal years 1984 through 1987. (See table 2.7.) When compared with total money awarded to small business, minority and disadvantaged firms received about 12 percent in 1984 and 1985 and about 8.5 percent in 1986 and 1987. The percentage of Phase I SBIR awards received by minority and disadvantaged firms remained about the same for fiscal years 1985 to 1987, but the percent- age of Phase II awards received by these firms was lower in fiscal years 1986 and 1987 than it was in 1985.

Firms report minority and disadvantaged status voluntarily on their proposals, and SBA has identified cases in which individual firms have been inconsistent, identifying themselves as minority and disadvantaged on some proposals but not on others. Because minority and disadvantaged firms do not receive preference in Page35 GAO/RCEIM%39AseessmentofSBIRRo~ Chapter 2 Are SBIR Programs Meeting Their Goals? the SBIR proposal process, SBA officials believe a firm has little incentive to report its status accurately. SBA and agencies with SBIR programs have undertaken outreach efforts to encourage participation by minority and disadvantaged firms. often as part of general outreach efforts to inform small businesses about SBIR. These efforts have taken several forms: national conferences; regional seminars; and mailings to state agencies, historically minority universi- ties and colleges, and individual firms. For example, in April 1987 DOD, NA,%, and DOE held a joint 2day workshop on the SBIR program that was sponsored by Virginia state government. In addition, a session for minority and disadvantaged firms was held in October 1987, as part of a conference in Atlanta attended by all SBIR agencies. The SBIR program has attracted some minority and disadvantaged firms that have not previously participated in federal contracting activities. About 26 percent of the projects by minority and disadvantaged firms identified in our questionnaire sample were performed by firms that had not had a contract or grant from the federal government prior to receiv- ing their first SBIR award. SBA sponsored a study during 1985 to identify minority and disadvan- taged firms capable of and interested in participating in the SBIR pro- gram. The study was completed in 1986 and the over 300 firms identified were entered in the SBIR mail list system and sent publications on the program. The study found that the number of firms that are pri- marily R&n-oriented is small compared to the total number of minority and disadvantaged firms. The study also found that many minority and disadvantaged individuals who have the technical training and capabil- ity for participation in the program are employed in large corporations or in the government and are not interested in applying for the program. Page 36 GAO/lKTEDS~ Assessment of SBLR Prograxm Quality of SBIR Research Projects Overall, 29 percent of the SBIR projects were judged to be of higher qual- ity than other agency research, and 50 percent were judged as of similar quality. However, project officers judged SBIR projects differently on some factors important to research quality, and officers differed among agencies in how SBIR projects were rated. For example, project officers at all agencies rated SBIR projects higher than other agency research con- cerning the likelihood that the project will lead to inventing and com- mercializing new products, processes, or services. Agency project officers differed on other factors, however, such as the likelihood that the project will lead to new scientific and technical discoveries. Many of the important differences among agencies paralleled the differing emphasis on SBIR program objectives that was described in chapter 2. In reauthorizing SBIR programs in 1986, the Congress asked us to report on how the quality of SBIR research projects compares with other research supported by each agency. To measure research quality, we sent questionnaires to project officers responsible for overseeing and monitoring SBIR and other research projects at the five agencies respon- sible for 96 percent of SBIR funds. We asked them to compare the quality of specific SBIR research projects with other research that they manage. Measuring Research Quality We identified techniques that had been developed to assess research quality but determined that they were not appropriate to our needs. According to the Office of Technology Assessment, the only quantitative measure of research quality is by analyzing research publications through techniques such as citation analysis1 Because SBIR projects involve applied research and do not usually produce scientific articles. this way of measuring research quality was not appropriate to our needs. Chapter 2 discussed some ways in which agencies try to ensure the qual- ity of their SBIR research projects. Agency project selection procedures, for example, seek to identify and fund SBIR proposals of high scientific and technical merit. In addition, agencies make some use of follow-on funding agreements as a way to identify proposals of high potential for commercial development. 'Citation analysis measures the number of times a sclentlfic article is referred to m subsequent research articles and is mtended to show how useful the research has been to other sctencIsts See Research Funding As an Investment: Can We Measure the Returns? Off& of Technology Assessment (Washington. D.C.. April 1986). Page37 GAO/RCED4939 AswusmentofSBIRRopms chapter3 Quality of SBIR R-mmh Projects We decided, on the basis of our own experience and the views of science policy experts we consulted, that the most feasible additional approach to measuring research quality was to enlist the judgments of technically knowledgeable persons who were familiar with the SBIR project but were not actually participating in the research. In addition to SBIR projects, agency project officers are normally responsible for other research activities. Therefore, we asked agency project officers to compare SBIR research with other research for which they were also responsible. SBIR research is a relatively small part of the responsibilities of most project officers. Almost 80 percent of the project officers responding to our questionnaire said that SBIR proposals and projects required no more than 10 percent of their time. Their remaining time was devoted to non- SBIR R&D proposals and projects and to other activities. To measure research quality, we asked project officers to compare spe- cific SBIR projects with other research projects that they were responsi- ble for, according to nine factors that we had identified as potentially relevant to research quality (by consulting science policy experts, reviewing published material, and pretesting questionnaires), and to assess overall project quality. These factors, which are listed in table 3.1, included, among others, the likelihood that the project would lead to new scientific/technical discoveries or to inventing and commercializing new products, processes, and services. In order to focus on projects that had been going on long enough to produce results, we sent question- naires to 530 project officers concerning the 739 projects begun during 1983 and 1984 that had been later selected for Phase II awards. Appen- dixes III, IV, and V contain additional information on our questionnaires and the project officers' responses. Overall Assessment of Overall, about half of the SBIR projects were judged to be of about the Research Quality same quality as other research under the project officer's responsibility. As table 3.1 shows, 50 percent of the SBIR projects were rated as having about the same overall quality as other research, while 29 percent were regarded as somewhat or much better and 19 percent were regarded as somewhat or much worse. A similar rating pattern is found for most of the specific factors regarding research quality. For all but one of the factors, more projects were rated better than were rated worse than other projects. The one exception was the quality of scientific and technical facilities and resources; for which 14 percent of Page30 GAO/BCED8939mmcnt ofSBlRPro@ams Chapter 3 Quality of SBLR &search Prokcts the projects were judged to be better than other research, while 27 per- cent were judged to be worse. Responses concerning the likelihood that the project will lead to inventing and commercializing new products, processes, or services were more positive than for other factors. For this factor, most projects (53 percent) were regarded as better than other research, while 29 percent were judged about the same. About 12 per- cent were judged worse than other research.

GAO questlonnalre Differences Among Agencies Regarding SBIR Project Quality Although most SBIR projects were judged to be about the same overall quality as other research, the pattern of responses differed among the agencies covered by our questionnaires. In general, these differences in agency response paralleled the differences in emphasis on SBIR goals that were described in chapter 2. At DOD and NASA, agencies that emphasize the SBIR goal of meeting federal R&D needs, project officers rated SBIR projects high on almost all factors in comparison with other research. In contrast, HHS and NSF project officers rated SBIR projects very high con- cerning the likelihood of private sector commercialization, a goal that Page 39 GAO/RcEDBs39 Awesament of SBKR Programs Chapter 3 Quality of SBIR Research Projects these agencies emphasize in their SBIR programs, but lower on some other factors-as table 3.2 indicates. To compare agency responses in table 3.2, we assigned numerical values to the questionnaire responses, as follows: Much better than other agency research 2 Somewhat better than other agency research 1 About the same as other agency research Somewhat worse than other aaencv research 0 -1 Much worse than other agency research -2 Responses of \"unable to judge\" or \"not applicable\" were not included in this analysis. For each factor, we added up the numerical value of the agency responses and divided by the number of responses to obtain an average agency response for each factor. As table 3.2 shows, the aver- age scores in many cases were generally slightly above or very close to 0, indicating that many projects were regarded as of much the same quality as non-snm research.

DOD'S responses are close to, but not quite as positive as, those from IUSA. DOD project officers rated SBIR projects better than other research on all but one factor: scientific/technical facilities and resources. At the other extreme, NSF project officers rated SBIR projects as lower in research quality than other projects overall and lower on six of the nine specific factors. HHS project officers were negative in their overall com- parison of SBIR research quality to other agency research and very close to neutral on six of the remaining nine factors. NSF and HHS project officers were, however, very positive concerning the likelihood that SBIR projects would lead to invention and commercialization. Page 4 1 GAO/RCED-M-39 Assessment of SBIR fioem chapter 3 Quallty of SBIR Besearch ProJect.9 DOE's responses fell between the extremes established by the other agen- cies, in the assessment of overall research quality, and in several of the specific factors. The assessment of SBIR projects performed by DOE'S Office of Program Analysis and dated August 1988 shows a real, although small, difference between the overall average ratings of SBIR and non-SBIR projects, with the non-sBIR projects having a higher rating.? In comparing responses among agencies, it should be noted that project officers differ among agencies in the amount of non-sBIR basic research that they oversee, as table 3.3 shows. This table indicates that more pro- ject officers at NSF and HHS than at other agencies reported devoting all, or almost all, of their time to overseeing basic research when they were not working with SBIR projects.

GAO auesbonnave As table 3.4 shows, project officers who spent all, or almost all, of their non-SBIR R&D time on basic research differed from other project officers in their responses concerning research quality. *The DOE assessment was based on evaluations provided by 17 independent scientific and techmcal panels that reviewed samples of SBIR and nonSBIR projects. 42 in Asaeaamenta of Research Quelity According to Amount Percent of Non-SBIR RID lime Spent on Basic Research Percentage of SBIR projects rated somewhat better or much better than other research Project off icera apendin all, or almost all, non-SBI R Other research time on basic project Factor research officers Overall quality of the project 20 35 Lrkelrhood that the project will lead to Inventing and commercralizrng new products, processes, or services 59 57 Lrkelihood that the protect WIII lead to new scientific/technical drscovenes Quality of screntrfic/ technrcal outputs resultrng from the project (patents, licensing agreements, research articles, conference presentations, etc.) 21 32 22 34 The skills and expertise In the scientific/ technical area addressed by research Appropnateness of expertmental and analyttcal methods used Screntrfic/technical facilitres and resources Effectiveness of the management and organization of the project 21 34 12 26 9 17 20 26 Creativity in carrying out the project Dedication of the research team In conducting the project 22 42 28 43 Source. GAO questlonnalre. For all but one of the factors in table 3.4, project officers who spent all, or almost all, of their Non-SBIR R&D time on basic research were less likely than other project officers to regard their SBIR projects as better than other research for which they were responsible. For example, 20 percent of the project officers who spent all, or almost all, of their non- SBIR time on basic research said that the SBIR project was of better over- all quality than other research, compared with 35 percent of other pro- ject officers. However, the project officers who spent all, or almost all, of their non-snIR project time on basic research were about as likely as the others to assess their SBIR project as more likely than other research to lead to inventing and commercializing new products, processes, or services. P8ge43 How Agencies View Their SBIR Programs We asked the heads of 11 agencies who fund SBIR projects to provide their judgments on the effect of SBIR legislation on their agency's research programs, as required by the reauthorization of the Small Busi- ness Innovation Development Act of 1982 (P.L. 99-443). In general. the agencies regarded the overall impact of the SBIR program on their research activities as favorable. The agencies differed in the specific impacts of SBIR legislation that they reported, but some themes were common to most agency responses. Most agencies identified ways in which their SBIR programs had (1) developed new research areas, (2) placed more emphasis on the application of research results, and (3) contributed to wider use of small businesses as research performers. (See apps. VI through XVI.) We also asked the same agencies, as well as SBA, to comment on our report in draft form. The agencies either had no comment on our report or expressed agreement with its contents. Common Themes in Agency Judgments of SBIR Programs New Research Areas Seven agencies identified ways in which the SBIR program has helped them support new kinds of research. For example, HHS noted that the SBIR projects addressed gaps in its research programs. \"A large number of these gaps appear to be in the area of medical instrumentation, for example, the development of devices for the diagnosis, treatment and rehabilita- tion of patients with communicative and sensory disorders.... Indeed, SBIR has proved to be a very effective means of encouraging the development of devices, instruments and other hardware that have not otherwise been addressed.\" Similarly, NRC stated that the SBIR program offers an opportunity for federal research program managers to take advantage of new ideas that might not surface through normal contracting avenues. According to DOE, research pursuits have been expanded in directions not tradition- ally followed, and advances have been made in many areas that would probably not have occurred without SBIR. CSDA. Commerce, D(JT, and NSF also reported ways in which SBIR had led to the support of new kinds of research. For example, Commerce said Page 44 GAO/RCEDB939 Assessment of SBIR Programs Chapter4 HOW Agencies View Their SBIB Programa that SBIR gave research managers the opportunity to explore new and innovative approaches to their problems and to obtain expertise not available in-house, while NSF said that SBIR projects had led to the devel- opment of instruments and testing procedures to support basic scientific research. Emphasis on Using Research Results SBIR programs have produced greater emphasis on the application of research results, in the opinion of six agencies. According to NSF, the SBIR program has \"served an important technology transfer function between university and industry research,\" with more than half of its SBIR projects involving university faculty. HHS believes that SBIR has been instrumental in linking industry researchers with academic investiga- tors by providing an incentive to collaborate, leading to more rapid tech- nology transfer. USDA and DOED also identified SBIR projects as a mechanism for commercializing the results of basic research. DOD noted that the SBIR program helps transfer technology by creating networks among SBIR contractors, government, and academia. NASA stated that SBIR projects had an excellent record in producing useful results for the agency. Small Businesses as Research Performers Six agencies highlighted that SBIR provided opportunities to small busi- nesses that had not been provided by other agency research programs. According to DOE, \"in almost all Departmental areas the breadth of par- ticipation by small business has significantly increased the pool of scien- tists and engineers now contributing to DOE research.\" In addition, USDA said that the small business research community that applies to the SBIR program is completely different from that which applies to the agency's main extramural research program. Of the 1,653 proposals received for USDA'S main research program in fiscal year 1987, only 8 were from pri- vate, profit-seeking organizations while all SBIR proposals are from this type of organization. Similar observations were made by DOT and HHS. DOD and NASA noted that their SBIR programs had helped small businesses become useful performers of agency research. Agency Comments on We asked the 11 agencies that now operate SBIFf programs, as well as Our Draft Report SBA, to comment on our draft report. Ten agencies provided written responses, which are included in appendixes XVII through XXVI. Although NASA and NSF did not respond in writing, we discussed the draft report with agency SBIR program managers at these agencies. Page45 GAO/RCEDW39 Aweasment of SBIB Frogmm~ Chapter 4 How Agencies View Their SBIFt Progana Agencies either had no comment on our draft report or expressed agree- ment with its contents.

General Accounting Office is currently studying the quality of the research conducted in projects obtaining funding under tne Small BuSineSS InnOva- tion Research Program (SEIR). In order to report this information accurately to the U.S. Congress, we are sending ques- tionnaires to the project officers responsible for these projects. We are particularly interested in your opinions about these projects and the SBIR pro- gram. We will be requesting separate judgments from your agency head on the overall effectiveness of the SBIR pro- gram. Two questionnaires are enclosed. This one covers your general opinions on the SBIR program. The other questionnaire covers a specific SBIR project that you have monitored. Because we are request- ing information on all SBIR projects awarded Phase II funding in 1984 through 1986, we may have sent you more than one project-oriented questionnaire. We hope you will be able to fill out each ques- tionnaire that is enclosed. The ques- tionnaires have been designed to be answered in five or ten minutes each by checking boxes or writing in a short answer. Project officers like yourself have helped us to make sure that ques- tions are easy to understand and answer. If the format does not fit your situa- tion, please give us any additional com- ments necessary to aescribe your ex- perience with STIR projects. There is room at the end of this questionnaire for additional comments or explanations.

Page 64 GAO/RCZLD439-39 haesement of SBIR Progr8.m~ -Appendix L Questionnaire Methodology In preparing this report, we used three survey instruments, as follows: . a survey of small businesses that had received SBIR awards, l a questionnaire to project officers responsible for monitoring SBIR projects at DOD, DOE, HHS, NASA, and NSF containing general questions on their agencies' SBIR program, and l a questionnaire to the same project officers concerning specific SBIR projects. Survey of Small Businesses With SBIR Projects Sampling For this report, we sent the survey contained in appendix II to small businesses using the same sample of SBIR projects that was used in our previous report, Federal Research: Small Business Innovation Research Participants Give Program High Marks.* The sample of projects we used was drawn from lists of projects conducted during fiscal years 1983 through 1985 by the 12 federal agencies that sponsored SBIR projects during this period. Questionnaires were sent to all firms having projects except for projects funded by DOD, DOE, HHS, NASA, and NSF. For those agencies, we selected a representative sample as shown in table V. 1. In addition, we sent questionnaires concerning all Phase II projects desig- nated as complete by the responsible agency at the time of our survey for the previous report. We assigned appropriate weights during the data analysis to account for the agency of the project and whether or not Phase II was complete. Table V.l shows the sample size for each agency and the weighted number of projects for each agency in our anal- ysis. (A copy of the survey is in app. II.) The sample was designed to have sampling errors of no more than 5 percent at the 95percent confidence level (sampling errors for subsets of the sample could be higher). (App. II shows sampling errors in paren- theses for selected key variables.) '(GAO/RCED-87-161BR. July 27. 1987). Page 66 GAO/RtXD8939Asaeeamentof SBIRPrograms Appendix V QUeStiOnnaire Methodology Questionnaire Procedures We developed the questionnaire after discussions with agency officials and consultants. We conducted pretests with eight companies in the Washington, D.C., and Boston areas that participated in SBIR projects. During each session, an individual respondent filled out the question- naire in the presence of two GAO observers. After the pretests, we revised the questionnaire as necessary to increase clarity and ease of response. We mailed questionnaires to the principal investigator of each project in the sample. Because we based our sample on projects rather than com- panies, 212 companies received 2 or more questionnaires. A total of 954 companies received our questionnaire. We sent follow-up letters to nonrespondents, including a second copy of the questionnaire, and also sent a final reminder to nonrespondents to encourage them to return their questionnaires. Survey Results We received 1 ,113 completed questionnaires out of 1,406 that were mailed, yielding a response rate of 79 percent.

These five agencies are responsible for 96 percent of all SBIR funds. Questionnaire Procedures We developed questions concerning the SBIR program after discussions with agency officials and consultants. We conducted pretests with SBIR project officers at DOD, DOE, HHs, and NSF. During each session an individ- ual project officer filled out the questionnaire in the presence of two GXO observers. After pretesting, the questionnaire was revised as necessary to increase clarity and ease of response. We sent follow-up letters to nonrespondents, including a second copy of the questionnaire. Later, we made a final follow-up to the remaining nonrespondents by telephone. Survey Results We received 495 completed questionnaires from the 530 project officers that we had identified, yielding a response rate of 93.4 percent. Appen- dix III shows the questionnaire and the frequency of responses to indi- vidual questions. Questionnaire Concerning Specific SBIR Projects Each project officer who received a questionnaire with general ques- tions about the SBIR program also received one or more questionnaires about specific SBIR projects that were started during fiscal years 1983 and 1984 that resulted in Phase II awards, a total of 739 projects. We followed up nonresponses to this questionnaire in conjunction with the questionnaire concerning general questions about the SBIR program. We received questionnaires concerning 691 projects, a response rate of 93.5 percent. The questionnaire concerning specific SBIR projects was developed and pretested in conjunction with the general questions concerning the SBIR program.

Curtin Deputy Director Resources. Community, and Economic Development Division U.S. General Accounting Office Washington, DC. 20548 Dear Mr Curtin: I am pleased to respond to your request for an evaluation by the U.S. Department of Agriculturr (USDA) of the effectiveness of the Suicii Business :nnuvation Research lStilRj program within the USDA. This evaluation is based in part on extensive consultations by the SBIR Office with grantees, scientists who have served on both SBIR and USDA Competitive Research Grants Office (CRGO) panels, and various USDA officials. It IS also based upon information documented by the SBIR Coordinator, Dr. Charles F Cleland. who has made nearly 30 site visits to Phase I and Phase II grantees since he jorncd USDA'S SBIR program in May of 1987. In our opinion the SBIR program is proving to be a sound investment of Federal R&D funds for the following reasons: The research community that applies to the SBIR program is completely different from that which applies to the Competitive Research Grants program. which is USDA's primary extramural research grant program. In FY '87. the Competitive Research Grants program received a total of 1653 grant proposals with only eight coming from private profit organizations. A total of 363 grants were awnrdcd with just two going to private profit organizations (both were awarded to Weyerhaeuser Company). The SBIR program in FY '87 received I78 Phase I applications and 24 Phase II applications, and made 23 Phase I awards and I2 Phase II awards. Thus. for science and technology-based small business firms, the SBIR program represents their best opportunity for access to USDA R&D funds. The quality of successful SBIR proposals compares favorably to the guality 01 successful proposals submitted to the Competitive Research Grants program. Scientists who have served as panelists in both programs indicate that while the nature of the research is clearly different, rhc scientific and technical merit is very high in both cases. Competitive Research Grants projects are usually for a two to three year period and are focused on baste research, while SBlR Phase 1 grants are for only 6 months and have a more applied focus Consequently, there are limitations on what can realistically be proposed in a Phase I grant, but this does not detract from the scientific merit of the proposals. Page 66 GAO/R- Assessment of SBIR Programs Appendix M Letter From the Department of Agriculture Concerning the SBIR Program Mr. Neal P. Curttn . (3) SBIR projects are innovative and represent a mechanism for commercialization of the results of basic research. For example. recent progress in animal biotechnology has been used by grantees to design supertor yaccines that 3rc quite specific with fewer undesirable side effects. Basic research tn plant biotechnology that has made it possible to introduce new genetics material Into certain plants has permitted grantees to create new plant varieties that possess supertor yield and quality characteristics or enhanced resistance to specific plant pathOgCnS or insect pests. Basic research that led to the development of fiber optics and laser spectroscopy has been built upon with various applications such as an improved soil moisture probe that uses fiber optic tCChnology or a computer-directed, laser guidance system for cdgtng hardwood boards that results in improved yield. Improved breeding methods have led to the development of one of the first American strains of cashmere goat that will be a domestic source of this valuable fiber. A project in Washington State plans to utilize this new strain in an effort to establish domestic cashmere production as a new enterprise that will enhance economic opportunity in rural areas. (4) The SBIR program is desi8ncd to leverage Federal R&D support in Phase I and II with non-Federal support in Phase III. The USDA supports the concept of Phase III funding by strongly cncouraSing Phase II applicants to include a follow-on funding commitment for Phase III as part of their Phase II grant applications. Grantees are also encouraged to secure matching funds from State or private sources to assist their Phase II effort or to seek bridge grants from their State government to permit the small business to continue its research activity during the period from the end of Phase I unttl the start of a Phase II grant. (5) The SBIR program provtdes support for certain USDA initiatives. For example, last year the USDA initiated a Rural Rcvttalization Effort. One of the six topic areas in the USDA SBIR program addresses rural and economic development. In FY 81, the number of Phase I applications in this topic area nearly doubled over the previous year and four proposals have been recommended for funding. These projects arc all directed at stimulating cconomtc development in rural areas. The Joint Council on Food and Agricultural Sciences. a major advisory body for USDA research programs, makes recommendations on research priorities. For FY '19. their two top priorities are: (I) maintaining and preserving water quality, and (2) expanding biotechnology and its applications. In both cases the SBIR program has funded a number of important projects. In the area of water quality. these projects include: (a) development of a laser/bacterial assay system for detection of pesticides and other contaminants in ground water; (bl dcyclopmcnt of a cost-effective integrated flow control device to permit more efficient use of irrigation water; and (c) development of a new membrane system to permit more effective demineralization of brackish ground water. In the biotechnology arca there are more than a dozen projects underway dealing with such Subjects as: (a) dcvcloptng safer and more effective animal vaccines; Page 69 GAO/RCEW39-39 Assessment of SBIR Programs Appendix VI Letter Prom the Deputment of Agridture Concerning the SBIR Program Mr Neal Curtin (b) using recombinant molecular techniques to produce porcrnc cytoklncs. which have the potential for improving the effectiveness of UCCinCS In P18S; (c) development of new corn varieties with enhanced methionw levels for improved animal feed; and (d) introductton of genes for chitinase (enzyme that digests chitin) into tobacco to produce plants with Increased resistance to fungal attack (fungal cell walls contain chitIn). (6) The SBIR program has proven to be an effective vehlclc for support of womcn- and minority-owned small businesses. Proposals are evaluated strictly on mcrl(. but women- and minority-owned small businesses are encouraged to appl) In FY '88. out of 230 Phase I proposals, 20 wcrc from women-owned and 22 from minority-owned small businesses. A total of 26 Phase I awards have been recommended for fundins. and of these. four arc wsmcrl-uwned and three arc minority-owned. The USDA is pleased with these results and hopes women- and minority-owned small businesses will continue to be successful In obtaining SBIR funds in the future. In conclusion, the USDA views the SBIR program as being an effective way to involve the small bustness community in Federal R&D funds. The projects being funded are innovatlrc and of high quality and offer good prospects for eventual commercialization. The SBIR program has earned the respect of the Department of Agriculture and of the agricultural scientific community. Sincerely, &-AL4 ,&L* Page 70 GAODUXDNM9 &usee6ment of SBIR Programs Appendix VII Letter From the Department of Commerce Concerning the SBIR Program Mr. John Luke, Associate Director Resources, Community, and Economic Development Division U.S. General Accounting Office Washington, D.C. 20548 Dear Mr. Luke: This is in response to your request for the Department of Commerce's judgcment on the effects of the Small Business Act, specifically the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, on our research programs. I am pleased to report that DOC scientists think the SBIR program can contribute to their research and development needs. The Department's first phase two SBIR contracts will not be completed until May 1988; consequently, I can not make a conclusive judgement on the effects of phase two in terms of the application of research results. My comments, therefore, relate to the presently identifiable effects of our phase one efforts. The SBIR program has provided DOC research managers an opportunity to broaden the scope of their research, facilitated direct communication between our laboratory scientists and their colleagues in small firms, and is creating a growing appreciation of the capabilities of small, innovative firms. The program has encouraged research managers to pursue projects that otherwise may not have been undertaken. By providing a means for accessing the ideas and expertise of competent scientists and engineers in small, technology oriented businesses, the program gives research managers the opportunity to explore new and innovative approaches to their problems and to obtain expertise not available in-house. Currently, we have 20 SBIR funded projects going on in the Department. If successfully completed, these projects will make significant contributions to our research programs. The Department views SBIR awardees as partners in cooperative research and development. We assign a Technical Representative (TR) to each phase one awardee at the time a contract is awarded. The TR, a laboratory scientist, not only provides technical assistance to contractors during phase one, but he or she also becomes the contractors advocate in the competition for phase two awards. A close working relationship is established between the Principal Investigator and TR. The effect of this partnership is to facilitate not only the exchange of information but also to ensure that the phase one and phase two work remains focused on the needs of the DOC laboratory sponsoring for the research. Page 71 GAO/RCED4%3!4 Aataessmenr of SBIR Progrsms Appendix VII Letter From the Lkpsrtment of Commerce Concerning the SBJR RO~~MI - 2 - The SBIR program has created a small, but growing number of advocates at the laboratory level. Because our program is comparatively small and relatively new, only a few of our researchers have been exposed to or benefited from opportunities the program offers. However, those that have been are quite enthusiastic about the program. In terms of the SBIR program's future, I believe this enthusiasm has an important effect. The success of the program is quite clearly dependent upon the continuing interest and cooperation of laboratory and program level scientists. They must provide the topics for solicitations, evaluate proposals, and participate in the selection of awardees. Based upon peer review of completed phase one work and progress thus far in phase two, there is no doubt about the competence of our SBIR awardees. I am convinced there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the SBIR program can make significant contributions to DOC research and development needs. If your staff requires more details on our SBIR program, Mr. Ed Tiernan, the program's technical manager, will be happy to provide them. He can be reached at (301) 763-4240. Sincerely, Director, Procurement Administrative Services Page 72 GAO/RCED-f3939 Assexwment of SBIR Programs Letter From the Department of Defense Concerning the SBIR Program THE UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE WASHINGTON, DC 20301 Mr. Frank C. Conahan Assistant Comptroller General General Accounting Office 441 G Street, NW Washington, DC 20548 Dear Mr. Conahan: This is the Department of Defense (DOD) response to your letter of December 3, 1907, requesting a judgment of the effects of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program on DOD Research and Development (R&D), (GAO Code 005738). The SBIR Program has continued to grow since its beginning in 1983 and has become an integral part of all DOD RhD programs. The effect of SBIR on these programs has been positive and the Congressional goals of the law are being met. Results of recent assessments of the SBIR Program within each of the six participating DOD components show that the quality and innovative nature of the work performed by SBIR contractors are equal to work performed by contractors outside the SBIR Program. The SBIR Program has provided a pool of small businesses willing to investigate new high risk and innovative ideas needed to expedite the accomplishment of DOD goals and objectives. Summaries of the DOD components assessments are enclosed. Since the DOD SBIR Program began in 1983, minority firms have competed and received twelve to fourteen percent of the SBIR dollars awarded each year. The DOD minority outreach program has paid off in SBIR participation and the Department will continue to incorporate new ideas to inform more minorities about the SBIR Program. The DOD wholeheartedly supports the Congressional goals of the SBIR Program and is pleased to report its positive effect on all R&D programs. Sincerely, Enclosures Page 73 GAO/RtXDW-39 Assessment of SBIR Programs Appendix ~ Letter From the Deputment of Defeenee Concerning the SBIR Program Assessment of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program SD10 has not yet completed any Phase Two contracts and is thus unable to help measure SBIR results. But SD10 has had a rich bounty of proposals to choose from and has started some excellent innovations in Phase Two. While SBIR has brought in many proposals, it does impose a burden to administer the highly structured program to satisfy the Public Law. It does seem, however, to be the unchanging will of Congress to foster Small Business enterprise and SBIR is at least as useful as any other way to bring in the voice of the small entrepreneur. It is difficult to compare the results of a small firm with that of a large firm. The internal dynamics of innovation in a large firm tend to force profitability criteria on innovations very early in their evaluation. In the small firm, the innovation itself stimulates hard work despite the little return and a higher risk. The human urge to pursue a brainchild whips the innovator far harder than the cold calculation of profit. And SBIR rewards what SD10 needs - the risk-taker. SD10 finds SBIR a worthwhile endeavor and anxiously awaits the day when it will have enough data from Phase Tvo results to evaluate SBIR as a program. Page 74 GAO/RCED&XW Anaesement of SBIR Programs AppendixVIIl LetterFromtheDeputmentofDefense ConcerningtheSBLUProgrsm Assessment of the Army Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program A summary assessment of the Army SBIR Program to date indicates that the percentage of small business participation in Army R&D has increased, resulting in more competition for Army business and more second sources for defense technologies. Small firms are learning how to do business with the Army, while the Army is learning how to use the capabilities of small business. Technology is more effectively transferred, as networking among SBIR contractors, government and academia is catalyzed by the SBIR Program. Small businesses are being given the opportunity to bring the fruits of their entrepreneurship to the Army, and they are finding new and better ways of solving Army needs. Many new and innovative ideas have resulted from SBIR research which Army Laboratories and Research Centers have integrated into mainline programs. Such mainline programs include the Tank Commander Decision Aid: ATR/Tracker Module Generic Robotic Control Module: Sensor Fusion/Situation Analysis; Advenced Fusion Technology Test Bed: Advanced Long Wavelength Infrared/Circuit and Array (ALICAT); Standardized Advanced Infrared System (SAIRS); AN/AL+136 and 162 PM-ASE Systems ; Pocket Radiac Soldier-Robot Interface: Finder: Track Wolf. Since the inception of the SBIR Program, the quality of the proposals has increased with each successive solicitation. As a result, the Army has reduced the number of topics evaluated for new work, this year, to ensure that funding is available for worthy Phase Two candidates. From the 4900 proposals received in 1987/1988, about 250 projects will be converted into Phase Two. Page75 Appendix VXKI LetterFromthe Lh+artmentofDefense ConcemingtheSBIRProgram Assessment of the Navy Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program The subject assessment has been prepared in conjunction with a majority of the Navy SBIR Administrating and Sub-Administrating Offices. The response by small businesses to the Navy's topics published in the annual Department of Defense Solicitation brochure has been excellent. The two thousand proposals received for about 250 topics, during both of the last two fiscal years, indicates that the Navy has made an effective outreach to small businesses, some being minority owned. The cream of the small businesses (approximately 15 percent of those making proposals) are receiving Phase I awards. Experience has shown that about 50 percent of the Navy's Phase I contracts transition to Phase II efforts. These trends have been found by the Navy as prudent practice considering the difference in scope and funding level between Phase I and Phase II awards. The result of this award behavior has been that the SBIR Program has proven highly beneficial as an adjunct to developing new technologies and broadening the Navy's industrial pool of capabilities. Navy SBIR contracts are developed and implemented by nine (9) Administrating and seventeen (17) Sub-Administrating Offices. Navy SBIR topics are selected by technologists to support anticipated research and development requirements in support of six naval warfare mission areas. As a result, Navy SBIR topics focus on important R&D thrusts including computer software, directed energy, guidance and navigation, sensors, materials, power sources, signal processing, telecommunications/fiber/optics, conventional warheads and, in particular, nev fields of advanced composites, ceramics, high temperature superconductors, robotics and artificial intelligence. The effectiveness of Navy Phase I and II contracts is demonstrated by the number of transitions into Phase III which are beginning to occur, with funding support derived from both government and commercial sources. Three Navy SBIR Phase III successes are particularly worthy of mention. The Office of Naval Technology sponsored development of technology assessment methodology by B-K Dynamics, Inc. (Rockville, MD). A personal computer based management system will be implemented to facilitate tech base program planning. The Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal Test Center is funding delivery of a prototype three-axis electromagnetic (EM) gradimeter from Dynamics Technology, Inc. (Torrance, CA) , which vi11 be used to detect deeply buried ordnance. The ROBOCOM Systems, Inc. (Levitown, NY), contract with the Naval Supply System Command is evolving into a budgeted and approved, one-year S9U Phase III contract to automate currently manual warehouse processes. In addition to these successful projects, several current Navy SBIR contracts have great potential. A nev theory for mine warfare planning is being developed by Horrigan Analytics, Inc. Page70 GAO/RCJ3.W39.39Asseesment of SBIRRograms Appendix VIII Letter Fhm the Department of Defense Concerning the SBIR Program (Chicago, IL), for the Naval Sea Systems Command. Physical Dynamics, Inc. (San Diego, CA), has developed a unique EM gradiometer using superconductive materials: Foster-Miller, Inc. of Waltham, MA developed a low flow separator; and Futetron :;~n Diego, CA), is developing radar absorbing materials. X-ray diffraction techniques for automatically assessing the quality of energetic materials developed by the Brimrose Corporation of America (Baltimore, MD) led to commercial utilization by DuPont. GTE is interested in electrodes for sulphur discharge lights developed by SMR, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA). Woven Carbon-Carbon composites from Techniweave may be pursued in the Tri-Service Integrated High Performance Engine Technology (IHPET) Program. A second source of stellar sensor optics was developed for the Trident program: and a fast switch may be valuable for Electronic Countermeasures. L Page 77 GAO/BCED49-39 heesement of SBIR Progcwns Appendix VIII of Defense Concerning the SBIR Progmm Assessment of the Air Force Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program SBIR contractors are offering new technologies and practical solutions to Air Force problems not previously considered. They are also very responsive and perform extremely well. This is noteworthy considering that many are contracting with the Air Force for the first time. The positive results of the program are related to the contractors' personal stake in the outcome of the projects. For example, a project in radiation-hard fiber optics established an SBIR contractor as a key producer of heavy metal fluoride glass. Another SBIR project resulted in giving the Air Force the lead in impulse radar technology, which is now a candidate for a major development program. New technologies and innovations coming from SBIR are already finding commercial application. Commercialization is occurring in both defense and non-defense industries, and is dependent upon the energy a company applies to searching out commercial opportunities. Many of the SBIR contractors have been successful in subcontracting their technology to a large business, licensing another company to manufacture, or acting as a prime contractor in developing a product for the Air Force or con8umer market. We are experiencing a large number of success stories throughout the Air Force with these programs. These include fiber optics, digital optronics, multispectral analysis, material processing, manufacturing technology, synthetic aperture radar, composite materials technology, airborne sensor platforms and computer-aided engineering design tools. The inexperience of SBIR contractors with Government contracting procedures has increased the administrative burden of the Air Force for the initial contractual actions, i.e., pre-award survey, approval of accounting systems, negotiations and reporting. Once the administrative tasks are completed, the burden of SBIR contracts is less than non-SBIR projects. The Air Force has worked aggressively to reduce any unnecessary administrative burden by simplifying the solicitation, purchasing request preparation and contracting procedures. This effort has been successful in reducing the government and contractor administrative burden. Many of the Air Force project officers responsible for managing SBIR projects believe that the innovation and responsiveness of the SBIR contractors are higher than with routine contracting procedures. The Air Force has used greater contractual flexibility and commercialization as SBIR contractor motivators. Since SBIR began in 1983, it has become a key part of the Air Force Research and Development program. It has been responsible for key technology breakthroughs and new products, benefiting both the Air Force and the consumer. It has demonstrated that small businesses are capable of performing quality research and development in response to Air Force requirements. L Page 78 GAO/RCED8S39 Assessment of SBIR Programs AppandixVIIl LetterFremtheDepertmentofDefense CancemingtheSBIEPrvgmm i Assessment of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program The number of new and innovative ideas submitted to the Agency has increased considerably due to the SBIR Program. The percentage of the small business community participation in Agency R&D has increased, with the concomitant results of more competition for Agency business and more second sources for vital defense technologies. Over 80% of the Agency program managers and administrators believe that their participation in the SBIR Program was worthwhile and that they received tangible benefits from it. Forty percent indicated that they were more aware of efforts in their technology area as a result of the Program. About twice as many Phase I and Phase II proposals are evaluated very highly and recommended for funding than are actually procured. This is indicative of the very high quality of SBIR work for which the Agency awards contracts. These results are based on a study of the SBIR Program at the Agency conducted by the SBIR program manager. Further results from this study indicate that the Congressional goals of the implementing legislation --the stimulation of technological innovation, the use of small business to meet federal R&D needs, and an increase in the private sector commercialization innovations--have been achieved. Page79 Appendix VIII Letter From the Department of Defemxe Concerning the SBIR Program Assessment of the Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program The Defense Nuclear Agency believes that the SBIR program has had a beneficial effect on the agency's research and development programs. DNA's technical managers give the SBIR program high grades for both innovativeness and quality of performance. They feel it is a unique source of fresh, innovative ideas and offers an inexpensive opportunity to explore high risk, high payoff ventures. They rate the quality of performance equal to or better than that obtained on non-SBIR contracts. Some of them also feel that SBIR contractors give more value for the dollar than some of the larger contractors. The SBIR program has been valuable to DNA as a means of broadening its contractor base. It offers small businesses an opportunity to suggest ways they can contribute to DNA's research and development programs and affords DNA an inexpensive vehicle for judging the capabilities of companies new to DNA's areas of interest. Some of DNA's technical managers have suggested that the SBIR program might be improved by raising the suggested dollar levels for Phase I proposals to S75,000-$100,000.

L. 97-219, signed by President Reagan in August, 1982, and further supported by a Presidential memorandum to agency heads in September. 1987. Since that time, the Department has complied with the provlsions of the SBIR legislation. SBIR LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY SBIR leglslatlon requires every Federal agency with an extramural research and development budget exceeding $100 million to set aside a minimum graduating percentage of that budget up to 1.25 percent annually for a special competition limlted to small, profit-making firms, to work on R and D problems of interest to the particular agency. The purposes of the Act are to stimulate technological innovation; to use small businesses to meet Federal R and D needs; to foster and encourage participation by minority and dlsadvrntaged persons In technological innovatlon; and to increase private sector colrncrciallzation of Innovations derived from Federal R and D. The law defines R and D as ' . ..any actfvlty which is (A) a systematic, intenslve study directed toward greater knowledge or understanding of the subject studled; (8) a systematic study directed specifically toward applying new knowledge to meet a recognized need; or (C) a systematic application of knowledge toward the production of useful matcrlals, devices, and systems or methods, including design, development, and improvement of protntypes and new processes to meet specific requirements.\" The legislatfon rewires '... a uniform process havlng (A) a first phase for dete&nlng, insofar as possible. the scientific and technical merit and feaslbillty of Ideas submitted pursuant to SRIR program sollcltrtions; (6) a second phase to further develop the proposed Ideas to meet the particular program needs, the awarding of uhlch shall take into conslderatlon the scientific and technical merit and feaslblllty cvldenced by the first phase . . . and (C) where appropriate, a third phase In which non-Federal capital pursues conercirl applications of the research or research and development and which may also involve follow-on non-SBIR funded production contracts with a Federal agency for products or processes intended for USC by the United States Government...\" MANAGEMENT OF ED'S SRIR PROGRAJ4 In a mworandum dated May 2, 1983, the Under Secretary of Education delegated responslbllity for management of the Department's SBIR program to the Assistant Secretary for Educational Prsearch and Improvement. The Assistant Secretary assigned responslblllty for day-to-day management of the program across the Departnrnt to a Senior Program Coordinator in the Offlce of Educational Research and Improvement. Fundlng for the SBIR Program is provided by individual prlnclpal operating components (POCs) allocatlng monies to support work on topics they identify in the Departwit's annual Phase I request for proposal solicitation. Within the Department of Education flve principal operating components--each with distinct and separate legislatlnn and R and D foci--have participated in the SBIR program over the last five years. These program units are the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS), the Office of Bilingual -l- Page 83 GAO/lEED-S~ Aaaeaement of SBIR Program Appendix IX Letter Prom the Department of Education Concerning the SBIR Program Educatton and Fcinorlty Language Affairs (OFEYLA), the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI), the Office of Postsecondary Education IOPE), and the Office of Adult and Vocational Education (OVAE). SBIR is managed through a worklna group composed of a representative from each of the POCs that make financial contrlbutlons. Working group members participate by submitting technical topics for solicitations, providing proposal reviewers, and monitoring projects funded from the units tht=y represent. They also coordinate SBIR activities withln their respective organizations. It should be noted that final decisions on projects to be funded under a alvrn topic in the SBIP prngram are made by a senior program official in the responsible principal operating component. SUmARY OF DEPARTMENT'S SBIR PROGRAM--1983-1987 The Department has complied with the provisions of SBIR legislation since its enactment in fiscal year 1983. In fact, it has slightly exceeded the legislated set-asides which were 0.2 percent, 0.6 percent, and 1.0 percent respectively for fiscal years 1983. 1984, and 1985. Additionally, It has exceeded the now continuing set-aside of 1.25 percent for fiscal years 1986 and 1987, and expects to do the same for fiscal year 1988. During fiscal years 1983 through 1987, the Department had five Phase I and four Phase II requests for proposal competitions, each conducted annually during the winter and early spring. These solicitations included a total of 19 distinct R and D topics (see attachment A) and generated a total of more than 850 Phase I eligible proposals from over 650 separate small business firms. Some 76 Phase I and 17 Phase II awards totalling over $5.3 mllllon were negotiated with 65 separate small business firms in 26 States and the District of Columbia. Currently, the Department has 28 active Phase I awards. 10 active Phase 11 awards, and 7 awards which are now in Phase III (all of whfrh reached that status wlthfn the last two years). The Department's review procedures for SBIR proposals have remained essentially unchanged during the program's five year history. Fach proposal is fndividually reviewed and rated by a minimum of three qualified Indfvlduals. Each reviewer rates a proposal based on published criteria outlined in each SBIR request for proposal solicltatlon. The reviewers are selected from rosters of qualified individuals maintained by each participating principal operating component. Each reviewer is asked not only to rate an assigned proposal but to identify its strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently, the senior program official in each POC makes fundlng decisions. These decisions are then conveyed to the appropriate Grants and Contracts Service unit personnel via procurement actinn requests. The Grants and Contracts Service unit then negotiates with offerors who have been recommended to receive an SBIR award, and notifies, by letter, those who wlll not receive an award.

The Department completes its review. -2- Page 84 GAO/RCED-89-39 Aeaeaement of SBLR Prograrw Appendix of Eduadon Concerning the SBIR Program decision-makinq, and award processes by September 30 of each fiscal year. A review of the SBIR projects supported by the Department revealed that nearly all rely on the use of computers to improve one or more facets of American education. For example: A Minnesota firm generated an authentic sounding bilingual speaking Spanish/English tutor131 program using computers so that students could more readily acaufre basic reading and language skills. A California small business firm developed a computer based English graaaaar and spelling monitor for use in schools. The resulting educational word processing software package is intended to permit elementary and junior high school teachers and students to spend more time developing writing and thinking skills. A New Hampshire firm worked with a team of scientists, engineers, computer prograaaaers. and educators to design, develop, and evaluate computer hardware and software for use in science laboratory experiments in secondary school classrooms. As a result, science students could receive an expanded number and variety of opportunities to participate in hands-on experiments. Two other small business enterprises--one in New Jersey, the other in Florida--each developed courseware authoring systems; i.e., a set of programs to help teachers organize and implement computer based instructional lessons. One authoring system is for language instruction In Chinese, Japanese, and English. The other authoring systcn Is designed to meet the Individual basic skill needs in reading. spelling, and mathematics of elementary students wlth cognitive or learning disorders. All five of the above mentioned projects are now in the early stages of SBIR's Phase III, the stage at which non-Federal capital pursues the R and D. The SBIR program has several built-in characteristics which make it unique when canpared to most other Department R and D programs. These include: (1) a \"feasibility of idea\" study stage (Phase I), before emerging into the R and D stage (Phase II); (2) a reliance on the marketing skills of entrepreneurs to get research findings into practice (Phase III); (3) government-wide simplified and standardized SBIP solicitation processes, regulated by Small Business Adatfnfstration policy directives; (4) retention of rights in data 9 encrated 5) in the perfownance of the contract by small business concerns; and a minimum of regulatory burden associated with participation in the SBIR program for small business concerns. It should also be noted that the Department's SBIR Phase I solicitations contain a variety of topics from which one set of performers, small businrss firms, for R and D can apply. On the other hand, most of the Department's non-SBIR solicitations for R and D contain only one topic for which a number of types of performers --non-profit and profit-making organizations and individuals--may submit a proposal. EFFECT OF SBIR ON DEPARTMENT'S R and D PROGRAM The Department of Education has relied on three dlfferent sources +n generate data to determine the effect of SBIR on the agency's R and D programs. These -3- Page 86 Appendix IX Letter From the Department of Ednadon ~nceminGtheSBlRProgmm are (I) an aralysfs of the appropriate leqislation governlnq the implementation of SBIR within the Department; 12) an analysis of a recent survey conducted by the Department of fts SBIR project monitors; and (3) a review and analysis of the historical data, program solfcftatfons, award topics. and completed Phase II awards. The outcomes of these-in house reviews elicited the following coammnts about the SBIR program within the Department. 1. FUNDS FOR SBIR ARE NOT AVAILABLE FROn ALL ELIGIBLE R&D PROGRAMS Implmnting SRIR In the @epartment of Fducation Is not without its dffffculties. Phased fn over a four-year period, the current and continuing SBIR set-aside of 1.25 percent now coamiands approximately 61.7 million of the Department's R and 0 budget. Some 30 separate R and D programs whose funding, when aggregated, exceed the $100 million threshold for extramural research and development should technically be availahle for contribution to the SBIR set-aside. However, each such R and D program has separate authorizing legislation 3rd congressional budget earmarks governing its use and dfrectlon, thereby affecting its availability for SBIR purposes. Specifically, only 19 of the 30. or 63 percent, of the R and 0 accounts used to determine whether ED nrets the $100 million threshold have authorizing legislation pemitting them to make awards to profit-making firms --the only ellgiblc awardees under the SBIR program. A table identifying the 30 R and D programs is provided in attachment 8. Additionally, statutory minimums and appropriation earmarkings of R and D funds restrict potential SRIR funding sources. For example, 97 percent of the Deparfzment's Education Research and Statistics account can only be used to support the Reglonal Educational Laboratories. National R and 0 Centers, the Center for Education statistics, the National Assessment of Fducational Progress, Field Initiated Research Grants, and the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC). The Impact of these legislatlvr constraints is evident in the small number of R and D programs in the Department which are required to contribute a disproportionately high share of their appropriated funds to satisfy the SBIR set-aside. Because of this situation, over 64 percent of the SBIR dollars obligated since 1983 have come from programs associated wfth the physically and emotionally disabled. 2. ED PROGRAM AND PROJECT OFFICIALS HAVE MIXED VIEW OF THE SBIP PROGRAJY A questlonnaln, developed by the General Accounting Offlce for its use with a random sample of SBIR project officers , was recently used by the Departnwnt of Education to survey its project officers who monitor SBIR and non-SBIR pmfectt . The questionnaire sought project officers' opinions about (1) the SBIR projects they monitor, and (2) the overall SBIR program. Background inforutlon about each project officer was also soliclted in the questionnaire. Of the 24 project officers who have SBIR projects and were sent the questionnaire, 23 responded. Four of the 23 did not coaplete most of the questions, stating that they had not been SRIR project officers long enough to form opinions. questlonnafre. One other project officer left the agency before completing the Data from the 19 project officers responding with completed questionnafres were aggregated, analyzed, and used for this report. -4- Page 86 GAO- Aaeensment of De~ntofEdocrtion Concerning Prorpun Most of the 19 respondents belfeved SBlR and non-SPIR research projects were about the same when comparing the overall quality of proiects. Their judgments were based on: (1) skills and expertise in the scientific/technical area addressed by the research, (7) experimental or analytic methods used during the research, and (3) effectiveness of the management and organization of the project. Respondents were also cf the opinion that creativity in carrying out the projects and the llkelihood that projects would lead to new scientlflc/techntcal discoveries or products were somewhat better for SBIR projects than for non-SBIR projects. Although most respondents believed that the potential for prlvste sector cocnerclrllzation of products was average or better for SBIR funded projects, the quality of scientific/technical outputs from projects, e.g. patents, agreements, and research articles, was thought to be somewhat better for non-SBIR projects. Project officers answered several questions focusing on SBIR and its relationship to the agency's research agenda and mission. In answer to one such question, 63 percent of the respondents believed SBIR projects could make moderate to some contribution to the research agenda and mission of the agency. The remaining 37 percent addressing the same question responded that SEIP projects will make little or no contribution to the research agenda and agency mission. When asked whether the SBIR program is an element of their overall research programs, over 47 percent of the project officers stated that it was not a very important element. The remaining 53 percent believed it was either a somewhat, moderate, or very important element of their overall research programs. Additionally. one-half of the respondents believed the relevance of the sclentlfic/technical problem to the agency's R and D needs tended to be less direct for SBIR projects when compared to that of their non-SBIR projects. Most project officers also stated that if the SBIR program did not exist withln the Department, thelr SBIR projects would probably not be supported by non-SBIR funds. Project officers were divided in comparing their current attitude toward the SBIR program to their attltudes when they first began working with SBIR projects. Approximately one third felt somewhat more positive, another third somewhat more negrtivr, and the last third felt that their attltude was about the same or that they had no basis on which to compare. Project officers were also equally dlvlded--between someuhat worse and about the same--when queried about the level of scientific/technical risk; i.e., researching an area where results are less easy to be achieved. When asked about the likelihood that SBIR projects will lead to new scientlflc/technical discoveries, or to inventing and connercializing new products, processes, or services, project officers were split between better, worse, and about the same. More than two-thirds of the SBIR project offlccrs believed that SBIR projects are technologlcelly innovative i.e.. the likelihood that projects ~111 lead to new sclentlfic/technicrl discoveries, or to inventing and corncrclrlizin9 new products, processrs, or services, while 26 percent did not believe they were innovrtlve at all. One indlvidual stated he had no basis on uhlch to judge technologlcel innovation. In giving their opinions about whether the four legislated SBIP goals are being met, more than half of the respondents (53 percent) stated that SBIR helps the agency meet Its R and D needs, 26 percent thought probably not, and 21 percent were uncertain. Some 58 percent of the respondents thought that SBIR -5- P8ge ConcemingtheSBIRRogram i stimulates technological innovation, 32 percent were uncertain, and !D percent felt it does not. Almost half of the project monitors (47 percent) believe S@IR encourages the private sector to cowanercialize the results of federally funded R and @, another 26 percent were uncertain, 16 percent had no basis fOr judgment. and the final 11 percent believed it prnbably did not encouraae private sector connerclaliration. Sixty-eight percent of respondents were pither uncertain or had no basis for judgment when asked about the fourth legislated SBIR goal--to encourage particlpatlon of minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation. The remaining 32 percent were split between \"probably yes' and \"probably no' when asked about that fourth leglslated SBIR goal. Just over 50 percent of the respondents Indicated they have been monitoring an STIR project for two years or less. Only three of the nlneteen respondents have been monitoring an SRIR program for five years. Nearly all respondents (84 percent) stated they spend 5 percent or less of their work time on SBIR related activities. Nine respondents stated they have overseen two or fewer SBIR projects since the SBIR program began. Three others indicated they have overseen three to five SBIR projects, and another seven respondents indicated experience with six or more SBIR projects. It should be noted that each project offfcer received and responded to only one questionnaire regardless of the number of SBIR projects he or she has overseen. A copy of the survey questionnaire that was used with the Department's prnject officers is provided in Attachment C. The total number of respondent answers is provided in parenthese next to each possible answer. 3. LEVEL OF INTEREST AMONG FIRMS IS HIGH On the average, each year the Department distributes a copy of its SBIR Phase I request for proposal solicitations to over 1,200 separate small business firms. In response to those solicitations, over the past five years, the Department received a total of 858 eligible proposals from more than 620 small business finms. While firm data are not avallable. carnents from SBIR project officers indicate that for a number of these firms, It is the first time they have responded to a Department of Education request for proposal solicitation. The number of responses to the competition indicates the small business conanunity has a strong interest in the Department's STIR program. As already noted, the Department has funded 76 Phase I proposals from fiscal year 1983 through fiscal year 1987. During that same period, each of 154 proposals received an avrrage score of 80 out of a posslble 100 from three independent reviewers using the evaluation criteria stated in the request for proposal solicitations and were ncoammnded for funding. Any SBIR proposal receiving an average score of 80 or above is deemed a high quality proposal. Using that standard, the Department funded almost 50% of the proposals deemed to be of high quality during the first five years of the SBIR program. The 76 Phase I SBIR proposals funded through fiscal year 1987 were awarded to 65 small business firms. Nine of the 65 small business firms received a second Phase I award. One of the 65 small business firms received three Phase I awards during the agencies first five years of the SBIR program. Additionally, analyses of the regional distribution show that the 76 Phase I awards have spanned 26 States and the District of Columbia.

I988 Dear Hr. Fultz: This is in response to your letter of December 8, 1987, that requested a judgment from the Department of Energy (DOE) on the effect of the Small Business Innovation Development Act on the Department's research programs. We believe that the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program has had a positive impact on DOE's R6D programs, and that the initial uncertainty concerning its value has been replaced by strong support for the program within the Department. An assessment of the DOE SBIR program was undertaken during 1987 to evaluate the quality of the research supported by the program compared to that traditionally supported by the Department. The assessment leads to the conclusion that SBIR and non-SBIR projects are of similar quality. Enclosure 1 describes the process and findings in more detail. During February of this year, designated representatives of the technical areas participating in the Department's SBIR program were interviewed on the program's effectiveness. The conclusion of this survey is that the program has effectively broadened the pool of available researchers and enriched the Department's research programs. Also. in many areas, the SBIR efforts have been integrated vith the ongoing WE research and development in a complementary and effective manner, and technology developed under SBIR support has been transferred to the private sector. Enclosure 2 describes these findings in more detail. Tbe Department regards the goals of the SBIR program as admirable and is pleased to report that the results achieved are worthvhile.

It 1s the Intent of this report to address, to tne extent possible, the \"effect\" elements of t.ne questIons ysed by the GAO without examlnlq the istated in Fubl~c Law 99-443) ccncernmq 'me effect:;reness of Phase I and Phase II and the +ai;ty of research supported by the SBIR Program ccmpared CO that tradltlonally supported my tne Department. Any assessment of \"effect\" or \"rmpac~\" must rake rnto conslderat:on that SBIR funds constitute only of the Department's extramural RSD budget. Thus SPIR prolects make up a very small portion of the researcn portfolL0. To is untended prlmrrly to zcrease corrmercralrzatlon of the results of federally funded research, It LS rmportant to recognrze that the technology transfer process 1s generally lengthy and trme consumlnq. Therefore, any defmitrve assessment of the effect of the SBIR Program LS someMat premature at this tline. it 1s Program ~11 ailw more conclusive fu?dLlqs. Background The Department of Health and Human Servrces includes five Gperatrng Drvrsrons: the Public Health Servrce, the Social Securltf AdminlstratLcn, the Office of Human Development Services, the Health Care Frnanclng Admmlstratron, and the Family Support Admlnrstratlon. Each of these Dlvrslons, as ~11 as the Office of the Secretary, admrnisters an extramural research program. In HKS, extramural research spenclrng tas grown from approximately S3.3 billion m Fy 83 to approxrrrately S5.4 billion Ln FY 87. Of this amount, approxlrrultely 96% are funds of the Public Health Service. Over the saw perrcd of tlm, the a polrcy decrsion was made to requrre all departmental components with extramural research actlvitles to partlcqoate m the SBIR Program. Al*hough the dqectives of sune HH.S research programs were not cor;patrble with the goals of the SXR legrslatlon, the Department attempted mitlally to Lnsure uniform overall partlcrpatlon by all components. Concern over the rncompatrbrlrty of these activities was rooted m the fact that there were and stall are three types Page 105 GAO/RCED-fS%# Aaaeaament of SBIR Programs Appendix Xl Letter From the Department of Health nnd Human Setices Concerning the SBIR Program of research prcqrams DHHS that experience slgnrfrcant difficulties LT. adapt- the SBIR Program model. First, there are scxw very sm;l departmental programs whose 1.25% set-aside is tea limited to war.inqfu!::; support SBIR activities. Secondly, there are programs that are leg;slatiV/e!y prohibited from making awards to for-profit enterprises and lastly there are programs whose missions are raved from either technological innovation or product c-rcialization. Consequently, a number of the smaller programs have since been dropped from the SBIR Program because either their extramural research budgets .wre too small to provide for a viable and cost effective program or their research ckqectives were not carpatible with SBIR goals. Since +-he SBIR set- aside requirement is applied against the overall departmental extrarmral budget rather than against individual programs, HHS &has been able, tnrougn administrative action, to meet the set-aside requirement. The experiences of each of the Divisions participatmg U-I the SBIR Program are described below: The Public Health Service IPHSlI Experience Program Irrplementation Prior to the inception of the SBIR Program, the experience of the PHS agencies--particularly the National Institutes of Health (NIHl--with small hslnesses had been restricted generally to contracts for technical or logistical support services ard for praurement of materials a& supplies. While there were some RhD contracts, these were relatively few in number. The SBIR Program becam the first, systematic, NIHride program to mvolve small businesses actively in grant supported research. This ushered in a new era for the research oriented PHS agencies which, until then, had interacted almost exclusively with academic institutions and not-for-profit research institutes. The SBIR Program also introduced an entirely new group of organizations and investigators to the PHS--corrpan ies and scientists that had never \"done business\" with the PHS agencies before Fy 83. At the outset of program Irrplementation, the Assistant Secretary for Health designated NIH as the lead agency in the public Health Service for SBIF! related activities. This decision was based largely on TV factors: (11 the SBIR set-aside funds at NIH constitute 92% of all PHS SBIR set-aside funding and (21 NIH has had the largest program and the longest tradition in supporting research. As a result, NIH has played the principal role in CkWelopihg SBIR ~iementing policies and procedures for the PHS. lThe Public Health Service agencies/offices particqatq in the SBIR Program Lnclude the National Institutes of Health, the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Admmistration, the Centers for Disease Control, the Food and Druq Administration, the National Center for Health Services Research and Health Care Technology Assessment and the Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs. Page 106 GAO/RW heeeement of SBIR Programs Appendix XI Letter Prom the Lkputment of Health and Human Services Concerning the SBIR Prognun L!seif '%ith In i'Y 85 contracts were intr-duced and have SLXP played an immportant though smaller role in supportmq ABIR research. :Le decrslon to adopt both fu-,dznq instr'urnents was based on the recqniclon :.-,a: a research agency, especially one such as NIH, needs to support both investigator mltlate? research as well as research tnat its identified agency requirements. While qrants have been used very ?ffect:vely to supper- a variety of research pro]ects whose ideas came from scientists in small businesses, this fmding instrument cannot be used to support research for tiich the agency has identified a need. The latter type of research constitutes a technical requirement that mst be met throuqh a research contract. In implementing any new program, especially one that Cats across all research programs of the PHS and which involves a new sector of the researcn community, there 1s a critical need to invest a significant amount of agency resources, particularly staff, to educate the new constituency. The small businesses that approached the PHS for SBIR support in the first th=ee co four years of the program were, by and large, totally unfamiliar witn Lie agencies wLti-m the PHS, their organlzatlon, programs, p0llCieS and procedures. To counter this problem, PHS staff invested substantial aro~its of time not only in famillarizlng small research corrpanies with \"+-he way 'de do busmess\" but also in monltorrng and interactmng with these fi,7m following the award of SBIR funds. Thrs investment has succeeded in educatrq our new \"clientele\" and, UI the process, *e have garned insrqhts into a research community that heretofore was equally unfamiliar to :us. General Program Information - The SBIR set-aside funds for the PHS have grm from 56,478,998 in Fy 83 to F&6,267,301 in FY 88. In each of the past fiscal years, the PHS has not only met but also exceeded its set-aside requirements. This points to Lhe fact that a number of fundi.rq ccnponents wrthln the PHS received proposals of sufficient quality that they contributed more than their allotted share of SBIR funds in order to make additional awards. The annual amounts by which the PHS has exceeded its set-aside requirements has ranged from S163,OOO to approxlrnately S740,OOO. Since the initiation of the program, over 3000 small businesses nave sukxfutted SBIR grant applications am3 contract proposals to the PHS. 3f these over 500 have been successful in conpetirq for SBIR funds. Scme conpanres have prcduced such high quality proposals that they have received mre than 20 SBIR awards each. In fact, as of March 1988 at least 370 firms have received a mlninum of two SBIR awards. Among those companies that have been successful, there 1s a significant percentage of mmrity/disadvantaged and women-cwned small businesses. This percentage is actually higher than that for PHS' tradltronal small business 3 Page 107 GAO/EED4S39 Aneesement of SBIR Programs Appendix Xl Letter Prom the Department of Health and Human !kvieea Concerning the SBIR Progmm set-aside contracts program. Based on data from FY 83 through PI 87, 94 awards have en made to minority/disadvantaged companies, 115 have been made to mne firms and 33 have teen made to small businesses wnose ownership is in the hands of minority/disadvantaged women. Although small businesses may submit grant applications for research on any subqect matter within the mission of the participating PHS agencies, the SBIR solicitations issued by the PHS offer over 375 mayor topics as examples of areas of interest. These solicitations cover a very broad range of research topics, ranging from the development of antiviral drugs and biolcgicals for the treatment of Acquired Imnunodeficiency Sy-rdrcme (AIDS) infections, to the refinement of technologies for screening of active anticancer agents, to the developmnt of devices ard instruments to help *de visually impaired rrraxlmlze the use of their residual vlslon, to research on the multiple biopsychosccial processes involved in the response to stress and hm +,hese responses relate to the onset and maintenance of physical and mental stress. There is hardly any area of biomedical or behavioral research m tiich small businesses are precluded from submitting proposals. To encourage small research oriented ccqanies to participate in the PHS SBIR Program, a policy decision was made in the early stages of planning that grant applications would be consider& in any program area within the mission of the participating PHS agencies. While the Small Business klministration was mltlally reluctant to accept this approach to proposal sukxnissron, eventually the PKS was able to negotiate this flexibility into its SBIR Program. As a result of this approach, the PHS was able to fund 245 meritorious research prolects over the last five years that muld not otherwise have keen eligible for consideration. The Appnduc to this report shows the number of grant applications and contract proposals tit have been submitted to the PHS SBIR Program since PY 83 and the number of awards over the same perrcd of tme. Posltrve Features of the SBIR Program While the SBIR Program offers a variety of positive features, the specific benefits that the PHS has reaped from supporting SBIR research include the following: II) SBIR addresses previously identified gaps in HHS research Progr-. A large nun&r of these gaps appear to be in +-he area of medical instrumentation, for exarrple, the development of devices for the diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of patients with cmicative ard sensory disorders, i.e., patients with irrpainnents of hearing, speech, language, taste, touch or smell. Instruments for the treatment of dematolcq~cal and cornea1 diseases had also been identified as research gaps but had received minimal attention from researchers prior to inception of the SBIR Program. Indeed, SBIR has proved to be a very effective means of encouragrrq the develcpeent of devices, instruments and other hardware +hat have not otherwise been addressed.

SBIR represents an addltLona1 mechanism for expedltlrq technology transfer ard the application of basrc research flrdlrqs to solvxq clinical problems. SBIR also serves as an alternative vehicle for tarqetrng SpeCiflC areas of mterest. It offers cpport~inities to exploit basic research flndLnqs that have comnerclal potential but which cannot Se pursued through our regular grants program. 131 SBIR provrdes additional resources to accomplish program goals. By attractq snrall businesses wrth appropriate expertise to r=.e PHS research cmity, the SBIR Prcqrarr has not only ldentlfied new resources for achlevq program goals but also provided mre flexlblllty to prcqram staff. As a result of the program, prrvate sector researchers wrth new, excrtirq ard swretlmes rrsky ideas/approaches have been dram Lnto the federal R6D effort. Consequently, the pool of sclentrsts who can answer some of *he critical questions in research and help ,mzet program needs 1s enhanced. Because of -qement and admlnlstratlve d-s, these mvestlgators can frequently devote full tim attention to their research and thus achieve their scientific and technxal &]ectives iTDre raprdly. One of the very important and tangrble benefits of SBIR LS +&e coupling of engrneerrng expertise with cllnlcal research to produce an array of products and technology that are hrghly Innovative. When one examines the inventory of products that are being developed with SBIR support, frcan an electrochemical microsensor that can selectively detect presence of human breath ard its alcohol content to the develmnt of tiection resistant shunts, it kcfnes cbvrous that muld be without the expertxe of both and c1Ln1c1ans. It muld be an cbvrous omission rf fry did mt mention that SBIR has been lnstrun-ental 111 linking tiustry researchers with academic rnvestigators by provrdrng an mcentive to collaborate, lead- to n-ore rapid technology transfer. By serving as either 5 Page109 GAO/RW Aaaeament of SBIR Programs Appendls Xl of He&h and Human Servicea C4mcemhg the SBJR Program consultants or subcontractors to small businesses, 'unlversrty- based researchers have helped to enhance the outcOrn of tne research funded under the SBIR Program.

I Since regular research programs do not expressly support product development, many of the products, processes am technoloqy supported by SBIR funds might mt have been developed if the SBIR I Program had not been instituted.

Impact of the SBIR Program Despite the relatively srrall size of the SBIR Program in relation tc the larger PHS research portfolio, SBIR has yielded sane mterestlrtq results for the PHS. It has demonstrated that available scientific knowledge is readily applicable to the develgment of innovative rrethcdologies. For example, rn the area of envrronmental health sciences, it has stimulated the application of fumlamental kmuledqe to solvim a specific problem with an lnvitor assay that is currently used to identify potential mutagens or carcinogens. The original assay is labor and mterlal intensive. By mzdlfyrng the protocol, a s1~11 busmess has reduced the costs by approximately 50% and has enhanced the reliability of the assay as well. This assay system 1s important because chemicals helm considered for druqs and those introduced into the environmnt mClst be tested for ptentlal carcincqenicity and health hazards to hinmns prior to industrial deplomnt. SBIR pro]ects have also helped NIH respond to the Congressionally mandated rnltikrve to fund research in learnw disabilities and enhanced research in high priority areas such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). A carplter system is be- developed to teach reading and spell~m to dyslexic chklren. It rncorporates animated color graphics, voice response through speech synthesizers ard a touch-sensltlve display for response by the child. This system will be used to teach sound-s-1 correspondence to +he point that children can deccde words automatically and fmus attention on word meaning. The research on SIDS involves the development of a supple, noninvasive instrument capable of accurate am efflclent acoustical ana~ysls of Infants cries to identify term infants at risk for SUE. 6 Page 110 GAO/BcED8939 Assessment of SBIR Programs Appendix XI Letter bm the Department of Health and Human Services Concerning the SBIR Program SBIR t-as acceierated a :Lsedse actbvlty, thus probe, whLch pen:ts a measurement acc~acy of better char: 0.1 C and a response tme of less than 0.2 second, offers a -IL~TLxZ advantage over currentiy ava:lable probes. Another result of t!!e SB:R activLtLes LS mat small busrnesses have developed an extfnsLve array of research resources useftil to and required ry most individual scientists M-IO lack the tme and means to produce these research resolflces routinely and consistently. These include standardized, hLqh qualLty assay procedures, reaqents, cell lmes, we!1 as new LnstrumentatLon requLred by clLnLca1 researchers. One of the areas Ln which SBIR may play the most sLgr,:f:cant role LS the develmnt of orphan drugs and devLces. Larger cwnles are simply hot attracted to +hLs fLeld because they do not perceLve the fLnancLa1 and proceed wrth an orphan dmg or device because they are net seekmg as sizable a return or profrt as the larger fLrms. There LS a growirq belief arronq proqram staff that the SBIR Program may indeed :Iiel? some SiqnlfiCant impact in the orphan druq and device arena. A limited but intriqumg by-product of the SBIR supported research :s +-hat it has created an opportunity for several academc clinrcal Lnvestiqators who served as consultants to some of the SBIR awardees to obtam regular research funding for proJects using the devLces developed by the smll ousI.nesses. As the SBIR Program matures, it high cpallty blcmedlcai research relres neavrly for success on equally sound research in instrumentation, enqineermq, physics and mathematics. SBIR has been able to advance RSD more rapidly by marrying tcqether enqineermnq, physics and mathematical concepts that are relevant to bmnedlcal research. Although a number of the SEIR products described earlier Ln thrs report were made possible because SBIR provided the Lmpstus and the opportunity, there are a few research outcomes that probably would not have materialized at all without the presence of the SBIR Program. Although SBIR has accelerated the development of certam devices, instruments, drugs and assays, it is possible that these products muld have been developed eventually without strmlation fran the SEIR Program. There are other itemS. haever, that would not have been developed at all lf SBIR fund- had not keen made available. One excellent example 1s the develwnt of vaccine for parainfluenza viruses, a group of unportant resprratory pathogens. In a recent Institute of Medicine report that identified the leadlnq diseases that could be 7 Page 111 GAO/RcED8939 Aaaesament of SBlR Pro@ams Appendix Xl Letter From the Department of Health and Human Services Concerning the SBIR Program prevented by +he development of approprrate v:r'Jses Yet no replar grant applicatrons had teen submrtted, much less funded, m ~9:s area. Today 'nere are two smal1 ccmpanles that are developrnq pararnfluenza vaccines. These two pro]ects constitute the oniy research of its rcmd funded by NIH. One =f the vaccines 1s now celnq considered for human cllnrcal trials, and SOW large pharmaceutical companres have already expressed an rteres? in manufacturlnq ;t. The development of human renln aqents whrch offer siqnlfican: improvements a rna]or rmpehmenr to ttie deslqn of c is the lack of numan renrn which is very difficult to obtain. A small business has succeeded in producing human renln in suff;cient quantities that ~11 allow X-ray analysis and subsequent cquter aided deslqn of orally active renm l.nhbrtors. Other examples of research products attrtiutable exclusrvely to the SBIR Program include the use of DNA and RNA hybridization techniques to develop tests for detecting cytomegalovrrus m blood specunens. Cytomgalovrrus, a member of the herpes virus group, 1s present U-I the blood of a large portion of the human populatron. H&ever, admlnlstration of this blood to high rls~ patients may result m death. Therefore, assays that are fast, simple, sensitive and speclflc are extremely valuable tools. In the area of c Ommulicative disorders, a small firm has developed a mrcrocomputer alded therapy program to produce fluent, normal soundinq speech m adolescents and adults who stutter. It is the only research pro]ect on stutterlnq flunked by NIH. The program, wtiich can be easily used by my qualified speech patholcqrst, appears to be equaliy effective in English and other languages. Potentral for Comnercral~zation of SBIR Results Although one of the primary obiectives of the Small Business Innovation Development Act is to Lncrease comnerclalizatLon of +che innovations der:ved from SBIR research, the relative youth of the program makes it scfnewhat premature at this tune to gauge whether It 1s has succeeded m meetinq this obpctlve. As varrous studies of technology VJansfer have affirmed, the process of translating research frndlngs rnto a definable product that is subsequently marketed successfully takes at least S-10 years. The GAO report due I.II 1993, rather than the one to be submitted to Congress this year, will lrkely provide more deflnltive data on the comnercialrzation of SBIR results. There are, however, a small number of examples of SBIR products that have reached the comnerclal market. The most slqniflcant of these is an innovative tuneable dye laser that uses selective photothemlysls to treat port WU-E stains (PWSI a4 hemanqlomas. whrch is target can erase WS birthmarks and yet leave the trssue surrounding the target unaffected. It iS antlclpated that, because of Its advantages, '91s laser may displace existinq argon laser techniques.

Although a number of these SBIR pro]ects have resulted m publxatlons, there 1s less of an Lncentive arrong SBIR awardees to publish research ftimgs because of the proprietary rk3ture of a significant amunt of their research. Furthermore, career advances for screntlsts m mdustry are generally not tied to their publlcatron records. Nonetheless, articles have been plblmhed m a number of well-established refereed ~oumals.

This was due genera 1 iy to the authorizing legislation under which +Le HDS programs operate. In mst cases, the statutes limited eliqioility to local and State governments, and private non-profit institutions. The limited statutory capability to fund \"for-profit\" organizations as grantees Ws not used extensively. As a result, awards to small businesses resulted from their participation in other programs within HE6 tiich ware not related to research and demonstration. Since the mlementation of the SBIR Program m 1983, HZ6 has awarded 32 qrants to small businesses. These awards total over S1.5 million in research ard demonstration funds. In the next 5 years, HDS expects to fur-d an additional S2.5 million in awards under the SBIR Program. During the initial implementation stage of the SBIR Program in KDS, it was difficult to determlne the role small busmesses could play m corductmq P.&D twrd the end of ccemarcializinq the results of their research. One mayor concern =s that the kind of products that were traditionally derived fran HE' research was informational nkaterials such as \"how-to\" manuals. For example, one of HE' regular research priorities in 1963 focused on the development and testing of new service delivery mcdels with a high probability of increasing the efficacy of semices at the point of service delivery. HDS questioned whether this kmd of research could successfully be conducted and tested mthin the guidelLnes of the SBIR Program. Could ~5~s research be carried out with the Sl50,OOO cc&u-& resources for Phases I and II? And, if so, hen* would the results be ccxnnercralized? WLat audience wauld be willing to pay for information previously made available \"free\" by HIX, or at a rcml~l cost through an inforrration clearinghouse? Consequently, HE received only a limited number of proposals under that year's SBIR Solicitation. Over the next few years, HE' research and demonstration efforts shifted toward identifying model approaches m hm services delivery that have a direct impact on increasing self-sufficiency. With this conversion, a major thrust m HE' R&D objectives became the dxsseminatron of information about exerrplary techniques and approaches *hat had already proven successful thrc@ research a& danstrations. Ofequal~rtancebecaffe~theneedto replicate these mcdels in other qeoqraphic locations. It was at thrs point that IES realized hm potentially valuable small businecs could be in meeting its F&D needs. Ca-mbarcralization of *he results of HDS' P&D activities has the potentral for increasing the practical applications of these techniques aId approaches. When a new approach in human services is to be transferred franone location to another, an important step is developing the documentation that captures the \"essence\" of the mmvation. The successful capture--in a report, a videotape, or tram- materials--provides an ideal gportunity for ccmnxcralization arch e believe ml1 ultmtely lead to increased usage by service practitioners and others in the social field. With the above concept YI msrd, in 1988 HDS solicited proposals in a.reas such as Interactive Leamlng for Youth. This research topic requested the developnent of books and/or video materials that utilized \"decision theory.\" In another research topic, HIS sought proposals for the development of simple 11 Page 115 GAO/RCEDs939 Assessment of SBIR Programs Appendix m Letter Prom the kqartment of Health and Human *rvicez~ Concerning the SBIR Program lcw cost products and devices that would enable older persons to perform -r.e tasks of daily living. These ard other research areas drew an overwhelminq response from small businesses. Approximately cne hundred proposals wre received for the combined 7 research topics announced XI our 1988 SBIR Solicitation. Thus, this uas a dramatic turnaround UI *he number of applicant proposals received. HiI6 v~eus the SBIR Program as a srgnificar.: step toward stimulating the small business cwnunrty in participatrnq in :ts research program and U-I helping HDS to achieve dissemination and replicatlor., as well as other aspects of its mission. HE anticipates that the mst highly visible technological innovaUons conducted by small businesses wrll be an outgrowth of its 1988 SBIR Program. The Health Care Financrnq Mministration's (HCFAI Experience The focus of the Health Care Financinq Adminrstratlon's research and demonstration programs is the study and resolution of major health care financing issues and the development of unproved methods of admrnisterw the medrcare and msdicald programs. HCFA LS responsible for stwdyinq the programs it iwnaqes and the seqment of the economy m which these programs operate. There is little 1tielM that mketable ovations or products will be produced as a result of this kti of research. The mayor thrust of HCFA's R&D program is incompatible with the SBIR rrndel. HCFA's relatively small R&D budget further aggravates SBIR set-aside has grown to 5333 thousand II? FY 87. Prior to the enactment of the SBIR Program, HCFA attempted to utilize small business firms to the maxirwm extent possible rn its research and demonstration programs. This approach was en@~%ized prior to the mlementatron of the SBIR Program and has continued subsequent to its ii@ernentation. Generally, small busrness firms have been used as subcontractors on large I&D projects or as prime contractors on small, usually short term, analytical projects. Because of the relatively small size of its SBIR program it has been difficult for KFA to develop SBIR topics Arch are totally cormwwrate with its rmssion. Hu&ver, HCFA has developed a number of topics for the SBIR Program which are sawwhat ccnpatlble with its mission. Few if any of these toprcs, hcwever, are of sufficient priority to warrant funding were it not for the SBIR set-aside requirement. KFA has been able to attract an adequate n&r (30-50 each .yearl of s.1~11 businesses rnterested in its SBIR tcQ1cs. The ccnmrcial potential of Phase II awards, to date, has been very limited. The type of research 'KFA needs is s-t removed from technoloqlcal ovation and product ccewnercializatlon. HCFA's research pro3ects results mostly rn research papers arx? statistical studies, both have very lunited cwwrcial application. To date, no marketable technological rnnovations have resulted fran HCFA's SBIR Awards. Concerning the SBlR Program 0 SBIR has enhanced Lhe research pcrtfolro within the Pbl:c Healtz Service. By en?ohasrzrnq applied research to solvxq clinical proclems, SBIR pro]ecrs have prsvAed a counterbalance to the PHS basic research programs. In cases iit.ere a program's needs In applied research ?,ad not prevrous1.f been wt. SBIR has succeeded x '-\".e ?H.S research prcqrams. 0 SBIR has facilitated and expedited tecnnolcqy transfer within :?e Public Health Service. More than any other sinqle feature, the SBIR Program nas clearly accelerated the translation of research findinya Lnto useful ard marketable products. SBIR awardees have souqht innovative means of exploiting fundamental knowledge and technology to develop products that are not only cleverly desiqned but also meetamarketneed. Given the SBIR emphasis on comnercralization, the overwhelming share of SBIR pro]ects supported by the PHS are mtended to develop products, processes or technolcqy with commercial applications. 0 SBIR has attracted a new qroup of sclentlsts to the PHS research c-ity who can contribute toward meeting program goals. ThrOUgh Lhe SBIR Pragram, PHS has been able to \"tap\" a new source of investiqators, scientist-entrepreneurs who normally wuld not be Aparticrp+ating in the type of research that is r-raditionally supported by the PHS. Thus SBIR has drawn \"ne+.comers\" with new areas of expertise into +he pool of qualified Lnvestigators .xho can assist the PIE in meeting Lts overall prcqram goals. 0 The Office of Human Cevelopnent Services has identified a siqnrficant role that small busmesses can play YI its RSD prcqrams. IfIX feels that small businesses, through the SBIR Program, will provide a vehicle for the transfer, dissemination, and replication of new technology developed by HDS grantees in the areas of human a-d scxzial semices. 0 The Department is continuing to fir-d ways m which smaller R&D programs whose missions may seem sanewhat incompatible with the SBIR model, can participate in the program in a meaningful manner. Reccmnendations 0 There is sentiment among staff at the Public Health Service that Phase I is too restricted, in terms of both the perrad and amount of support. A large number of our SBIR awardees find it difficult to produce maanxigful results in six months' tune at a funding level of s50,000. Yet these results constitute a critical element in assessrng the degree to which the SBIR auardee was successful in meting Phase I objectives. It has been suggested that a rmxe appropriate timfram rmght be 12 months with funding increased to 575,000. This would allow the small business sufficient time and 13 Page 117 GAO/RCED449-39 Assessment of SBIR Programs Appendix XI Letter From the of Health and Human Servicea conctming the SBIB Rogram resources to carry out the Phase I effort whose results figure very heavily in the evaluation of the Phase II proposal. If Phase I can be extended to 12 months, it muld also make it posslale for -he PHS to accept a Phase II proposal prior to expiration of the Phase I prolect and thus mrnlmize the fundlnq hiatus that currently exists betbeen the tm phases. 0 The Cepartmnt supports the concept of allckiing an agency to accept Phase II proposals fran a snrall business that has already completed its technrcal feasibility study with non-federal funds. The -rent program structure ml1 not allm thrs and thus forces a number of ccnpanles to construct a Phase I study which m fact has already advanced beyord the technical feasbility stage. It appears that the Lnterests of both the sn~111 buslness cmity and the federal agencies muld be se& by allow- exceptions to the current process in which a srrall business must receive a Phase I award XI order to be eligtile for Phase II fundmq. Wrle such an approach might mvite srrall firms to apply for larger awards IJ-I Phase II without carry- out the Phase I effort, this ptentlal problem could be avoided by estillshlng strict requirements for dcxzumentation of the Phase I effort and Its results. 14 Page 118 GAO/R- Aseeaoment of SBIR Programs Appendix XI Letter From the Human the FY 04 833 217 91 53 FY 85 881 276 140 1 A ,14 v FY 86 L623 342 240 142 FY 87 L531 317 369 99 (Starting in Py 85) FY 85 382 156 N/A FY 86 385 71 120 23 FY a7 305 76 43 suhritted Subitted sutritted N/A 2 2 3 3 2 2 9 2 N/A 2 1 3 2 4 1 3 2 Page 119 GAO/RCED4939 Amesoment of SBIR Prorpams Appendix Xl Letter Prom the Department of He&h Human Services Concerning the SBIR Program LEES- 910 95 56 E-f 85 1342 146 109 FY 86 2036 421 366 168 FY 87 1883 356 457 146 Page 120 GAO/RClXMS-39 Assessment of SBIR Programs Letter From the Department of Transportation Concerning the SBIR Program Yr. Neal P. Curtin Deputy Director Resources, Community and Economic Development Division Uruted States General Accounting Office Washmgton, D. C. 20548 Dear Mr. Curtm: The Secretary of Transportation has asked me to respond to your recent request for judgments of department or agency heads as to the effect of the Small Business Act on their research programs. The Research and Special Programs Administration has been assigned the responsibility for administering the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program for the Department of Transportation and provides the overall management of the Program. In response to your request, we have obtained informatron from the various elements of the Department regarding the effectiveness of Phase I and Phase II of the SBIR Program. The Department has awarded 135 Phase I and Phase 11 contracts valued at approximately $12 million unce the SBIR Program's Inception m Fiscal Year 1983. The awards were based on the provisions of Public Law 97-219, as amended, which currently require a minimum of 1.25% of the Department's extramural research budget to be set aside for research or research and development by SBIR awardeer. Our overall assessment of the SBIR Program, based on information provided by our various Operating Admmistrations, is that the Program has provided an important adjunct to normal contracting mechanisms for meeting the objectives of the Department's research programs. The research objectives of the Department are to provide the information and new technology needed for its operational programs (e.g., air traffic control) and for regulatory programs (e.g., automotive and aircraft safety standards). The SBIR Program has contributed toward meeting these objectives by providing research that has relevance to the improvement of some aspect of the national transportation system or to the enhancement of the ability Of the Department to perform its mission. The SBIR Program has also enabled firms that would otherwise not normally be able to compete for federal research funds to provide significant contributions toward a safe, efficient and reliable transportation system. The SBIR research topic areas are determined annually by each Operating Administration and reflect the Department's priority research needs best met by innovative small business firms. The SBIR Solicitation process has helped the Department meet its current research objectives and provides a timely and cost- effective contracting method with small business firms. Page 121 GAO/RCED49-39 Assessment of SBlR Rograms L+m.m From the Dement of 'Ihnsportation Concerning the SBIR Program Page Two The supporting information for the judgment provided above is included in the attachment. I hope this informatlon is useful to your overall assessment of the SBIR Program. Please let me know If there IS any addItIona information needed. Attachment Page 122 GAO/BcED%939 Asaewment of SBIR Programs Appendix XII of Tranaportatfon Concemitig the SBIB Ro@=t L ATTACHMENT The participating elements of the Department of Transportation's Small Busmess Innovation Research (SBIR) Program mclude the Office of the Secretary, United States Coast Guard, Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Highway Administration, Federal Railroad Admmistratron, Marltrme Admtmstratlon, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Urban Mass Transportation Administration, and the Research and Special Programs Admlnistratron. Each element has a mission which includes research or research and development opportunities for mnovatlve small busmess firms as summarized below. OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY The Office of the Secretary (OST) supports broad-based policy research on domestic and international transportation issues of importance to the nation. The SBIR Program in the Office of the Secretary, although small, operates in a cooperative manner with the various Operating Administrations and jointly funds critical projects. This has helped ensure that research priorities in areas such as safety are initiated in selected cases. OST is pleased to continue to contribute and participate with the other modes that support high prrorrty research goals and objectives of the Department. UNITED STATES COAST GUARD The U.S. Coast Guard WSCG) supports research to maintain and improve search and rescue systems, environmental protection, marine safety, aids to navigation, the enforcement of laws and treattea and activities which benefit all USCG programs. The SBIR Program has provided an approach to perform basic research in high priority areas in support of USCC mission requirements. The SBIR Program is an effective method to achieve research objectives that are most appropriate for innovative smafl business firms. The success of the SBIR Program is demonstrated in projects that have application both to the USCG and to other operating elements both within the DOT and in other federal agencies. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION The research program of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is consistent with the needs of the National Airspace System Plan. Current initiatives include enhancing the capability of a wide range of radar systems to meet new operational requirements; continuing the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System Program; increasing system and airport capacity; continuing developmental efforts for Advanced Traffic Management and Automated 'Enroute Traffic Control; continuing development of radars for detection and tracking of severe weather; and continuing emphasis on initiatives in aviation security through expedited development of devices for detection of weapons, explosives and flammable liquids. Page 123 GAO/RCXD&MS Asaeeament of SBfB Programs Appedix XII Letter From the Department of Transportation Concerning the SBIR Program ATTACHMENT (Continued) Page Two The SBIR Program plays an important part in FAA's research and development activities. This role is both supplementary and complementary ln nature to the overall FAA mission. The SBIR Program supplements near-term, applications- oriented research and development programs with innovative, forward-looking research objectives. This longer term approach (as distinguished from basic research for which the FAA is not chartered) would not ordinarily be performed under existing programs. The SBIR Program also complements FAA research and development efforts by filling gaps and offering alternative solutions and avenues of investigation ln various R&D programs. An example of this complementary function is noted in the area of aviation security. A recent SBIR project has demonstrated the feasibility of using a complementary nonradioactive electrically driven source of neutrons for baggage interrogation at airports. This Phase I effort proved to be successful and will be funded in Phase II with project funds, thereby freeing up allocated SBIR funds for other worthy FAA research tasks. A noteworthy feature of the SBIR Program is the unique process by which research needs are solicited from the various technical groups who are aware of the most pressing agency needs. SBIR topical areas resulting from this solicitation process currently include aircraft safety, aviation security, avionics, air traf flc control/flight services technology, aeromedicine and human factors. An additional feature of the SBIR Program is its ability to apply either allocated SBIR funds or project funds to accomplish R&D tasks. This flexibility to appiy diverse financial resources coupled with the mimmal administrative burden of SBIR provides an extra level of speed and responsiveness to FAA needs. FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) supports research programs in highway planning, design, construction and maintenance to ensure an effective and efficient national highway system. Research is also conducted to identify and correct impediments to highway safety and to improve common carrier safety. The SBIR Program effort, although small in relation to other FHWA research programs, is carefully selected by the Office of Research, Development and Technology (RD&T) to assure that it complements and supports the other federally funded highway research programs nationwide. The research work which has been performed under the SBIR Program already has had a significant effect on portions of the highway research program. The SBIR work addresses issues in major RD&T categories including safety, traffic operations, structures, hydraulics, materials and pavements. The SBIR Program is viewed as making a significant contribution to the overall highway research program. SBIR provides an opportunity for small business firms to propose novel research ideas and bring them to fruition. FHWA plans to continue to utilize the SBIR Program to pursue innovative solutions to highway research problems. Page 124 GAO/RCED4%39 Asaesament of SBIR Programs Appendix XII Letter From the Department of Transport&on Concerning the SBlR Program ATTACHMENT (Continued) FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION Page Three The Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA) research and development efforts are prlmarlly directed m support of the Admmlstratlon's rail safety regulation responsibllitles. FRA believes that the SBIR Program should be continued since It provides an efficient means for accomplishmg the task it was designed to address. FRA has funded more than the mandatory assessment, when resources have permitted, and views SBIR as a useful way to communicate priority research needs to a broader community of scientists and engineers than might otherwise be reached. MARITIME ADMINISTRATION The Maritime Administration's (-MARAD) research and development missron has included development of methods, equipment and systems to make the U.S. shipbuilding and ship operating industries more efficient, competitive and productive. MARAD has supported the objectives of the SBIR Program: however, funds for .MARAD's overall research program have been severely reduced eliminating the extramural base on which SBIR funding is assessed. Although the quality of Phase I research supported has been good, none has proceeded far enough along from the initial feasibilrty effort to enter into a second phase development project. NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) supports research for motor vehicle and highway safety research and developments including alcohol enforcement and emergency services, crashworthiness and crash avoidance research, the National Occupant Protection Program and the National Driver Register. NHTSA supports the SBIR Program as a valuable adjunct to the research procurement process to encourage small businesses tu develop innovative approaches or concepts. The SBlR Program provides a unique research and development forum in which a desired applied R&D project can be prioritized on the basis of its importance to the highway safety program. URBAN MASS TRANSPORTATION ADMINISTRATION The Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA) provides support to research, training and human resources programs in all phases of urban mass transportation services and programs which contribute toward meeting total urban transportation needs at minimum costs. In addition, UMTA supports interdisciplinary research at colleges and universities including training of personnel to conduct further research or to obtain employment in urban mass transportation planning, construction, operation or management. - - Page 126 GAO/RCEJJ49-39 haeaeunent of SBIR Progmm Appendix of Tranoportatton Concerning the SBIR Program ATTACHMENT (Concluded) Page Four The SBIR Program provides UMTA wrth the ability to solicit and obtain innovative approaches to address current irutiattves. The Program has resulted in research efforts which address transit efficiency and promote greater competition and involvement of the private sector in the movement of people in urban areas. The Program is an Important part of UMTA'r research and development efforts because it enables innovative entrepreneurs to propose and test new concepts. RESEARCH AND SPECIAL PROGRAMS ADMINISTRATION The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) provides support for research in hazardous materials, pipeline safety, radio-navlgatlon, transportation statistics and emergency tranrportatlon. RSPA's contribution to the SBIR Program is limited due to the small size of the overall RSPA research program.

CL GAO/RCEDd3%39 Assessment of SBtR Programs Letter From the Ewironment.d Protection Agency Concerning the SBIR Program SMALL RllSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH PROGRAM REPORT TO THE U.S. GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE Introduction The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) has requested the U.S. Environ- mental Protection Agency (EPA) to assess the effectiveness of its Cmall Business Innovation Research (SEIR) Program in strengthening the role of small businesses in meeting EPA's research and development needs and the needs of other agencies. EPA's response and those from the other Federal agencies with SBIR programs will enable GAO to transmit a report on this subject to appropriate House and Senate Committees by necember 31. 1988, as required by Public Law 99-443. This report represents EPA's response to GAO's request. Oescrtptlon of EPA's SBIR Program In an effort to fulfill the mandate of the SBIR Act, EPA's SBIR program seeks basic innovative research projects that are concerned with national pollution control in solid, liquid, and gaseous media. Innovation in emission reduction/control processes are sought which concern, but are not limited to industrial, municipal. drinking water. hazardous material, and energy production sources. Performance and cost effective approaches featuring conservation, reuse, recycle, and increased efficiencies are of special interest. Research in the development of environmental instrumen- tation and measurement methods is also solicited, where they are directly connected to pollution control processes. In order to cultivate the widest array of innovation in research and development approaches, EPA has provided wide latitude to the recipients in the conduct of their programs, and has avoided the use of the SEIR program as a procurement tool. Methods of Analysis As in other federal SBIR programs, EPA's SBIR program is divided into two phases: d Phase I which consists of d six-month feasibility study and a Phase II, which is a development study of at most 2 years. The purpose of the Phase II research is to produce d commercial product or process in the area of pollution control, instrumentation or measurement methods. As part of our analysis, we hdve restricted our response to PhdSe II SBIR projects, since the six-month PhdSe I feasibility studies are too short to provide enough significant data to influence EPA's overall research and development program, and is not intended to produce d saleable product or process. Page 128 GAO/RCED-8939 Assesement of SBIR Programs Appendix XIII Letter Rom the Environmental Protection Agency Cbvxning the SBCR Program 2 Data for our analysis was obtained through a survey letter (Appendix 4) which was sent to all of EPA's Phase II awardees, both past and present, totalling twenty-nine. Interaction directly affecting EPA's research and development and/or any other EPA activity was requested, as was Information on the awardees' interactions with other federal agencies relative to their EPA-sponsored SBIR research. The analysis plan was to provide a synopsis of each response (Appendix 5) and to tally the percentage of responses in each category requested. Results The following results are based on a brief analysis of the respondents' letters and contain all of the principal characteristics of their responses. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. All recipients of the survey request responded (29). Sixty-five percent of the respondents indicated that they have had sane interaction with EPA or other Federal agencies, State governments, local governments, or private industry. Thirty-one percent of the respondents reported interaction with EPA laboratories or field stations. Fourteen percent of the respondents reported interaction with EPA regional or headquarters prograwoffices. Twenty-eight percent of the respondents reported interaction with State or local governments. Thirty-five percent of the respondents reported having interaction with private industry. Thirty-flve percent of the respondents reported that they have not had any interactions with the Agency or other corporations. In addition, the following significant issues and/or items that were not requested in the EPA letter were indicated by the respondents: a) There +s a potential for useful application of the STIR work. About 47% of the respondents made this statement. b) Twenty-eight percent felt it was too soon to determine success. A number of years would be required to do this. Page 129 GAO/RCED89-39 Aseesclment of SBIR Proqams Appendix Agency Concerning the SBIB w c) About 75% of the respondents indicated that the major potential for useful application was not directed toward EPA or other Federal, State or local agencies hut rather toward the private sector who could use the results of the EPA SBIP research (instrument, process, etc.) to support pollution control activities which in many cases will be directed toward meeting regulations in a cost-effective manner. Specific examples of the SRIR program's interactions with EPA, other federal agencies, or the private sector are provided in Appendix 8. Conclusions General conclusions which *e have drawn from the results of our survey are as follows: 1. It is too soon to tell what the real impact of the EPA SBIR program will be on efforts to meet EPA regulations. Many of the projects are still in the development phase. 2. There has been a moderate degree of direct interaction with EPA al ready. 3. There has been a moderate degree of interactlon with other agencies. 4. Host potentially useful applications affect EPA or other agencies indirectly, i.e.. development of methods vktich may change a standard government measurement method, or a device or process that will assist institutions in meeting a pollution standard.

Bowsher Comptroller General of the United States General Accounting Office Washington. DC 20548 Dear Mr. Bowsher: A letter from the General Accounting Office dated December 3, 1987, requested my judgments of the effects of our Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) activities on the research programs of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the basis for those judgments. This letter conveys my judpents on SBIR and outlines the process by which they were developed. To assess SBIR's effects, we conducted a study of all SBIR Phase II projects which had been completed or which were nearly completed by the end of 1987. This group consisted of 73 projects carried out by 63 small business fims. Most of the projects St-cd from our 1983 and 1984 SBIR Program Solicitations. Our study concentrated on the effects these projects have had on the performance of the NASA mission in aeronautics and space, and it also addressed the quality of research sponsored by the agency. In addition, we investigated the extent to which the results of the 73 completed projects were being utillred in colercial and/or other Federal agency applications outside the NASA program. The informatlon for our study was obtained from comprehensive interviews with NASA personnel who had managed the research and with the principal investigators and company officials of the firms perfoming the research. Finally, we obtained the opinions of each NASA Center Director on the value of the SBIR Program to the Center's activities and to the NASA mission. Our interviews revealed that the technical staff at each NASA Center highly rated the quality of research in most of the 73 SBIR projects, judging it to be equal to or better than other contract research for which they were responsible. Many reported that soae of these SBIR projects (and others not yet coapleted) have established new insights and directions for NASA's research efforts. They also reported that the results of at least 39 of the 73 projects are either now in use by NASA or will likely be chosen for use within five years, including mission applications in mainline NASA programs. ThfS is an excellent record for research projects of this nature. Page 140 GAOiRCED99-39 Asaesament of SBIR Programs Appendix xxv Letter Ram the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Concerning the SBlRProgram 2 All our information makes it clear that small businesses are valuable and cost-effective sources of MD innovations for NASA and that SBIR is an effective nay to discover and use them. Uithout exception, the NASA Center Oirectors support continuation of the SBIR program and intend to ensure the integration of small business capabillties in their pursuit of NASA's R&O goals. I was pleased to learn also that significant corercial benefits have already accrued to a number of participating fims. Company officials for 16 of the projects reported comercial sales of products and services to private and public entities and/or receipt of additional R&D funding from private sources and Federal agencies other than NASA. Good prospects for future comercial applications of the results of another 12 projects were also reported. Considering the recent completions of many of the research projects, these findings are impressive. In sumary. I am pleased to report my judwnts of the SBIR program: that the quallty of most of the research Is high, that its effects on NASA's research are positive, and that many small businesses in the SBIR prograr produce valuable and cost-effective results. Ye expect continued benefits from SBIR in both its support of the NASA mission and its contributions to the national economy.

Thmsm proposals ore reviewed and. based on the Foundation's merit review systmm, are eligiblm for awards. The solicit8tion's structure and the evsluation procedures assure intmgration of the SBIR program with the other activities of the Foundation. 2. THE FOUR MAJOR GOALS OF THE ACT The Small Businmss Innovation Development Act of 1982 spmcifimd four major goals: 1. to stimulatm tmchnological innovation, 2. to use small business to meet Federal research and development nmeds, 3. to foster minority and disadvantaged persons to participate in tmchnologicol innovation, snd 4. to incrmasm private smctor commercialization of innovations from Fedmrol rmsearch and development. Since its inception in 1977 the NSF SBIR program has addressed each of thmsm objmctivms. For Coal 1, the responses to thm 1987 SBIR solicitation ore a measure of the Foundation's stimulation of the innovation process. Twenty five specified resmarch topics at the leading edge of epplied research resulted in ovmr 300 innovative proposals judged OS scientifically meritorious. For Goal 2, 8 review of SBIR ewards indicates that about 90 percent were mode in tmchnical ore88 relevant to \"national needs forecests.\" Concerning Coal 3, minority and femalm participation hoe grown significantly in the past ten years. The 1987 solicitation resulted in 270 submissions from firms owned by women: submissions from minority firms lead to 25 Phone I awards. For goal 4, succmss in commercialization is shown by the products already being marketed and by the magnitude of the financial commitments from the private sector to Phase III to Phase II awardees. Page150 theSBIRProlpam 6 3. ASSCSSING THE FOUR MAJOR COALS Planning for the original NSF SRIR program began in 1976. It called for the use of a \"trial\" phase prior to making large grant awards or contracts to a firm, no matter how promising therr proposals. This led to a phased program in use today at NSF and at all other agencies with SBIR programs: Phase I is the initial NSF grant, SSO.000 maximum. Phasm II is the major research effort, often a larger NSF grant up to S2SO,OOO. usually subject to a commitment of investment by the private sector for the next phase. Phase III marks the transfer of the completed research project to the private sector for development or commercialization with private sector funding. The level of support for this last phase is one positive indicator of the success of the program. The history of these awards is shown in Table 1. Goal 1: SBIR PROMOTES ImOVATION *1 . . . to stimulate technological innovation...\" There are several measurms of the success of the SBIR program in promoting innovation: 8) the increase in the number of quality proposals received by the program, b) the increase in the number of quality proposals recommended for awards made each year, c) the diversity of innovative quality proposals d) the interest of the private sector as measured by the investment in commercialization, represented by selected examples of resultant innovations. a)Zuality Proposals. One of the main criteria for a Phase I grant is the innovative nature of the proposed research. The ratio of the proposals judged as innovative to the total of those Qroposals received has grown from about one in seven in 1977 to one in four in 1987, an assessment made possible because the Foundation's SBIR program predates the Act by about five years. This means that there is a longer time line available for the study of the growth of innovation. Typically the Phase I and Phase 11 research process takes from three to four years to complete, and the private sector Phase III development can take PogelSl GAO/RcEDBs39 AsseusmentofSBIRPrograms AppendFxm LetterF'romthe NationalScience Foundation Concerning the SBIR Program 7 several years. Output from the program takes five to six years. The selected examples given at the and of this mection have completed this innovation cycle. b) Recouended Awards. As shown in Table 1, in 1977 the Foundation received about 330 orooosals. After merit review more than 50 proposals ware judged iort'hy of award but available funds resulted in only 42 actual awards. By 1987 response to the Foundation's SBIR solicitation almost quadrupled to 1250 proposals. Merit review of these resulted in recommendations that about 300 qualified for a Phase I award, but available funds limited these to 160 Phase I awards. There has been a fourfold increase in the number of proposals received in response to the solicitation. Similarly one in four of these proposals was judged innovative and worthy of support. These are input indicators of innovation stimulation because the number and the quality of these proposals has grown. The Foundation has judged the quality by criteria similar to its customary review procedures which apply to all research proposals, including SBIR. Increased interamt by the private mector almo points to the value of the research ramults obtained from the SBIR program. Significant private me&or financing has gone into the Phase III portion of the program to convert research results into developed products and services. For those amall firms which received awards during the first fiva years of the Foundation's program the total private sector activity now exceeds S4OO million. This is a quantitative output indicator of the financial value of the innovations from these firms to the economy.

Another measure of the capacity of the SBIR program to stimulate innovation lies in the diversity of research supported by the program. While the research topics under the Foundation's solicitation follow the major thrusts of the engineering and sciantific disciplinas, responaee are often unique. For example, while the astronomy program sought new sensors or improved inatrumanta, it may in the end support a new materials process which results making a more sensitive light detector or a better mirror. A few examples of some SBIR project titles illustrate the breadth, sophistication, and innovation inherent in the program: o Single Sphere, Multiple Detector Neutron Spectrometer o Integration of Stochastic Differential Equations on Supercomputer o Advanced Dielectric Cap for III-V Ion Implantation o Stable Suppression of Gene Activity in Plants o High Performance Signal Processing o Coherence Holographic Reflector Based Non-Linear Materials o Coenzyma Recycling Using a Membrane Reactor o High Performance Superconducting Magnetic Bearing Page153 GAO/RCED8939As~mentofSB[RProrpams Appendix XV Letter FromtheNationalScienceFoundation ConcemingtheSBIERogram 9 o Mixed Vapor Growth of Organic Non-Linear Optical Materials. d) Private Sector Colarcialisation. The interest of the private sector is exemplified by investment In development and actual product sales. Following are five examples of SBIR awards which have been completed. \"Completion\" in this context means that the projects have gone through Phases I, II, and III. 0 SBIR 81-14274 \"Distributed Data Base Management on Local Networks.\" 1982-1985, Relational Technology, Alameda, CA The first known research on DBM on local networks was conducted under this project and resulted in the highly successful INGRES Star software. Sales now exceed $105 million and private investment from Sutter Hill, Berkeley International, Morgan Stanley, T. Rowe Price, Citicorp, Bankers Trust and Bank of New South Wales totals SlB million. The company attributes one-third of the investment and sales to the NSF research. The consultant from the University of California, Berkeley, said that SBIR was the principal reason for the company's success, thanks to the breakthrough made possible by NSF research support. Employment at the time of the proposal in 1981 was 6; today it is 475. University collaboration has been with University of California at Berkeley, Carnegie-Mellon and MIT. 0 SBIR 80-096001 \"Theoretical Modeling of an Innovative Unidirectional Surface Acoustic (SAW) Transducer.\" 1981- 1984 RF Monolithics, Inc., Dallas, TX. The research represented a new concept in the design of low- loss frequency filters by four engineers who spun off from Texas Instruments. The project explored four new ideas: all were successful. Twelve product lines of receivers, oscillators (IFF and radar), SAW devices, resonators, transmitters, microtransmitters, filters, notch elements resulted directly and indirectly from the research and are now being sold. Venture capital investment came to S13.1 million in three rounds of financing from 12 firms. Sales have totalled S16.3 million. University collaboration has been with the Universities of Maine and Central Florida. Employment has increased from 5 to 85. 0 SBIR 79-17180 \"Growth of Ruby Crystals by the Heat Exchanger Method,\" 1979 - 1982, Crystal Systems, Inc. Salem, MA. The research formed the base for a new class of laser materials and for another NSF SBIR award for titanium-doped alumina crystals. This significant advance resulted in the first tunable solid-state laser to be commercialized in the Page164 .4ppendixXV LetterFkomtheNational!kienceFoundation ConcerningtheSBIRRognun 10 600 to 1200 run wavelength range. Laser rods were introduced as a product in 1987 and a large company is now developing a tunable solid-state laser system based upon the rods. Thrs should develop into a significant military and commercial market. Customers include Lockheed, Hughes, McDonnell- Douglas, Northrup and Wright-Patterson AFB. University collaboration is with MIT and State University of New York, Stonybrook. Employment has increased from 10 to 24. 0 SBIR 82-60166 \"Long-Life Catalysts for Immobilized Microorganism Fermenters.\" Lebanon, NH. This SBIR funded by NSF and later by NIH resulted in the invention of micro-porous beads to optimally grow mammalian cells before Phase II was completed and what may be the leading continuous process for large scale production of engineered proteins. Investment of S17 million was obtained from Eli Lilly, Combustion Engineering, Genentic and 10 venture capital firms. Cumulative sales now exceed S7 million.

Quantitative input and output measures in the form of proposal pressure, proposal quality, and private sector Page166 GAO/R- AssesamentofSBIRRograma Appendixm Letter From the National Science Foundation Concerning the SBIR Program participation have been presented. These support the contention that the SBIR program has been successful in stimulating innovation. Among the small business firms responding to the solicitation innovation has grown in the ten years of the program's existence and the quality of the research proposals has increased markedly. Probably the most persuasive indicator of success is the measurable financial participation from the private sector in the products and processes coming from SBIR research. Goal 2: SBIR RESPONDS TO NCCDCD R&D II . . . to use small business to meet Federal research and development needs...\" When it established SBIR, Congress formally stated that technological innovation creates jobs, increases productivity, competition, economic growth, and is valuable in reducing inflation and improving the balance of payments.' Further, while most federally funded R&D is conducted by large business, universities, and Government laboratories, small business is the principal source of innovations. Finally, Congress determined that small businesses are among the most cost-effective performers of R&D and are particularly capable of transforming R&D into new products. Three Major Studies. In making these findings, Congress had access to studies and reports which had provided the earlier impetus for the small business set-aside under the NSF SBI program, as well as the NSF's experience with this program. Three of these studies are especially relevant: 1) A Commerce Department report on innovation published in 1967s showed that small high technology firms were responsible for a disproportionately large share of new technology when compared with their three percent share of Federal research and development support. The report set the stage for what has become the SBIR program, first at the National Science Foundation, and in 1982 at all of the major research funding agencies in the government. As to how well the SBIR program has succeeded in stimulating this innovation and how well the small high tech firms have succeeded in providing innovation which meets our national needs, it is ' PL 97-219, Sec. 2 (a). 5 Holloman, J.H., Technological Innovation, Its Environment and nanagement , U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington D.C.

Research Priorities. Based on review of these major reports, and other data, the perceived research priorities could be summarized under the following general categories: o electronic materials and devices o lasers and electro-optical devices o biological systems, neurobiology o robotics and computers o fluids, turbulence 0 surface science o air and water pollution Industry Studies. Similar but not identical results emerged from analyses of various industrial indicators such as compound annual growth rates by industry, and the distribution of industrial research expenditures. The resulting industrial R&D priorities are: o electronic materials and devices 0 scientific instruments o electrical equipment and computers o chemicals and chemical processes 0 aerospace systems o mechanical systems and machinery While there is not complete agreement between the governmental forecasters and the distribution of industrial research resources, it became apparent that both perceive electronic materials and computers to be of long term importance. NSP SBIR Prioritie8. The foundation made its SBIR awards under a series of research topics representative of the disciplinary research thrusts. These topics have been reviewed and are summarized under the following, more generic categories. These categories make it possible to assess how well SBIR research 6 Pive Year Outlook on Science and Technology-1981, National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C. 1981. 7 Annual Science and Technology Report to the Congress, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Washington, D.C., Oct. 1983.

This approach permits an assessment of these activities over the span of the program with comparisons to the cited forecasts. Distribution of Awards. Table 2 is a categorization of Phase I awards for the yeara from 1977 through 1987, in accordance with the preceding listing: Table 2: NST SBIR PURSE I AWARDS BY CATEGORY 1977-1987 Solicitation Year -77-'79-'80-'al-'82-'83-'84-'ES-'86-'87-Tot'1 Elect/Optic Mat'1 0 515 6 3 7 9 13 13 62 Mfg.

When compared with the 1981 forecasts and the industrial indicators, 6 \"Other\" has been used by NSF in many research programs: it leaves open the door for new ideas, especially those not readily classifiable by discipline or topic. Page168 AppendixXV Letter From the National Science Foundation Concerning the SBIR Program 14 these research activities appear to have tracked both the forecasts and the industrial perceptions of where the action was or would be. National Needs. About 90 percent of Phase I awards were made in areaa relevant to \"national needs forecasts,\" as reported separately by the National Academy of Sciences, and the Office Science and Technology Policy9. Moreover, the awards reflected quite accurately the industrial perceptions of areas of technological and economic growth. Proposals received by NSF SBIR in response to the solicitations have provided the Foundation with useful feedback from industry on \"hot\" technical areas. Since 1977, the Foundation has made awards in about 30 solicitation or topic areas. One interesting facet of these awards is that a project is often relevant to more than one area of technology or application. For example an award made under radiation physics for research on a pulsed ion or x-ray source has found application as a manufacturing tool for integrated circuits. Thus, the SBIR program has over its ten year life span served as a mechanism for funding industrially relevant research in many disciplines with a broad range of applications. Conclusions: The analysis of the Foundation's SBIR awards leads to tha conclusion that the projects funded by the SBIR program have baen relevant to the perceived national technological needs. This is particularly germane to the development of needed new processes in chemistry and manufacturing, new materials in electronics, and new methods in biosciences. The perceptions which the small high tech firms have'brought to the Foundation in the form of their proposals has helped in the fight for technological competitivenesm. Goal 3: MCOUMGt MINORITY PARTICIPATION I . ..to foster and encourage participation by minority and other disadvantaged persons in technological innovation....\" The NSF program in amall business innovation antedates the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 which specifies thim objective. NSF has a long-standing policy of encouraging participation by women, minorities and the disadvantaged. Results from the 1987 solicitation with regard to this objective are given in subsequent paragraphs. In 1986, the Foundation's Division of Industrial Science and Technological Innovation undertook a concerted effort to present information about the SBIR program to minority and disadvantaged 9 op. cit. Page169 GAO/RCED8939 AaaeaamentofSBIRProcpams AppendixXV LetterFromthe~tio~SeienceFoundation Concerningthe SBIRRolgam 15 individuals and groups stressing their potential for participation in the program through the submission of high quality research proposals. The program addressed groups and associations which were science and engineering based, associated with minority institutions of higher learning, minority business associations, and other identifiable l ources of minority participation in science and business. One of the most significant steps has been an outreach effort carried out in conjunction with the annual Federal High Tech Conference. The Foundation sponsored a one day meeting just prior to the Conference in Atlanta and to address the particular needs of minority and disadvantaged firms in preparing proposals under the SBIR program. This meeting and workshop addressed not only the Foundation's SBIR activity, but the special needs for responding to the solicitations from all of the participating agencies. While it is too early to tell whether this outreach approach has helped with the minority participetion in the SBIR for other agencies, the results of the Foundation's 1987 solicitation and awards arm very gratifying toward Goal 3. Results. In response to the 1987 SRIR solicitation the Foundation received 1250 proposals. Of these, 172 were from minority owned firms and 97 were received from fims owned by women. Thus the combined response from minority and women owned fims was more than 20 percent. In terns of awards, the Foundation has made 160 awards: of the winners, 15 are firms owned by minority and ten are owned by women. The combined share is about 16 percent of Phase I awards. In percentage terns these awards by the SBIR program aurpaso the record of the Foundation as a whole in fiscal year 1987 for awards to minority or women principal investigators. From 1983 to 1986 the SBIR program received about 620 proposals from minority and women owned fims. For this period the program made 24 awards to women owned fims and 39 to minority owned firms. These figures indicate that the SBIR program has in large measure succeeded in promoting the participation of minorities in the innovation process. Further Activities. Given the positive response to 'he recently increased outreach activities, the Foundation is planzing to broaden its SBIR program outreach to black and hispanic business and professional organizations and Chambers of Commerce. This effort will stress working with scientific, technical and business groups. It will focus on those geographic areas characterized by high concentrations of these groups as proposers of innovative research under the SBIR program. Conclurion. The Foundation built on a good record when it took aggressive action and got positive results by organizing workshops and conferences to enhance minority and disadvantaged participation in research and innovation. The outreach program has helped to improve SBIR participation. The output measure of the L Page160 Appendix XV Letter From the National Science Foundation Concerning the SBIR Program 15 success in stimulating minority and disadvantaged particlpatron is the increase in the number of awards to these groups. Goal 4: SBIR INCRRASCS COMMCRCIALIZATION 1 . . . to increase private sector commercialization innovations derived from Federal research and development.\" The original 1976 NSF SBIR program emphasized commercialization. Because it was not clear that small high technology firms could perform quality research, the program consisted of three phases. The objective of Phase I was to explore, Phase 11 to use more NSF support to build on the promise of Phase I, and the real crux of the program was to get to Phase 111 where the project is handed off to the private sector for funding of development and commercialization. The process is still in use today not only at NSF but at other agencies with SBIR programs. Figures for NSF SBIR activities since 1977 appear in Table 1. Follow-on Funding. Since 1977 an important factor in achieving results from SBIR, and a basic element of the program design, has been the requirement for follow-on funding commitments. NSF makes few Phase 11 awards without obtaining, in advance, a signed contingent commitment from a third party for follow-on funding. It states that the third party will fund Phase III with at least S200.000 to enable the small business to pursue commercial product development. (There are two contingencies: Phase II must first achieve the agreed upon technical objectives: and the technology has not been by-passed in the marketplace during Phase II.) In return, following investment, the third party may receive an exclusive or non-exclusive license, shares of stock in the company, prototype instruments, or whatever agreement these parties choose to make. This mechanism has been crucial to take the project from public funding to the private sector. Phase II research proposals are recommended for award only as a result of their technical merit. If they are accompanied by a satisfactory follow-on funding commitment, they receive preferred consideration in the awards process (as compared to other SBIR proposals.) This is a means of combining SBIR \"technology push\" with the \"market pull\" of the follow-on funding commitment from the private sector. In practice, small firms have obtained commitments from major venture capital investors, research and development limited partnerships, and large industrial firms in the United States. The innovative nature of the research carried out under the SBIR program as well as the commercial potential of some of these Page161 GAO/RCED&%39 Asaesament of SBIR Programs Appentim LetterF'romtheNationalScienceFoundation ConcemingtheSBtRProgram 17 developments has not been lost on private sector investors. A listing of participants in Phase III commercialization includes: Industrial Firms: IBM Westinghouse General Electric Du Pont Ford Kodak W.R. Grace Cabot Corporation North American Phillips Eveready Battery Hercules, Inc. Coca-Cola Dow Corning Borg Warner Venture Capital and Financial Institutions: American Research and Development Venrock Sutter Hill Continental Capital Citicorp Research and Development Limited Partnerships: Merrill Lynch Morgan Stanley Paine Webber The listing is only a sample of the types of institutions which have made commitments to invest in successful outcomes from the Foundation's SBIR program. Equally impressive is the amount of follow-on funding which NSF awardees from 1977 through 1982 were able to obtain as a result of their participation in the SBIR program as a whole. This group of awardees has obtained combined Phase III commitments, equity investment, and product sales which are estimated to exceed 5400 million. Additional Indicators. In addition to the diversity of the Phase 111 investors and the estimates of the follow-on commitment, two factors attest to the succesta of the Foundation's efforts to commercialize SBIR products: The volume of product sales, and the increase in employment for the firms. Here are illustrations: 0 Flow Research of Kent, Washington, had 190 employees in 1961 at the time of its first SBIR award. The firm now has 940 employees counting those working for the three spin-off companies, largely as a result of their successful SBIR research. The parent firm and the spin-off companies have received $54 million in venture capital from research and development limited partnerships, with an estimated one-half of this sum attributable to SBIR program participation. Some S50 million in sales to date may be attributed to SBIR. 0 Native Plants, Inc. of Salt Lake City has had three mayor breakthroughs. SBIR has been the principal reason, NPI explains, why the company has been able to obtain S65 million of private Page162 GAO/RCED89-39 Assessment of!%~Pnw Letter From the National Science Foundation Concerning the SBIR Prom :a investment from six large industrial firms: MartIn-Marietta. McCormick, Sandoz. Elf Aquitaine, Tata and Sumimoto. The firm has also obtained venture capital from Venrock, E.H. Prince, Greylock. 4 Southwest Venture Partners and Newcastle, as well as research and development partnerships from Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Paine Webber. Employment in the firm has increased from 40 in 1980 to 450 today. The firm is a world leader in plant genetics. 0 Ceramatec, Inc. of Salt lake City, Utah received an SBIR grant in 1983 for the fabrication of a new class of silicon ceramics. This NSF support led to Phase I and Phase II DOE SBIR awards and may result in a Phase III with a major U.S. industrial firm on high wear engine parts. An earlier NSF SBIR award was for \"Electrowinning and Refining of Metallic Sodium Using Solid State Rapid Ion Conductors\" for use in electrolytic cells for a sodium sulfur battery for the 1990's. This was an SBIR follow-on of NSF research sponsorship by the same principal investigator while a professor at the University of Utah. The Phase III requirement of both projects has resulted in Sl3 million of venture capital investment by the Koppars Co., ELKEM (Norway), and Whitcom. Ceramic packaging products and contract RLD sales now total $13 million. University collaboration is with Utah, Penn, Northwestern and UC Santa Barbara. Employment has increased from 31 to 130. 0 Collaborative Research, Inc. of Bedford, Massachusetts received an SBIR award in 1977 for the enhancement of animal protein production by novel genatic technology. This project was an early applied research effort in genetics in 1977, the same year Genentec was formed. To date the research, which is high risk but high payoff. has not been successful but continues through a Dutch firm. However, Dow Chemical invested an initial $5 million in Collaborative because of its genetics capability and this has increased to $12.5 million. Both the SBIR funded genetics research and the Dow investment led to S30 million in public offerings to provide funding for new facilities, staff growth and major new efforts in DNA diagnostics and enzyme products. The company was the first to identify the cystic fibrosis gene marker. David Baltimore (Nobel Laureate) chairs the company's scientific advisory committee. University collaboration is with Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital. Employment has increased from 33 to 150. 0 Biometric Systems, Inc. of Eden Prairie, Minnesota was awarded an SBIR grant in 1979 for affinity cross-linking for enzyme tachno1ogy. This research and \"Substitute Anatomical Materials with Proclivity for Natural Cell Lining,\" 1984-1987, has had an important impact on biocompatable coatings and materials. The research led to S2.5 million investment from research and development partnerships and S2 million of private placement investment. Plastic tubing coating for bypass surgery, heart valves, dental and orthopedic devices, contact and interocular lenses, in vitro cell culture systems, diagnostic systems, sensor Page 163 GAO/RCRD-89-3!3AaaeaamentofSBIRI+ogama ApQendiZ xk' LetterFromtheNationalScienreFoundation ConcemingtheSBlRProgram 19 systems, and biomambranes are now being produced and sold. University collaboration is with Minneaota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and North Carolina. Employment has increased from 4 at the time of the first SBIR award to 63. 0 Browning Enqineerinq, Inc. of Hanover, New Hampshire received an SBIR award in 1979 for extreme impact velocity metal and ceramic depoaition. This raaoarch resulted in a process used by G. E. and Rolls Royce to coat turbine comproaaor blades. The process was also licensed initially to Cabot Corporation which aold the division to a California company. Royaltiea, R&D and consulting relevant to the project excoad Sl million. A now generation Plaz Jet process has been developed for abrasive coatings. Sales exceed S400,OOO but are expected to increase sharply since a major licensing agreement is in process. University collaboration is with Dartmouth and MIT. Direct employment has not grown because the company licenses its products to others. SUmm8ty: Small high technology firms are important to technological innovation and economic growth, including increases in domestic l mploymont. There ia evidence that they represent one of the most efficient mechanisms for the conversion of science and technology to commercial products. They increase technological competitiveness and appear to be especially effective when these firms are coupled to universities, large industrial companies and venture capital. The Foundation's SBIR program is designed to take advantage of this route to commercial use of Federal research and development. 4. CONHENTS ON THE CPPCCT O? TNmrC PROGIUn The Small Businosa Innovation Act of 1982 (amended) requires the judgment of the director of the National Science Foundation \"as to the effect of thia Act on rosearch programs.\"rO Technology Transfer. While the preaent report deala with the four explicit mandated objectives, there alao should be mention of an important additional objoctivo, technology tranafer. merely implied under the first goal, Innovation, and the second goal, Federal R&d Needs. In this case SBIR provided an important linking mechanism between basic resesrch and the market place. While many studies can be cited, the Rand Corporation study of 198411 showed clearly that the results of basic research do not readily find their way to the msrket place without the uae of intermediate mechanisms. SSIR lo PL 97-219, Sect.6. 11 Tora K. Bikson, Barbara Quint, Leland L.

Page164 AppendixXV LetterFromthe NationalScienceFoundation ConcemingtheSBIR Program 20 provides such a mechanism and further has demonstrated that the program provides feedback to basic research through the creation of new research instruments, sensors, and materials. This may be attributed to NSF procedures which routinely call for the research divisions to formulate research topics for the solicitation. Judgment. The NSF SBIR program has shown persistent growth and success over the past ten years. It is a worthy peer among the Foundation's activities, useful nationally, validated through additional investments by other agencies and by a variety of private sector capital sources. This, in turn has generated new products, processes, techniques and has provided new jobs. It has attracted proposals from targeted audiences like minorities and the disadvantaged and has rewarded promising applicants with financial support. It has contributed to technology transfer and provided feedback to NSF basic research. The overall data for the program as reviewed and assessed in this report bear this out, and show that the NSF SBIR program has moved strongly in line with Congressional findings and intent, while leaving room for additional efforts and achievements.

Curtin. Deputy Director Resources, Consnunity and Economic Development Division U.S. General Accounting Office Washington, DC 20548 Dear Hr. Curtin: This responds to your request to Chainnan Lando W. Zech. Jr. for an assessment of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program within the Nuclear Regulatory Consnission (NRC). NRC has participated in the SBIR program since FY 1983 and fully supports the purposes of the Small Business Innovation Development Act. All NRC extramural research is under the direction of our Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES). Accordingly, the requirement for participation in the program is applicable to the extramural research budget of RES. In FY 1987 we provided a high of S1.4M to the program. NRC believes that the SBIR program offers an opportunity for Federal research program managers to take advantage of new ideas which might not surface through normal contracting avenues. Innovative proposals with consnercial applicability can be quickly reviewed because of the simplified SBIR procedures, and the feasibility of ideas can be tested at a relatively low cost. Since the program's inception the NRC has received 548 Phase I proposals and has funded 42 Phase I awards to determine the technical feasibility of promising ideas. From this group, we have funded 15 Phase II awards for only those projects which we considered to have the greatest likelihood of success. The enclosed briefs describe those completed Phase II projects which we believe have a moderate to high potential for commercial success. Despite the advantages of the program, our current research budget has taken a pecipitious drop in the past year. As a result, NRC's total extramural research budget dropped to f99.8M in FY 1987 and approximately J89.OM for FY 1988. Budget constraints and a legal concern about violating the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 had caused us to conclude that we could not participate in the SBIR Program in FY 1988. Subsequently, the NRC received a GAO opinion (GAO letter B-230594.2 dated March 15, 1988) which concluded that the NRC is not precluded from voluntary participation in the SBIR Program even though our extramural research budget is less than $100 million. On April 14, 1988, I met with Representative John J. LaFalce. Chairman of the House Consnittee on Small Business, to review NRC's concerns. During that meeting, I explained that our level of participation in FY 1988 was directly related to the impact of the NRC's FY 1988 appropriation reduction of Page 166 GAO/RcED8936 Assessment of SBtR Pro+! Appendix XVI Letter From the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Concerning the SBtR Program Mr. Neal P. Curtin 2 $35 million and on our ability to maintain necessary safety research program funding levels. Following this discussion we reevaluated our FY 1988 situation (based upon our mid-fiscal year review) and have concluded that we can partici- pate in the FY 1988 SBIR Program at a level of approximately $500,000. The specific number of Phase I and Phase II awards will depend on the quality and merit of the proposals received. Our level of participation in the FY 1989 program will be bused on future budget developments. I appreciate the opportunity to express our opinions and relate our experience regarding the SBIR program. The primary contact on the program at NRC is Mr. William Forehand. SBIR Program Manager.

The SURBOT is capable of: high resolution TV viewing of components; measurement of radiation levels, temperature, and humidlty; two-way sound communication with work crews; air and surface contamination sample collect4on; and, has a remote controlled Inn capable of lfght maintenance tasks. In 1986 SURBOT was successfully demonstrated at the Electric Power Research Instftute (EPRI) Nondestructive Testing Center. The development and successful demonstration of the robot penits NRC staff to better evaluate licensee proposals to use automated technology. NRC participation in this SBIR project was an opportunity for the agency to further the utilization of what appears to be a cost effective dose reduction technology. The ability to perform more freouent and more sensitive in-service inspection, as demonstrated in this project, will also enhance plant safety. REMOTEC is marketing four optlonal concepts featuring SURBOT in wheeled and tracked models with combinations of inspection equipment and operattonal arms. Conslderable Interest has been evidenced in the nuclear, defense and security markets. In addition, REHOTEC, partly due to its success on the NRC contract, has been selected to conduct three new SBIR demonstration projects for DOD and DOE.

Campbell, CA Phase I s 50,000 Phase II J182.000 The NRC has sponsored complex computer programs to simulate thermal-hydraulic phenomena in power reactor transients. These programs are large, long-running and too costly to be used in simplified studies to get approximate results quickly or for a wide range of input parameters. S. Levy, Inc. proposed a simplified thermal hydraulic model and computer program to be run on an IBM PC. During Phase I, the program was developed and extensively tested by NRC staff. Feaslbllity was demonstrated and the need for improvements identified. During Phase II, the model was extended to allow calculation of two phase (water, steam) conditions. Subsequent testing revealed the need for more model improvements. The results were wholly satisfactory to NRC. The coemiercial application of this project has been extensive. During Phase II.

Idaho Falls, Idaho Phase I t 49,000 Phase II $451.000 The NRC uses computer simulations to analyze potential power reactor thermal hydraulic transients* during accident scenarios such as breaks in pipes. Preparing for a simulatlon is an extensive task requiring calculating the geometry of the individual cells of each modclled pipe and other ccnponents. To save that labor and to build in an audit trail of the steps in gathering the basic data and creating the model, NRC needed to computerize the process as much as possible. The work done by Scientech in Phase I met this need by first creating a plant data entry manual, designed for use by a power plant engineer in entering basic plant geometric and operating data. Scicntech then created a software package (Plant Data Management System) for data entry, data update, and graphics data retrieval. The package was successfully demonstrated for the primary loop of a reactor. Phase II will incorporate the secondary loop.

Seattle, k'A PHASE I 5 50.000 PHASE II 6235.000 At the time that this SPIR proposal was funded the NRC was conducting research on field implementation of the SAFT process for in-service inspection of nuclear reactor components. Previous research had shown the advantages of SAFT processing in obtaining major improvmnts in flaw detection reliability and sizing accuracy. A disadvantage of SAFT processing is that it requires millions of operations, involving square roots and additions, for the imaging of small volumes. This makes the process very computer intensive and time consuming -- too slow for practical field applications for flaw detection. One of the tasks in the NRC research program was to develop a \"real-time\" SAFT processor to render the technology useful for field application. Sigma Research Inc. proposed an innovative idea for accomplishing real-time SAFT-UT (ultrasonic testing) imaging based on a frequency domain correlation process applied to conventional pulse-echo ultrasonic data using residue number system (RNS) computational methods. The frequency domain process has the potential for better discrimination of flaw types. Also SAFT processing in the frequency domain involves multiplications (instead of additions) which can be performed very fast by the RNS computational method. A Fortran coded software simulation (for frequency domain processing using RNS) was developed by Sigma for extensive analytical studies of the proposed system. Through the use of this code it was determined that real-time SAFT processing in the frequency domain was possible and a system was designed using conventional electronic components. The hardware design concentrated on a custom memory management processor and RNS computational modules. The code was used to quantify the capability of the designed system. The software simulation program has been supplied to an NRC research contractor for its further use in the NRC sponsored program for field validation of a SAFT-UT inservice inspection system. The validity of the Sigma approach has been confirmed. Because SAFT-UT is a relatively new technology it has not yet seen wide-spread use in the U.S. The Sigma approach represents an alternative method for implmnting SAFT and we expect that it will be used extensively by industry. 4 Page 171 GAO/RCEDss39 Asseesment of SBIR Programs Appendix XV Letter From the Nuclear Regulatory Gxnmiasion Concerning the SBIR Program U.

Nuclear Regulatory Conxnission SBIR Effectiveness FRCJBABILISTIC RISK ASSESSVENT FOR SEISMICALLY Future Resources Associates, Berkeley, CA PHASE I 5 50,000 PHASE II L?50,000 Probabilistic Risk Assessments (PRAs) performed to date indicate that seismically induced events may be major contributors to the residual risk for some nuclear power plants. One area of this seismic risk analysis that has not been studied well is the effect of relay chatter on plant operation. Experts have felt that during a seismic event, the chattering of relays due to motion may leave the plant In an undesirable and perhaps unknown configuration. This could be a significant factor in our understanding of seismic risks. The research conducted in this program addressed this specific issue, and developed methods for estimating risk at a plant from selsmically initiated relay chatter. The methodology was applied to operating nuclear power plants (Zion 1 and LaSalle 2). Conclusions from this study will help analysts to quantify risk from seismically inltlated relay chatter for plants in the future as part of seismic PRAs. In addltion, the study provides insights to the quantification of operator error under high-stress conditions. The contractor is currently negotiating with a utllity to perform the cormcrclalizatlon phase of the research. Preliminary indications are that other utilities are interested in using the tools developed. The report on this research received an award as the best paper presented at American Nuclear Society conferences during 1987, 5 Page 172 GA0iRCED-W39 Assessment of SBCR Programs Appendix XVI Letter From the Nuclear RegulatorY Co&ion Concerning the SBIR prO@~ U. 5. Nuclear Regulatory Commission SBIR Effectiveness DEGRADATION OF NUCLEAR PLANT TEWPERATURE SENSORS Analysis and Measurement Services Corporation, Knoxville, TN PHASE I f 49,cocl PHASE II f150,000 Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTDs) are used for primary coolant temperature measurement. The RTOs perform an tmportant safety function in monitoring power output and primary coolant safety margins. As a conseauence they are required to be accurately calibrated, must maintain their calibration In use, and be both reliable and exhibit fast response with coolant temperature change. An SBIR program was initiated with Analysis and Measurement Services Corp. (AM) which would provide answers to a number of significant NRC regulatory concerns with RTDs. a. What qualification test methods are acceptable? b. What temperature accuracy is achievable in initial calibration? C. How much does the calibration change with age (time)? d. How much drift occurs with time? e. What is a realistic response time achievable with the several installation mounting techniques (thermowells) currently used with RTDs? Phase II of thfs program has started In October 1987. It is expected that at the end of the 2 year research effort AM will have assessed the accuracy of initial RTD calibration and the rate of degradation, as well as established a basis for periodic recalibration requirements. The RTD calibration and drift measurement capabilfty that AHS will possess as a result of their research is expected to provide a basis for many coavnercial contracts fn the future. Utilities have already contracted with AM to provide some of these laboratory services. As a result of this research, nuclear power plants are expected to provide more reliable and accurate RTD installations, thus enhancing safe operation.

CA PHASE I f 50,000 PHASE II $240.000 Phase I was completed with publication of an NRC contractor report titled: \"A Systnn for generating Long Steamflow Records for Study of Floods of Long Return Period.\" Linsley, Kraeger Associates demonstrated the feasibility of coupling a stochastic hourly rainfall generator as input to a detetministic watershed simulation model to develop a synthetic flow record of 1000 years. A stochastic model for the multi-station generation of hourly rainfall was also developed and tested. The overall Phase II effort provides a practical methodology for includfng severe external flood events into a probabilistic-risk assessment (PRA) study. It can also assist in the assessment of \"Safety Margins\" for flood protection at nuclear facilities. This work has received favorable revfew by the National Research Council's Cornittee on Techniques for Estimating Probabilities for Extreme Floods. Consistent with the SBIR Act, the NRC research contract has the potential for making a significant contribution to the conrrcial application of the model developed by Linsley. Kraeger Associates. Upon the completion of the software enhrnccnwnts of the stochastic rainfall generator, and successful testing of the model on the two selected watersheds, the contractor will be able to use the developed methodology for various utilities and DDE contractors. The contractor has also begun inquiries with Electric Power Research Institute to fonulate a project to initiate the coaaaercialization effort for use by utilities. The work also has potential benefits for the safety assessments of dams whether or not they are associated with NRC-licensed facilities. 7 Page 174 GAO/RCED-W3 Assessment of SBIR Programs XVl LetterFmmtheNncIeerBeguLato~ CommieeionConcerningtheSBlBF'rogram U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Conmission SBIR Effectiveness APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY TO EVALUATE AGING AN- ON N-POWERS SEA Consultants, Inc. San Jose, CA PHASE I PHASE II Conmcrcial nuclear power plants are large complexes and are comprised of many different systems, components. and structures which cover a broad spectrum of materials and designs. There are a number of factors that can cause degradation of the functional capability of a component. system, or structure. They include material degradation, operating environment, and improper maintenance. These factors, and others, can act with time to degrade a component, system, or structure. Therefore, technical data and regulatory guidance are needed to account for aging degradation in plant safety systems, support systems, and camponents. Also, improved regulatory guidance is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of inspection, surveillance, and monitoring methods of aging in nuclear power plants. In Phase I. SEA investigated and demonstrated the application of modelling systems interactions to identify components with aging significance. The method involves proper characterication of functional and spatlal systems interactions. In Phase II, SEA has applied the systems interaction model procedures, developed in Phase I, to selected safety systems and support systcrns; identified components and parts which have propensity for aging degradation and generated recmndations for maintenance of the systems to alleviate aging concerns. Thfs research has provided a method to evaluate age and service wear effects from a spatial and functional system interaction perspective. The methodology provides the capability to model the interactions required to ccnplete a plant function (e.g., core cooling) and assess the effect on plant function due to component aging. The output of the research will be used in performing in-depth l nglneering studies and in developing guidelines for inspection, surveillance and maintenance to alleviate aging concerns. This research demonstrates an application of a practical method for plant operation and aging management. SEA has completed a system operability assurance program for a nuclear generating station under construction. The contractor also developed a procedure to systematically investigate system functional interactions that could effect the safety system design basis. In another case, the contractor is involved with a major utility in demonstrating the potential use of the developed methodology for plant maintenance planning and policy. 9 Page 176 GAO,'RC- AsemementofSBLBPro~+ *Appendix Xc'11 Comments From the Department of Agriculture 23 NOV 1988 SUBJECT: GAO Draft Report RCED-G9-39, Dated October 31, 1986.
