These should be folded in half to create 4 layers and applied to the persons back - from hip to shoulders (the torso). The size of the towels should be appropriate to the size of the person to create 4 layers. Cover with a wool or vellux blanket. Leave these for 5 minutes. Have another set of hot towels ready at the 5-minute mark. At 5 minutes replace the old towels with the new set. Repeat two more times. Apply for 4 total rounds of 5 minutes each (20 minutes total) of heat. THEN apply a cool towel about the size of a washcloth to the abdomen - 2 layers well wrung from cool water. Cover. This will RAISE the temperature typically .5-1\u00b0F and typically provides relief of aches, pains, and headaches. It also can be useful in the chill phase of a fever to help the body to reach it's therapeutic temperature early and help to divert an infection to a milder form. For Temperature 98.0-98.6\u00b0F In the absence of a fever during an infection: Take a warm bath or shower for 5-10 minutes. Afterwards follow the directions for the Neptune's Girdle found below. For fevers 98.6-99.5\u00b0F - Wet Sock Treatment: Use a pair of cotton socks (crew/tube/sports socks) and wring them out in cold tap water. Put on the wet socks. Put on over the cotton socks a pair of thick wool socks. Relax for 20 minutes or until the wet socks are warmed to body temperature, then remove. This will gently bring the fever down about .5 F degree and is useful early on to abort an infectious process particularly of the ears, sinus and throat. For fevers 99.6-101\u00b0F - Abdominal/Neptune's Girdle: Wring a thin bath or hand towel in cold water. Fold in half lengthwise so it is two layers thick and wrap around your torso, covering from chest to hip bone. Use a thick blanket of vellux or wool to wrap around tightly and compress the cold towel \"girdle\". Wear this for 10-20 minutes until it is warmed. For fevers 101-104\u00b0F - Torso Pack Apply a thin cotton linen which has been wrung out in cold water from the armpits to the buttocks, such as a bed sheet or opened pillowcase. This may wrap once or twice around the body. Around the cool, wet sheet you will wrap them in a thick blanket of wool or vellux, making sure to seal the wet sheet from the air. This will help dissipate the fever and cool the core of the body. Leave this wet sheet on the body until warmed, then remove. For Fevers 104\u00b0F or higher - Wet sheet wrap or Spanish Mantle Using a cotton sheet which has been wrung out in cold water, wrap around the person from shoulders to ankles. This may wrap once or twice around the body. Around the cool, wet sheet you will wrap them in a thick blanket of wool or vellux, making sure to seal the wet sheet from the air. This will help dissipate the fever and cool the core of the body. Leave this wet sheet on the body until dry or significantly warmed. ____________________________________________________________________________________ Portland Clinic of Holistic Health \u00d32007-2020 All rights reserved 833 SW 11th Ave, Suite Guidelines Update 032820 INFECTION GUIDELINES AND FEVER INSTRUCTIONS These are general guidelines; the doctor will communicate specific instructions for your condition.

No one has a crystal ball, we make the best choices we can, and we must maintain our rights to make that choice. \"Give me a fever and I can cure any disease\" -Hippocrates. The 'Father of Modern Medicine' who in actuality practiced Naturopathic Medicine What is a Fever? Fever is an elevation of the body temperature. Fever or a 'febrile state' is diagnosed when an oral temperature is 1\u00b0F or .5\u00b0C above a person's normal body temperature. However, in general a fever is present at 99.0\u00b0F or 37.5\u00b0C orally. It is a symptom of an infection and a response by the body to fight it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever Why do we get a fever with infections? Our immune system has many levels of protections to keep us healthy. For example, the skin is a physical barrier against infection and mucous in our respiratory tract is helpful to trap infectious organisms, and there are many other types of safeguards built into our bodies. Some of those safeguards, when triggered, stimulate the body to create a fever. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2367118/ What safeguards cause the body to make Fever symptoms? There are several important safeguard pathways that stimulate the body to create a fever. These include specific types of white blood cells of the immune system that circulate through the body and act as roaming guards. When these cells identify an invader that can cause infection they send a chemical message (called IL-6) to a part of the brain that is called the hypothalamus. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25429137 What does the hypothalamus part of the brain do? The hypothalamus is an important part of the brain. It regulates many things - hormones, sleep, emotions, blood pressure, it directs our pituitary 'the master hormonal gland', and more. The hypothalamus also controls the temperature regulation of the body. When it gets the message that an infection needs attention the hypothalamus raises the body temperature. The hypothalamus also can also direct the body to become febrile on its' own when it is stimulated by infectious organisms that may get past the guards. This is an example of having overlapping back-up ____________________________________________________________________________________ Portland Clinic of Holistic Health \u00d32007-2020 All rights reserved 833 SW 11th Ave, Suite Update 032820 systems in our body. https://www.endocrineweb.com/endocrinology/overview-hypothalamus How does the hypothalamus part of the brain make a fever happen? The hypothalamus controls many parts of the body. When the hypothalamus gets the message from its' guards or from its' own identification of an infectious agent it resets the body temperature thermostat. In other words' it raises the temperature that the body will be running at - very much like raising the thermostat in a house will then cause the furnace to turn on and heat the house. Once the hypothalamus raises the temperature 'set point' it sets into motion two large processes. The first thing is the hypothalamus creates heat conservation. Just like we will close the windows in the house to avoid losing heat the hypothalamus closes the pores of the skin to trap heat in the body. That we may experience as the chills that precede our actual temperature rise. The second thing the hypothalamus does is increase the production of heat in the body by increasing metabolic activity, just like your furnace will turn on when you raise the temperature set point. This combination of events - conservation of heat loss along with production of heat - leads to the rise of the body temperature in infections that we experience as a fever. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever Why does our brain raise our temperature when it senses an infection? The process of fever creation in infections is not an accident. It is an intentional protective reaction of the brain to coordinate the whole body and its' various systems as a part of our immune system fight against infection. Fever above 40\u00b0C is associated with significant viral suppression and increased bacterial cell death. There is a 200-fold reduction in polio virus replication at those temperatures and facilitates bacterial death. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4786079/#R23 https://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/infections/fever-plays-vital-role-immune-response How long will a fever last in an infection? The fever will continue until what stimulated the reaction is resolved. When that happens the hypothalamus 'opens the windows' and 'resets the furnace to a normal temperature.' The hypothalamus causes blood vessels in the skin to dilate which brings the body heat to the surface and it also directs the sweat glands to open which lead to sweating. This signifies the 'crisis' of the fever, or the fever 'breaking', and it predicts the anticipated reduction of oral temperature (Guyton & Hall 2006). Fever- what is it good for? It is fundamentally important to remember that a fever is a protective mechanism of the body to fight infection. Bacteria and viruses cannot replicate at higher temperatures and cells of the immune system are activated by higher temperatures. Mild fever is associated with better prognosis in both viral and bacterial infections (Kluger 1986). If a fever has benefits why should we stop it? The prescription of anti-fever drugs in an effort to reduce fever is based on the assumption that fever is bad and that reduction of fever will be of benefit. The assumptions that fever is bad or that reducing fever has benefit has never had any scientific, clinical, or basic science research evidence to back it up. Actually, the opposite has been found and should be expected when one understands the purpose of a fever. ____________________________________________________________________________________ Portland Clinic of Holistic Health \u00d32007-2020 All rights reserved 833 SW 11th Ave, Suite Update 032820 Anti-fever medications have never been shown to reduce the likelihood of febrile seizures. Dr. Mackowiak of the Veterans Administration in Hospital outlined in a research review about these problems with anti-fever medications clearly in the prestigious Current Opinion of Infectious Disease in 2002. His conclusion ultimately was that \"Unfortunately, insufficient experimental data are available to validate any rationale\" for their use in infection. Bottom line is we should not look to 'stop' or 'suppress' a normal fever process in an infection. It is done out of fear of the fever. And fear can be False Evidence Appearing Real. We should harness the fever. http://www.ufrgs.br/fisiologiacelular/site/arqs/ENSINO/artigos%20em%20PDF/Fever%20-%20beneficial%20and%20detrimental%20effects%20of%20antipyretics.pdf What was the track record of Naturopathic Treatment in the Spanish Flu? In 1918 Naturopathic Physicians (ND) Osteopathic Physicians (DO), Chiropractic Doctors (DC), and Homeopathic MDs, worked in a similar comprehensive natural fashion in their management. While the mortality rate of the conventional MD's surpassed 20% the loss of life under DC's and DO's 2-3%, and the Homeopathic MDs and Naturopathic Physicians less than 1%. The reports from the Naturopaths on their loss of cases indicates that they were seen after the patient had already tried regular medical care. In Chicago at the Lindlahr Hospital for example they treated 300 cases in patient naturopathically and 1200 outpatient cases. They saved every life. The nearby Cook County Hospital mortality was almost 40%. A key element of treatment by Naturopathic Physicians was what they did do and what they did not do. They did not suppress the fever with anti-fever medications. Physicians from Lindlahrs' hospital trained the doctors that trained the doctors that trained the doctors that trained us. We have all used these principles for close to a century in cases from Polio, to Measles, to Pneumonia, MRSA, Kidney Infections, gastric infections, infections of the bone, and too many others to count, even a case of the Bubonic Plague. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4711683/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22148/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_aspirin https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/49/9/1405/301441 Why avoid using such as Tylenol, acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen and those other medicines like Nyquil, Dayquil, and numerous others that contain them. This is frequently the first intervention over the counter and in hospitals and doctors' offices. Research has shown do not shorten infections and even worse that they can prolong infections. More troubling is that they can prolong the time of it being spread (Geisman 2002). Importantly anti-fever drugs are associated with a higher loss of life in infections than when not using them (Vaughn 1980). Naturopathic clinical principles have been confirmed by research that has shown that fevers are associated with better outcome in viral and bacterial infections (Kluger 1986). Therefore - we harmonize our treatment to ease the discomfort of fever in ways that assist the goals of the fever - which in itself is an attempt by the body to heal. This is the secret to the effective and successful Naturopathic approach to infections. Why do we not advocate the general use of NSAIDs during fevers from Viral infections? To be straight to the point, Dr. Mackowiack of the Veterans Administration has been studying fever management for decades and he has this to say: \"Underlying the prescription of (NSAIDs) is the assumption that fever is detrimental and that reduction of fever will have ____________________________________________________________________________________ Portland Clinic of Holistic Health \u00d32007-2020 All rights reserved 833 SW 11th Ave, Suite benefit; however, neither assumption has been demonstrated.\" (Mackowiak 2000). In other words' there is no scientific rationale or evidence that they have benefit. There is actually enough scientific evidence to calculate their negative impact on the number of lives lost. In other words', they lead to more fatalities when they are used and we can predict how many more lives will be lost in a given disease (1-5% more in seasonal and pandemic viral infections). We strongly advise to minimize and ideally eliminate the use of NSAIDs with fever or during viral infection. In pandemic viral infection models the use of anti-fever medications increases loss of life by 1%-5% for viral respiratory pandemics and increase the virus spread and transmission. That means that they lead to increased infection spread and increase the loss of life by 1-5%. They will raise the curve and not flatten it while worsening case outcomes. Another recent study provides further evidence that use of acetaminophen in respiratory infection associated with decreased lung function and an increased risk of asthma and COPD. This is incredibly important information to understand. \"Patients might survive (when using fever suppressor), but it's IN SPITE of the treatment, not because of it\" - Harold Dick ND, in clinical practice from 1955-1990. Based on the known and accepted physiology of fever, the basic and clinic scientific evidence of NSAID use in infectious fever, it is clear that the use of NSAIDs in fever management with viral respiratory infections be used judiciously and minimally. It is imperative that a rational approach to fever in the clinical setting particularly as it relates to respiratory viral infections, be implemented. \"Success sometimes depend not just on what the doctor does, but what he does not do.\" - Hippocrates We know that part of the high loss of life from the Spanish Flu epidemic from 1917-1918 was due to the prescription of aspirin and not the flu itself. I have been lecturing on this topic for almost 20 years. The renowned Dr. Karen Starko published a detailed evaluation of the data in 2009 in the Oxford Academic. Dr. Karen Starko is known around the world for leading the discovery that aspirin could be toxic to infants and lead to Reyes Syndrome. Aspirin was a new wonder drug against fevers and had recently become generic after Bayer lost a lawsuit to claim it as an exclusive patented drug. It gained widespread international distribution just before the academic. The starting dosages at the time we know now are the lowest level of toxic dosages - and induce pulmonary edema, hyperventilation, and death. Her conclusion was that \"a significant proportion of the deaths (during the epidemic) may be attributable to aspirin.\" http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/49/9/1405.full Naturopathic doctors at the time did not use aspirin to suppress the fever as the fever was seen to be beneficial and instead used hydrotherapy to comfort the patient, control the fever and harness it, and to help fight the infection. One of Hippocrates great quotes is \"Success sometimes depends not just on what the doctor does, but what he does not do.\" Why didn't Naturopathic doctors use aspirin for fevers? Naturopathic physicians, including Hippocrates, have long clinically observed the benefit of fever in infections. Modern research above has validated these observations resoundingly as noted above. Fever is considered a part of the curative response of the body. The role of hydrotherapy is not to artificially stop it with ice packs or drugs. The role of Naturopathic Hydrotherapy and Bio-Thermal Therapy \u00ae is to harness the fever to more rapidly resolve the infection. Additionally, naturopathic doctors of that era, and many today, believed that infections, particularly the childhood fevers such as measles, mumps, rubella etc., were a part of a larger cycle of immune development. In other words, that ____________________________________________________________________________________ Portland Clinic of Holistic Health \u00d32007-2020 All rights reserved 833 SW 11th Ave, Suite Guidelines Update 032820 by going through these infections the immune system was strengthened and chronic diseases such as cancer, paralysis, mental degeneration, arthritis, etc. would be prevented and reduced. This belief - that the childhood fevers in particular have a larger benefit when handled correctly- has also been confirmed by modern scientific research. Febrile childhood infections such as measles, mumps, rubella, etc. protect against all non-breast cancers. A Swiss study found that adults are significantly protected against non-breast cancers \u2014 genital, prostate, gastrointestinal, skin, lung, ear-nose-throat, and others \u2014 if they contracted measles (odds ratio, OR = 0.45), rubella (OR = 0.38) or chickenpox (OR = 0.62) earlier in life, and all febrile childhood diseases were associated with lower rates of non-breast cancer later in life.

Because of the effective clinical approaches outlined below infections were routinely benign for naturopathic physicians whereas in the hands of conventional doctors using ice packs, anti-fever medications, stuffing patients with food, etc. (in other words non-biological and unscientific approaches) complications were more frequent. ____________________________________________________________________________________ Portland Clinic of Holistic Health \u00d32007-2020 All rights reserved 833 SW 11th Ave, Suite Guidelines Update 032820 The following 5 steps of the Naturopathic infection guidelines below were the consistent principal interventions of the Naturopathic Physicians in the 1918 Flu epidemic that by themselves showed significant life-saving benefit. Avoid NSAIDS in any form (Tylenol, Aspirin, Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, Baby Aspirin, Nyquil, Dayquil, etc.) Do not disregard them - they are the essential basis of rational biological fever and infection management. Fever and Infection Basic Naturopathic Guidelines 1 Rest as much as possible. Stay home. This will allow the body to focus on fighting the infection, it will also help prevent spreading the illness to others. 2 Fresh Air The body requires 13% more oxygen for every degree of body temperature elevation (Beers and Berkow 1999). Ventilate the sick room. Get fresh air every hour or two while awake via an open window. A screen can be used to prevent a draft on the ill person. During the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 it was common in regular medicine to not open windows and keep patients confined without fresh air, this was counterproductive. Do not make this mistake. 3 Diet The old saying is actually: \"If you feed the cold, then you will have to starve the fever\". During infections' a simple diet of easily digested foods such as steamed vegetables, chicken soup, etc. are the rule. Avoid sugary foods, sweets, pastries, breads, heavy foods, or the hard to digest foods from your food intolerance report. Refrain from solid foods with a temperature over 99.5\u00b0F- ingest only water, diluted fruit juices, lemonade sweetened with honey, herbal teas, etc. (unless diabetic, pregnant or breastfeeding [the child should continue to breastfeed]). This may be required for several days. It is just as important to restrict the food as it is to properly break the fast. See below. It is very important to understand that feeding can be very counterproductive during a fever. The body produces chemicals (called interleukins) that halt digestion. Feeding solid foods will drive the fever higher because the foods do not digest under these conditions. Breaking the fast or food restriction: When the temperature has come down from being elevated to below 99.5\u00b0F, begin to break the fast SLOWLY. This is very important. The body has not been producing digestive enzymes during the fever- remember the body shut down digestion and digestive enzymes are largely proteins. The body used these proteins to make immune chemicals. It also harvests proteins from muscles- which is why fevers ache so much. So the body needs to 'warm up' to eating again. A reliable way is first by eating vegetable broth. The minerals in the vegetable broth will also help to improve rehydration. Vegetable Broth Recipe- Carrot and Celery: 12 cup of each in 2 cups water. Simmer until brown, strain, and drink 12 cup every 30 minutes. If fever returns again, discontinue solid foods as before and wait again for the fever to reduce to a level when digestion is activated. If fever does not return after consuming the two cups, proceed to eat the carrots and celery. If the fever still does not return then continue on to solid foods, something like a piece of meat or fish for proteins to replenish ____________________________________________________________________________________ Portland Clinic of Holistic Health \u00d32007-2020 All rights reserved 833 SW 11th Ave, Suite Guidelines Update 032820 those used during the fever. Continue to eat as directed by hunger It was common in regular medicine during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1917-1918 to stuff the patients and feed them strong meat broths during a fever 'to keep up the strength'. This was counterproductive and will increase negative outcomes. Do not make this mistake and overfeed an ill person. 4 Fluid Intake Hydration is important in infections. Use diluted fruit juices, lemonade, etc copiously and regularly. Dehydration is the biggest concern with a fever. Unless pregnant or diabetic, ingest only water, diluted fruit juice, lemonade sweetened with honey, herbal teas, etc. This may be required for several days. Breastfeeding children should continue to breastfeed and should not be fasted. Fluids were restricted in the Spanish Flu epidemic - do not make this mistake. 5 Bio-Thermal Therapy \u00ae Treatment : Hydrotherapy for safe fever management, hydration, and immune support The Bio-Thermal Therapy \u00ae system of Naturopathic Physiotherapy (physical therapy) Treatment is a drugless clinical method of care. The components of the treatment system have been in continuous clinical development based on research and clinical experience from around the world. Our clinical lineage stretches back directly over 200 years. We use modern and state of the art equipment. Basic Hydrotherapy guidelines are below.: These treatments help to encourage radiation of the heat to maintain the fever at a safe and beneficial temperature. They improve the ability of the body to fight the infection and should be considered a valuable tool to fight infections. These methods have centuries of practical clinical use internationally in colds, flus, pneumonia, cholera, smallpox, polio, and other epidemics as a very effective method. The system below is a modern simplification of the methods used their effectiveness and importance should not be discounted. The Hydrotherapy methods described below replace the anti-pyretic medications. However, they not only allow the fever to do its job, make patients more comfortable, while preventing complications or risks, they assist the fever by letting it run and 'drawing off the heat'. Apply the procedure indicated based upon the temperature. Wring the wet cotton towels from cold tap water - wrung very well to be only damp and not dripping. NOT ice cold. The cool towel is always covered by an insulating layer such as a wool or vellux blanket. This creates a dynamic relationship between the heat of the body and the cold towels. The heat of the body will warm the cool towel, drawing off the heat. Leave the application on until it warms to the temperature of the body then remove. Renew the applications until the patient sleeps or rests well (typically leave on if sleeping until they wake) or until the temperature comes down to around 101F which is ideal for effective and safe fever. Cool compresses to the forehead and back of the neck in high fever can be very soothing and protect from overheating. For Temperatures below 98.0\u00b0F with symptoms such as chills, headaches, aches or pains: 5x4x20 treatment: Wring out 2 towels from hot water (100-120\u00b0F). These should be folded in half to create 4 layers and applied to the persons back - from hip to shoulders (the torso). The size of the towels should be appropriate to the size of the person to create 4 layers. Cover with a wool or vellux blanket. Leave these for 5 minutes. Have another set of hot towels ready at the 5-minute mark. At 5 minutes replace the old towels with the new set. Repeat two more times. ____________________________________________________________________________________ Portland Clinic of Holistic Health \u00d32007-2020 All rights reserved 833 SW 11th Ave, Suite Guidelines Update 032820 Apply for 4 total rounds of 5 minutes each (20 minutes total) of heat. THEN apply a cool towel about the size of a washcloth to the abdomen - 2 layers well wrung from cool water. Cover. This will RAISE the temperature typically .5-1\u00b0F and typically provides relief of aches, pains, and headaches. It also can be useful in the chill phase of a fever to help the body to reach it's therapeutic temperature early and help to divert an infection to a milder form. For Temperature 98.0-98.6\u00b0F In the absence of a fever during an infection: Take a warm bath or shower for 5-10 minutes. Afterwards follow the directions for the Neptune's Girdle found below. For fevers 98.6-99.5\u00b0F - Wet Sock Treatment: Use a pair of cotton socks (crew/tube/sports socks) and wring them out in cold tap water. Put on the wet socks. Put on over the cotton socks a pair of thick wool socks. Relax for 20 minutes or until the wet socks are warmed to body temperature, then remove. This will gently bring the fever down about .5 F degree and is useful early on to abort an infectious process particularly of the ears, sinus and throat. For fevers 99.6-101\u00b0F - Abdominal/Neptune's Girdle: Wring a thin bath or hand towel in cold water. Fold in half lengthwise so it is two layers thick and wrap around your torso, covering from chest to hip bone.
