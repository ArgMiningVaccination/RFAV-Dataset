The 1962 amendments to the Federal Food, Drug I and Cosmetic Act and the Food and Drug Administration's regulations require the agency to closely control the clinical (human) testing of new drugs. The act re- quires that the agency approve a new drug for safety and efficacy before it is intro- duced into interstate commerce. (See p0 1.) Since June 1963 the Food and Drug Adminis- tration has required sponsors--persons ac- cepting responsibility for investigating new drugs-- to submit investigational new drug applications to exempt unapproved new drugs from the ban on interstate shipment, thus permitting shipment to qualified experts (clinical investigators) for clinical stud- ies to obtain evidence concerning safety and efficacy. (See pp. 1 to 3.) Within the Food and Drug Administration, the Bureau of Biologics regulates the testing of biological drugs and the Bureau of Drugs regulates all other human drugs. At June 30, 1974, there were about 4,600 active investigational new drugs involving about 250,000 test subjects. About 1,200 sponsors and 5,000 clinical investigators were under regulation by the Bureau of Drugs. About 200 sponsors and 4,400 clinical in- vestigators were under regulation by the Bureau of Biologics. The clinical investi- gations under a single investigational new drug application may include several thousand human test subjects. (See pp. 3 to 6,) Tear Sheet. Upon removal, the report cover date should be noted hereon. i HRD-76-96 :' AGE& MONITORING EFFORTS me---- .---.---m Poorly conducted clinical investigations unnecessarily expose human subjects to po- tential hazards and could result in the Food and Drug Administration's approving a drug for marketing on the basis of inaccurate and unreliable data, To prevent this, the agency must monitor the performance of clinical in- vestigations. Such reviews, however, have been limited. Before 1972 the agency's monitoring was lim- ited to about 40 inspections of clinical in- vestigators suspected of wrongdoing, From July 1972 through June 1974, the agency, in a special survey, inspected 15 sponsors and 155 of their clinical investigators, In 1974, at GAO's requestr the agency inspected an additional 83 clinical investigators. In most cases, clinical investigators were not fully complying with the laws or agency regulations and sponsors were not adequately monitoring their clinical investigators. (See pp. 8 to 21.) ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and new drug regulations provide for administra- tive and legal actions against those who violate requirements. The Food and Drug Administrati'on has made limited use of these enforcement actions. Since the 1962 amend- ments, four cases have been referred to the Department of Justice, which prosecuted two clinical investigators for submitting fraud- ' ulent data. Administrative sanctions have not been effectively used. (See pp* 21 to 25,) INFORMED CONSENT -- -- The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act explicitly requires that human beings par- ticipating in an experiment with a new drug be informed of such use and that their con- sent, or that of their representative, be obtained. New drug regulations contain t QI ii detailed requirements concerning how such informed consent should be obtained. Of 238 Food and Drug Administration inspec- tions made since 1972, consent information was available on 172 clinical investigators and 52 sponsor/investigators (sponsors who personally perform all or part of the clini- cal testing). Sixty-seven, or 39 percent, of the 172 clinical investigators had not complied with agency requirements for in- formed consent. Twenty-six, or 50 percentp of the 52 sponsor/investigators had not complied. Violations included failing to obtain consent and using forms containing various deficien- cies, including exculpatory language through which the patient is made to waive or appear to waive his or her legal rights or to re- lease the physician or the institution from liability for negligence should adverse ef- fects occur. (See ch. 3.) INDEPENDENT 'THIRD-PARTY REVIEW ----- --- Some clinical investigators use institution- alized subjects, such as those confined to a hospital, nursing home, prison, or home for the mentally retarded. Because such subjects may be more vulnerable to abuse or exploita- tion by research projects than the general population, the Food and Drug Administration since April 1971 has required that an insti- tutional review committee be established Ilor initial approval and continuing review of such studies. (See p. 42.) Although Food and Drug Administration regu- lations state that, in addition to the spon- sor's continuing responsibility to monitor the study, the agency will inspect institu- tional review committees periodically, the agency does not know the number and loca- tions of all committees and has inspected relatively few. As of October 1974 the Bureau of Drugs had inspected 25 committees since 1971, when they were first required to be established. The Bureau of Biologics had never inspected a committee and was not Tear Sheet iii I ,I (. ,;lj/ ,I1 ,,!I/1 aware of the regulatio'ns concerning such inspect ions D (See ppa 43 and 44.) The inspections showed that frequently the committees had not adequately reviewed new drug studies, The Food and Drug Adminis- tration had scheduled inspections at two institutions but found that the institu- tional review committees had not been es- tab1 ished 0 (See ppO 44 to 48.) THE AGENCY\"S AUTHORITY OVER CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS -w SPONSORED BY FEDERAL AGENCIES At the time of our review, the Department of Defense was sponsoring 53 clinical in- vestigations and the National Institutes of Health was sponsoring 222, A question exists as to whether the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory authority under the act extends to clinical investiga- tions sponsored by Federal agencies, (See p. 52.) The agency had not inspected clinical inves- tigations sponsored by the Department of De- fense and the National Institutes of Health until GAO requested that some be inspected. The inspections concerning the Department of Defense were limited to unclassified studies. The inspections showed generally the same types of deficiencies as were found in the Food and Drug Administration inspections of non-federally-sponsored studies. (See ppO 52 to 58.) I GAO is making recommendations to the Secre- tary of Health,, Education, and Welfare to I', enable the Food and Drug Administration to improve its monitoring and better control clinical investigations. (See pp& 26, 40, 50, 60, and 63.) GAO also is recommending that the Congress clarify its intent regarding the question of the ,applicability of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to Federal agencies., (See p. 60.) iV Tear Sheet The Department of Health, Education I and Welfare (HEW) did not dispute GAO's findings but questioned whether some of the recommen- dations provided the most appropriate solu- tion to the problem. However, HEW generally agreed that regulation of clinical investi- gations needed strengthening. (See pp. 27, 40, 50, 60, 64, and app. VI.) HEW pointed out that the E'ood and Drug Ad- ministration must carry out many complex, and sometimes competing responsibilities in evaluating the safety and effectiveness of new drugs. Recognizing the limited resources available for these activities, HEW said em- phasizing one aspect will diminish the effort that can be directed at other aspects of the regulation of investigational new drugs. (See p, 27.) To help the agency strengthen its manitoring activities, on April 22, 1976, the President asked the Congress for an additional $16.3 million in a fiscal year 1977 budget amend- ment to increase efforts in certain agency program areas, including the monitoring of preclinical and clinical testing of new drug products. (See p. 51.) The Peparment of Defense concurred in GAO's conclusions and recommendations pertaining to it. (See p. 60 and app. V,) V CHAPTER 1 -- ------ INTRODUCTION In late 1361, Thalidomide, a sedative not approved for marketing in the United States, was ,being tested in pregnant women suffering from insomnia and morning sickness. Although approved in Europe as safe for general use, the drug proved to be teratogenic, causing a number of crippling birth de- fects, such as the lack of arms and legs. The major impact of the tragedy was avoided in the United States. However, premature distribution of Thalidomide and other inadequately tested drugs and a recognition of the 'ethical need to mini- mize risk to human test subjects were two factors that led to passage of the 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendments to the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 301). REQUIREMENTS OF LAWS AND -__I ,--- IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS Under the 1962 Kefauver-Barr is Amendments and implemen- ting regulations for investigational use of new drugs, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), is required to closely control the clinical (human) testing of new drugs. The FD&C Act requires that, before a new drug may be intro,duced into interstate commerce, FDA must approve it for safety and efficacy. Before 1462 there was no requirement that FDA be notified that drugs were being tested on humans or that a new drug be proven effective for its intended use. While chemical drugs are regulated under the FD&C Act, biological drugs are subject to both the FD&C Act and section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 262). The latter requires that biological dr.ugs shipped interstate be licensed to insure they are safe, pure, and potent as well as safe and effective under the FD&C Act. FDA admin- isters the FD&C Act and the drug provisions of the Public Health Service Act. Tne FD&C Act defines a \"new drug\" as any drug not gen- erally recognized, among qualified experts, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the drug's labeling. A new drug may be an entirely new substance or a marketed drug being tested for a new indication (that is, a condition for which the drug is not approved). To satisfy FDA requirements for safety and efficacy, the sponsor of a new drug must, among other things, clinically test the drug under closely controlled circumstances. This 1 may involve shipping an unapproved drug interstate to qual- ified experts (clinical investigators) for testing. According to FDA's 1963 drug regulations, a sponsor is the person who assumes responsibility for investigating a new drug, including the primary responsibility for monitoring the clinical investigators' activities, Sponsors are generally drug manufacturers, private and government institutions or agencies, or physicians, In a later consideration of the sponsor's responsi- bility, FDA in 1972 sought the advice of the National Academy of Science/National Research Council. Their views generally conformed with the FDA requirements, so FDA did not revise its regulations. FDA defines a \"clinical investigator\" as any person licensed in the healing arts, such as a physician or den- tist, qualified to make studies with investigational drugs. Clinical investigators must receive FDA approval for participation in the study. A sponsor who personally per- forms all or part of the clinical testing is referred to as a sponsor/investigator. Investigational new drus apolications Since June 1963 FDA has required the sponsor to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to exempt the new drug from the ban on interstate shipment of unapproved drugsl thus permitting it to be shipped for clinical studies. The evidence of safety and efficacy obtained from such studies is included in either a new drug application sub- mitted by persons seeking to market a new drug product or a license application submitted by persons seeking to market a biological product. Under FDA procedures issued August 14, 1970, the sponsor I after submitting an IND application, must wait 30 days before beginning clinical tests. This delay enables FDA to review the application to make certain it contains necessary in- formation and to insure that patients will not be exposed to unwarranted risks e Before August 14, 1970, the sponsor was free to begin testing immediately after submitting the IND application to FDA. FDA's regulations (21 C,F,R. 312) governing new drugs state that the IND application must include: 1. A statement covering all information available to the sponsor derived from preclinical investigations, 2 including studies made on laboratory animals, and from any clinical studies and experience with the drug r from which the sponsor has concluded that clinical tests can be conducted with reasonable safety. 2. The name of each investigator and a summary of his or her experience and training which the sponsor con- siders appropriate to qualify the investigator as a suitable expert to investigate the drug. 3. An overall outline of any phase or phases of the planned investigations, including detailed plans of study (called protocols) for use in the proposed testing during the clinical investigation. In addition, the regulations require the sponsor-- as a condition for IND application approval--to agree to submit to FDA: 1. Accurate progress reports at reasonable intervals, not exceeding 1 year, of investigations and signif i- cant findings, together with any signif icant changes in the information submitted to investigators. 2. Reports of any findings concerning the drug that may suggest significant hazards, contraindications, side effects, or precautions pertinent to the safety of its use. If the finding is alarming, it is to be reported immediately and the clinical investiga- tions discontinued until the finding is adequately evaluated and a decision reached that it is safe to proceed. 3. A full report of the reason for discontinuing the investigations when the drug's risks are expected to outweigh its potential benefits. Within FDA the Bureau of Biologics regulates the testing of biological products and the Bureau of Drugs regulates the testing of all other human drugs. Before July 1, 1972, the Bureau of Biologics was under another HEW constituent agency, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and was known as the Division of Biologics Standards. When received by FDA, an IND application is analyzed by a review team consisting of a medical doctor, a chemist, and a pharmacologist, who seek to determine whether there is adequate data from short-term animal studies and in vitro 3 !,, tests, l/ as well as adequate 'manufacturing controls, to con- clude that it is reasonably safe to study the drug in humans. FDA must complete this review and notify the sponsor of any safety problems within 30 days after receiving the IND; if FDA raises no objections during this time, the sponsor may start human trials. Then the review team must periodi- cally review the IND file, including all new data submitted. Clinical investigations are divided into three phases, --Phase I begins when the new drug is first introduced into healthy humans to determine pharmacological actions, such as human toxicity, metabolism, absorp- tion, and elimination; the preferred route of admin- istration and safe dosage range are also determined. The number of humans used in Phase I varies, general- ly ranging from 20 to 50. --Phase II covers the initial trials on a limited number of patients, generally no more than 100 to 200, to test pharmacological actions in preventing or con- trolling a specific disease. --Phase III covers expanded trials on patients which provide a basis for assessing the drug's safety and efficacy and optimum dosage schedules in diagnosis, treatment I or prophylaxis. Phase III trials may include several thousand persons. Long-term animal tests, generally lasting from 1 to several years, are conducted concurrently with clinical tests and are designed to show the drug's long-term effects. The data on a new drug collected during the three phases of testing in humans and long-term animal testing is the pri- mary basis on which FDA approves a sponsor's new drug appli- cation or license to market the drug. Therefore, such data must be accurate and reliable, Before permitting a clinical investigator to participate in a new drug study, FDA requires the sponsor to obtain a certification that the investigator understands and will adhere to the requirements of the law and regulations govern- ing clinical investigations, including the requirement to II- L/Conducted in test tubes or in glassl as opposed to tests in man or animals. obtain informed consent of test subjects or their repre- sentatives before administering the drug. In some cases tests involve institutionalized sub- jects-- such as those confined to a hospital, nursing home, or prison. Therefore, since April 1971 FDA has required that, in addition to its own reviews, an initial approval and continuing review of the study be made by an institutional review committee (IRC). From June 1963, when sponsors were first required to submit IND applications, through fiscal year 1974, FDA granted about 11,000 IND exemptions. The approximate number of active sponsors, IND exemptions, clinical invest- igators, and test subjects under regulation by the Bureau of Biologics and the Bureau of Drugs at June 30, 1974, follows. Number under regulation by Bureau ----- Bureau of of Drugs -_I- Biologics Sponsors 1,200 200 INDs 4,200 415 Clinical investigators 5,000 4,400 Test subjects 160,000 88,000 The percentage of INDs under regulation by each bureau and type of sponsor is shown below.

FDA has administrative and legal enforcement actions available if it finds the law and regulations are not being followed. (See p0 21.) NATIONAL RESEARCH ACT -- Pub1 ic and congressional concern over protection of human subjects in biomedical and behavioral research led to passage of the National Research Act (Public Law 93-348) on July 12, 1974. The act establishes the National Commis- sion for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, composed of 11 members appointed by the Secretary of HEW. The act requires that the Commission be composed of individuals distinguished in medicine; law; ethics; theology; the biological r physical social sciences; philosophy; humanities; health administration; government; and public affairs, including five individuals who are or have been engaged in biomedical or behavioral research in- volving human subjects. The Commission's duties are to identify the basic ethical principle& and develop guidelines for conducting biomedical and behavioral research involving human sub- jects, In addition, the Commission was required to inves- tigate specific issues, such as (1) the use of children, prisoners, and mental patients in research projects, (2) the assessment of risk-benefit criteria in biomedical research, (3) the nature and definition of informed consent, (4) the nature and extent of fetal research, and (5) the use of psychosurgery in the United States. Commission members were appointed in October 1974, and the Commission's work is in progress. The Commission's final report on its investigations is due to be provided to the Secretary of HEW in .December 1976. The act provides that after 2 years the Commission will be replaced by a permanent National Advisory Council for the Protection of Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The Council will provide the Secretary with rec- ommendations concerning the protection of human subjects and review the changing status and trends of biomedical research. However I Senate bill 2515, introduced on October 9, 1975, would reestablish the Commission as a Presidential Commission, broadening its jurisdiction and its membership. Alscl I the National Academy of Sciences, on February 18 and 19, 1575, convened a publ,ic forum on \"Expel: iments and Research 6 with Humans: Values in Conflict. \" The forum discussed the ethical and legal issues involved in biomedical experiments on human beings, placing special emphasis on children, the poor, prisoners, and military personnel, as well as fetal research. The four areas examined were (1) perspectives of biomedical research, (2) individual risks versus societal benefits, (3) regulatory, judicial, and legislative processes, and (4) future policy options. Although the Academy forum provided for public discussion and debate on the issues, it did not recommend improve- ments in human research activities. 7 i, CHAP+ER 2 NEED FOR AGGRESSIVE MONITORING -- AND ENFORCEMENT IN CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS -1-s FDA has not effectively regulated clinical investiga- tions of new drugs. At any time about 4,000 drug investi- gations are in progress, involving about 10,000 investiga- tors and tens of thousands of human subjects, Between 600 and 1,100 new IND applications are filed each year. Poorly conducted clinical investigations unnecessarily expose hu- man subjects to potential hazards. FDA's system of new drug regulation depends heavily on the accuracy of the data sub- mitted by the sponsors. FDA acknowledges that, to protect patients and insure the quality of submitted data, FDA must monitor the performance of clinical investigations, Such monitoring is necessary for FDA to evaluate whether sponsors are effectively carrying out their responsibility for moni- toring their clinical investigators. FDA's monitoring has been limited, however, and FDA has not aggressively enforced compliance with its investigational new drug regulations. As a result, it is not effectively fulfilling its responsibility to (1) regulate clinical in- vestigations, (2) protect the human test subjects from un- necessary dangers a&ociated with experimental use of new drugs, and (3) protect the public from dangers from new drugs approved for marketing by insuring that the approval decision was based on accurate test data. LIMITED MONITORING DIMINISHES --P---M REGULATORY EFFECTIVENESS Although the 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendments required FDA to closely control clinical investigations, FDA's moni- toring has been limited. Until June 1974 FDA did not have a comprehensive plan for monitoring clinical investigations and evaluating compliance with its regulations. In 1972 FDA began a special survey in which it inspected 15 sponsors and 155 of their clinical investigators, and in 1974 it inspected, at our request, 83 more clinical investi- gators. Before 1972 FDA ,monitoring was limited to about 40 inspections of clinical investigators suspected of wrong- doing . In most inspections since 1972, FDA found that clin- ical investigators were not fully complying with the law and FDA regulations and that sponsors were not adequately moni- toring their clinical investigators, 8 Swecial survev FDA began the special survey in July 1972 to assess the practices and procedures of sponsors and their clinical investigators. The last inspection was completed in June 1974. Our review of the inspection results indicated that, of the 155 clinical investigators inspected, 115 (74 per- cent) failed to comply with 1 or more requirements of the law and regulations. The percentage of clinical investi- gators who failed to comply with each of six requirements checked by FDA follow. Requirements Percent failing to comply I_- Informed patient consent 35 Drug accountability 50 Protocol adherence 28 Records accuracy 23 Records availability 22 Investigator's role in study 12 Except for informed consent (see ch. 3), the require- ments and related deficiencies are described below. Drug accountability-- The investigator must accurately recordthecof-fig received from the sponsor and distributed to test subjects. Only authorized individuals should distribute investigational drugs. At the conclusion of the study, the investigator must return any unused drug to the sponsor. Also, should a drug be found to cause health hazards serious enough to require recalling the drug supplies, lack of proper drug accountability could impede or preclude the recall, leaving the hazardous drug in the hands of the unsuspecting patients. Thus, drug accountability is important from the standpoints of patient protection (receiv- ing the proper dosage under the supervision of a qualified investigator) and preventing unauthorized use of the drug. Protocol adherence-- The investigator must adhere to the protocol, a detailed plan for conducting the investigation, agreed upon by both sponsor and investigator and submitted to FDA. Significant changes in direction or scope of the inves- tigation must be reported to the sponsor and by the sponsor to FDA. Deviations from the agreed-upon protocol may in- validate study data. In such cases, human test subjects are unnecessarily placed at risk because the study results cannot be used. 9 Records accuracy --The records must accurately reflect the patient's condition before, during, and after the study and the type of laboratory work done and other therapy admin- istered during the study. Accurate records show that the clinical investigator has provided proper care and attention to the study. Perhaps more important, the validity of con- clusions derived from the study and ultimate market approval depend upon the accuracy of the study records. Records availability--The investigator must keep accurate case records for at least 2 years after the drug's approval for marketing or withdrawal from clinical trial. Maintaining records is particularly important for followup should un- expected results develop during or after a study. Study role --The drug may be administered only by the in- vestigator or a qualified individual under his or her direct supervision. To insure that only qualified investigators use the drug I the investigator may not provide the drug to in- dividuals not mentioned in the agreement with the sponsor. To insure proper supervision of the drug's use, the investi- gator may not delegate responsibility for the investigation to subordinates or include as study subjects individuals whose geographical location does not permit close observation and followup. Details on FDA's inspection findings concerning several sponsors and their clinical investigators follow. In addi- tion to the deficiencies discussed in each case, deficiencies 'were found in consent procedures. (See ch. 3.) Sponsor i In 1973, as part of its special survey, FDA inspected sponsor A and nine of its clinical investigators conducting phase II and phase III trials of a vaginal cream for the treatment of moniliasis-- an infection caused by yeast-like fungi. In seven of the nine clinical investigations for which we obtained a copy of FDA's inspection report, over 250 women participated. All nine clinical investigators were deficient in com- pliance in one or more of the six FDA requirements. FDA\" s letter to the sponsor summarized the deficiencies as follows. 10 Number of investigators Failed to maintain proper drug accountability records Deviated from protocol Maintained inaccurate case records 4 Failed to maintain patient ret- ords to support case reports 3 FDA told sponsor A that few investigators were aware of the requirements to maintain proper drug accountability--an indication of the sponsor's lack of proper monitoring. Al- though FDA regulations require that unused drugs be returned to the sponsor, some investigators kept the unused drug sup- plies after completing their study. One investigator said that after study completion he sometimes retains the unused portion to use on other patients if he \"thinks it is a drug of choice. 'I FDA inspectors' attempts to reconstruct drug accountability records for several studies revealed various amounts of unaccountable overages or shortages. The inspections also revealed numerous deviations of varying degrees from t,he protocol. For example, one .inves- tigator omitted required laboratory studies (hematology, urinalysis, and biochemical properties),on 40 percent of his patients. Be said he obtained oral approval 'from the spon- sor's monitor to omit the studies. FDA advised the sponsor that, if deviations are authorized, such authorizations must be in writing and that careful monitoring can prevent most deviations. Another investigator who deviated from the protocol a number of times said he did so on his own init'iat'ive, without the required knowledge and concurrence of sponsor A. In one case this investigator included in the clinical study a pa- tient who did not meet the protocol selection criteria. The investigator said he had \"slipped up\" and should not have admitted her to the study. One other investigator failed to follow the protocol requirements for --post-therapy examinations, --!Pap smear tests, --the alternating of two drugs administered to patients, and --treatment of moniliasis when it recurred. 11 Record inaccuracies noted ';in four studies included numerous discrepancies between patient records and case reports submitted to FDA. In one study, the case report showed that two apparently different patients--one age 22, admitted to the study in January 1973, and the other age 32, admitted in November 1972--had the same name. The investi- gator's assistant stated \"there had been a mix-up somewhere.\" In another study, tests reported in the case reports could not be substantiated by raw data. The investigator told the FDA inspector tha t if the test results were not in the pa- tients' records, the tests probably' were not made, FDA ad- vised sponsor A that when patient records are not available, the credibility of a study can be questioned. Sponsor B This was a phase III study of an antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. One investigator's study lasted 18 months and involved 155 human test subjects. Most of the study was done by 18 resident physicians at 3 hospi- tals. FDA concluded that the investigator's management of the study was unsatisfactory, authority was delegated and diffused to the vanishing point, and the result was a weakened study. Drug accountability was inadequate, and laboratory and treat- ment records in many cases were inaccurate. For example: --The investigator failed to keep a complete record of all drugs received, dispensed, or returned to the sponsor e He said he thought some had been returned but could not find documentation of that fact. He said the residents may have given supplies of th.e drug to other residents not in the study. --Laboratory and treatment records contained errors in (1) transcribing laboratory reports, (2) reporting dates of treatment, and (3) calculating total days of treatment. The investigator said .this was a con- stant problem with the resident physicians and that he also had problems with residents failing to com- plete case reports when patients die after receiving only one or a few doses of an investigational drug. Review of the laboratory results in the files of 8 patients disclosed 54 discrepancies from the re- sults reported to sponsor B. --Deviations from the protocol included failing to per- form required laboratory tests; giving patients con- comitant antimicrobial therapy for treatment of the condition for which the experimental drug was being used; and admitting patients that did not meet the selection criteria, including some with pseudomonas (a type of bacteria) e 12 The protocol states the experimental drug should not be used to treat pseudomonas. The FDA inspector's review of 10 patients' records revealed 2 were admitted with pseudomonas and 1 was treated for the condition with the experimental drug. Review of the autopsy reports for the six test sub- jects that died indicated the presence of pseudomonas in one patient but did not implicate the drug in the death. In an- other deviation from protocol, records for a 12-year-old patient indicated the possibility that a lo-day supply of the injectable antibiotic was given to the patient's mother for administration at home. When asked if he considered this an approved practice for investigational studies, the clinical investigator said the parent of one subject had been a nurse and this might have been the one. The investigator told the FDA inspector he considered this study to be insignificant research since he knew through experience that the drug would work and would not hurt anyone. He also stated he did not consider all the case reports sub- mitted to sponsor B to be acceptable for evaluation but did not tell the sponsor so. He said the evaluation was between the sponsor and FDA. At the conclusion of the inspection, the investigator invited the FDA inspector back to review one of his better investigations. Sponsor C --- This was a phase III study of a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. An excerpt from FDA's letter to the clinical investigator concerning the inspection findings follows. \"We have reviewed [the FDA inspector 's] report and find multiple deficiencies in your investiga- tional procedures. \" * * * * * \"2. Drug accountability was haphazard, with 992 tablets unaccounted for at the time of [the inspector's] visit. \"3. Failure to follow protocol. \"a. No prestudy x-rays within 3 months on 8 patients. \"b. Concomitant therapy-6 patients. \"C. Diagnosis not indicated-5 patients. 13 \"d 0 Documentation of the existence of the treated disorder * * * present in only one patient I \"we consider the above deficiencies to be signif - icant deviations from the Investigational Drug Regulations and feel that they represent derelic- tion of your responsibilities as a clinical in- vestigator,\" Sponsor D This was a phase III study of a drug intended to reduce the appetite of obese patients. Sixty test subjects partici- pated in the study. .FDA's letter to the clinical investigator stated: \"we must conclude that you did not give proper consideration to your obligations as an inves- tigator of new drugs. Our conclusion is based on the following: \"1. You did not have any contact with any of the patients participating in your study. \" * * * * * \"3. The review of records generated in the study disclosed multiple discrepancies relating to patient numbers, which, in turn I created a most confusing picture of the actual medication schedule. \"4. Two patients received concomitant medi- cation with other [appetite-suppressing] agents e This reflects a lack of proper control of this study, \"We would remind you that repeated or deliberate failure to comply with the Regulations * * * could lead to loss of [the investigator's] entitle- ment to receive investigational new drugs,\" Although not mentioned in the letter, drug accountability was nonexistent. The clinical investigator said he had no record showing the amount of drug received, date received, amount used, and amount destroyed when the study was com- pleted. 14 The inspection also disclosed that some adverse reactions to the drug reported to sponsor D were not recorded in the hospital outpatient records. In another case a possible re- action noted in the outpatient record was not reported to the sponsor. A small nodule was noted in the patient's breast while on the study and was removed by surgery after the study ended. The assistant to the clinical investigator said that the nodule was not malignant and that she did not believe discovery of a nodule in a breast was unusual or alarming in a study of an investigational drug. The clinical investigator told the FDA inspector he had been making clinical investigations for 16 years and had never before been inspected. FDA's evaluation of special survey flndings -- The Commissioner of FDA, in congressional hearings on July 10, 1975, pointed out that a 1970 pilot survey of spon- sors revealed that they were reluctant to discuss the IND regulations with their clinical investigators lest they an- tagonize them. Furthermore, it was found that sponsors did not routinely examine the investigator's raw patient data. He stated that the 1972 special survey results reflect the same situation. The sponsors, in seeking out capable physi- cians to conduct their studies, \"appear loath\" to discuss IND fundamentals with an expert clinician. The Commissioner said that the inspectional findings at the investigator level reflect the consequences of this re- luctance and that improvements were needed to raise the levels of compliance. He concluded that the sponsors are in the best position to raise these levels by more thorough supervisory contact with their investigators. He pointed out that spon- sors, in their discussions with investigators, should stress and detail not only the protocol to be used but also the In- vestigation Drug Regulations to be followed. FDA inspections made at GAO's request e-p--- We found that FDA had never inspected clinical investiga- tors working for Federal sponsors or as a sponsor/clinical investigator, It also had not inspected sponsors or clinical investigators regulated by the Bureau of Biologics. The Director, IND Staff, Bureau of Biologics, said he lacked the resources to make inspections. He was not aware that about 148 FDA field inspectors, specially trained to inspect clinical investigations, were available for such inspections. (This and other matters concerning lack of 15 l/j /Ii coordination between the Bureau of Drugs and the Bureau of Biologics are discussed in ch. 6.) Because of FDA's complete lack of data on these important and sizeable segments of clinical investigation activities, we requested FDA to inspect a sample of clinical investiga- tors from each segment. The results of the inspections of federally sponsored clinical investigations are discussed in chapter 5 a Results of the other inspections made at our re- quest are discussed below, Bureau of Drugs In about 44 percent of the new drug clinical investiga- tions, physicians act as both the sponsor and investigator. In these cases, the study is usually done for basic research, rather than to accumulate data needed to prove the drug is safe and effective for marketing. Unlike studies sponsored by a drug company, studies made by a sponsor/investigator are not subject to independent monitoring by sponsors, In such cases I FDA monitoring becomes even more important. We found, however, that the Bureau of Drugs had never inspected studies conducted by sponsor/investigators, At our request, FDA inspected a sample of 35 sponsor/ investigators from the 225 that submitted IND applications to the Bureau of Drugs during fiscal year 1973, Compliance levels were low--generally no better than compliance levels disclosed by FDA's 1972 special survey. Compliance in drug accountability was much lower. The Bureau of Drugs' Scien- tific Investigations Staff expressed.surprise at the dis- closure. All 35 sponsor/investigators failed to comply with one or more requirements of FDA's regulations, Although the ability to project the findings to all sponsor/investigators was limited by the small number in- spec ted I Bureau of Drugs officials said general trends were fairly clear. The percentage of sponsor/investigators that failed to comply with requirements that Bureau officials con- sidered most important are shown below. Percentage fail- Requirements ing to comply Informed patient consent Institutional review committee a/44 34 Communication with FDA and collaborators 85 Drug accountability 67 a/As discussed on pages 32 and 33,. we evaluated the consent forms using E'DA's criteria and found the failure rate to be 85 percent. 16 (Ch. 4 discusses deficiencies found in the performance of IRCs.) The third category-- communication with FDA and collaborators-- represents a combination of failure rates in several areas. For example, 76 percent failed to notify FDA of changes in protocol as required, 48 percent failed to submit timely annual progress reports, 15 percent failed to wait the required 30 days before administering the drug, and all the sponsor/investigators whose patients experienced alarming adverse reactions to the drug failed to report them. The results of FDA's inspection of two sponsor/investi- gators follow. Sponsor/investigator A-- The drug in this study was being used to treat three hospitalized patients having generalized lipodystrophy (a disturbance of fat metabolism causing gro- tesque disfigurement) . --Two patients suffered alarming adverse reactions about 6 weeks and 1 week, respectively, before the FDA in- spection. These reactions, which were not reported to FDA until the day after the inspection, included severe depression, tiredness, unsteadiness of gait, anxiety, and insomnia. The investigator said the re- actions were alarming because, in the patients' condi- tions, they might cause suicidal tendencies. --Drug accountability was not properly maintained, and 100 capsules were shipped to another in'vestigator without FDA's knowledge and approval and without the required signed statement from the investigator re- ceiving the capsules that he understood, his respon- sibilities under FDA regulations. --No control patients were selected for the study as required by the protocol. --Approval by an IRC was not obtained until 1974, although the study began in 1972. The investigator said he was not aware of the requirement, Sponsor/investigator B--l Ihis was a study of a drug used to treat mycosis fungoids, a rare chronic skin disease. The drug was known to produce cancer in tests on laboratory animals. FDA's letter to the investigator stated: \"Several aspects of our investigator's report are of concern to us. We note that you did not always get written consent from your office 17 practice patients. We fur'!her note that you provided the drug to three other physicians not directly responsible to you* and whose names and Investigator Statements * * * were not supplied to us. In addition, we note that one patient was treated prior to your filing for an IND, Finally, the report indicates that no drug accountability procedures were in effect.\" Bureau of l3ioiogics At our requestp FDA inspected a sample of 23 sponsor/ investigators and 25 clinical investigators working for com- mercial sponsors, FDA selected the clinical investigators from the INDs submitted during fiscal years 1972 and 1973. FDA found that the level of compliance observed during the 48 inspections ransed from \"substantial deficiencies\" to llsubstintial or complete compliance\" with provisions of law and regulations, as shown below. Investigators Sponsor/ for commer- Level of compliance investigators cial sponsors In substantial compliance Poor recordkeeping only Noncompliance in substan- tial areas 14 14 2 10 7 1 - 23 25 S i the Total 28 12 8 48 s Although FDA judged 28 to be in substantial compliance in all areas, in at least two areas--patient consent and drug accountability-- the large majority of the 48 inspected failed to comply e Thirteen of the 23 sponsor/investigators and 19 of the 25 commercial investigators failed to obtain or properly obtain patient consent. FDA found most consent forms to be poor or incomplete e Failure to maintain proper drug account- ability was a problem for 16 sponsor/investigators and 14 com- mercial investigators. Poor recordkeeping included problems in data compilation, drug accountability, and the listing of assistant investiga- tors a Noncompliance in substantial areas included refusing to provide progress report information to the sponsorr f.ail- ing to inform FDA that additional principal clinical investi- gators had been added to the study,. failing to obtain written patient consent, and failing to obtain IRC approval. FDA concluded that the inspection results demonstrated tne importance of the Bureau of Biologics' developing an inspect ion nonitcr ing program to promote full conpl iance with the regulations. FDA is considering sending a letter to each sponsor of biological products summarizing the in- spection findings. In its letter, FDA plans to express its concern that clinical investigators have not been complying with the law and FDA regulations. Two investigators found in noncompliance in substantial areas were also, according to FDA, deficient in medical per- f ormance. Both were sponsor/investigators and are discussed below. Sponsor/investigator C-- This was an ongoing phase II study of a new drug used to reduce the rejection rate among kidney transplant patients. About 650 patients were treated; 85 died. The sponsor/investigator did not attribute any of the deaths to the drug. The deficiencies FDA found included: --Failure to obtain written patient consent. --Failure to report to FDA four cases of an alarming adverse reaction (renal artery thrombosis, a blood clot in an artery of the kidney). --Failure to report patient deaths to FDA. --Failure to submit annual progress reports. --Failure to obtain FDA approval of protocol modifica- tions. --Failure to wait the required 30 days before adminis- tering the drug. --Failure to obtain FDA approval to use 15 additional clinical investigators in various States. The Director, IND Staff, Bureau of Biologics, said that correspondence with the clinical investigator after the in- spection indicated that even oral patient consent for use of the investigational drug had not been obtained. The Director said FDA regulations require that deaths be reported immedi- ately only when-- in the opinion of the sponsor and clinical investigator-- the death is alarming and is attributed to the drug. (The regulations require that any alarming adverse effect which may reasonably be regarded as caused by, or prob- ably caused by, the new drug shall be reported immediately.) The Director added that, if the investigator does not believe death was caused by the drug, he or she can wait and note the death in the annual progress report without reporting the sur- rounding circumstances. In this case, however, the progress report was not submitted until the study was over 2 years old. !//I iI 1;; l//i The Director said the unapproved deviations from protocol were significant and could adversely affect patient safety. Sponsor/investigator D-- This r study used an experimental radioblologlcal nn 37 hosprtalized patients. According to the clinical investigator, the patients were, for the most part, mentally incompetent and averaged 69 years of age, The inspection revealed that the investigator failed to follow the protocol requirement for administering iodides to the patients, before injecting the radioactive drug, to prevent uptake of the drug by the thyroid gland. The investigator said the iodides were not administered because the patients were old, administration of the iodides causes general discomfort, and the patients were \"all demented and difficult to orally medicate.\" FDA said this failure to follow the protocol constituted a clear medical hazard to the patients' thyroid glands, Recent actions to improve monitoring As early as 1968 FDA recognized that data submitted by clinical investigators was frequently unreliable and that on- site inspections of the facilities and records were necessary to insure data reliability, Not until June 1974, however I did FDA develop what it termed a \"comprehensive plan for clinical investigation evaluation.\" According to FDA, the impetus behind developing the plan was \"the lack of a concrete strategy * * * especially during a time of close public and congressional scrutiny resulting from the identification of unethical and non-scientific investigational stud ies O I1 The plan consists of a number of subprograms intended to enhance FDA's monitoring efforts, including: --Standard setting to insure that regulations and guide- lines are adequate. --Education to insure that sponsors and investigators are aware of their responsibilities and of problems identified through FDA inspections. --Coordination to insure that the Bureau of Drugs and the Bureau of Biologics use resources most efficiently in their parallel monitoring activities. --Surveillance inspections based on representative sam- ples of sponsor5, investigators, and IRCs. 20 Although the plan appeared to be a step in the right direction, it had been only partially implemented. Inspec- tions of a random sample of cl inical investigators have been made under the surveillance program. However, because of higher priority projects the needed regulations and guide- lines had not been published for comment as of May 1976. Problems identified in the 1972 special survey and in the inspections we requested have not been published, although the inspections were completed in 1974. The two bureaus have not achieved adequate coordination. NEED FOR AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT -THELAW AND REGULATIONS FDA has not aggressively regulated clinical investiga- tions. Although inspections have revealed a wide range of deficiencies, FDA has not taken effective enforcement action to achieve correction. The FD&C Act and FDA regulations provide for adminis- trative and legal actions against those who violate require- ments. FDA has made only limited use of these enforcement act ions. Administrative actions include: --Sending an information letter advising a firm or person of violations of law and regulations. --Disqualifying clinical investigators from eligibility to receive investigational drugs if they repeatedly or deliberately violate the law or regulations. --Terminating a sponsor's IND exemption for various reasons. (See pp. 24 and 25.) The following legal actions may be initiated through the Department of Justice: --Prosecuting an individual under title 18 of the U.S. -- Code for submitting fraudulent data to the Government. --Enjoining an individual or firm from violating the FD&C Act and FDA regulations. --Seizing any drug product that is adulterated or mis- branded, or is a new drug without an IND, when intro- duced in to, or while in, interstate commerce. Information letters In 1973 the Bureau's Director, Scientific Investigations Staff, wanted to send letters pointing out deficiencies to 21 !I1 '.' !,, sponsors and clinical investigators who had been inspected under the 1972 Special Survey, The Director of the Bureau of Drugs, however, believed that sending the letters would be unfair because the inspections were part of a survey to gather information, not to determine noncompliance with the regulations. He also doubted the legality of the letters and refused to sign them until a legal determination was made, The HEW Assistant General Counsel, Food, Drugs, and Environmental Health Division, in his response to the Direc- tor's request for a iegai determination, stated: \"Contrary to your note of 10/23/73 attached to the file, I do not believe that the letter * * * is either harsh or an over-kill, Nor do I agree that it should be \"tempered' with equivocal statements, The investigators who receive letters like this are grown men. They must understand the impor- tance of the work they are doing, and the fact that the law imposes obligations upon them * * * I see no more reason to coddle the medical pro- fession than I do to coddle drug manufacturers or food warehouse owners. Where criticism is de- served, it should be set forth in a candid and honest manner.\" * * * * * \"The entire approach is sound from both a legal and a public policy standpoint,\" Subsequently, the Bureau of Drugs sent information letters to each of the 15 sponsors inspected as part of the 1972 special survey describing the deficiencies of the spon- sor's investigators. Although the letters emphasized that the deficiencies could have been minimized if not completely eliminated by careful and conscientious monitoring by the sponsorsl and the Bureau did not require the sponsors to respond inform FDA of corrective actions taken to improve their monitoring. Instead, the letters closed with: \"We request that you furnish us with any comments or proposals you may wish to offer on these subjects,\" Only 7 of the 15 sponsors responded. Three outlined procedures they had instituted as a result of FDA's inspections; three simply said that FDA's survey would help them improve their monitoring procedures; and one met with the Bureau of Drugs to outline its monitor- ing procedures, FDA also sent letters to each of the 155 clinical in- vestigators. About 40 whose work was found generally or completely satisfactory were sent courtesy letters: 14 whose 22 work was found unsatisfactory or violative of regulations were sent letters containing specific admonitions or warn- ings: and the remainder were sent a letter delineating specific areas needing improvement. Response to the letters from the investigators was sparse; most respondents rebutted, acknowledged, or questioned (or all three) the survey find- ings. Several indicated appreciation of the visit and pro- mised to correct deficiencies. Disqualification of the 7--- clinical invEE?Xjator The only administrative action specified in the FDA regulations directly applicable to clinical investigators is disqualification. If the Commissioner of FDA finds an inves- tigator has \"repeatedly\" or \"deliberately\" violated the regu- la t ions, he may declare the investigator ineligible to re- ceive investigational drugs--that is, he is disqualified from further participation in investigational drug studies. The Bureau of Drugs has disqualified 20 clinical inves- tigators since the Kefauver-Harris Amendments of 1962. Five were later reinstated when, in accordance with the regula- tions, they assured FDA that the problems would not reoccur. The Bureau of Biologics has disqualified 10 clinical inves- tigators, 5 of whom were later reinstated. The Bureau of Drugs disqualified the 20 investigators because they submitted false information, seriously deviated from the protocols, and/or violated other FDA regulations, The Bureau of Biologics disqualified the 10 investigators because they failed to submit progress reports. No inves- tigator has been disqualified for any of the many violations of the regulations disclosed by the inspections under the special survey or the inspections we requested. The Bureau of Biologics has made no disqualifications since 1971 and the Bureau of Drugs made none from 1970 through 1974. Although disqualifications had been recommended to the Director of the Bureau of Drugs during that period, he said he was not given evidence of repeated violations. The Bureau of Drugs has seldom inspected a clinical investigator more than once. The Director, Scientific Investigations Staff, who is responsible for the Bureau's monitoring efforts, said FDA has no policy or procedures for making routine followup inspections when violations are found. She said she had no reason to doubt that the investigators would take corrective actions. She added that the recent trend away from disqualifying clinical investigators reflects FDA's growing emphasis on education rather than enforcement. FDA hopes this emphasis 23 will stimul'ite sponsors and clinical investigators to voluntarily improve the conduct of clinical studies. Besides publishing the problems found during FDA's inspec- tion, the education effort includes giving each investiga- tor inspected in the future a copy of FDA requirements con- cerning clinical investigations, Educating sponsors and clinical investigators about their responsibilities is certainly needed and should result in improved drug studies and better protection of test sub- jects. tu'e do not believe, howeverp that investigators who fail to comply with the regulations can be excused on the basis of ignorance, Before being approved by FDA to conduct a clinical investigation, each investigator must submit a signed FDA Form 1572 or 1573 which specifies his responsi- bilities and certifies that he is aware of and accepts them. Moreover I the requirements are also published in the Code of Federal Regulations, and sponsors are responsible for select- ing only qualified clinical investigators, experts in their field, FDA officials told us that numerous problems hamper effective use of the disqualification sanction. Evidence of \"repeated\" or \"deliberate\" violations is difficult to obtain. FDA officials have variously interpreted the term \"repeatedly. \" According to FDA's Associate Chief Counsel for Drugs, the term means that the violation was found sev- eral times during a single inspection by FDA, The Director of the Bureau of Drugs said it meant that violations were found more than once in the lifetime of the clinical inves- t igator 6 The Director, Scientific Investigations Staff, said the meaning of the term is frequently debated because the regulation is hard to interpret. The Director of the Bureau of Drugs acknowledged that the policies and procedures for handling poor clinical in- vestigators need clarification and revision. He said present procedures are cumbersome and offer limited options--basically disqualification. Termination of the IND exemntion An effective but seldom used tool is the authority to terminate the IND exemption., Because termination directly affects the sponsor, the sponsor is stimulated to take action concerniqp the clinical investigator a The Commissioner of FDA may terminate an IND exemption if he finds --the sponsor has submitted false data or has omitted material information: 24 --inadequate support to conclude that clinical investigations can be initiated or continued with reasonable safety; --evidence that the drug is unsafe or ineffective for the purposes and in the manner in which it is offered for investigational use; --unsatisfactory manufacturing practices; --the plan for clinical investigations of the drug is not reasonable in whole or in part, or the investiga- tions are not conducted in accordance with the plan; --improper labeling or commercialization of the drug; --failure to submit progress reports at Least once a year; or --failure to report serious or potentially serious adverse reactions. Since June 30, 1971, FDA has terminated 12 INDs in the Bureau of Drugs and 9 in the Bureau of Biologics. The rea- sons cited most often were insufficient information upon which to evaluate safety and failure to submit progress reports. Legal sanctions Since the Kefauver-Harris Amendments of 1962, four cases have been referred to the Department of Justice, which pro- secuted two clinical investigators for submitting fraudulent data. CONCLUSIONS FDA has failed to adequately monitor clinical investiga- tions. It has placed primary responsibility on sponsors to monitor clinical investigations; however, its inspections have shown that sponsors have not adequately assumed this responsibility. FDA has made piecemeal attempts to monitor the activities of sponsors and clinical investigators, but coverage has generally been spotty and some areas have not been covered at all. The Bureau of Drugs never inspected sponsor/investigators, and the Bureau of Biologics had not inspected sponsors or investigators until we requested that some be inspected. As a result of inadequate monitoring of sponsors and clinical investigators, FDA lacks assurance that human test 25 I, subjects are adequately protected and that the data upon which marketing approval is based is accurate and reliable. We believe that noncompliance with pertinent laws and FDA regulations disclosed by recent FDA inspections is traceable in large measure to FDA's limited monitoring of sponsors and clinical investigators, FDA recognized the need for better monitoring as early as 1968 but waited nearly 7 years to develop a comprehensive monitoring plan. We believe this delay in the face of the recognized need clearly demonstrates FDA\"s lack of aggressive- ness in fulfilling its responsibilities in this important area. The plan appears to be a step in the right direction, but it has not been fully implemented; subprograms and vari- ous details have yet to be worked out. Improved monitoring efforts, however, must be coupled with improvements in FDA's enforcement program if lasting improvements are to be achieved in the levels of compliance e FDA's monitoring efforts primarily identify specific defi- ciencies. But monitoring does not insure compliance, For that, FDA needs an aggressive enforcement program to deal with violators and deter others, FDA's enforcement against sponsors and clinical investigators has frequently not been sufficiently aggressive to do this. Although we do not advocate disqualifying all clinical investigators found in violation or terminating INDs in each instance of sponsors 0 inadequate monitoring, greater use of all available enforcement tools is needed. The ample enforce- ment options available have not been fully used. Educating sponsors and investigators about their responsibilities is needed I but this should be coupled with more aggressive en- forcement of compliance with laws and FDA regulations. In addition to the problem of interpreting the terms, limiting disgualif ication to instances of \"repeated\" or \"de1 iberate\" violation of the regulations seems unnecessarily restrictive and hampers effective enforcement, The regula- tions should be revised to give FDA greater discretionary use of disqualification actions when regulations are violated. RECOMMENDATItiNS TO THE SECRETARY OF HEW We recommend that the Secretary direct the Commissioner of FDA to: --Give priority to implementing the comprehensive plan for monitoring and evaluating clinical investigations regulated by the Bureau of Drugs and the Bureau of Biologics. (See pe 20.) 26 --Better use enforcement actions to insure corrective action by sponsors and clinical investigators when violations are found. --Revise the regulations to give FDA greater discre- tionary use of disqualification actions when regula- tions are violated by deleting the requirement that an investigator must be found to have repeatedly or deliberately violated the regulations. AGENCY COPIMENTS AND OUR EVALUATIOK In commenting on a draft of this report (see app. VI), HEN did not dispute our findings but questioned whether the proposed remedies offered constructive and effective solu- tions to present conditions. HEW believed that some of the specific recommendations throughout the report did not pro- vide the most appropriate solution to the problem. However, HEW generally agreed that regulation of clinical investiga- tions needed strengthening. HEW's comments on specific rec- ommendations and our evaluation of them are presented in the appropriate chapters of the report. Implementation of monitorinq and evaluation plan HEW said that the plan referred to in our recommendation i was prepared in June 1974, t are still valid, and although its general concepts the implementation plan for most of the spe- cific steps is no longer accurate. HEW pointed out that FDA must carry out many complex, and sometimes competing respon- - sibilities in evaluating the safety and effectiveness of new drugs. Recognizing the limited resources available for these activities, HEW said emphasizing one aspect will diminish the effort that can be directed at other aspects of the regula- tion of investigational new drugs. According to HEW, in 1975 much of FDA's monitoring resources had been redeployed to examining certain sponsor 'preclinical test data, the reli- 7 ability of which had been questioned. HEW said that current I plans for the clinical investigation evaluation program re- flect these events but remain among FDA's highest priorities. Enforcement actions HEW said FDA believes that it is using available enforce- ment actions appropriately when violations are significant enough to warrant action and that changing the criteria for using enforcement actions is not likely to greatly affect the performance of clinical investigators. 27 !jl 'I! HEW fu'tther stated that: 11; \"* k * GAO j, t + assumes an adversarial relation- ship between FDA and the research community. The goals of science and medicine and of FDA regula- tion are the same: ethical researchl scientifi- cally valid and useful researchl research protect- ing and benefiting both the subjects and patients generally. Achieving these objectives requires both clear exposition of FDA policies to encourage understanding and compliance and judicious appli- cation of sanctions in those situations where clearly improper behavior is found. For the FDA to approach researchers as though their only in- centive to comply is threat of FDA action, how- ever, demeans the ethical and professional stand- ards of these persons and is unjustif ied by the evidence ti Moreover I a hostile FDA might produce a reluctance to cooperate with the Agency, or worse I a disincentive for research itself .I' HEW pointed out that the FDA Commissioner testified on July 10, 1975, during joint hearings by the Subcommittee on Health, Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, and the Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, that monitoring clinical investigators is the direct responsibility of IND sponsorsl who are responsible for the quality and accuracy of reports to FDA and for assuring that investigators are fulfilling their sci,entific and ethical commitments. HEW said that increasing FDA monitoring could signal to sponsors that FDA is replacing them in the direct supervision of investigators and thus reduce sponsor monitoring. FDA believes that improv- ing rather than replacing the sponsors' oversight of investi- gators is the key to an effective, efficient solution to the problem e Apart from specific actions against poor investigators, FDA believes that its single most helpful action will be to assure that sponsors meet their monitoring obligations. HEW said that regulations are being prepared which will define much more clearly the responsibilities of the sponsor with respect to monitoring investigations, According to HEW these proposed regulations will require the sponsor to (1) submit to FDA written procedures for moni- toring investigations, (2) assure that the investigator clearly understands his obligations before participation, (3) visit the investigator periodically to assure that pro- tocol is being adhered to, (4) receive written approval of the institutional review committee, where applicable, before 28 initiating the investigational study, and (5) maintain accurate accounting procedures and records. HEW said that, collectively, these requirements will oblige the sponsor to control investigator performance in many of the same areas in which our report recommends FDA directly oversee individ- ual investigators. HEW believes the approach of focusing on sponsors is superior because it places the legal responsibil- ity where it properly belongs, has a much more immediate ef- fect on all investigators, and enables FDA to verify the per- formance of all investigators while investing fewer resources. We recognize that sponsors are primarily responsible for monitoring their clinical investigators. However r some FDA inspection of clinical investigators is necessary to evaluate whether sponsors are adequately carrying out this responsibil- 8 i ity. Such FDA inspections are even more important when the clinical investigator is also the sponsor. The FDA inspec- tions conducted at our request showed that sponsor/investiga- tors violate requirements of the law and regulations about as much as clinical investigators. b i We believe that, because FDA is responsible for regulat- ing the research community that conducts investigations of the safety and efficacy of new drugs, it must sometimes as- sume an adversary role to enforce compliance with laws and regulations. Effective regulation of clinical investigations is important because FDA relies heavily on the data obtained from them in making decisions about the safety and efficacy of new drugs. Improperly conducted clinical investigations could produce false or misleading data about the drugs and expose test subjects to unnecessary risks. Aggressive en- forcement of law and regulations would not demean the ethical and professional 'standards of the research community; rather it would serve to reenforce those standards and provide addi- tional incentives for adherence to them. Moreover, we believe that increased FDA monitoring of clinical investigations, accompanied by effective enforce- ment action when violations are noted (see pp. 21 to 25) r would signal to sponsors that FDA was tightening its regula- tion of clinical investigators. This should in turn increase sponsor monitoring activities to insure compliance with FDA requirements. Although FDA believes that sponsors have primary respon- sibility for assuring that clinical investigators comply with FDA requirements, E'DA has not required sponsors to bring vio- lative investigators into compliance. For example, FDA's special survey completed in fiscal year 1974 showed that 115 (74 percent) of the 155 clinical investigators inspected failed to fully comply with the law or regulations and that 29 I, iI/ /Ii sponsors were not adequately monitoring their investigators. In his July 1975 testimony, the Commissioner stated that FDA notified the 115 investigators of the need to improve com- pliance with the regulations; some received severe admoni- tion or warning and the violations in some cases required followup inspections. According to the Commissioner, FDA advised the appropriate sponsors of the survey findings and invited their comments and proposals; most sponsors did not respond e FDA's action in these cases would not seem to im- pose any obligation on the sponsors to obtain investigator compliance fi FDA'S proposed regulations to more clearly define the sponsor's responsibility to monitor clinical investigators should f when issued I affect the monitoring of clinical in- vestigations, However, unless the new regulations are ag- gressively enforced I their effect is not likely to be much greater than that of the current regulations. Such enforce- ment is particularly important in view of the indications that sponsors have not adequately monitored investigators and I as the Commissioner testified in July 1975, sponsors \"appear loath\" to discuss IND fundamentals with expert clinicians. (See p* 15.) A first draft of FDA's proposed regulations was com- pleted in September 1974. As of May 1976 the regulations had not been published for public comment. Pending issuance of the new regulations, FDA should insure that sponsors carry out their responsibilities under the current regulations. Revision 2.f disqualification regulations HEW stated that FDA intends to revise the regulations regarding disqualification of investigators to improve the process by eliminating unnecessary procedures, by clarifying the criteria actually used by the agency, by establishing uniform handling of actions among bureaus, and by resolving certain legal problems that have been uncovered. HEW added that clarification of the obligations of investigators, together with new regulations regarding the sponsors' respon- sibility to monitor studies, compliance observed by FDA, should substantially increase CHAPTER 3 NEED TO INFORM HUMAN SUBJECTS PARTICIPATING IN NE'W DRUG TESTING FDA views informed consent as a principal means of protecting humans subjected to experimental use of new drugs. However, often the consent of test subjects is not obtained or they are not adequately informed of their participation in new drug te sting because FDA regulations --are not complied with by clinical investigators and --are confusing and subject to misinterpretation by FDA officials as well as sponsors and clinical investiga- tors. The FD&C Act explicitly requires that (1) any human beings participating in an experiment with a new drug be in- formed of such use and (2) their consent, or that of their representative, be obtained. The two exceptions to this rule are when (1) obtaining consent is not feasible or (2) in the doctor's professional judgment, obtaining consent would be contrary to the subject's best interests. In regulations implementing the FD&C Act, FDA has spe- cified that a test subject (or his representative) must have the legal capacity to give consent and be able to exercise free choice. The consenting test subject must be given a fair explanation of the procedures to be followed in carrying out the drug investigation, including --an identification of those which are experimental, --a description of the discomforts and risks involved, --a descr'iption of benefits that may occur, and --a disclosure of alternative therapy available. In addition, the form, should not contain exculpatory language through which the patient is made to waive or appear to waive any legal rights or to release the physician or the institution from liability for negligence should adverse ef- fects occur. Written consent of persons receiving an investigational new drug in phase I or phase II tests is required by FDA regu- lations. However, for phase III tests the regulations read 31 b'k vk 9' it is the responsibility of investigators, taking inta consideration the physical and mental state af the patient, to decide when it is neces- sary or preferable to obtain consent in other than written form. When such written consent is not obtained, the investigator must obtain oral con- sent and record that fact in the medical record of the person receiving the drug.\" When oral consent is obtained during phase III, the clinical investigator is required to indicate in the patient's record only that oral consent was obtained, He is not required to indicate what he told the patient about the investigational drug. FAILURE TO MEET CONSENT REQUIREMENTS --- - In 238 FDA inspections made since 1972, consent infor- mation was available on 172 clinical investigators and 52 sponsor/investigators. The inspections showed that many investigators failed to comply with FDA's requirements for informed consent. The number and percent of investigators . that failed to comply follows. (See apps. I, II, and III for more details.) Clinical investigators Number of investigators Number in noncompliance with FDA requirements Percent in noncompliance with FDA requirements Total 172 67 39' Bureau of Drugs --.- 153 54 35 Bureau of Biologics -- 19 13 68 Sponsor/inv,estigators Number of sponsor/ investigators Number in noncompliance with FDA requirements Percent in noncompliance with FDA requirements Bureau o,f Bureau of Total Drugs I_- Biologics - 52 34 18 26 \" 15 11 1'50 '44 61 Because failure rates of investigators subject to regu- lation by the Bureau of Drugs appeared much lower than those regulated by the Bureau of Biologics, we reexamined the 19 sponsor/investigator consent forms classified by the: Bureau of Drugs as being \"probably adequate\" or \"exemplary.\" Using Bureau of Drugs criteria, we found that 14 of the' 19 forms were deficient and misclassified. In 4 of the 14 cases, the clinical investigator failed to obtain informed , consent from some of his test subjects. And in the remain- ing 10 cases deficiencies in the forms included a failure to disclose the risks and benefits of the experimental drug and the alternative treatment available. Adjusting for these misclassifications, the Bureau of Drugs failure rate for sponsor/investigators increased from 44 to 85 percent. We did not review the consent forms of clinical investigators classified by the Bureau of Drugs to determine if similar misclassifications occurred. Violations disclosed by the inspections included failure to obtain consent, use of forms containing exculpatory lan- guage f and other deficiencies in the forms used. FDA's sum- mary of its inspection results identified the overall per- centage failing to comply with consent requirements but not the frequency of each type of violation. Examples of each type of violation follow. Failure to obtain informed consent Informed consent is a basic way the FD&C Act and FDA regulations assure that patients are protected. The require- ment of informed consent is intended to give test subjects a choice of whether they wish to participate in the new drug experiment and to provide information upon which to base such a choice. Yet these provisions are sometimes ,not met. --An experimental drug used to treat whipworms was ad- ministered to mentally retarded children having IQs of about 35. FDA's inspection showed consent was not obtained. The clinical investigator and the IRC decided that obtaining consent from parents or guardians was unnecessary because they had previously authorized the use of medical, surgical, or dental procedures necessary to the child's general health and well-being. Such authorization I however, did not cover use of experimental drugs and was to in- clude only. instances in which reasonable attempts to obtain the consent of parents or guardians was un- successful. No attempt to contact parents or guard- ians was made. -A radioactive drug was used in a study involving 37 elderly patients. The FDA inspector reported that written consent was not obtained because the sponsor/investigator was not aware of the require- ment. The sponsor/investigator said that most pa- tients used in his study were mentally incompetent, so the consent would have to have been obtained from a relative. He was not aware that this was permitted under E'DA regulations. 33 Deficiencies in C&Sent form 't ,/ When written consent was obtained, FDA found that the information given test subjects was often inadequate. As illustrated by the following example, some consent forms were very general ,and provided little information. The following is the wording of the complete form used to obtain the consent of 19 patients for testing a diagnostic drug t.o detect gallbladder problems that did not show up in X-ray or gastrointestinal studies. \"The nature of the drug [drug name] and its com- plications has been explained to me by [the doc- tar]. I unde'rstand this drug is not widely used at this time nor has it been officially approved by the Food and Drug Administration. 'I This form, rated by Bureau of Drugs as needing improve- ment r does not show that the drug is experimental a Neither does it meet FDA criteria for providing a fair explanation of the procedures to be followed; description of discomforts, risks, and benefits; and disclosure of alternative diagnostic t procedures available a Other forms obtained during FDA inspections were defi- cient in that they: --Repeated the basic elements of consent rather than using these elements as guidelines for providing a concrete description of what the drug is, why it is being given, the individual dose, the route, how often and for how 'long it will be given, the known hazards of it and the discomforts involved, what potential benefits may be gained, and what alterna- tive forms of therapy are available. ---Failed to give the subject a fair explanation of such pertinent information as what or how long additional tests ,or examinations would be required in connection with the use of the experimental drug, --Failed to inform the subject of the results of perti- nent animal and/or previous clinical studies with the drug to enable the subject to exercise free choice. --Failed to state what steps would be taken to prevent or minimize the possible risks and hazards associated with the drug. 34 --Failed to use simple language rather than medical terminology in explaining the details of the proposed study. --Failed to tell the subjects that some would serve as control subjects who would receive either a placebo substance or an alternative drug rather than the in- vestigational new drug under study. Consent forms containing exculpatory language Many consent forms contained exculpatory language in- tended to release everyone connected with the study from legal liability, even though this was contrary to FDA policy. Following are typical examples of the language used. The consent form used for inmates in a State prison read: 1'1 * * * hereby fully and forever release, acquit and discharge the * * * [State, State prison sys- tem, the prison] and all their agents, officers, and employees I the investigators for this project, and the * * * [research institution] together with their officers and employees, from any and all li- ability which may accrue on account of any and all claims or cause of action which in any way arise from my participation in a research project known as : * * *'I In a study to evaluate the tranquilizing effects of an experimental drug on patients with psychiatric disorders, the following consent form was used. RELEASE OF ALL CLAIMS - \"WHEREAS [patient's name] of * * *, is desirous of participation in the * * * Program conducted by research investigators of the * * * [clinic and/or * * * hospital] and has been advised with [sic] such investigators relative to such pro- gram: \"The undersigned consents to all facets of the * * * Program, and hereby holds harmless and re- leases from all liability * * * Hospital, all personnel of * * * Hospital, or any other hospi- tal facilities utilized, as well as the attend- ing physician, photographers, and all others connected with and/or participating in the con- duct of the above mentioned program, from all claims related to such Program.\" 35 And finally, in a study involving immunized blood donor volunteers, the following exculpatory language was included in the consent form, \"In consideration of the sum of $5.00 paid to me for my services as a donor, receipt of which is acknowledged, I agree to assume all of the direct and indirect risks involved, including personal injuries which I may sustain, and I RELEASE [name of corporation] its employees and the physician named above from all liability due to the injury or damage in connection with or resulting from this procedure. *' ,,I' CONFUSING AND MISINTERPRETED CONSENT REGULATIONS FDA regulations are in certain respects confusing and subject to misinterpretation; thus they have contributed, in part, to the deficiencies in the consent obtained. Elements of consent Commenting on the importance of consent in protecting test subjects, the Commissioner of FDA, in his testimony of February 5, 1973, before the Subcommittee on Monopoly, Senate Select Committee on Small Business, said: \"[The 1962 Amendments to the FD&C Act were] en- acted specifically to protect the public, in- cluding those people who may participate in drug investigations. \"The Act specifically provides that the investi- gator obtain the consent of such patients before they are included in any new drug investigation. The FDA has promulgated regulations which specify the substance of informed patient consent.\" Within FDA there are varying interpretations on whether the regulations \"specify the substance of informed patient consent. \" In 1974 HEW published regulations for the guidance of NIH grantees which provided new guidelines describing the elements of consent. Since then, when criticizing sponsors and clinical investigators for using consent forms that do not contain the basic elements of consent, the Bureau of Drugs has cited the HEW guidelines rather than FDA regula- tions because the elements of consent are more clearly described. 36 In addition to the four elements required by FDA regulations shown on page 31, the HEW guidelines require that persons obtaining consent include an offer to answer any questions about the procedures and a statement that the participant is free to withdraw from the study at any time. In its December 30, 1974, letter to a sponsor/investigator, the Bureau of Drugs stated: \"We would note that the patient consent form dated November 3, 1974, on your letterhead stationery * * *, needs improvement l We are enclosing a recent Federal Register reprint which delineates the necessary elements of consent. While these regulations apply only to [HEW] supported research, they reflect our position relative to the obtainment of consent in all drug research studies.\" The Bureau of Biologics also used the 1974 HEW guide- lines rather than FDA regulations to determine the adequacy - of consent forms obtained during inspections of clinical investigators. The Director, IND Staff, Bureau of Biologics, considered the FDA regulations on the substance of informed consent to be vague and unenforceable. On the basis of a Bureau of Biologics evaluation of in- spections made for us, the Director, IND Staff, stated that: \"The content and quality of the majority of pa- tient consent forms * * * were poor or incomplete. However; in the absence of having the essential elements of a patient consent form concretely stated in the regulations, it is not feasible to cite these deficiencies as deviations from the regulations.\" As a result, the Bureau of Biologics did not comment to the clinical investigators on the poor quality or incomplete content of consent forms. We questioned the position of the Director, IND Staff, that FDA regulations were vague about the basic elements of consent and requested him to reexamine FDA's regulations. Upon reexamination he found that four of the six basic ele- ments from the 1974 HEW guidelines were explicitly stated in FDA regulations. The Director said he had never before made a point-by-point comparison of FDA's consent regulations with BEW's basic elements. He said he was surprised and en- lightened to learn that such concrete elements were spelled out in FDA regulations. 37 As a result of the reexam'ination, the Bureau of Biologics sent letters to 20 clinical investigators and required them to revise their deficient consent forms to make them conform to FDA regulations. Submission of consent forms to FDA ---- The Bureau of Biologics and the Bureau of Drugs did not agree on FDA's authority to require sponsors to submit con- sent forms to be used during a clinical investigation for FDA review and approval. Since June 1972 the Bureau of Biologics has obtained con- sent forms as a part of the IND application. The IND Staff reviewed the forms and suggested improvements to the sponsors. The Bureau of Drugs, however, does not obtain consent forms at the time IND applications are approved. As a re- sult the Acting Deputy Director, Bureau of Drugs, stated \"We don't know what, in fact, patients are told err in the case of written consent, what they sign.\" The Director of the Bureau explained that the Bureau did not obtain consent forms because: \"It is not required in the regulations. If it were, we could do it across the board. Some reviewers on their own had been requesting them from the firms routinely. Firms were having troubles with their investigators over this, so they complained to us. Since this was discrimi- natory, I told the directors that if we wanted it done, we should change the regulations, Until then, the reviewers should abide by the regulations, unless there is a specific (non- routine) reason for requesting consent forms.\" Obtaining.oral consent In phase III tests -- Confusion also persists about whether FDA's regulations permit clinical investigators to routinely obtain oral con- sent during phase III testing. Although written consent is clearly required for phase I and II testing, the regulations (as cited on ppe 31 and 32) are not explicit for phase III. As a result, FDA officials as well as sponsors have made different interpretations. For example, the Acting Deputy Director, Bureau of Drugs, in a memorandum to the Director dated Novem- ber 30, 1972, stated: 38 \"Our own regulations require written consent except for unusual circumstances, however, there has been a widespread misinterpretation of these regulations by investigators and drug firms whereby they are obtaining written consent in Phases I and II and oral in Phase III.\" The Director, Bureau of Drugs, told us that written consent in phase III is preferable but not necessary. The Director, Scientific Investigations Staff, Bureau of Drugs, however, told us that oral consent may be obtained only in an exceptional case and FDA's regulations indicate written consent should be obtained as a rule during phase III. The Director, IND Staff, Bureau of Biologics, told us that he interprets FDA's regulations as recommending written consent during phase III but allowing oral consent if docu- mented in the patient's record. FDA officials said the regulations were deliberately made ambiguous when issued. When FDA issued its proposed regula- tions in 1966, it required written consent in phase III. How- ever, the Assistant to the Director for Regulatory Affairs, Bureau of Drugs, told us that this proposal caused a furor in the medical profession because doctors believed it would hinder drug research, So, when FDA issued the final regula- tion in 1967, it changed the wording of the requirement. Although FDA recognizes that obtaining informed patient consent is a principal means of protecting human test sub- jects and acknowledges that its consent regulations are am- biguous, it has not revised those regulations. CONCLUSIONS Patient consent, required by law and recognized by FDA as a principal means of protecting test subjects, has not always been obtained as required. FDA has not aggressively pursued its responsibility to insure that patient consent is obtained. As a result, many test subjects are inadequately informed of their participation in clinical investigations of new drugs. FDA% failure to take more aggressive steps to insure that informed consent if obtained is related, to some extent, to (1) inadequately defined elements of consent in FDA's regu- lations, (2) varying interpretations of FDA regulations re- garding the requirement for written versus oral consent dur- ing phase III studies, and (3) the differing views over FDA's right to routinely review consent .forms before studies begin. Also, as discussed in chapter 2, we believe problems in 39 obtaining consent are related to FDA's inadequate monitoring and enforcement of compliance with this requirement. To eliminate the misunderstanding regarding requirements for obtaining consent, we believe FDA should revise its regu- lations for obtaining consent so that FDA personnel, sponsorsI and clinical investigators will clearly understand what is required and FDA personnel can effectively and consistently enforce the requirements. Oral consent in phase III in some cases may be justi- fied. However I allowing oral consent as a rule in phase III diminishes FDA's ability to insure that proper consent is obtained because FDA has no way of knowing what the patient is told, We recognize that obtaining written consent does not guarantee truly informed consent. That depends on the test subjects' ability to understand and comprehend the nature of what they are consenting to, by the clinical investigator, as well as what they are told We believe, however, that re- quiring written consent as a rule in all phases of clinical investigations-- using a document that fully describes the pertinent study details-- will greatly increase the likelihood that truly informed consent is obtained. Also I requiring that consent forms be submitted for FDA review and approval would enhance FDA's ability to insure that the requirement to obtain consent serves its purpose of protecting human test subjects. RECOJ&END,ATIONS TO THE SECRETARY OF HEW _1_- We recommend that the Secretary direct the Commissioner of FDA to revise FDA regulations to: --Conform to the elements of consent contained in HEW gyl;del ines e --Clearly require that written consent be obtained as a rule in phase III trials of clinical investigations. Exceptions allowing oral consent in phase III trials should be permitted only after obtaining FDA approval. --Qequire the submission of consent forms for FDA review and approval before initiating the clinical investiga- tion m AGENCY CQMMENTS HEW said that, in the evolution of public awareness and concern for the protection of human subjects, FDA continues to review and upgrade its regulations in an attempt to provide .40 guidance in the negotiation of informed consent. HEW said that the concept of negotiating informed consent with a re- search subject has been evolving rapidly and believes that our recommendations focus on narrow aspects of the negotia- tion process. HEW explained that, when the FD&C Act estab- lished a requirement for informed consent in 1962, FDA issued its interpretations of how consent is to be obtained, based in part on its own experience and in part on expert advice. HEW noted that its 1974 regulations differed from FDA's most recent regulation (1967) with respect to elements of consent, documentation of consent, and prior approval of consent forms. HEW said that: \"Not all of these differences reflect simple policy decisions; the FD&C Act precludes manda- tory submission of reports by investigators to FDA; consent is not required in every situation; the cost of compliance with requirements is not necessarily paid out of HEW grant or contract funds. Nor is the merit of some of the differ- ent requirements established; for example, prior approval of consent forms may not be as cost- effective as clearly defined requirements for such forms. The HEW regulations do not, there- fore, represent definitive rules applicable to all situations, nor has any such code been yet devised. The National Commission for the Protec- tion of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behav- ioral Research is currently studying subject con- sent, particularly as it relates to persons in unique groups such as prisoners, the mentally disabled and children. The Commission is due to make recommendations to the Secretary of HEW early in 1977 .I' HEW does not assume that mechanical requirements will guarantee informed consent but does believe that meaningful standards can contribute toward that goal. Accordingly, HEW said FDA would propose new regulations dealing with the ele- ments of information essential for obtaining consent: whether oral consent is ever acceptable andp if so, under what cir- cumstances; and what consent forms must, and must not, contain, These regulations will consider the National Commission's evaluation of current HEW and FDA regulations, its recommen- dations for change, mental policies, the need for consistency in all depart- FDA's legislative authority, and the cost- effectiveness of administrative review of documents and pro- cedures to be used in individual studies to obtain informed consent. 41 CHAPTER 4 --- NEED TO STRENGTHEN INDEPENDENT w-m----. ------- THIRD-PARTY REVIEW -.--- In addition to informed patient consent, FDA considers an independent review of clinical investigations by an IRC as an important means of protecting human test subjects. Beginning in April 1971 FDA required the sponsor to assure that an IRC would oversee all investigational new drug studies conducted on persons confined to such institutions as hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, and homes for the mentally retarded. Because such persons may be more vulner- able to abuse or exploitation by research projects than the general population, FDA believes special protection for them is warranted. IRCs are intended to provide added safeguards for in- stitutionalized test subjects by insuring that the --rights and welfare of human subjects are protected, --methods used to obtain informed consent are adequate and appropriate I and --risks are outweighed by the potential benefits to the subjects or by the importance of the knowledge to be obtained. FDA regulations require that IRC members have varying backgrounds and be competent to judge the acceptability of a study. The IRC is responsible for --initially reviewing and approving the proposed clinical study; --conducting continuing reviews at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk but not exceeding a year; and --maintaining adequate documentation, which must be available to FDA upon request, on committee activities and on the information provided test subjects in ob- taining consent. FDA regulations state that, in addition to the sponsor's continuing responsibility to monitor the study, FDA will periodically investigate institutions to determine whether the IRCs are operating in accord with the sponsor's assurances. We found, however, that FDA made only a limited number of 42 IRC inspections. And the inspection results showed that the protection intended for institutionalized test subjects was not provided because IRCS were not adequately reviewing new drug studies. FDA LACKS INFORMATION ON IRCS FOR INSPECTI?% PLANNING --,-1 --------- FDA does not require sponsors or clinical investigators to furnish it with information identifying IRCs used in their clinical investigations. As a result, FDA does not have information on the number and locations of IRCs for planning IRC inspections, and FDA has inspected relatively few IRCs. As of October 1974, the Bureau of Drugs had inspected 25 IRCs since such inspections were first required in 1971. Accord- ing to the Bureau's Director, Scientific Investigations Staff, some IRCs reviewed were selected from a list furnished by medical officers in the Bureau. Others were inspected because of adverse publicity or in connection with an inspection of a clinical investigator under another inspection program. The Bureau of Biologics had never inspected an IRC and was not aware of the inspections provided for in the regula- tions. National Institutes of Health records show that about 540 institutions receiving NIH research grants have IRCs and, although others exist, FDA does not know how many. Without knowing the universe of IRCs, FDA cannot make an inspection effort that would insure representative coverage and enable it to evaluate overall IRC performance. During each of fiscal years 1976 and 1977, the Bureau of Drugs plans to inspect 24 IRCs. The Director said IRCs will be selected for inspection when they are identified under other inspection programs. Rather than leaving the identification and selection of IRCs to chance, FDA should develop and maintain a complete, current list of IRCs. In addition to providing the basic management data FDA needs to help fulfill its IRC regulatory responsibilities, the data base would permit the selection of random inspection samples. This would enable FDA to project its inspection findings to the universe of IRCs in evaluating IRC compliance while efficiently using its limited inspection resources. Developing a system for obtaining and maintaining an adequate data base for inspection sampling is especially important, considering FDA's plans to require IRC review 43 for studies involving noninstitutionalized patients, When the requirement for involvement of IRCs was published in 1471, FDA recognized that noninstitutionalized test subjects may be as much at risk as the institutionalized and should,. therefore, be given the same opportunity for the added pro- tection expected from independent third-party review. FDA is still considering IRCs for noninstitutionalized patients. Such a requirement, if adopted, would mean that all clinical investigations would be subject to 'IRC review. INDEPENDENT REVIEW BY IRCS INEFFECTIVE -- The Director of the Bureau of Drugs described the IRC's importance and FDA's reliance on it when he stated: \"The patients' first line of defense on ethical issues and the second line of defense on medical issues is the IRC. FDA's review of ItNDs is only a tertiary defense and should be directed mainly at only those things that IRCs aren't good at-- the design of protocols, the interpretation of animal data, and manufacturing controls data .'I Unfortunately, FDA inspections of IRCs disclosed numerous deficiencies in their performance, thus reduci'ng their ef- fectiveness in protecting test subjects. The 25 IRCs the Bureau of Drugs inspected were responsi- ble for reviewing studies in the following types of institu- tions. Prisons Mental institutions Children's hospitals University research centers Nur s ing home 11 8 3 2 1 - 22 - FDA had scheduled inspections at two other institutions--a nursing home and a county jail--but found that the IRCs had not been established as required. Of the 25 IRCs FDA inspected, no deficiencies were found in two cases involving children's hospitals. In the remaining 23 inspections, FDA found de- ficiencies as shown on the Lacked Failed to consent continuins maintain institution -----.-.- form .- review * records --- ,Pr isons Mental institutions University research centers Nur s ing home Children's hospital 4 6 6 3 1 2 0 0 0 0 0\" 1 1 1 - 13 b 9 S Z = Lacked varying back- ground 8 5 2 1 1 - 17 Z In addition, the inspection reports noted that IRCs in three prisons were paid for their services by the sponsor or clinical investigator. Failure to insure adequate consent forms used -1- To provide the special protection it believes is warranted p FDA requires IRCs to insure that the methods used to obtain informed consent of institutionalized persons are adequate and appropriate, This includes an IRC review of consent forms to insure that the form contains the elements of consent and does not contain exculpatory language. FDA found that 13 of 25 IRCs inspected had approved faulty consent forms. language was used. In 11 of the 13 cases, exculpatory In eight instances the form failed to advise test subjects that they were free to withdraw from the experiment at any time-- a point that seems important considering the potential for abuse and exploitation of in- stitutionalized test subjects. Failure to provide continuing review -- -- FDA requires IRCs to review the progress of drug studies at least annually-- and more frequently if the IRC determines the risks to test subjects warrant it--to insure the research is being conducted according to the IRC's understanding and recommendations. The clinical investigator is to give the IRC all information on the study necessary for the IRCls com- plete review. Also, the clinical investigator is to report to the IRC any emergent problems, serious adverse reactions, or proposed procedural changes that may affect the status 45 of the study, No procedural changes are to be made without IRC approval expect when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards. FDA found that 8 of the 25 IRCs inspected did not re- view the investigational drug study after initial approval. FDA'S inspection reports contained the following observations, --The IRC for one prison was not aware of FDA's regula- tions governing IRCs, It did not make a continuing review. --The IRC for another prison did not receive informa- tion on the results of ongoing or completed studies. The prison warden said his administrative assistant constantly monitored the study and would report any problems to him. The assistant was paid by the firm conducting the studies, a possible conflict-of- interest situation. --Another prison IRC never reviewed ongoing studies or final reports. The following examples illustrate the effects of IRC failure to review ongoing studies. In these examples, FDA inspected both an IRC and the clinical investigators the IRC was to monitor. IRC A -- In June 1974 FDA inspected IRC A, which was responsible for reviewing investigational drug testing at a State insti- tution for the mentally r'etarded. Children at the institu- tion were used in a study of an investigational drug for treating pinworms and whipworms. FDA found that the IRC had not assured itself that the clinical investigator obtained informed consent., Also, the IRC had no provision for reviewing studies during their ex- ecution and no policy to insure that a clinical investigator would report emergent problems or procedural changes in the study as required by FDA regulations. FDA's inspection of the clinical investigator showed that he had not complied with FDA requirements for informed consent, drug accountability, and reporting. In addition, the investigator deviated from the protocol and maintained only limited control over the study, with portions conducted by nurses in two separate units without his supervision. 46 IRC I3 -- In January 1974 i?DA responsed to a congressional inquiry to inspect the activities of IRC B, which was responsible for clinical investigations at a mental institution. During its inspection, FDA reviewed the IRC's actions on six investiga- tional drug studies and found that the IRC had failed to adequately review studies in general and had approved consent forms containing exculpatory language. Gne study involved a marketed drug that was being tested for use in the treatment of chronic brain syndrome--a condi- tion for which the drug was not approved for market., Test subjects were elderly patients having psychotic symptoms and/or other behavioral difficulties. FDA's review showed the study was su.bmitted to the IRC for review, but, contrary to FDA regulations, the IRC did not review it because the chair- man did not believe that a study involving a marketed drug required IRC approval. Consent forms had been obtained from patients who, according to FDA, were not capable of giving informed consent because of their diminished intellec- tual performance and low level of consciousness, Although the one patient death that occurred could not be established as drug related, FDA concluded that the use of the patient in the study appeared to have been ill advised because the patient was unable to communicate and had a his- tory of hemiplegia (paralysis of one side of the body) and fluctuations in blood pressure. Therefore, including the patient in the study seemed to provide little useful informa- tion and may have placed the subject at unnecessary risk, FDA inspectors were informed that this IRC was generally concerned only with patients' rights in the studies it re- viewed and that adverse reactions and deaths might not have been reported to it. In its letter to the institution, FDA pointed out that I'* * * If this is the case, we would draw your attention to the fact that continuing review is con- sidered to be an essential function of institutional review committees * * *.'I Failure to maintain records To provide a basis for evaluating IRC performance and compliance with FDA regulations, FDA requires that IRCs (1) record their recommendations concerning the clinical study, (2) document their discussions of substantive issues and how they were resolved, and (3) prepare reports on their ongoing reviews of the clinical investigation. FDA found that, of the 25 IRCs inspected, 5 k.ept no minutes of 47 II ,i, meetings, records I ii/ or documents and 4 kept records that were incomplete or extremely sketchy. IRC members lack diverse backgrounds --I-v- ---- IRCs must have not only broad competence to understand the nature of the study but also other competencies needed to judge its acceptability in terms of institutional regula- tions, relevant law, standards of professional practice, and community acceptance. Accordingly, FDA regulations state that IRCs must be composed of sufficient members of varying background, that is, lawyers, clergymen,. or laymen as well as scientists, to insure complete and adequate re- view of the research project. As shown belowl 17 of the 25 IRCs inspected did not include persons from one or more of the backgrounds mentioned by FDA regulations. Composition of IRCs Inspected --.

The inspection reports stated that 3 of the 25 IRCs inspected received payment for their services from the sponsor or clinical investigator. At one prison the clinical investigator paid the IRC chairman $4,000 and each member of the committee $2,000 per year. At two other pri- sons IRC members were paid an unspecified amount by the sponsor or investigator. FDA regulations do not prohibit such payments. FDA's inspections do not show that the payments in- f luenced the IRCs I performance. The inspection results show, however, that the IRCs did not comply with FDA re- quirements. For example, in the case in which the IRC chairman received $4,000 and each member $2,000 per year, the IRC approved an inadequate consent form and failed to make a continuing review of the study. The IRCs whose members were paid an unspecified amount by the sponsors or investigator approved an inadequate consent form, did not review the study as it progressed, and failed to maintain any records of its activities. FDA's Associate Chief Counsel for Drugs said that the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research has contracted for a study of IRCs and that at the conclusion of the study FDA will con- sider the need for regulations dealing with several issues concerning IRCs, including whether IRC members may be paid and, if so, by whom. CONCLUSIONS FDA considers independent. third-party review an important safeguard for protecting the health, safety, and welfare of institutionalized test subjects--those often incapable of protecting themselves. Although FDA in its regulations stated its intent to inspect IRCs periodically, it does not know how many IRCs exist or where they are located. Without such information, FDA is unable to pursue an effective inspection program that would insure representative coverage and enable it to evaluate overall IRC performance, FDA should require sponsors to provide information on the IRCs that are used in clinical in- vestigations so that it can develop and maintain a complete list of IRCs. 49 FDA inspections of a lim'!ted number cf IRCs indicate that IRCs are not fulfilling their responsibilities and that FDA should strengthen its regulation of IRCs, Because the FDA inspections revealed many deficiencies by IRCS, we believe the sponsor should be required to submit information on the IRC's composition and a signed statement from the IRC indicating its awareness of and willingness to fulfill its responsibility. Such a requirement would better assure FDA that a properly constituted IRC would monitor the study. RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE SECRETARY OF HEW We recommend that the Secretary direct the Commissioner of FDA to: --Require sponsors to furnish information on the IRC composition and location, --Develop and maintain a list of IRCs, their location, and their composition. --Require sponsors to submit to FDA a signed statement from the IRC indicating its awareness of and willing- ness to fulfill its responsibility as an IRC. --Emphasize to FDA bureaus the importance of the require- ment for periodically inspecting IRCs. AGENCY COMMENTS HEW stated that the new regulations it intends to issue will require the sponsor to assure that investigators submit proposed protocols to the IRC and that the IRC has approved the protocols, The sponsor will also be required to assure that committee composition is in accordance with established guidelines and that the committee will be responsible for continuing review and approval of the investigational new drug study, HEW added that the forms for reporting this information have been revised and will be in use shortly. Accordingly, HEW pointed out that FDA will be routinely receiving information on the IRC composition. Compiling the information into a centralized list, howeverl would not be very useful to the agency given the current level of monitor- ing resources. The information that is received on IRCs will become a permanent part of the IND files and will therefore be readily available for use in planning, directing, and making inspections of IRCs. 50 With regard to periodic inspections of IRCs, HEW said that such a periodic inspection program cannot be created by simply emphasizing the need for these inspections. HEW noted that the underlying problem is one of limited resources in the. face of competing priorities. According to HEW, although FDA plans to inspect a limited number of IRCs to the extent that resources permit, additional inspections of IRCs would be made at the expense of clinical investigator and sponsor inspect ions. This trade-off, HEW said, must be carefully considered in light of anticipated benefits. To help FDA strengthen its monitoring activities, on April 22, 1976, the President asked the Congress for an additional $16.3 million in a fiscal year 1977 budget amend- ment to increase efforts in certain FDA program areas, includ- ing monitoring preclinical and clinical testing of new drug products. The additional funding, if provided, should permit FDA to increase its IRC inspections with less impact on its other inspection activities. 51 , /I I/! I' CHAPTER 5 NEED FOR CLARIFYING FDA'S AUTHORITY OVER CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS --- --- SPONSORED BY FEDERAL AGENCIES -uII Clinical investigations are sponsored by Federal agen- cies as well as drug firms and private physicians. At the time of our field workp the primary Federal drug sponsors were the Department of Defense (DOD) and NIH. DOD was spon- sor ing 53 clinical investigations, and NIH was sponsoring 222, A question exists as to whether FDA's authority to regulate clinical investigations of experimental drugs under the FD&C Act extends to such investigations sponsored by other Federal agencies q Section 505(a) of the FD&C Act generally prohibits a person from introducing into interstate commerce any new drug without FDA approval. A \"person\" is defined in sec- tion 201(e) of the act as an \"individual, partnership, cor- . poration, and associationN and does not specifically in- clude Federal agencies and departments, Section 505(i) authorizes experimentation with investi- gational drugs without the approval required under section 505(a) and empowers FDA to issue regulations prescribing the conditions under which the IND exemption will be granted. Section 505( i) and the regulations issued pursuant to it also apply only to persons, and since the term \"person\" as defined in the act does not specifically include Federal agencies or departments I experimentation with investigational drugs by Federal agencies and departments may not be subject to FDA regulation under section 505(i), FDA had not inspected clinical investigations sponsored by DOD or NIH until we requested that it inspect some. The inspections showed generally the same types of deficiencies as were found in FDA inspections of non-federally-sponsored studies. (See ch. 2.) Also, in some cases, FDA waived re- quirements of its regulations, Fur then: I the Bureau of Bio- logics did not attempt to regulate federally sponsored in- vestigations because it did not believe the FD&C Act provided regulatory authority over other Federal agencies. DOD-SPONSORED CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS In 1962 the medical departments of the DOD services (particularly the Army) became concerned that tighter FDA 52 control resulting from the 1562 Kefauver-Harris Amendments would impede the search for new drugs needed for the Na- tion's defense. DOD believed it had unique medical re- sponsibilities affecting the Nation's security and that the Commissioner of FDA had no background in evaluating the po- tential military value of a drug as compared with the de- gree of risk involved in clinical trials. DOD thus believed it could exercise better control over clinical investigations it sponsored. In 1964 HEW and DOD entered into an agreement, made formal by a memorandum of understanding, on the use of in- vestigational drugs. Essentially, DOD was not required to file a formal IND application for clinical investigations classif ied for reasons of national security. The proposed tests for such classified studies were to be reviewed and approved by a DOD review board and surgeon general. The re- view boards were to insure adequate protection of human sub- jects through competent review of the research protocols by qualified professionals. All classified testing was to be discussed periodically with FDA personnel having security clearances. DOD classified drua tests An official of the Office of the Surgeon General of the Army told us that since the 1464 agreement the Army had not conducted any classified clinical investigations of 'new drugs. However, as a result of the Rockefeller Commission's investi- gation of Central Intelligence Agency activities, it was dis- closed that the Department of the Army had conducted secret drug tests using LSD and other hallucinogens. These tests were conducted at Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland, and elsewhere. The House Armed Services Subcommittee on Investigations held hearings on the secret drug tests. Also, joint hear- ings were held by the Subcommittee on Health of the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee and the Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Because of these investigations we did not pur- sue the matter further. However, the testimony showed that many of the FDA regulations for protecting patients were not followed in the secret tests. Test subjects in some cases were not told they were being given the drug until after it was administered, and continuing adverse effects resulted from the drugs. The FDA Commissioner testified that FDA's regulation and surveillance of these classified tests was minimal. Although the 1964 memorandum of understanding called for 53 HEW and DOD to periodically meet to discuss classified tests, during the first 10 years of the understanding only four such meetings were held 0 Of these I only twol according to the Commissioner p provided any exchange of significant information on test results, Thus r FDA did not exercise surveillance over the classified tests and DOD, as indicated by testimony before congressional subcommittees, did not observe FDA's regulations for patient protection. The HEW and DOD memorandum of understanding was revised in 1974, (See app. IV.) It still exempts from FDA regula- tion those clinical investigations classified for reasons of national security, The only change in this regard is that DOD is required to discuss its classified investigations with FDA personnel having security clearance on a \"frequent\" basis, whereas the original agreement required only \"periodic\" dis- cussions. The agreement does not specify the need to obtain consent from test subjects. However, the DOD appropriation acts for fiscal years 1973, 1974, 1575, and 1976 impose such a requirement (Public Laws 92-570 I 93-238, 93-437, and 94-212). DOD unclassified drug tests For unclassified drug studies, the 1964 agreement speci- fied that DOD would submit to FDA an IND application consist- ing of copies of (1) the request for approval submitted to the DOD review board, (2) the review board's evaluation and approval, and (3) the DOD surgeon general's approval. These submissions were sometimes much briefer and less specific than normal filings and did not contain the clinical investi- gator's signed assurance that he or she understood his or her responsibilities as specified in FDA regulations. FDA was to handle such submissions in the same way as any other IND application. According to the revised agreement, unclassified clinical investigations would be subject to all new drug regulations and normal IND filing requirements. Because FDA had never inspected DOD-sponsored clinical investigations, in 1974 we asked FDA to inspect six Army- sponsored L/ clinical investigations being conducted in five locations, About 1,175 test subjects participated in the 6 studies. FDA made inspections at -- L/Neither the Navy nor the Air Force had active IND exemp- tions at the time of our review. However, FDA officials stated that, although their experience with the other services as sponsors was very limited, it was \"less satis- factory\" than with the Army. 54 --the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medi- cine, Natick, Massachusetts, which was testing drugs; --the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Fort Detrick, Maryland, which was testing vaccines; --Fort Ord, California, a combat training center which was testing vaccines on recruits; --Stateville Penitentiary, Joliet, Illinois, where an Army contractor was testing antimalarial drugs on prisoners; and --Walter Reed General Hospital, Washington, D.C., which was testing an investigational radiopharmaceutical. The inspection results show that conformance with FDA regulations ranged from good to very poor and was generally similar to conformance by civilian clinical investigators. Nonconformance with FDA regulations included: --Inadequate drug accountability (four locations). --Failure to report protocol changes of varying degrees of significance, such as a new coinvestigator, not using a control group for part of a study, starting phase II with a dosage 100 percent higher than speci- f ied in the protocol, use of 50 percent greater radio- activity than specified, and use of children as sub- jects when not specified (four locations). --Beginning and completing tests before submitting the IND application to FDA (two locations). --Failure to report change in the drug source (one loca- tion). --Failure to submit progress reports to FDA when required (three locations). --Investigator's participation on the local institutional review committee-- he voted for approval of his study (one location). --Failure to note in patient's records that oral consent was obtained (one location). --Failure to obtain consent (one location). 55 Routine use 'of investigationai! drugs by DOD -- The military services have routinely used four experimen- tal drugs --three vaccines and an antimalarial drug that has an approved new drug application for treatment of leprosy but not for malaria. Routine use refers to administering an unapproved drug or vaccine --usually on a large scale--as if it were not an experimental drug but as if FDA had approved it for marketing. (The informed consent of the recipient is not obtained 0 j FDA was aware of such routine use but did not object to the Army or the other services. The drugs were routinely administered to over 2 million servicemen. FDA was not kept advised of DOD's experiences with the drugs. Adenovirus type 4 and type 7 --These are major causes of -- acute respiratory disease, a problem at basic combat train- ing centers, The Army sponsored development of three vac- cines against these adenoviruses, and on February 2, 1970, the Surgeon General of the Army authorized routine use of these vaccines, The vaccines were tested on about 10,000 recruits at basic training centers, and the Army estimated that as of May 1974 the vaccine had been routinely administered to from 500,000 to 750,000 recruits. Such use was continuing. On December 8, 1970, Army and Bureau of Biologics (then the Division of Biologics Standards, NIH) personnel infor- mally met to discuss the potential problem of vaccine sup- pliers balking at supplying unlicensed vaccines for routine use and to agree on recordkeeping and reporting requirements, since the Army no longer considered the vaccines investiga- tional. Army personnel agreed to develop a policy pertaining to their recordkeeping and reporting practices and to advise the Bureau of their plan, Neither the Army nor FDA could find evidence that this had been done. Representatives of both agencies conjecture that a plan was never developed. Dapsone --In June 1966, after clinical investigations with Dapsone (an approved drug for the treatment of leprosy) involving about 2,550 test subjects indicated it to be an effective antimalarial drug, the Surgeon General of the Army requested approval of the FDA Commissioner to use Dapsone routinely. The use was intended for combat forces and ancillary personnel in sections of Vietnam where malaria strains resistant to the existing antimalarial drugs were present, The Commissioner replied that, in the absence of more data on the toxicity of Dapsone to man, such a request would not be approved had it come from civilian quarters. He said, however, that FDA would not object if the Surgeon General con- sidered the use of Dapsone to be in the interest of national security. Essentially, the Commissioner's only requirement was that FDA be sent pertinent reports on the use of the drug. Dapsone was given to about 1,600,OOO people as an anti- malarial under this special authorization. However, the Army did not keep FDA currently advised of new developments in the use of Dapsone. The first progress report was not submitted until October 1968, over 2 years after the routine was began and after FDA notif ied the Army that a report was due. Army records show the report consisted of a reprint of a 2-year-old article on the use of Dapsone written by an Army doctor. Nothing more was submitted until February 1970, despite the Army's identification early in 1969 of two potential ad- verse reactions to Dapsone. One was the possibility that the drug could impair the judgment of combat forces or diminish their physical stamina. The other reaction (agranulocytosis, affecting the blood and mucus membranes.) resulted in the deaths of 8 of 16 soldiers during the first 10 months of 1969, The FDA medical officer responsible for monitoring the Dapsone study said the Army took all the necessary precautions--except promptly notifying FDA --when it noticed the adverse reactions. Although the Army was aware of the problem as early as May 1969, it did not advise FDA until February 17, 1970. The Army later determined that Dapsone did not signifi- cantly affect the judgment and stamina of combat forces, ex- cept in such unusual situations as high-altitude flight in unpressurized compartments. The eight deaths associated with the drug were thought possibly to have been related to decom- position of the Dapsone before administration. The Army sub- sequently destroyed some of its old Dapsone supplies and altered the method of shipping Dapsone to minimize the threat of this problem. The Army submitted its next progress report on the use of Dapsone in August 1972, 2-l/2 years later, despite two letters from FDA reminding the Army a report was overdue. From August 1972 until June 1974, no reports were submitted to FDA, despite a \"reminder letter\" in November 1973. The June 1974 report stated that, since the U.S. military in- volvement in Southeast Asia had ended, the Army Investiga- tional Drug Review Board had withdrawn its approval for the use of Dapsone in routine malaria prophylaxis and recommended that all supplies of Dapsone be suspended from military is- sue and use. 57 FDA officials said no spe'cial safeguards or special procedures were established for monitoring DOD's use of Dap- sone a FDA medical officers responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Dapsone IND exemption were not advised that the Army had been given special authorization to use Dapsone routinely, Therefore, the FDA personnel who were to receive the pertinent data from the Army were not aware of its signif- icance or the importance of receiving it in a timely manner. In fact, the FDA medical officer responsible for the Dapsone IND exemption since 1971 was not aware of the special authori- zation until we discussed it with him in June 1974. The memorandum of understanding as revised in October 1974 stipulates that when the unique requirements of the military dictate the extensive use in military personnel of drugs not yet approved by FDA, ad hoc review and approval of such use will be carried out jointly by DOD and FDA represen- tat ives . NIH-SPONSORED CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS At our requestl FDA inspected five clinical investiga- tors of NIH-sponsored drugs. It made two investigations at the NIH campus, Bethesda, Maryland, and the others in Arizona, California, and Massachusetts. Twenty-five test subjects were involved in these studies. Although the inspection results indicate consent was ob- tained from test subjects, the forms used in three of the five studies were general and did not contain all four ele- ments required by FDA for informed consent. (See pa 31,) Two of these forms were standard NIH consent forms. The inspections also revealed the following types of noncompliance with FDA's new drug regulations: --Inadequate drug accountability (three locations), --Continued administration of the drug after the study was formally discontinued (one location). --Unreported protocol changes of varying degrees of significance, such as failure to perform all speci- fied preliminary laboratory tests and use of a child as a subject when only adults were specified (two locations). --Drugs administered before submitting an IND applica- tian to FDA (one location). 58 --Shipment of the drug to a coinvestigator without prop- erly labeling it as an investigational drug (one loca- tion). In a letter to one of the investigators, FDA expressed concern that he continued to administer the drug after discon- tinuation of the IND and that he informed the patients to \"stop taking the pills and throw away the bottle\" when they got an attack --negating all efforts at drug accountability. The letter referred to the deficiencies as being \"in direct opposition to our Investigational Drug Regulation.\" FDA REGULATION OR SELF-REGULATION OF FEDERAL SPONSORS FDA's Associate Commissioner for Medical Affairs cited the following as valid reasons for FDA regulation of Federal agencies' clinical investigations of new drugs. --FDA has the guidance of an existing act, the FD&C Act. --FDA has issued implementing regulations. --FDA has an established organization to perform the regulation. These would have to be established by the Federal agencies if they are made self-regulating. Further: --FDA has organizational independence. --Subjects of drug experiments conducted by Federal agen- cies should receive the same protection as subjects of drug experiments conducted by private sponsors. --Data derived from Federal agencies' drug experiments 'may be important to the public. --FDA may have knowledge from other experiments on the same or related substances that may affect the ap- propriateness of the proposed study or otherwise af- fect (positively or negatively) the study, and this information may not otherwise be available to the sponsor. According to the Associate Commissioner, FDA is not capable of evaluating the military benefits of the use of a drug as a weapon and therefore would not be able to make complete risk-benefit evaluations in such cases. /,!I CONCLUSIONS 1,: The question of the applicability of the FD&C Act to Federal agencies and departments is extremely important and needs to be clarified by the Congress because it affects not only drugs regulated by FDA but also other products covered by the act. In clarifying its intent regarding the regulation of Federal sponsorsp the Congress should consider whether it wishes the test subjects in federally sponsored investigations to receive the same protection as partici- pants in non-Federal studies-- through independent review and FDA enforcement of the requirements and safeguards of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations and through FDA's drug knowledge and experience accumulated over many years, RECOMMENDATION TO THE CONGRESS We recommend that the Congress resolve the question of the applicability of the FD&C Act to Federal agencies and departments by clarifying its intent regarding the regulation of federally sponsored clinical investigations of new drugs. RECOMMENDATION TO THE SECRETARY OF HEW Pending resolution by the Congress of the question of the applicability of the FD&C Act to Federal agencies, we recom- mend that the Secretary direct the Commissioner of FDA, pursuant to the memorandum of understanding with DOD, to include the clinical investigations sponsored by DOD in its comprehensive plan f'or monitoring and evaluating clinical investigations, as recommended in chapter 2. AGENCY COMMENTS DOD concurred in our conclusions and recommendations pertaining directly to it. (See app. V.1 HEW said that, in many respects, the recommendation to the Secretary poses the same dilemma as the recommendation in chapter 4 concerning the periodic inspection of IRCs. Inspections of DOD-sponsored clinical investigations can only be accomplished at the expense of other monitoring acti- vities. However, FDA will devote some coverage to DOD- sponsored investigations in the future, although the level of coverage will be influenced by overall program consider? ations. 60 CHAPTER 6 IMPROVED COORDINATION NEEDED BETWEEN BUREAU OF DRUGS AND BUREAU OF BIOLOGICS Clinical investigations regulated by the Bureau of Drugs ' and the Bureau of Biologics are subject to the same safe- guards and requirements of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations and frequently involve the same sponsors and investigators. Although these commonalities exist; we found little coordi- nation between the two bureaus, thus hampering FDA's regula- tory efforts. NEED TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION ' ONINVESTIGATORS, sPoNsoRs, AND IRCS The Bureau of Drugs and the Bureau of Biologics have not routinely exchanged information on their monitoring activi- ties. The monitoring efforts of one bureau could profit from the experience of the other. The inspection findings on in- dividual clinical investigators, sponsors, and IRCs should be brought to the attention of the other bureau because the same sponsors, investigators, and IRCs might be subject to regulation by both bureaus. Also, overall trends, weaknesses, or conclusions identified or reached by one bureau should be shared with the other so each can make appropriate adjustments to its monitoring efforts. No mechanism exists, however, to insure such exchange of information. For example, the bureaus had not routinely ex- changed information on the inspections discussed in chapter 2. Further, the Bureau of Biologics had disqualified 10 cl,inical investigators, the last in 1971. The Bureau of Drugs, how- ever, was not informed of the disqualifications and accepted one as a clinical investigator after he had been disqualified by the Bureau of Biologics. The Bureau of Drugs had dis- qualified 16 investigators from 1964 through 1970 but did not inform the Bureau of Biologics until 1973. The Bureau of Drugs disqualified four investigators during 1975 but had not notified the Bureau of Biologics as of January 14, 1976. The Director, Office of Compliance, Bureau of Biologics, acknowledged that a need exists to establish a liaison to in- sure that the bureaus exchange information. An official of the Scientific Investigations Staff, Bureau of Drugs, agreed, stating that the two bureaus' paths had not crossed much in the past. A contributing factor may be that the Bureau of Biologics did not join FDA until July 1, 1972. However, there has been little or no coordination since then. The Director, IND Staff, Bureau of Biologics, said he had only superficial knowledge of the Bureau of Drugs' activities. 6l. NEED TO COORDINATE 1NSPECTiOIj;J ACTIVITIES pe__II.--- ----- - -- The two bureaus had not coordinated the inspection coverage to eliminate duplication and insure efficient use of FDA'S resources in their parallel monitoring. Al though the Bureau of Drugs' comprehensive plan discussed on page 20 is supposed to provide for coordination of inspection cover- age, that is one of the parts of the plan that has not yet been fully implemented. According to an official of the Scientific Investigations Staff, that section of the plan has been delayed pending development of guidelines for sponsors ' monitoring efforts. The data on both bureaus' IND exemptions should be computerized. In addition to inspection coverage I the two bureaus have not adequately coordinated the development of their inspect ion programs 0 The Bureau of Drugs, which has had more inspection experience than the Bureau of Biologics, revised its inspection program in 1975 to reflect lessons learned in prior inspections., However, the Bureau of Drugs has not given the Bureau of Biologics the benefit of its exper ience e The official developing the first inspection program for the Bureau of Biologics said he tried in vain in January, April, July, and October 1974 to obtain information from the Bureau of Drugs on its efforts to develop an inspection pro- gram. He characterized the responses as vague with an ap- parent reluctance to be specific and said he got the impres- sion little progress was being ,made. In December 1974 he was again unsuccessful in obtaining the information, The Bureau of Drugs began making inspections under its new program only a few months later. When the Bureau of Biologics finally completed its in- spection program, the Bureau of Drugs official said it was too bad the Bureau of Biologics had patterned its program after the Bureau of Drugs old program. He said experience had shown a number of weaknesses needing correction. The Bureau of Biologics official said it was too late to change the program and that it would be used beginning in about December 1975, The Director, IND Staff, Bureau of Biologics, said the bureaus had little or no coordination since the Bureau of Biologics joined FDA. He said 'that until our review he was not aware of the availability of FDA inspectors. Lack ing this knowledge, he had no inspections made because he lacked suf f ic ient manpower e Both he and the Director of the Bureau agreed that the inspection activities of the Bureau of Drugs and the Bureau of Biologics should be coordinated. 62 NEED FOR MORE UNIFORM TREATMENT OF -- .---.I---I--~..-- SPONSORS AND CLINICAL INVESTIGATORS -1_11 The two bureaus differ in the requirements they impose on sponsors and clinical investigators for obtaining oral consent in phase III trials. The Bureau of Drugs is satis- fied if the investigator notes in the patient records that oral consent was obtained. The Bureau of Biologics, how- ever, after reviewing the results of the inspections we re- quested, decided to ask sponsors to submit--when oral consent is to be obtained--(l) an explanation from the investigator of why he or she has decided that it is necessary or preferable to obtain other than written consent and (2) a written copy of the statements that will be made to obtain oral consent. For written consent (see p. 38), the Bureau of Biologics requests that sponsors submit consent forms for FDA review: the Bureau of Drugs does not. The two bureaus also differ in their use of the dis- qualification procedure. The regulations specify that a clinical investigator may be disqualified from eligibility to conduct further drug studies if he repeatedly or deli- berately fails to comply with provisions of the regulations. While the Bureau of Drugs reserves disqualification for severe violations, the Bureau of Biologics has used disqualification most often as a means of forcing clinical investigators to submit overdue progress reports or other data. Upon sub- mission of the required information, the Bureau of Biologics reinstates the investigator. CONCLUSIONS 1 The Bureau of Drugs' and Bureau of Biologics' monitoring and control of clinical investigations have not been ade- quately coordinated. Since the same laws and regulations apply to INDs regulated by both bureaus--and often the same sponsors and investigators are involved--coordination is important. As a minimum, results of all inspections and ac- tions taken with regard to sponsors, IRCs, and investigators should be exchanged routinely; inspection coverage should be coordinated; and sponsors, IRCs, and investigators should be treated uniformly with regard to written and oral consent and the circumstances justifying disqualification. A focal point should be established to insure the bureaus' efforts are ade- quately coordinated. RECOMMENDATION TO THE SECRETARY OF HEW B - tie recommend that the Secretary direct the Commissioner of FDA to establish a focal point to insure coordination of 63 ii ,! ,/jk 'I /Ii the clinical investigation i'nspection and regulatory activities of the Bureau of Drugs and the Bureau of Bio- logics e AGENCY COMMENTS /I) HEW stated that it recognizes the need for close co- ordination between the clinical investigation activities of the Bureau of Drugs and the Bureau of Biologics. HEW ex- plained that the clinical investigation activities of the two bureaus also must be fully responsive to the needs, priorities, and requirements of their respective IND review processes and that therefore differences in operating pro- cedures are sometimes appropriate. HEW said, however I in the day-to-day operation of the clinical investigation activities of the two bureaus, ex- change of information about matters of mutual concern is obviously needed. Although HEW does not see a need for a formal focal goint, it said the two bureaus will identify the sponsorsI IRCs, and investigators of mutual interest and exchange relevant information. Furthermore, the two bureaus will coordinate in developing new regulations and inspection programsP CHAPTER 7 SCOPE OF REVIEW We evaluated FDA activities and plans for regulating the testing of new drugs in humans and reviewed agency policies and procedures, legislation, and regulations. We also interviewed agency personnel. Our review was made at FDA headauarters in Rockville,' Maryland, and FDA's Bureau of Biologics and Bureau of Drugs in Bethesda and Rockville, Maryland. We also visited the Department of the Army in Washington, D.C., and NIH in Bethesda. We reviewed the results of FDA's inspections of sponsors,, clinical investigators, and institutional review committees. To give us information on a segment of the universe not previously inspected, FDA inspected, at our request, 23 sponsor/investigators and 25 clinical investigators who were testing new biological products and 35 sponsor/investigators who were testing new drug products. We also reviewed FDA's efforts to enforce compliance with the clinical investigation requirements of the FD&C Act and regulations. 65 APPElNDIX I APPENDIX I FDA'S EVALUATION OF ADEQUACY OF CONSENT --- OBTAINED BY COMMERCIAL CLINICAL INVESTIGATORS II- __I- -- REGULATED BY BUREAU OF DRUGS Category Clinical investigators - Number inspected where information on consent was obtained Rated \"satisfactory\" (when oral consent was obtained, it was properly recorded in pa- tient records) Rated \" improvement needed\" (included incomplete records of written consent or defective written consent form such as use of exculpatory language) Rated \"unsatisfactory\" (there was no notation in patient records to substantiate oral consent) Rated \"violative\" (patient consent was not obtained from some or all test subjects) Failure rate (percent that did not obtain con- sent, document that oral consent was obtained ,. or use a written con- sent form that had all elements of consent specified) 153 c 99 47 4 3 - 54 - 35 APPENDIX II APPENDIX II FDA'S EVALUATION OF ADEQUACY OF CONSENT FORMS USED BY SPONSOR/INVESTIGATORS REGULATER BY BUREAU OF DRUGS Category Sponsor/investigator Number inspected where infor- mation on consent forms was obtained Rated \"exemplary\" (all six elements present as set forth in HEW guidelines) Rated \"probably adequate\" (forms which depend primarily on oral presentation) Rated \"need for improvement\" (one or more elements missing) Rated \"unacceptable\" (consent form included exculpatory language or failed to give balanced presentation of possible adverse effects and benefits) Failure rate (percent that did not have all essential elements of consent and/or contained exculpatory language) - -- 34 i 13 6 a/19 -- 8 7 - 15 - 44 a/Not adjusted for the misclassifications found by GAO and discussed on pp. 32 and 33. 67 APPhNDIX '%I .I Ii/ : III FDA'S -EVALUATION CONSENT --_I_ BY CLINICAL ----- INVESTIGATORS- (note inical Sponsor/ Category Total investigators investigators Number inspected where information on consent was obtained 37 19 18 .ZZ I Z Rated \"exemplary\" (all elements present) 5 0 5 3 - - Rated \"adequate\" (one of four essen- tial elements missing) 6 3 3 Rated '1 improvement needed\" (two or more of essentiz@ ele- ments 12 4 8 Rated '!uqacGeptable\" langwge 1 6 6 mended, elements (not inc$uded in \"failure rates\" below) 8 6 - - 32 19 - 0 2 - 13 -- Failure rafe (percen.t that did not have alj. essential. elements of consent and/or C@atained exculpatory language) 65 . ,.a \"~,, 68 61 a/The Bureau of Biologics used as its criteria for rating consent forms the four essential elements of consent explicitly required by 21 C.F,R. 310.102(h). 68 APPENDIX IV APPENDIX IV MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTAP!DI~(G BETWEEN THE FOOD.

Purpose: To establish the procedures .to be followed by the Department of Defense and the food and Drug Administration regarding the investiga- tional use of drugs by the Department of Defense. This Ikmorandun of Understanding, when signed by representatives of the agencies, replaces the current Memorandum. of Understanding signed in 1964. * Backgro,und . * -- . . l Section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amehded by Section 104 of P.L. 87-781, 76 Stat. 784; 21 U.S.C. 5 355(a). (1970) established procedures for the approval required before a nev! drug can be introduced into interstate cornlcrce. Section 505(i) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 355(i)) establishes exemptions from the approval procedures for drugs krhich will be.used only for manufacture of other drugs or for investigational purposes.

D.C. 20201 April 141 1976 Mr. Gregory J. Ahart Director, Manpower and Welfare Division United States Genera; Accounting Office Washington, D.C. 20548 Dear Mr. Ahart: The Secretary asked that I respond to your request for our comments on your draft report entitled, \"Federal Control of New Drug Testing is not Adequately Protecting Human Test Subjects and the General Public.\" The enclosed comments represent the tentative position of the Depart- ment and are subject to reevaluation when the final version of this report is received. We appreciate the opportunity to'comment on this draft report before its publication. Sincerely yours, $'I i ;go;L, Q;$v.; .i,. i, As&stint. Secretary, Comptroller .., Enclosure 74 APPENDIX VI APPENDIX VI DEPARTMENT COMMENTS TO GAO DRAFT REPORT ENTITLED, \"FEDERAL CONTROL OF NEW DCUG TESTING IS NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECZING WUMAN TEST SUBJECTS AND THE GENZRAT., PUBLIC\" GENERAL COMMENTS: Questions concerning the use of human subjects in the investigation of drugs are complex and they have been the subject of continuing public controversy. For this reason, the Department welcomes any study which contributes to a better public understanding ->f the issues involved. Much of the material in the draft report was I-liscussed extensively at the joint hearing by the Subcommittee on Health of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, and the Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs presented his analysis and conclusions of the inspection results in July, 1975; and in January 1976, repre- sentatives of the General Accounting Office reported the findings in this report regarding FDA's inspections of clinical investigations. Since these positions are a matter of record, our comments at this point are directed primarily at the manner in which the report analyzes the issues and the appropriateness of the proposed recommendations. Generally, we believe the report would benefit from a more extensive discussion of the underlying issues and a more thorough consideration of the way in which the proposed recommendations are likely to remedy the problems characterized in the report. This would not only improve the informative value of the report, but we beli.eve it might alter the conclusions with respect to priorities and overall strategy. The report bases its conclusions and recommendations principally on the GAO's interpretation of results of FDA inspec ions of clinical investi- ga tors . The underlying legal, medical, ethic:!1 and social issues related to protection of human research subjects, howpver, deserve a thorough consideration before recommendations for chanr:e are proposed. Failure to discuss such issues has obscured very real and complex problems in this area, as well as the evolving nature of Lhe factors involved. In fact, societal standards and expectations regarding the adequacy of sub- ject protection have undergone considerable growth since the 1962 Drug Amendments. As the Commissioner of Food and ifrugs expliiined in his testimony, FDA has reptlatedly revised its reglAlations d:' the need for additional controls has been recognized and tile agency ;inticipates con- tinued changes in the future. This evolutionary process means, however, that any examination which applies current wisdom retroactively, without consitltaring the dynamics of the process, may propose changes which are already inadequate for ! uture needs. 75 APPENDIX VI APPENDIX VI \".nny issues involving protection of subjects znd quality assurance of sci2niific data have been examined in a variety of studies and forums iR recent years. For example, in 1972 the National Academy of Sciences/ :iational Research Council studied the issues involved in the monitoring of clinical investigations. This study explored a number of issues of direct relevance to this report including the responsibilities of the spo~!~ors for the conduct of clinical trials, the extent to which sponsors should monitor on-going institutionai reviews of drugs, and the FDA role in mofiitori& of clinical invest-Lgators, In addition, the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjecf:s of Biomedical and 32havioral Research was established by an act of Congress to study matters such as patient consent to participat,on in research, institu- tional review procedures, guidelines for selection of human subjects, and a study of the ethical, social and legal implications of advances in biomedical research. In February 1975, the National Academy of Sciences conducted a public forum on ftExperiments and &esearch &<th Humans: Values in Conflict.\" We believe the GAO repor-, should either discuss the inde- pendent studies of issues rrlllated to patient ijrotection such as those mentioned above, or include its own assessmenL of the factors which these groups considered, An adequate treatment of these issues will substan- tially enhance the depth and perspective of the report and probably improve the quality of the recommendations. In evaluating the safety and effectiveness of new drugs, the Food and Drug Admfnistration must carry out a number o? complex, and sometimes competing, responsibilities. The Agency must ensure that preclinical c data are sufficient to warrant testing in hurn;Ans, that all data are reliable, that important new drugs are made available as quickly as possible but not before safety and effectiveness are clearly established, that design of clinical trials are adequate to justify exposure of human subjects, and that the risk to experimental s objects is minimized. Rec- ognizing the limited resources available for hese activities, an emphasis on any one area 'will have an impact on the level of effort that can be directed at other aspects of the regulation 0.1 Investigational New Drugs. During the past year, for example, a consider<ible portion of FDA's mon- itoring z\"esources have been devoted to the examination of certain animal test data where the reliability has been subject ty question. The report shduld consider the implications of its recommendations on these related responsibilities, and the extent to which difficult trade-offs will be necessitated. Another problem'with the GAO approach is that it assumes an adversarial r?iat ionship between FDA and the research community. The goals of science and medicine'and of FDA regulation are the same: ethical research, scientIfically valid and useful research, research protecting and benefiting ~10th rhe subjects and patients generally. Achieving these objectives re- q&i*cs bt>th clear exposition of FDb policies 'LO encourage understanding 76 APPENDIX VI and compliance and judicious application of sanctions in those situations where clearly improper behavior is found. For the FDA to approach researchers as though their only incentive to comply is threat of FDA action, however, demeans the ethical and professional standards of these persons and is unjustified by the evidence. Moreover, a hostile FDA might produce a reluctance to cooperate with the Agency, or worse, a disincentive for research itself. While the preceding perspectives would have been helpful at the outset of the draft report, their absence is most critically apparent in the development of recommendations. The vast preponderance of the report analyzes the FDA inspection results, and in general the transition from the findings into recommendations is accomplished with a minimal discus- sion of strategies, alternatives, policy analysis, management or resource considerations. The central purpose of our comments is not to take issue with the findings, but to examine whether the proposed remedies offer constructive and effective solutions to present conditions. There is no apparent long-term strategy underLying the GAO recommendations. The report claims its recommendations will enable FDA to improve its monitoring efforts, to achieve better regulatory control over clinical investigators, and, if supported by aggressive FDA enforcement, to compel compliance with FDA regulations through the deterrent force of legal sanctions. We cannot share this enthusiasm. Existing resources allow FDA to inspect only one investigator in a hundred each year. Thus, the vast majority of clinical investigators will be unaffected by the GAO recommendations for many years. The GAO recommendations might actually aggravate present conditions. An increase in FDA monitoring activity could signal sponsors that FDA is replacing them in the direct supervision of investigators, and thus reduce sponsor monitoring activities. FDA believes that improving rather than replacing the sponsor's oversight of investigators is the key to an rffecti.vcJ, eff cient solution to the over- all problem. As the Commissionlar of Food and Drugs testified in July 1975, \" * * * FDA cannot directly police this system, which involves policing physicians and other scientists throughout the conduct of their professional work, with any reasonably attainable staff. !' -Ir * * The monitoring of clinic,ll investigators is the direct responsibility of IND sponsorsI the drug manufacturers, who are rt?sponsible for the quality and ;Iocuracy of reports to FDA and for assuring that investigators are fulfilling their scientific rind ethical commitments. 77 APPENDIX VI APPENDIX VI \" * * * Through our survey activities between 1970 and the present, we have gained a far better appreciation of the important interaction between sponsor and investigator. Apart from specific actions against poor investigators, I believe the single most helpful. effort we can make will be in assuring that sponsors meet their monitoring obligations. Regulations are being prepared which will define much more clearly the responsibilities of the spo:rsor with respect to monitoring investigations. * * * \" These proposed regulations will require the sponsor to (1) submit to FDA written procedures for monitoring investgations, (2) assure that the investigator clearly understands his obl:Lgations prior to partici- pation, (3) conduct periodic visits to the investigator to assure that protocol is being adhered to, (4) receive written approval of the in- stitutional review committee, where applicable, before initiation of the investigational study, and (5) maintain accurate accounting procedures and records, Collectively, these requiremenx will oblige the sponsor to control investigator performance in many of the same matters where the report resommends FD& directly oversee individual inwestigators. We believe the approach of focusing on sponsors is a superior one in several respect6, 1~ places the legal responsibility where it properly belongs, hao a much more immediate effect on all investigators, and enables FDA to verify the performance of all investigators with significantly less re- source inveitment. Our comments on specific recommendations reflect the FDA overall strategy. GAO RECO~NDATION : _ __ That the Secretary, HEW, direct the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to give priority to implementing the comprehensive p an for monitoring and evalu- ating clinical investigations regulated by the Bureau of Drugs and the Bureau of B$al,ogics. DEPARTMENT COl@@XF: - _ The plan to which this recommendation refers was prepared in .June 1974, and althnu& its general concepts are still valid, the implementation plan for mqs& of the specific steps is no longer accurate. In 1975, questions about the reliability of preclinical data caused substantial rf?deployment of inspectional resources. Prepnrai ~:.)n of many of the documents bias also been affected by subsequent events. Current plans for the c-liniral investigation evaluation program reflect these events and remain Limong FDA's highest priorities. 78 APPENDIX VI APPENDIX VI GAO RECOMMENDATION: That the Secretary, HEW, direct the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to make better use of enforcement actions , especially the regulatory letter, to assure corrective action is taken when violations are found. DEPARTMENT COMMENT: [See GAO note, p. 83.1 Gen- erally, FDA believes it is making appropriate use or avallabie enforcement actions in instances where violations are significant enough to warrant action and as our general comments indicated, we do nor believe that changes in the criteria for the use of present enforcement actions are likely to have a widespread or significant impact on the performance of clinical investigators. FDA's forthcoming regulations regarding specific sponsor responsibilities will have a more significant impact on reducing the likelihood of violations by individual clinical investigators. GAO RECOMMENDATION: That the Secretary, HEW, direct the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to revise the regulations to provide FDA greater discretionary use of dis- qualification actions when regulations are violated. DEPARTMENT COMMENT: As noted in the comment to the preceding recorrmendation, FDA believes it is making appropriate use of present enforcement mechanisms. The Agency intends to revise the regulations regarding disqualification of investi- gators to improve the process by eliminating unnecessary procedures, by - clarifying the criteria actually used by the Agency, by establfshing uniform handling of actions among Bureaus, and by resolving certain legal problems that have been uncovered in practice. But these changes will in all probability not produce a sharp increase in the number of investigators being disqualified. Clarification of the obligations of investigators, together with new regulations regarding the sponsor's responsibility to monitor studies, should substantially raise the level of compliance observed by the FDA. 79 APPENDIX VI APPENDIX VI GAO RECOMMENDATION: That the Secretary, HEW, direct the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to: --revise FDA regulations to conform to the elements of consent contained in the HEW guidelines. --clearly require that written consent be obtained as a rule in Phase III trials of clinical investigations. Exceptions allowing oral consent in Phase III trials should only be permitted after obtaining FDA approval. --require the submission of consent forms for FDA review and approval prior to initiating the clinical investigation. DEPARTMENT COMMENT: These recommendations focus on narrow aspects of the process of negotiating informed consent with a research subject. The concept itself has been evolving at great speed. Prior to the Drug Amendment of 1962, no statutes or regulations existed regarding consent of subjects in research. Section 505 (i) of the Act established a novel requirement with little guidance as to what was intended; since then FDA has issued its own interpretations of how consent is to be obtained, based in part on its own experience and in part on the advice of other experts. For example, the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) contains an international statement on what elements of information are essential to the process of negotiating subject consent. The HEW regulations of 1974 differed from FDA's most recent regulation (1967) in several respects: elements of consent; documentation of consent; prior approval of consent forms. Not all of these differences reflect simple policy decisions; the FD&C Act precluc 2s mandatory submission of reports by investigators to FDA; consent is r,>t required in every situation; the cost of compliance with requirements is not necessarily paid out of HEW grant or contract funds. Nor is the merit of some of the different re- quirements established; for example, prior approval of consent forms may not be as cost-effective as clearly defined requirements for such forms. The HEW regulations do not, therefore, represent definitive rules applic- able to all situations, nor has any such code been yet devised, The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research is currently studying subject consent, particularly as it relates to persons in unique groups such as prisoners, the mentally disabled and children. The Commission is due to make recommendations to the Secretary of HEW early in 1977. In the evolution of public :Iwareness and concern for the protection of human subjects, FDA continues to review and upgrade its regulations in an :litempt to provide guidance in the negotiation of informed consent. The 80 APPENDIX VI APPENDIX VI Agency does not assume that mechanical requirements will guarantee informed consent, but believes that meaningful standards can contribute toward that goal. The FDA will propose new regulations dealing with the elements of information essential for obtaining'consent, whether oral consent is ever acceptable and, if so, under what circumstances, and what consent forms must, and must not, contain. These regulations will consider the National Commission's evaluation of current HEW and FDA regulations, its recommendations for change, the need for consistency in all Departmental policies, FDA's legislative authority, and the cost-effectiveness of administrative review of documents and procedures to he utilized in individual studies to obtain informed consent. GAO RECOMMENDATION : That the Secretary, HEW, direct the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to require sponsors to furnish information on the IRC composition and lo- cation and submit a signed statement from the IRC indicating its awareness and willingness to fulfill its responsibility as an IRC. DEPARTMENT COMMENT: The new regulations discussed in the general comments will require the sponsor to assure that investigators submit proposed protocols to the IRC and that the IRC has approved the protocols. The sponsor will also be required to assure that committee composition is in accordance with established guidelines and that the committee will be responsible for continuing review and approval of the investigational new drug study. The forms for reporting this information have been revised and will be in use shortly. GAO RECOMMENDATION: That the Secretary, HEW, direct the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to develop and maintain a listing of IRC's, their location and their com- postion., DEPARTMENT COMMENT: As indicated in the comments on the previous recommendation, FDA will be routinely receiving information on the PRC composition. Compilation of the information into a centralized listing, however, would not be sig- nificantly useful to the Agency given the current level of monitoring resources. The information that is received on IHC's will become a permanent part of the IND files, and therefore will be readily available for use in planning, directing, and conducting inspections of IRC's. 81 APPENDIX VI APPENDIX VI GAO RECOMHENDATION: That the Secretary, HEW, direct the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to emphasize to FDA bureaus the importance of the requirement for period- ically inspecting IRC's. DEPARTMENT COMMENT : A periodic inspection program for IRC's cannot be created by simply emphasizing the need for these inspections. The underlying problem is one of limited resources in the face of competing priorities. While FDA plans to inspect a limited number of IRC's to the extent that current resources permit, additional inspections of IRC's would be conducted at the expense of clinical investigator and sponsor inspections. This trade- off must be carefully considered in light of anticipated benefits. GAO RECOMMENDATION: That the Secretary, HEW, direct the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to include the clinical investigations sponsored.by DOD in FDA's comprehen- sive plan for monitoring and evaluating clir;ical investigations, pursuant to the 1970 MOU with DOD. DEPARTMENT COMMENT: In many respects, this recommendation poses the same dilemma as the preceding one. Inspections of DOD sponsored clinical investigations can only be accomplished at the expense of other monitoring activities. Given the limited inspectional resources available to this program, the essential question is whether DOD sponsored investigaLions warrant the same, greater, or lesser coverage than other clinical inve:,tigations. Since they comprise such a small number of the total IND's, a significant coverage of this group would require a substantially disproportionate, commitment of re- sources. According to GAO's own statistics, there were only 53 DOD spon- sored investigations among the total of about 4,400 active IND's. Since FDA can only examine about 1 percent a year, a proportional commitment to DOD sponsored investigations would call for just one inspection per year. We do not beiieve that this is the intent of this recommendation. Lnstead) it implies a more extensive coverage for this group, but the report does not provide sufficient justification for concentrating on this group at the expense of coverage (rf other investigators. FDA wi 11 devote some - coverage to DOD sponsared investigations in the future, although the level of coverage will be influenced by overall program considerations. GAO KECOMMENDATION : - ---___- That the Secretary, Hl:W, dirclct the Commissioner, FDA, to establish a focal point to assijre coorditlativn of t!le clinical investigatit)n inspection and regulatory act ivit ies cli the Bureau of Drugs: and the Bureau of Kiol<?lgics. 82 APPENDIX VI APPENDIX VI DEPARTMENT COMMENT: The Department recognizes the need for close coordination between the clinical investigation activities of the Bureau of Drugs and the Bureau of Biologics. With regard to overall policy and management considera- tions, the Agency presently has various mechanisms to coordinate the activities of the bureaus. In their respective areas of responsibility, the General Counsel, the Associate Commissioner for Compliance, the Associate Commissioner for Medical Affairs, as well as othersShave over- sight roles in assuring that FDA policies are properly implemented. As the general comments noted, the clinical investigation activities of the two bureaus also must be fully responsive to the needs, priorities and requirements of their respective IND review processes, and therefore differences in operating procedures are sometimes appropriate. In the day to day operation of the clinical investigation activities of the two bureaus, there is an obvious need for the exchange of information about matters of mutual concern. Although GAO concludes that all in- spections and actions taken with regard to s;)onsors, IRC's and investi- gators should be exchanged routinely, we do not believe the degree of congruence is sufficient to justify a total rxchange of data. Instead, the two bureaus will identify the sponsors, IRC's and investigators of mutual interest and exchange relevant information, Furthermore, the two bureaus will coordirlate in developing new reF,ulations and inspection programs. We believe these steps obviate a formal focal point. GAO note: Deleted comments pertain to material contained in the draft report but not included in the final re- port. 83 APPENDIX VII APPENDIX VII PRINCIPAL HEW AND DOD OFFICIALS ----yI--I' -I- RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING ACTIVITIES I_I_--------.--_c-----.. -- DISCUSSED IN THIS REPORT .--- ----I_ Tenure of office -.------- Fr0lt-i TO SECRETARY OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE: David Mathews Caspar W.
