We then rest in the openhearted awareness that includes this ever changing creative flow of aliveness. We close with a prayer of loving kindness (a special meditation from the archives). No matter how often the mind drifts, all that really matters is the quality of heart in the way you come back... to come back with interest and friendliness to this moment, then you plant those seeds for whatever else arises.
