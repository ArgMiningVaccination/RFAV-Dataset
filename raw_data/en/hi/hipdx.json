John A. Zahm, C.S.C., provincial of the American Province of the Congregation of Holy Cross, a Catholic religious community that shared hisbelief in the importance of education. In 1902, Archbishop Christie asked theCongr egation to assume control of the University. For the next 65 years Holy Cross was solely responsible for the University's operation. In1967, as a means of ecumenical outreach and to involve lay people in the governance of the University, Holy Cross transferred control to a board of re-gents, but continued its commitment to offer the University the service of itsmembers. As a result, the University of Portland is Oregon's Catholic university,governed by an independent board of regents composed of men and women ofvarious religious denominations, with Holy Cross priests and brothers as mem-bers of its faculty, staff, and administration. The Univ ersity places superb teaching as both its fir st virtue and a centr al tenet of its mission. The five colleges of the campus \u2014 the College of Arts and Sciences, the Pamplin School of Business Administration, and the Schools ofEducation, Engineering, and Nur sing \u2014offer an education that str esses br oad liberal arts learning, the development of personal skills, and the opening of the mind, the heart, and the soul. Ranked by U.S. News & World Report magazine as one of the ten best regional universities in the West, the University offers some1,300 courses, 38 undergraduate programs of study, and 12 graduate degrees. The University is situated on a bluff near the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia riv ersin one of the large metropolitan areas of the West. Located in a r esidential section of the city of P ortland, the 130-acr ecampus offers lawns, hundreds of trees, and beautiful buildings in a quiet, peaceful setting, which is conduciv etothe learning pr ocess .Proximity to the river has suggested nautical names for the University's athletic teams, the Pilots, and the student publica- tions, The Beacon and The Log.

The Curriculum Core Curriculum Beginning with the rise of universities in Paris and Bologna in the T welfth Century, the Catholic intellectual tradition has beenrooted in r easoned inquiry that cr osses scholarly disciplines to engage and inform each of them. This tradition creates aframework in which great questions facinghumankind can and should be addressed. This undergraduate program was crafted toeducate students so that they will make6 GENERAL INFORMATION contributions to the world guided by con- cerns for issues of justice and ethical be-havior. The core curriculum will offercourses to help students: [1]develop the foundational knowledge and skills necessary for informed inquiry, decision making, and communication; [2]develop the knowledge, skills, and com- mitment for acting ethically in everyday life; [3]learn to use and value the lenses of different disciplines, and seek the connec- tions among them; [4]examine faith, its place in one's own life, and in the lives of others; [5]critically examine the ideas and tradi- tions of western civilization; [6]learn to live and contribute in a diverse society and interdependent world; and [7]value the importance of learning and reflection throughout one's life. Fundamental Questions The faculty of the University of Portland fashions this core curriculum because we believe that learning originates in seekingansw erstoimport ant life questions .Learn- ing springs from active inquiry conducted through different intellectual disciplines,each with its own tools, methods, and mea-sures.Learning is ongoing and integr ates various perspectives. University of Portland students learn how various disciplines usetheir differ ent lenses t ostudy the same uni- verse and all its experience. As a communi- ty of scholar s,faculty and students approach key questions about life by gathering and as - sessing evidence about them: we explore cultures of the past and present for their an-swers; weexamine the natural world and universe for data about them; we study reli- gious traditions and practices, philosophies,literature and other arts, and ourselves for answers. Through this process, we know that good questions lead to more questions. AsaCatholic university, these funda- mental questions, threaded throughoutstudents' years here, must engage us all: IWho am I? Who am I becoming? Why am Ihere? IHow does the world work? How could the world work better? IHow do r elationships and communities function? What is the value of difference? IWhat is the role of beauty, imagination, and feeling in life?IWho or what is God? How can one relate to God? IWhat is a good life? What can we do about injustice and suffering? Lenses for Examining the Questions In creating this core curriculum, the faculty has been guided by the University of Port-land's place in the history of Catholic high- er education and by its contemporary mis- sion. Therefore, the faculty requires thatstudents use these courses as the lensesthrough which to begin their study of thefundamental life questions introduced bythe core curriculum. Hrs. Area Hrs.

Academic Regulations The following articles set forth the rules and regulations of the University whereby thedeans administer the academic affairs of therespective college and schools under the co- ordinating direction of the provost. All stu- dents, including those who participate in in-tercollegiate athletics, are responsible forknowledge of these regulations and will begoverned by them. I. Code of Academic Integrity Academic integrity is openness and hon- esty in all scholarly endeav ors.The Uni - versity of Portland is a scholarly communi- ty dedicated to the discovery, investiga-tion, and dissemination of truth, and t othe development of the whole person. Mem- bership in this community is a privilege,requiring each person to practice academ-ic integrity at its highest lev el, while e x- pecting and promoting the same in others. Breaches of academic integrity will not be tolerated and will be addressed by the community with all due gravity. The University of Portland defines acade- mic integrity as \"openness and honesty inall scholarly endeavors.\" This standard is tobe upheld by faculty, students, administra-tion, and st aff to the extent that their roles in the University involve or influence scholarly activities ,both on and off campus . The Univ ersity e xpects each f aculty mem - ber and each student t oengage in and pro- mote scholarship in such a way that peers and experts will recognize his or her work as a scholarly undertaking, thorough and consistent with regard to the standards of one's discipline, appropriately cautious andself-critical, and cogniz ant and r espectful of the contributions of others, including differ- ing or opposing points of view. The University's interest in maintaining compliance with this standard is groundedin nothing less than its identity as a schol-arly community in the R oman CatholicGENERAL INFORMATION 15 tradition. As a Roman Catholic institution of higher learning, the University seeks toprovide an educational opportunity for itsstudents within a Judeo-Christian contextthat promotes respect, honesty, and fair-ness in service to God and neighbor. In the words of its mission, the University is com- mitted to providing \"an environment thatfosters development of the whole person,\"including the moral and ethical self, and to promoting \"a concern with issues of justice and ethical behavior\" that is \"central to thedaily life of the University.\" As a scholarly community, the Universi- ty believes that it is vital to the academicprocess, as well as desirable in itself, tomaintain an environment in which ideas,accomplishments, and information can beexchanged freely and creatively withoutmisgivings as to the honesty and opennessof one' scolleagues .Beyond this, the Uni- versity's stature and reputation as a schol- arly community depend on the quality ofits research and pedagogy, as well as its ability to certify its achievements in these areas. In conferring credentials, recogniz-ing competencies ,andawarding degr ees, honors, promotions, and distinctions to students, faculty, and other associates ofthe University, it is imperative that theUniv ersity hav efull confidence that all concerned parties hav econducted them- selves in accordance with its standard of academic integrity. In line with this, the University holds that a consistent, activ ecommitment t oits standar dof academic integrity not only benefits all members of the University community, but also is the responsibilityof each and ev ery member ,without e xcep- tion. Thus, each person who participates in the mission of the Univ ersity of Port- land and shares its privileges is account- able t othe Univ ersity not only for his or her own actions with regard to the stan- dard of academic integrity, but also for theactions of groups of which he or she is apart. Furthermore, each person is respon-sible for encouraging academic integrity inother sby means of dir ect communication and personal example, for discouragingbreaches of academic integrity, for con-fronting per sons who commit br eaches , and for reporting breaches to the appropri-ate authorities.II. Course Registration [A]The dates for registration of students in both semesters and summer session are set forth in the University calendar con- tained in this Bulletin.

If a student has any account balances or obliga-tions such as tuition, library or parking fines, loans, etc., a hold will be placed on grade re- ports, transcripts, and/or diplomas until paid. [E] Gr ading Sy stem The gr ading system is based upon achievement in course workattempted. The grades and points of thisgrade point average (G.P .A.) system are asfollow s: Points per Semester Hour Grade A4.0 C 2.0 A-3.7 C- 1.7 B+ 3.3 D+ 1.3 B3.0 D 1.0 B- 2.7 D- .7 C+ 2.3 F .0 In addition, the following symbols are used: P\u2014Pass NP\u2014No Pass AD\u2014Audit I\u2014Work Incomplete IP\u2014In Pr ogress (giv en only for Thesis 599 and other approved courses) W\u2014Withdrew (with permission) NG\u2014No Grade Submitted The G.P .A. is the total points divided bythe total semester hours in which grades of Athrough Farereceived. All courses which the student does not successfully complete will be denoted on the transcriptby the symbol I, IP,F,or NP. [F] Incomplete The grade Iis allowed only with the approval of the dean.

The I will convert to an Fif the requirement is not completed by the deadline. [G] Pass/No Pass Certain courses, because oftheir content and scope, are graded on the pass/no pass basis. These courses aredetermined by the dean of the college orprofessional school which offers the coursesinvolved upon recommendations of the fac-ulty of a department or professional school.Such courses will not be subject to the regu-lations on student options below. Courses that are required by the Univer- sity cor e,college curriculum, or depart- mental program may not be taken pass/no pass. T o fulfill the remaining credit hoursfor graduation, three courses may be taken pass/no pass. The student must have the approval of his/her academic advisor anddean. Courses attempted under the pass/no pass system and completed successfullywill carry academic credit, while unsuc-cessful perf ormance will carry no cr edit but will be listed on a student' stranscript.

Both courses and grades will remain onthe permanent academic record, with theoriginal course denoted by the symbol RP. While courses repeated at the University of Portland may change one's grade pointaverage, equivalent courses taken at an-other institution, even when fulfilling Uni-versity requirements, cannot be used to re- place any course or grade entered on the permanent academic record, or to changeone's University of Portland G.P .A. [I] Withdrawal T o receive a W,astudent must officially withdraw from a course in which he/she chooses not to continue.The withdrawal is effective the date it isfiled in the registrar's office, and in no in-stance later than the eleventh week of thesemester.

[C]Should the aggrieved students believe that their rights were abridged at the de- partmental and college levels, they mayfile a request for review with the associateprovost, making clear the substance of theappeal. The associate provost will consultwith the dean, the department head, andfaculty member in question and make arecommendation regarding the issue: thatthe original evaluation and decisionshould stand; that there appears to havebeen unf air ev aluation or treatment by the instructor.

Advanced Placement [A]Students may challenge courses and/or receive advanced placement withcredit upon permission fr om their acade - mic dean and on certification fr omthe head of the department which offers thecourse.Courses may be challenged only once. Courses may not be challenged in which the student has been pr eviously en - rolled at the Univ ersity of P ortland.* [B]Credit may be granted for advanced placement for those courses required inthe student' smajor pr ogram.* [C]Students who have earned 60 or more semester hours of college credit cannotgain additional cr edit through the College Level Examination program (CLEP) gener- al tests. They may receive credit for satis-factory scores in specialized subject exami-nations. VII. Probation and Dismissal Due to Poor Scholarship Any student who earns a semester G.P .A. below 2.00 will be placed on academic pro-bation. Furthermore, the records of those students who withdraw from more thanfour credit hours during a semester will bereviewed by the dean. When the academicprogress of such a student is judged unsat-isfactory, that student will be placed on academic probation. If at the end of the next regular semester the student is not placed on probation, thestudent returns to regular academic stand- ing. A student who is placed on probation for two semesters in any twelve-month pe-riod may be dismissed from the University. In addition, regardless of the number of semesters on probation, a student may bedismissed if, in the opinion of the dean,the student's academic progress is inade-quate to assure successful continuation atthe University. Students who have beendismissed from the University for academicreasons may appeal in writing t othe Acad- emic Standing Committee for a review of the decision of dismissal and/or for re-admission to the University. The letter should be addressed to the associate provost, who is chair of the AcademicStanding Committee .It is only with the approval of this committee that a student, once dismissed, may be re-admitted to theUniversity. VIII. T ransfer of Credits [A]Transfer to the University or from one college or school within the Univ ersity t o another may be made only with the ap - proval of the dean in each area. For students who transfer within the Univ ersity, cour ses common in r equir e- ments to all schools and divisions of the University will be accepted in transfer andboth cr edit earned and grade received shall be used in computing the G.P .A. of the student. Other courses may be accept-ed at the discretion of the dean and shallbe used in computing the G.P .A. [B]If, after enrolling in a degree program at the University of Portland, a studentwishes t otake a course at another institu- tion and use it toward the degree, prior approval of the student's academic deanshould be obt ained. Official tr anscripts of credits earned in other institutions (high *Forms for requesting approval to challenge courses and for certifying credit are available in the Office of the Registrar, and must be presented to the proper academic dean before examination is taken.GENERAL INFORMATION 19 school, college, or university) must come directly from the school to the Universityof Portland. IX. Student Classification [A]Undergraduate degree-seeking stu- dents are classified as freshmen if theyhave earned less than 30 semester hours; as sophomores if they have earned at least 30 semester hours; as juniors if they haveearned at least 60 semester hours; as se-niors, if they have earned at least 90 se-mester hours. [B]Special students are those who qualify by maturity and ability to perform satisfac-torily at the university level, but who failto meet the requirements for freshman or advanced standing. [C]Nonmatriculated students are those who have been admitted in order to regis-ter for credit but who have not been ac-cepted into any degree program at the University. See page 31 of this Bulletin for specific requirements for admission to thisstudent st atus. [D]Postgraduate students are those who have earned an undergraduate degree andare in a program that leads to a certificateor other non-degr eecredential. [E]Graduate degree-seeking students are those who have earned a baccalaureate de-gree and who hav ebeen accepted into a program leading to an advanced degree. X. Graduation and Degrees [A]In or der toearn a baccalaur eate de - gree, students must successfully complete at least 120 semester credit hours, andmorein most pr ograms.The particular re- quirements in each college or school are listed under each pr ogram in this Bulletin. Aminimum of 30 semester hours at the Univ ersity of P ortland is required for a de- gree. Normally, these 30 semester hours must be those which immediately precedethe completion of degree requirements. Itis expected that students will complete allof the upper division courses in theirmajor at the Univ ersity of Portland. How- ever, the deans of the schools or collegesmay accept up to 25 percent of the upper-division major cour se requir ements in transfer from other accredited institutions.Students seeking a second baccalaureate degree from the University are required tocomplete an additional 30 semester hoursat the University and fulfill the course re-quirements of the college or school inwhich the second degree is sought. [B]In addition to satisfying the above quantitative requirements, students musthave a cumulative G.P .A. of at least 2.0 incourses taken at the University of Port- land, and a 2.0 average in their major field. [C]The undergraduate and graduate de- grees listed elsewhere in this Bulletin are granted by the University through theCollege of Arts and Sciences and the vari-ous schools. (For master's degree require-ments, refer to the Graduate School chap-ter of this Bulletin beginning on page 113.) [D]Eligible candidates for graduation should file an application for degree withthe registr ar and pay the appropriate fees during the semester prior to the semester in which they expect to graduate, but nolater than the date specified in the academ- ic calendar. [E]Although a number of administrative and f aculty advisor sareready t ohelp stu- dents in planning and checking the progress of their degree program, the final responsi-bility for completing all requirements for adegree rests with the student. If a student has not satisfied all of the r equirements, the degree for that student will be with- held pending adequate fulfillment. XI. Honor sat Graduation Honor sfor undergraduate degrees at grad- uation ar edetermined one semester prior to graduation by computing the G.P .A. in all courses (both University of Portlandand transfer) applicable toward gradua-tion. T ransfer students who have not com- pleted 30 semester hour sin residence by one semester prior to graduation will be evaluated at the conclusion of all w ork. Fall semester graduates are included with the subsequent spring semester and sum-mer semester graduates are included withthe previous spring semester in determin-ing honors at graduation. Honors arebased on the f ollowing formula: within a given college or school, summa cum laude will be awarded to all students receiving a20 GENERAL INFORMATION 4.00 G.P .A.; maxima cum laude to next cum laude to the next 7%; cum laude to the next 10%.

Athletics Athletics/Intramurals Lawrence R. Williams II, J.D., director The mission of the University's athletics programs has four features: IT o educate the minds, hearts, and spirits of student-athletes ,in such ar eas as f air- ness,discipline, teamwork, competitive- ness, and sacrifice; IToadvance the University toward preem- inence among its peers by fielding teams and student-athletes that ar etalented and competitiv eat the NC AA Division I lev el; IT o provide additional non-curricular \"teaching moments\" for all students; IToformulate and perpetuate pr ograms that r eflect the University as a whole, and which symboliz ethe University's mission. Since the University's founding nearly a century ago, sport has been both a centr al means of education for the student bodyand one of the many ways that the Univer-sity is bound together as a community. The University's inter-collegiate and in- tramural athletics programs have allowedmany thousands of students a f orm of edu- cation respected since the time of the an-cient Greeks. On playing fields and courts,Univ ersity students hav efocused theirphysical, mental, and emotional efforts; learned the benefit of discipline and team-work; channeled competitiveness, creativ-ity, and energy toward goals both individ-ual and common; and realized one aspectof the University's attempt to teach them what it means to be a wholly educated per- son, alert to knowledge of the mind, body,and spirit. The University's athletics programs have also served as an important means of bind- ing the University community together, incommon support of the student-athletesrepresenting the University, and in com-mon support of the athletics staff chargedwith caring for and teaching the studentson their teams. Coaches, trainers, and ad-ministrators in the athletics departmentare considered teachers of direct or indi-rect influence. Through their conversa-tion, conduct, and per sonal and pr ofes- sional activities, athletics personnel are colleagues in the University's effort to edu-cate mind, heart, and spirit. The University's participation at the NCAA Division I level is characterized byadhering t othe NC AA'sstandards of acade- mic quality and degree completion and by striving for regional and national promi-nence. The University is committed to bean institution that abides by NC AA rules and r egulations as well as those of the West Coast Conference (WCC). Programs: The men' sand w omen's inter- collegiate program competes in the WCC in bask etball, golf, tennis ,soccer ,and cross country. The men also compete in theWCC in baseball, and the women compete in the WCC in volleyball. The track pro-gram for both men and w omen competes as an independent. The intr amural program offers a wide variety of organized sports and recreation- al activities f or the student body, f aculty, and staff. Both \"pro\" and \"rec\" divisions are offered in basketball, volleyball, indoor/out-door soccer, ultimate frisbee, tennis, soft-ball, and other sports. Activities includebiking, camping, snow skiing, hiking,snow shoeing, and r afting.

Students who knowingly submit altered transcripts or falsified applications jeopar-dize their admission status and could havetheir acceptance canceled. Entering Freshmen Students admitted as freshmen must grad- uate from high school before enrollment.Admission is determined by Universi-ty'sestimate of the student' sprobable suc- cess in college-level work. This estimate is based upon the number of and the gradesin high school academic subjects, togetherwith the S AT1or ACTtest scor es, recom- mendations, an essay, and the major the student plans to pursue. The best prepara-tion for study at the University of Portlandincludes four years of English, three tofour years of mathematics, three to four yearsof labor atory science ,three tofour years of social sciences/history, and two to four years of a foreign language. Topreparefor some majors, a more in- tensive background in certain academic areas is r ecommended. F or example, one year of high school chemistry is required for students interested in the School ofNursing and one year of Pre-Calculus isthe preferred minimum math require-ment for the School of Engineering. Candidates should complete the f ollow - ing procedures by February 1 for priority consideration. Additional admission deci-sions will be made to later applicants asspace allows.

Advanced Placement With Credit In recognition of the strength of many advanced programs in secondaryschools, college credits will be awarded onthe basis of satisfactory scores on AdvancePlacement (AP), International Baccalaure- ate (IB), and the College Level Examina- tion Program (CLEP) examinations. Threeor more semester hours' credit may begranted for each AP examination passedwith a score of 4 or 5 and higher level IB examinations passed with a score of 5 or better. CLEP provides a series of objectiveexaminations t oassess student pr oficiency in several general fields: natural science, social science/history, humanities, Eng-lish composition, and mathematics. Sub-ject e xaminations ar ealso offer ed in a wide v ariety of fields. These tests measure competence in specific college-level acad-emic ar eas. There is no grade attached to advanced placement, international baccalaur eate,or CLEP cr edit. Ther efore,it is not included in the grade point average of the student. Without Credit Those who do not qualify for adv anced placement with cr edit ac - cording to the provisions mentioned above, may, nevertheless, be assigned to advancedfreshman or sophomore sections of certain classes, if in the judgment of the dean of the college or school, the student's prepa-ration is adequate.

Until English pro-ficiency is judged satisf actory, the student must take a reduced load in the major area of study. Thus, it may take the student anextra semester or more to obtain an under-graduate or a master's degr ee. An exception to the above may be made in the following case: Applicants present- ing GCE certificates in English languagefrom the University of London, or GCEcertificates fr om of London need not take the TOEFL test, but they will be required to take the Universityof Portland English placement e xamina - tion with the conditions mentioned above.

The Department of Biology strives to achieve excellence in the teaching of sci- ence t oall levels of undergraduate stu- dents. Students majoring in biology andlife science achieve comprehensive prepa-ration for careers as future scientists,health car epractitioner s,and technical personnel. Students in these majors ac- quire a breadth of knowledge along withtechnical and analytical skills ,while re- flecting on ethical values that link science and society. Under graduate research is emphasized throughout the curriculum, reinforcing independent learning andallowing students to develop talents incritical thinking and pr oblem solving while refining advanced laboratory or field skills in observation and data collection.Students in nursing, education, and envi-ronment al studies complete biological coursework relevant to their professional training. A biology major and a life sciencemajor ar eoffered; a minor is available in biology. A concentration in biology is of- feredthrough the environmental studies program. Thr ough its support of the cor e science courses as well as courses in the major s, the department attempts to ensure that all Univ ersity graduates develop sci- entific literacy, an understanding of thepotential and limitations of scientific methodology, and an appreciation for therole of science in contemporary life. Preparation for Careers in Health Science, Biology, andEnvir onmental Science Programs of coursework to prepare for post-graduate study or employment inmany areas of health science, biology, andenvironmental studies are offered by the Department of Biology. Students shouldconsult with their academic advisor orwith the health professions advisors to de- velop a schedule of courses that will meet individual educational goals. The Department of Biology oversees a comprehensive undergraduate program for students preparing to enter a variety of health professions, including medicine,dentistry, dental hygiene, pharmacy, occu-pational therapy, optometry, physicaltherapy, podiatry, veterinary medicine,and biomedical research. The pre-healthprofessions program at the University ofPortland focuses on providing studentswith a solid foundation in the natural sci-ences within the context of a broad liberalarts education. The University offers courses that satisfy the admission requirements for all accred-ited U.S. medical and dental schools, andfor most other health pr ofessions pr o- grams and graduate programs in the bio- medical sciences .Most pr ofessional and graduate programs require students to complete a set of prerequisite sciencecourses, but students may complete theserequir ements while pur suing a degr ee in any academic major .The University en- courages students to pursue a major oftheir choice and t akeabroad spectrum of coursework, while completing the specific requir ements for a particular professional or graduate pr ogram. Students inter ested in the biological sciences may fulfill these requirements while completing a bache-lor'sdegree in biology or life science . The Department of Biology offer ssup- porting cour ses in the University's envi- ronmental studies program.

Kolmes, Ph.D., program director and B.S. track directorRussell Butkus, Ph.D., associate programdirector and B.A. Barnes, Butkus, Cantrell, Hill, Houck, Kodadek,O'Reilly, Snow, Wasowski The purpose of the environmental studies program is to critically examine the broadscope of the current environmental crisis. This crisis is scientific, sociopolitical, and ethical in natur e. In light of this crisis, the environmental studies program offers abachelor of arts degree in environmentalethics and policy and a bachelor of sciencedegree in envir onment al science. The pro- gram is designed to give all program majors, regardless of the track they pursue,an under standing of the scientific implica- tions of environmental study, and the the- ological, philosophical, economic ,and political issues at the heart of this chal-lenge. In addition to its interdisciplinarynature in the College of Arts and Sciences,the pr ogram is also dedicated t ocreative inter action with other schools of the Uni- versity, such as the environmental engi-neering track in the civil engineeringdegree pr ogram, and the sust ainable entr e- preneurship offerings in the Pamplin School of Business Administration. T aken together ,this encourages a rich and con- structive conversation on our campus that center son the place of humankind and human activities in an envir onment ally sustainable future. The goal of the environmental studies program is t ograduate students who have gained enough insight into the present en- vironmental situation, and the intercon-nected elements involved in any solution,to provide leadership as environmental professionals. As Oregon's Catholic Univer-sity, the University of Portland is perfectlysituated as a place wher ethe discussion of moral and ethical dimensions of environ- mental decisions is part of normal discourse. The B.S. track leads to a degree in environ- mental science, a broadly conceived courseof study that involves biology, chemistry,physics, mathematics, and computer sci- ence, along with a strong foundation in thesocial sciences and humanities. Withinthis integrative framework, students willselect an upper-level concentration inbiology, chemistry, or physics. The B.A. track leads to a degree in envi- ronmental ethics and policy, which com-bines a background in science with adiscourse that centers on philosophy, theol- ogy, ethics, political science, and other fields. One of the critical aims of this degreetrack is to cultivate critical intelligence andconsciousness within students regardingthe multifaceted nature of environmentalethics and environmental policy. B.A. and B.S. students in environmental studies are brought together several timesin the course of their undergraduate work:in the University's core curriculum courses,in envir onment al studies courses, labora- tories, and field trips, and in a senior cap- stone seminar which involves case studiesand team-approach problem-solving in re- gional environmental issues. Minors are available in environmental science and in envir onment al policy. Environmental Studies Learning Out comes These programs are designed to graduate students who have: Ian understanding of the scientific impli- cations of envir onment al study, and the theological, philosophical, economic, and political issues at the heart of this chal-lenge .

In the foreignlanguage courses required of all B.A. stu-dents, as well as in those of its major, mi-nors, and certificates, the program: [1] Builds proficiency in speaking, listen- ing, reading and writing the target language; [2]Foster sappreciation f or other cultur es and the international global community; [3]Develops the critical thinking skills and humane values inherent in the Uni- versity's liberal arts tradition. Foreign language faculty members guide and inspire students to experience other cultures through the study of language andliterature, and through periods of total im-mersion abr oad. In their teaching and in their r esear ch, faculty ar ededicated t othe study of language and literature for its own power and pleasure, and as a means ofpromoting under standing and enjoyment of cultural differences. They are commit- ted tostudent-center ed instruction, which develops the foreign language proficiencyand confidence majors and certificates need to be successful in graduate programs, as well as in a wide range of careers, such as business, government, education, socialwork, and health care. The Department of Foreign Languages offersaGerman Studies major ,aSpanish major, a French Studies major, a certificate in Spanish, and minors in French, Ger-man, and Spanish. The f oreign languages program offer scourses in French, Ger- man, and Spanish language and literature. Students interested in a foreign languageCOLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES 57 major, certificate, or minor should consult with the department chair. Learning Outcomes for Foreign Languages Students who successfully complete all re- quirements toward a B.A. in French studies,German studies, or Spanish, including course-work in a foreign studies program, will: Ispeak, write, listen to, and read the target language at the intermediate-high to ad-vanced proficiency level (based on theACTFL Proficiency Guidelines*); Idemonstrate a high degree of cultural lit- eracy by living, studying, and/or workingin the target culture with relative ease andsensitivity to cultural differences; Idemonstrate sensitivity to cultural diver- sity by examining critically their nativelanguage and culture vis-a-vis the targetcultur e; Ibe able to secure positions in the private and public sector which require use of thetarget language, engage in further study at the graduate level in the target languages, or secure grants for work and study in acountry where the target language is spo-ken. All students beginning their study of French, German, or Spanish at the Univ er- sity of Portland are encouraged to take afree online placement test. After taking the test, the student will receive informa-tion indicating which cour se will pr ovide the best fit for the student's level of profi- ciency. Contact the chair of the foreignlanguages department f or information on how to access the exam. French Studies ,B.A. The F rench studies major is an inter- disciplinary major which combines cour ses from the department of French with those from other disciplines, the content of which dir ectly r elates t oFrance and French-speaking countries. The program is designed to offer its ma- jors the opportunity to achieve proficiencyin writing, speaking, comprehending, andreading the French language, while at thesame time broadening and deepening their knowledge, understanding, and ap-preciation of the cultures of France andthe francophone world. Since the goal of the French studies major is to focus on the acquisition of lan- guage proficiency and to incorporate con- tributions from more than one field ofstudy, it prepares students for careers ininternational law, teaching, government services, foreign missions, translating, the non-profit sector, and for positions in busi-ness that require a knowledge of theFrench language and culture. Students pursuing a B.A. degree in French studies are required to complete 18upper-division credit hours of Frenchcourses and 9 upper-division credit hoursfrom at least two of the following disci-plines: history, philosophy, fine arts, andpolitical science .Students pur suing a B.A. degree in French studies also must spend aminimum of six weeks studying French in France or a francophone country. Study abroad opportunities include IES pro- grams in Paris (summer or semester),Nantes and Dijon (semester only). If a student studies in France for six weeksin the summer, he or she may earn up tosix credits towards the French Studiesmajor .If a student studies abr oad f or one semester ,he or she may earn up to 15 credits towards the major.

German Studies ,B.A. The German studies major provides stu- dents with the opportunity to become proficient in German language while also becoming knowledgeable about social, historical, and political f actors that shape and define German-speaking cultures. By natur ethe German studies major is inter - disciplinary, and it cr eates connections among a number of disciplines which are cornerstones of the liberal arts tradition.The combination of these cour ses under a cohesive curriculum allows students to gain pr oficiency in German language while also learning to think and reason across disciplinary boundaries. Additionally, the current trend toward globalization means that students must become not only informed citizens and leaders withintheir own community and country butalso in the world at large. By becomingknowledgeable in global political andsocial processes through German studies,students will learn to understand complexinternational r elationships and gain an appreciation f or differ ent cultures. The German studies major supports studentsin their developing roles as leaders in their community and the world. All students pursuing a major in German studies must complete 18 upper-divisioncredit hours of German courses and 9upper-division credit hours from at least two of the following disciplines: philosophy, history, political science, fine arts, and the-ology.

As a nationally accredited unit of the Col- lege of Arts and Sciences, the music pro-gram is committed t oits role within the Univ ersity mission (especially the dev el- opment of the whole person), compliance with the standards of the National Associa-tion of Schools of Music ,and ongoing ev al- uation of the program in all its aspects. Ther earetwodegree pr ograms for music major sat the University. The bachelor of arts degree in music provides students the widest possible education in the sciences and the humanities as they give particular emphasis to the comprehensive study ofmusic. The School of Education, in cooper- ation with the music faculty, offers profes- sional instruction leading t othe bachelor of music education degree for students who plan to teach in elementary or sec-ondary schools . New students ,including tr ansfer stu- dents, will be accepted as music majors on aprobationary status until they present a satisfactory audition at one of the follow-64 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES ing: 1) scholarship audition; 2) the perfor- mance final examination at the end of thefirst semester; or 3) by special arrange-ment with the faculty. Avariety of large and chamber ensem- bles are open to all University students with prior musical experience. These en- sembles, which perform music of all typesand styles, include the University Singers,University Concert Band, University Choral Union, University-Community Orchestra, Jazz Ensemble, Guitar Ensemble, Cham-ber Ensemble, and Chapel Music Ensem-ble. Each presents a series of performancesthroughout the academic year. All music majors, before completion of their degree program, must demonstratean acceptable proficiency in keyboard,aural, and sightsinging skills. Specific de-tails about these requirements are con-tained in the Music Study Handbook . The Music Study Handbook also contains details about the requirements for MUS001 (Performance Attendance); and MUS 186, MUS 286, MUS 386, and MUS 486 (Pri- vate lessons), and necessary informationabout the senior pr esent ation.

Gauthier, Hogan, Martin, Santana, Trout Philosophy plays a central role in Catholic liberal arts education as the primary inte- grating discipline across the curriculum.Training in philosophy develops thestudent's ability to explore and critically reflect upon the most fundamental ques- tions about human beings and society, theuniverse, and God. By focusing on its ownhistory, philosophy acquaints studentswith the intellectual f oundations of West- ern civilization. By enabling students tobecome reflective, critical, and articulateabout their own beliefs and values, philos-ophy mak es an essential contribution t o the education of individuals, whatevertheir vocational plans, and to the develop- ment of the community. Philosophy, B.A. The major in philosophy is intended to meet the needs of various types of stu-dents ,including those who plan t odo gr ad- uate work in philosophy; those who plan to do graduate work in other fields likelaw, medicine, business, journalism, min- istry, or any of the liberal arts; those who wish t opursue a double major in philoso- phy and some other discipline of the hu - manities, sciences, or professional areas; and those who wish to get a solid liberaleducation. Philosophy may also be t aken as a minor, as part of an interdisciplinary major, or within other programs such asthe social justice pr ogram. Learning Outcomes of Philoso- phyMajor Philosophy graduates of the University of Portland should be able to: [1] Demonstr ate mastery of the content of the discipline; [2]Engage in the art of questioning; [5]Recognize the strengths and weakness- es of their own arguments.

How do we know? What is the evidence and why doweaccept it? Physics is the science that seeks t ounder stand natural phenomenaas simply as possible and so provide the foundation for the other sciences and engi-neering. Whatever questions they ask,physicists have discovered that the an-swers ultimately involve the same elegantgeneral principles, such as symmetry, en- ergy and momentum, mass and charge. Rather than simply describe one observa- tion, a physicist seeks to connect that ob-servation with many others and apply or extend comprehensive theories. Physicists look for and study patterns among naturalphenomena, including those that are read-ily apparent (like the orbits of planets) andthose that are apparent only to deep analy-sis and careful observation (like the quan-tum transitions of atoms). Aphysics major provides a rigorous grounding in the scientific process and afirm scientific understanding of the world.It foster scritical thinking and quantitative problem solving skills and provides broad practical training in science and technolo-gy. It can lead to graduate study and basic research (in a variety of disciplines), to stimulating jobs in industry, or to chal-lenging and r ewarding car eersin teaching. Our faculty members are engaged in original research and physics majors aredrawn early into collaborative researchprojects with the f aculty. Students learn t o think as physicists ,not just work physics problems, and faculty welcome students' curiosity, questioning, and new per spec- tives. Aphysics major is essential f or students planning t opursue a gr aduate degr ee in physics. A physics major also provides a solid foundation for students who antici-pate a car eer in secondary education, engi - neering or medical research. Students looking f or a broad scientific grounding as part of their liberal arts education are also well serv ed by the physics major . The curriculum is specifically designed to help students reach the following learn-ing goals. Students will: [1] Understand the general principles of symmetry, energy, force, momentum,mass and char ge as underlying f ounda- tions for other sciences and engineering. [2]Be able to recognize patterns among natur al phenomena, including those that are readily apparent (like the orbits of planets) and those that are apparent onlyCOLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES 67 to deep analysis and careful observation (like the quantum transitions of atoms).

This definitionemanates from a number of sources. Theprogram is named after Dorothy Day, whowas a Catholic social activist in the best tradition of social work. Social justice, peace, domestic violence, farm workerunions, and the environment were amongthe many of her social work concerns. The social work program incorporates a systems perspective that provides a way toorganize conceptualizations about theoriesand methods of social work practice. Addi-tionally, this definition incorporates theimportance of ethics and values in thepractice of social work drawn from the so-cial teachings of the Catholic Church.These qualities provide a framework forthe program mission; to prepare studentstoassume leader ship roles in global soli- darity and community within an increas- ingly diverse society through culturalcompetence and commitment to social justice. Cultural competence and a dedication to social justice f or vulner able populations through global and local solidarity are sig- nature aspects of the Dorothy Day SocialWork Program at the University of Port-land. The objectiv es of tr ansferring the values, skills, and knowledge inherent in this goal are embedded throughout the program through courses, sponsored re- search, and community service in local and international settings .Students ar e taught t osupport and enhance eff orts at all levels of society to uphold human rights and dignity; to assure fair access to re-sources; and t oinfluence social, economic , and political systems so that they become morejust and equitable. The primary goals of the program are: Goal I: The pr eparation of students f or generalist practice in entry-level positions is the primary function of the program.Objective: T o provide students with theknowledge, skill, and values necessary toenable practice on an entry-level with in-dividuals ,families, groups, organizations, and communities in a variety of practicesettings and with a focus upon social jus-tice. Goal II: The preparation of students for advanced graduate study in social work.Objective: T o provide students with the ed- ucational foundation necessary for ad-vanced graduate study in social workthrough a curriculum that enables stu-dents to consider personal and profession-al options regarding specialization and graduate education. Goal III: The encouragement and en- abling of student to assume leadershiproles in meeting the social service needs of vulnerable populations. Objective: T o en- able student to incorporate leadership con-cepts and principles into their personaland professional lives through criticalthinking and ethical behavior aimed at thegeneration of solutions to social problems.In pursuit of this end, students are encour-aged to participate in student organiza-tions, the National Association of SocialWorkers, local, national, and internationalboards,committees, and conferences as possible. The social work program was awarded accreditation status in October, 2006. Ac- creditation status makes graduates from this program eligible for advanced stand-ing in most master' sof social w ork pr o- grams across the country. Graduates are therefore eligible to receive an MSW inone year instead of two. While most of ourgraduates go on t ograduate school, many distinguish themselv es in national and in- ternational service beforehand. University Core Requirements\u2014 39 hours (See pg. 5-7.)

Baasten, Ph.D., chair Faculty: Baasten, Hosinski, LaBarre,McManus ,McNamara, Rutherford Theological studies have a prominent role in the University and College of Arts andSciences cor ecurricula. The Department of Theology is the academic unit of the College of Arts and Sciences whose pur-pose is to offer quality theological educa-tion. Within a Catholic conte xt and in an ecumenical per spective it provides a foun- dation for: a) critical, spiritual, and ethical reflection, and its e xpression; b) nurturing theological scholarship and dialogue; and c)pastoral service on campus and in local churches. The Department of Theology is one of the most direct and visible ways in whichthe Univ ersity pr omotes its mission as an independently gov erned Catholic universi- ty, fulfilling its commitment t othe cen tral tenets of faith and service. By providing for- mativ etraining in the content and meth - ods of Catholic/Christian theology, thedepartment, in the spirit of Ex Corde Eccle- siae(1990), contributes to the manner in which service to God and humanity is val-ued and personified in our graduates. The Department of Theology seeks t o fulfill its own mission and the stated objec-tives of the University by providing, aspart of the core curriculum, a theology core program consisting of 9 credit hours.As part of the theology core program, allstudents are required to take three theolo-gy courses. The first, THE 101, introducesstudents to the nature of religion, the great world religions, and the discipline of theol- ogy. The second, THE 205, surveys bibli-cal tradition and culture. The third coursemust be taken from a range of 400-level courses, which provides students with ad- vanced study of a more focused topic with-in Christian theology, possibly one relatedto the student's major or one of personalinterest. THE 101 and 205 are prerequisites for all upper-division theology courses. The Department of Theology offers a program of courses leading to the bachelorof arts degree with a major in theology, atheology minor (described on pg. 45), andamasters degree in pastoral ministry (de- scribed on pg. 133). Theology, B.A. Students desiring to orient themselves more thoroughly in the study of religiousvalues and influences choose theology as avaluable integr ating major in the College of Arts and Sciences .Some declare theol- ogy as a second major or interdisciplinaryarea with communication, dr ama, educa- tion, philosophy, psychology, and social service ,tomention the most fr equent combinations .Major smay qualify f or en - rollment in the national honor society for religious studies and theology (ThetaAlpha K appa). In addition to THE 101 and 205, theology majors take 27 hours of upper-divisioncourses. Of these 27 hours, 3 are allotted to biblical studies, 3 to the history of Chris- tianity, 3 to systematic theology, 3 to theo-logical ethics, 3 to Christian worship, and 3to spirituality. The remaining 9 hours areallotted to upper-division theology elec-tives, three hours of which may be satis-fied by t aking a THEP course.

Total Credit Hours \u2014 120 Global Business: Study Abroad Requir ement Global business major sare required to study abroad in a summer, semester, oryear-long program. The University does not guarantee that the students who wish tomajor in global business will be chosen to participate in a program abroad. The se- lection pr ocess is competitiv eand is based on factors which include, but are not limit- edto, academic perf ormance ,disciplinary record, maturity, fle xibility, and potential for success in the environment abroad as judged by faculty, staff and others whohavecome int ocontact with the applicant. Global business majors are responsible for maint aining strong academic credentials, as well as a positive profile in the otherareas,toposition themselves to be selected for a study abroad program. Ultimately, it is solely the student's responsibility to ful-fill this requirement. During the sophomore year, the dean's office will use the aforementioned factorstoevaluate students intending to major in global business. During this process, stu-dents may be called in to discuss these fac-torsand their plans f or study abr oad. Students who do not meet the r equir e-ments to be selected for a study abroad pro- gram will not be allowed to graduate with aglobal business major. Students who applyto transfer into the Pamplin School of Busi-ness Administration, either from within oroutside the University, may undergo this evaluation immediately upon their request to transfer, depending on the percentage ofcurriculum they have already completed. Finally, students who intend to study abroad are encouraged to begin research- ing programs and planning ahead duringtheir freshman year. Application deadlinesfall well in advance of most programs' startdates, and students who plan ahead usual-ly can integrate overseas study into theirfour-year plan without delaying their grad-uation. After narrowing down their choic-es, students should meet with businessschool staff to plan their remaining courseschedules so as t oavoid duplication of courses offered abroad and to assess any additional ramifications (for example, theneed for summer school). Double Majors and Minors Students who w ant tomajor in tw oareas of business must complete the majority of these programs through separate electives.Only two upper-division electives may becross counted f or s.Only one upper-division electiv ecan be cross count- ed for a minor. T o be awarded a minor at graduation, students must achiev ean av- erage G.P .A. of 2.50 or better in their minor classes .

The purpose of the School of Education is t oprepare individuals in various stages of their careers to teach and lead in public and private schools. Such edu-cators, the School of Education believes, demonstrate a range of knowledge,skills, and dispositions. They are life-long learners who are re-spectful other s.They ar eexceptional communicat orsand can work effective- ly with others. Knowledgeable of both theory and practice, they have a broad and deep knowledge about students, the curriculum, and learning, and the con-comitant skills to organize classrooms, schools, and districts and employ in-structional strategies to meet the diverse needs of learners. The degree programs offer the opportunity for initial and continuing teacher licensur eat one of f our levels: early childhood (age 3 through grade 4); elemen- tary (gr ades 3 thr ough 8), associated with the degree in elementary education; middle (grades 5 through 10); and high school (grades 7 through 12), associated with the degr ee in secondary education. The curriculum is based on a w ell-re- searched knowledge base including effective teaching practice, reflective teach- ing, and leadership of the teacher in the classroom, in the school, and in thecommunity. Embedded in a broad liberal arts tradition, the program integrates liberal studies ,content, pr ofessional, and pedagogical knowledge with planned field experiences. The curriculum develops professionals with pedagogical compe- tencies and per sonal attributes characteristic of exceptional educational leaders. The School of Education is accr edited thr ough the National Council for Accreditation of T eacher Education and its programs are approved by the Ore- gon T eacher Standards and Practices Commission. The school receives further recognition by the University of Portland's accreditation from the NorthwestAssociation of Schools and Colleges. The school is a member of the AmericanAssociation of Colleges f or Teacher Education, the Association of T eacher Edu - cators, and the Association of Independent Liberal Arts Colleges of T eacherEducation. Federal law requires that all schools of education report required teacher licensur eexams and the percentage of graduates from their programs passing those e xams.All candidates within our pr ograms must r eceiv epassing scor es on the California Basic Educational Skills T est or the PRAXIS I: Pre-Professional Skills T est and the Multiple Subjects Assessment for T eachers. Middle and highschool authoriz ed teacher smust r eceiv epassing scor es on the PRAXIS II tests 84 SCHOOL OF EDUCATION in their specific licensure content area. Since passing scores are required on alllicensure exams as a program completionrequirement, all candidates who completeUniversity of Portland School of Educationprograms have received passing scores on each licensure exam. The programs of the University of Port- land School of Education have been ap-proved with no unmet standards by the Oregon T eacher Standards and Practices Commission through 2012.

Admission to the School of Education, Freshmen: Admission of freshman candi- dates is based upon a derived matrix score which includes a combination of predic- tors of probable success: SAT scores (orequiv alent basic skills test scor es appr oved by the associate dean), academic records (including grade point average), essaysample, and a personal recommendation.The matrix components ar ereview edan- nually by the School of Education f aculty.

Music education applicants must obtainapproval from the director of music educa-tion to be admitted to the program.

Yamayee, Ph.D., P .E., dean Khalid H. Khan, Ph.D., associate dean Faculty: Albright, Chamberlain, Doughty, Hoffbeck, A. Inan, Vegdahl,Ward, Yamayee Engineering is a dynamic and creative profession dedicated to achieving the technological aims of society and helping humankind progress to abetter standard of living and well-being. It is a profession in which the knowledge of natural sciences and mathematics is applied with judgement todevelop ways to utilize, economically and with concern for the environmentand society, the materials and f orces of nature for the benefit of humankind. Engineers enjoy a unique professional satisfaction. They can usually point totangible evidence of their efforts. For example, every skyscraper, bridge, televi-sion set, VCR, computer, robot, airplane, or automobile is a lasting testimonialto the engineers responsible for its design and creation. Mission: The School of Engineering continues its progress within the frame- work of the University of Portland mission statement, which appears on page 3of this Bulletin . The School of Engineering is committed to providing the best possible engi- neering education t oits students ,thus enabling the students to become compe- tent practicing engineers and computer scientists. The programs also provide a base for both graduate study and lifelong learning in support of evolving careerobjectiv es.These objectiv es include being inf ormed, effectiv e,and responsible participants in the engineering profession and society. The school endeavors to develop qualities that ar eessential f or the pr actice of engineering and benefi - cial service to the community. These qualities include a knowledge of engineer- ing principles, the ability to apply those principles to solve problems, and thedevelopment of professional, personal, and social values. The school provides a personalized and caring learning environment for its students ,enhanced by high quality faculty, staff, facilities, and equipment. The envir onment includes e xceptional instruction; frequent opportunities for rele- vant laboratory experience; practice of communication and teamwork skills; the challenge of undert aking realistic engineering projects; and the personal attention, guidance, and example of faculty and administrators. This environ-ment is also enhanced by students who hav ean aptitude and motiv ation f or engineering study, as w ell as gener al intellectual curiosity.SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING 9394 SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING Educational Objectives The primary goal of the School of Engineering is to provide an excellent en- gineering and computer science education consistent with the mission, goals, and ob-jectives of the University of Portland asarticulated in the University Bulletin. To achieve this goal, the School has estab- lished the following program educational objectives: [1]Prepare students for entry-level posi- tions and graduate school. [2]Prepare graduates who have a broad background in fundamentals and theability to solve problems. [3]Prepare graduates who possess techni- cal proficiency and sound judgement. [4]Prepare graduates who are competent inwritten and oral communication, and computer proficiency. [5]Prepare graduates who have an under- standing of professional issues such as eco- nomics, ethics, teamwork, and leadership. [6]Provide a stimulating environment and promote life long learning. The School of Engineering offer sboth under graduate and gr aduate degr ee pr o- grams. In the undergraduate studies, the curriculum progresses from mathematicsand science cour ses in the fir st year t oen- gineering science topics in the sophomore year.Junior and senior year studies con - centrate more on the analysis, design, and synthesis aspects of the topics learned inthe fir st two years. This process of synthesis culminates in the capst one design pr ojects in the senior year. Here, students embark on an in-depth study of a particular device,structur e,or system and design it fr omthe ground up using the knowledge they have gained in pr evious year s. Professional Societies Student chapters of the following profes- sional societies curr ently ar eactiveon (ASCE)American Society of MechanicalEngineers (ASME)Association for Computing Machinery(ACM)Institute of Electrical and ElectronicsEngineer s(IEEE)Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Society of Women Engineers (SWE) All students are encouraged to join organizations of interest to them. The University of Portland Oregon Gamma Chapter of T au Beta Pi, the nation- al engineering honor society, offers admis- sion to the top upper-division engineeringstudents. Community College Transfers Transfers from community colleges are accepted regardless of whether they have completed a course of study or not.Students from engineering transfer pro-grams can generally complete the B.S.degree requirements with no loss of time.Students who are interested in transfer-ring to the University are encouraged toseek individual counseling both at theircommunity college and at the University.Discussions at the University can be usedboth t odevelop a suitable academic plan and to develop a suitable financial plan. Prospective transfer students are strong- ly urged to counsel at the University atleast one semester bef orethey plan t o transfer. In this way potential deficiencies can be spotted. Deficiencies can causesequencing problems and delay gradua- tion. In some cases students can save a full semester by taking a key course in thesummer pr eceding planned entry. Degrees and Pr ograms The School of Engineering offers four-year bachelor of science degr ees in civil engi- neering (B.S.C.E.), electrical engineering (B.S.E.E.), and mechanical engineering(B.S.M.E.), as well as engineering manage-ment (B.S.E.M.). In addition, a bachelor ofscience degree in computer science(B.S.C.S.) is offered in the Department ofElectrical Engineering and Computer Sci - ence. This department also offers a \"comput- er track\" under its degree programs. Simi-larly, the Department of Civil Engineering offers an \"environmental track.\" Because the University believes in a broad education for all students, the engi-SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING 95 neering program includes studies in history, fine arts, literature, social sciences,theology, and philosophy. Amaster of engineering degree is offered in the School of Engineering. It combinescourses from engineering, business, and communication studies. Details of this de- gree program are given in the graduatesection of this bulletin on page 127. Undergraduate Curriculum The first semester of the freshman year is common to all engineering curricula. During the freshman year the student laysthe foundation for later engineering stud-ies. This foundation consists of courses inmathematics, science, introduction to en-gineering, and core curriculum. Duringthe second year the study of mathematicsand science continues ,and cour ses in basic engineering theory and application are introduced. With careful planning thestudent can postpone the selection of aparticular engineering major until the endof the second year. In the junior and senioryears the curriculum consists primarily ofcourses in the student' sspecializ ation. There is a progression analysis- oriented cour ses todesign and manuf ac- turing-oriented courses. In all programs acapstone design project is required in the senior year. Some v ariation in the or der in which courses are taken is permissible, so long as the prerequisites are satisfied. Throughout the four years, the student takes liberal arts courses to broaden his or her education and t oimpr ove communica- tion skills . Students are encouraged to take the Funda- mentals of Engineering examination priorto graduation. This nationwide examinationis a step toward registration as a Profess-ional Engineer (P .E.). Our students' pass - ing rates have been well above the nation-al average in this e xamination. Civil Engineering, B.S.C.E. Mehmet I. Inan, D.C.E., P .E., chair The Department of Civil Engineering has made as its primary goal the preparationof civil engineers whose education meetsthe objectives of the School of Engineering as well as those set in the mission of theUniversity. The faculty has established thefollowing program educational objectives: [1]Prepare students for entry-level posi- tions and graduate school. [2]Prepare graduates who have a broad background in fundamentals and theability to solve problems. [3]Prepare graduates who possess techni- cal proficiency and sound judgement. [4]Prepare graduates who are competent in written and oral communication, andcomputer proficiency. [5]Prepare graduates who have an under- standing of professional issues such as eco-nomics, ethics, teamwork, and leadership. [6]Provide a stimulating environment and promote life long learning. The civil engineering program offers two optional paths of study: the civil engi - neering track and the environmental engineering track ,both leading to a bachelor of science in civil engineering. Civil engineering encompasses a wide range of technological matters of vital con-cern t omodern society. The basic ar eas in - clude: structural analysis and design, envi- ronmental protection and control, water re-sources, transportation, geotechnical engi-neering, construction engineering. The cour seofstudy provides a progres- sion of course work from basic science and mathematics thr ough engineering analysis and design. The curriculum includes each aspect of civil engineering: surv eying, structur es,construction materials ,geot- echnical engineering, hydromechanics, environmental engineering, transporta-tion, and engineering economics .The pr o- gram integrates communication, team- work, experimentation, analysis, and de- sign, and provides a cohesive experience aimed at pr eparing the gr aduate t ofunc- tion as a successful engineer. The first three semesters are common for all civil engineering students. In addition,all students take courses in the areas ofstructural engineering, geotechnical engi-neering, tr ansport ation engineering, and environmental engineering, allowing stu- dents to become proficient in each ofthese major ar eas.Students in the civil track take additional courses in construc- tion materials, structural analysis and de-96 SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING sign, while students in the environmental track take courses in the basics of environ-mental microbiology, environmentalchemistry, and water and wastewatertreatment plant design. Both tracks in the civil engineering pro- gram lead to a bachelor of science in civil engineering (B.S.C.E.) degree.

The engi- neering management program is aimed at these students. Specific objectives of the Engineering Management program are: [1]Preparestudents f or entry-lev el posi - tions and graduate school. [2]Prepare graduates who have a broad background in fundamentals and the abili-ty tosolveproblems . [3]Prepare graduates who possess techni- cal proficiency and sound judgement. [4]Preparegraduates who are competent inwritten and oral communication, and computer pr oficiency. [5]Preparegraduates who hav ean under - standing of professional issues such as eco- nomics, ethics, teamwork, and leadership. [6]Provide a stimulating envir onment and promote life long learning. Typical fields of activity for graduates are in manufacturing and production, scheduling, quality contr ol, technical mark eting, sales engineering, field work, contract supervi- sion, and construction management. Somegraduates will become entrepreneurs.Students who wish to lead research or designprojects should obtain a bachelor's degree inan appropriate engineering specialization. The course of study includes the same mathematics, science, basic engineering,and liberal arts courses as the other engi-neering disciplines. However, some of theupper-division engineering courses are re- placed with courses in economics, account- ing, and marketing and management. Thestudent has ample opportunity to takeelectives. These can be chosen from civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering, and from marketing and management, account-ing, and finance. The engineering management program leads to a bachelor of science in engineer-ing management (B.S.E.M.) degree.

Warner, D.N.S., interim dean Susan Randles Moscato, Ed.D., interim associate dean Vines, Warner, Wilson-Anderson, Woo The School of Nursing offers a bachelor of science in nursing and a master of science degree in nursing. Convinced of the intrinsic dignity of thehuman person, the University believes that the best interests of nurses and, through them, of the persons to whom they minister, can most effectively bemet and maintained by a program of studies integrating the professional courseswith those primarily designed t odevelop the humane qualities of the students. Professional nursing is a therapeutic profession with responsibilities of judg- ment, interpretive thinking, and critical analysis. Professional nurses must taketheir places as contributing, self-reliant members of the health team. In order todo this they must develop a broad understanding of people, of society, and ofcurrent health needs. They need to be able to discern changes in the social pat-terns and to develop a readiness to meet problems of the future. The upper-division major, a blend of the humanities and sciences, enables students to construct a substantial framework on which they may continue tobuild thr ough e xperience and further academic study. Accreditation: The School of Nursing is approved by the Oregon State Board of Nursing, is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education(CCNE), and is a member of the American Association of Colleges of Nur sing. Professional Society Omicron Upsilon, the University of Port- land School of Nur sing'schapter of Sigma Theta T au International Honor Society, in- vites to membership seniors and graduatestudents who have demonstrated superioracademic achiev ement in nur sing. A ward- ing membership encourages, fosters, and actively supports further professional de-velopment, thus promoting nursing schol-arship, leadership, creativity, andcommitment to nursing. Program Outcomes The baccalaureate program in nursing at the University provides students with a lib-eral arts and science foundation followedby concentrated study in the professionalnursing major. The program provides thestudents with the opportunity to develop competency in the assessment of healthneeds and in the pr omotion, maintenance , and restoration of health. A rich variety of settings are utilized to reflect the array ofactual and potential health pr oblems expe- rienced by individuals, families, and com- the life cycle . The baccalaur eate graduate of the School of Nur sing will: [1]Practice theory guided, evidence based nursing care. [2]Demonstr ate clinical r easoning in the delivery and management of client cen- tered nursing care. [3]Promote the spiritual dimension of health in practice. [4]Exemplify value based caring while meeting the health care needs of a diverseand changing society. [5]Manage physical, fiscal, and human re-110 SCHOOL OF NURSING sources to achieve quality, cost-effective outcomes. [6]Use communication effectively and appropriately. [7]Provide leadership in the design, deliv- ery, management, and evaluation of health care. [8]Advocate for clients , society, and the nursing profession. [9]Incorporate the values of the nursing profession in practice. Admission Requirements Applicants for admission must meet the general entrance requirements of the Uni-versity as set forth in the general informa-tion section of this Bulletin .Students may be admitted as freshmen or transfer stu-dents into the School of Nursing. All enter-ing fr eshmen will hav ecompleted a high school- or college-level general chemistry course prior to enrolling in BIO 205. Allentering fr eshmen whose recentered score is less than 530 on the verbal SAT, or its equivalent, must take ENG 107. Acceptance into upper division nursing courses is dependent upon: [1]Acumulative G.P .A. of 2.75 or above. [2]Acumulativ eG.P.A. of 2.75 or abov ein the required sciences with a minimumgrade of Cin each required science course. Pass/No Pass grades are not allowed. [3]Completion of all the pr erequisite course work. Lower-division credit may be taken at any accredited college or university. Transfer students will be evaluated on an individual basis. Transfer students' G.P .A. for admission t oupper-division nur sing courses is computed fr om: [1]All credits accepted in transfer toward the nursing degree. [2]Credits earned while at the University of Portland. Computer e xperience/liter acy (ability t o use a PC for word processing, e-mail, andaccess t othe Internet) is r equir ed. The School of Nursing is projecting that all stu-dents beginning upper-division course-work will have the requirement for apre-approved notebook computer andPDA for use throughout the upper-divisionnursing program.Student Handbook The School of Nursing provides students with a copy of its handbook as they begin taking nursing courses. Students have the responsibility to acquaint themselves withits contents and are held accountable forall statements therein. Career Opportunities The curriculum is designed to prepare graduates for the practice of professional nursing in a variety of settings. Graduatesof this program are eligible to sit for theNCLEX-RN, a requirement in all states toobtain professional R.N. licensure. Stu-dents/graduates may apply for appoint-ments in the Air Force, Army, or Navynurse programs. Providence Scholars Program The Providence Scholars program, a part- nership between Providence Health Sys- tems (PHS) and the University of Portland, was created to address the national nurs-ing shortage. Undergraduates selected tobe Pr ovidence Scholar swill have 100 per- cent of their tuition paid by PHS and the University of Portland. The ProvidenceScholars program applies to the junior andsenior year sof the tr aditional under gradu- ate nursing program (bachelor of science in nur sing). The student will sign a thr ee- year employment contract with PHS in ex- change for tuition coverage. Program Requir ements The pr ogram is eight semester sand one summer session in length. Electives will be individually planned considering thestudent' sinterests, ability, and schedule requirements. The requirement for gradu- ation is 124 semester hours. Students must receive a grade of Cor bet- ter in all nur sing cour ses and a gr ade of Pass (P) in all clinical courses, NRS 436 and NRS 498. The school retains only those students who satisfy the requirements of scholar- ship, health, and personal disposition for nursing. Students must consistently demon-strate academic integrity and ethical con-duct. Students must fulfill the requirementsSCHOOL OF NURSING 111 for the classroom and clinical components of the major. Students must pass a two-partcomprehensive exam prior to graduation. Nursing, B.S.N.

Greene, Ed.D., dean The Graduate School was established as a separate administrative unit of the University in 1950. Graduate education motivates faculty and studentsalike to develop and extend intellectual capacities; to expand the body of knowledge; and, in some areas, to develop knowledge and functional skills sothat graduates may perform as professionals in chosen fields. Mirroring the diver-sity of the undergraduate curriculum, the graduate programs range from thosewith tr aditional academic underpinnings to those with a professional specialization. The Graduate School encompasses 12 degree programs in eight academic areas. The courses, curricula, and faculty are provided cooperatively by theSchools of Business Administration, Education, Engineering, and Nursing, andby the College of Arts and Sciences .Each program is administered by a director in the appropriate school or department. These directors, together with thedean of the Gr aduate School, comprise the Gr aduate School Council. 12 semester hour sof credit in a semester or for more than nine semester hours of credit in summer school without the con-sent of the dean of the Graduate Schooland the program director.

C-)will not carry graduate credit, but will be included in thestudent' scumulativ egrade point av erage (G.P .A.) calculated according to the point system described in the Univ ersity A cade- mic Regulations (IV . Grades and Credits). [2b] Only courses in which a grade of C-, D+,D,D-,or NPhas been r eceived may be repeated at the University of Portland for academic credit. In such cases the newgrade and credit will replace the originalin the calculation of grade point average;however both courses and grades will re-main on the permanent r ecord, with the original cour se denoted by the symbol RP. [3]Students who receive an IPin Thesis 599 or a gr aduate cour se arenormally e x- pected t ocomply with the academic r egu- lation that the work be completed within one year. However, in exceptional casesDegrees Offered Business Administration: Master of Business A dministr ation (M.B .A.) Communications Studies: Master of Arts (M.A.) Master of Science (M.S.)

Music: Master of Arts (M.A.) Nursing: Master of Science (M.S.) Doctorate of Nursing Practice (D.N.P .) Theology: Master of Arts in Pastoral Ministry (M.A.) Academic Regulations The academic regulations listed in the opening section of this University Bulletin also apply t ograduate students with the following modifications: [1]Nostudent may r egister f or mor ethan114 GRADUATE SCHOOL the dean of the Graduate School may, upon recommendation of the graduateprogram director, extend the period oftime which students have to completetheir thesis or the course and receive agrade. [4]No course or practicum numbered above 499 may be taken on a \"pass/nopass\" basis for hours required toward anadvanced degree except Thesis 599. [5]Students may not use credits obtained by challenge or advanced placement towardthe hours required for an advanced degree. [6]Thirty semester hours of courses num- bered 500 and above are the minimum re-quirements for a master's degree. (Consultthe individual programs for the precise re-quirements as some programs requiremore than 30 hours.) [7]G.P .A. of 3.00 is required in graduate courses for an advanced degree. [8]Astudent must maintain a G.P .A. of 3.00 to remain in good standing. A studentwho is not in good standing will be given specific conditions by the program direc- tor. If these conditions are not fulfilled, thestudent will be dismissed fr om the Gr adu- ate School by the dean of the Graduate School. [9]Master's degrees requiring 30 to 36 semester hour smust normally be com - pleted within a period of fiv eyears. Master's degrees requiring 37 or more semester hoursmust normally be completed within aperiod of six years. In exceptional cases these periods may be e xtended by the dean of the Gr aduate School upon r ecom - mendation of the graduate program direc- tor. [10]Transfer of cr edits: [a]With the approval of the dean of the Graduate School, a maximum of nine semester hours may be transferred to a master' sdegree pr ogram from an ac- credited institution if they are accept- able for graduate degree credit in thesource institution. (Consult the individ-ual graduate programs for details assome allow less than nine hours oftransfer cr edit.) However, credits or courses used to satisfy the requirementsof any other degree cannot be applied tothe fulfillment of a subsequent degr ee inthe Graduate School. [b]Only those courses graded Bor bet-ter are eligible for transfer. [c]No credits transferred from another institution may be applied to a master'sdegree if they were earned in coursesthat began more than five years beforethe date that will appear on the degree. [d]Graduate credits earned through dis- tance learning will be considered fortransfer, subject to the same criteria astraditional courses with respect to quali- ty, relevance, and timeliness as well as the accreditation of the source institu- tion, including the provisions of regula-tion 10[g] below. [e]Normally credits should be trans- ferred at the time of the applicant's orig- inal acceptance into a graduate programso they may be integrated into the plan-ning of a program. A request for a latertransfer may be denied. [f]T o transfer graduate credits taken at another university during the time of astudent' sgraduate w ork at the Univ er- sity of Portland requires written author- ization before such work is taken. [g]Wher ethe University of Portland graduate program has a special accredi- tation, the source institution may be re- quired tohavethe same or an equiv a- lent accreditation. [h]M.B.A. students who qualify for ad- mission may tr ansfer mor ethan nine hours of graduate credit under provi- sions of the multilater al admissions agreement. [11] Students may not accumulate more than nine hours of credit in the nonmatric-ulated st atus.After nine cr edit hour s,astu- dent must seek admission to a program in order to have the hours apply to a degree. [12] Astudent who e xpects to receive a degree at the end of a semester or the summer session must apply for the degreewithin the time limits set by the registrar. [13] Unless excused by the dean of the Graduate School, the candidate for a mas-ter's degree is expected to attend com-mencement e xercises at which the degree is conferred.GRADUATE SCHOOL 115 Student Classification Degree student is one who has been ac- cepted into a program leading to a master'sdegree. Postgraduate student is one who is ad- mitted to the University for postgraduate work. This does not imply acceptance to agraduate degree program. Regular admis-sion to the Graduate School must be ob-tained from the dean of the GraduateSchool before any work will be acceptedtowards a graduate degree. Nonmatriculated graduate student is one who applies for admission in order to register for credit but who is not a degree- seeking student at the University. Enroll-ment as a nonmatriculated student im-plies no commitment on the part of theUniversity regarding regular admission atalater time .Credits earned while in the nonmatriculated classification do not nec- essarily apply toward requirements for adegree should a student later be accepted into a degree program. Admission as a nonmatriculated student requires that the student submit a nonma-triculated student application to the Grad-uate School along with a $50.00 applica-tion fee ,relevant tr anscripts, and other re- quested documents prior to their initial registration. Accumulation of more than 9 hours of grad- uate cr edit in the nonmatriculated st atus is not permitted, and any such student who ac- cumulates 9 semester hour sis requir ed to seek r egular admission to a degree program in keeping with procedures determined by the Gr aduate School. Application and Admission [1]Correspondence concerning admission tothe Graduate School under any classifi- cation should be addressed to the Gradu-ate School, 5000 Willamette Blvd.,Portland, [2]Before applicants will be considered for admission as degree students the followingmust have been received or met: [a]Completed and signed application forms. [b]The non-refundable admission fee. (Graduates of the University of Portlandare exempt from this fee.) [c]An official transcript sent directly to the University of Portland showing allcollege credit attempted and/or com-pleted from each college and university previously attended. Transcripts from foreign universities must be in Englishor be accompanied by an English trans-lation certified as authentic. Evidence ofpossession of the bachelor's degreefrom an accredited institution is re-quired. All official transcripts submittedbecome the property of the Universityand cannot be copied or returned to theapplicant. [d]Three recommendations from per- sons knowledgeable of the applicant's abil- ity. T wo should normally be from formerprofessors. Note: The M.A.T. program re- quires four letters of recommendation and a resume. The M.Ed. program re-quires thr ee letter sof recommendation, a resume, and a copy of the teaching certifi- cate. The Post Master Specialty programrequires two letters of recommendation,aresume ,and a copy of the teaching cer - tificate .Nursing requires two letters of recommendation. [e]Evidence of scholastic backgr ound that indicates ability to do satisfactory graduate w ork. U sually this is consid- ered tobe a Baverage. [f] Appropriate score on a standardized test.

A Basic Skills T est, and the Oregon Educat or Licensur eAssessment T est (ORELA) and the appropriate PRAXIS Specialty T est (if applicable) arerequired for the M.A.T. degree. For allother programs the General T est of theGraduate Record Examination is re-quired. The T est of English as a Foreign Language is required for applicants whose native language is not English. Aminimum scor eof 550 is r equir ed ex- cept for the master's programs in busi- ness administration (where the score is116 GRADUATE SCHOOL 570) and communication studies and music (where the minimum score is 600). [g]Astatement of academic or profes- sional goals, appropriate to the specificprogram. [h]Specific admission requirements, in- cluding undergraduate G.P .A., of individ- ual degree programs are listed in the in-dividual programs' information. [3]Admission to a program leading to a master's degree is given only by the dean of the Graduate School when the followingconditions are fulfilled: [a]The documentation required above is complete. [b]Apositive recommendation is re- ceived from the graduate program direc-tor of the department or schoolinvolved. (A personal interview may berequired.) [4]Applications should be complete not later than one month before the student'sbeginning class at the University to pro-vide time for adequate consideration and program arrangement.

IThe integration courses introduce a cross-disciplinary approach to managingbusiness oper ations and examine r oles and v alue fr ameworks that need to be mastered by future managers. IThe adv anced cor eexplor es the applica - tion analytic tools in management infor- mation systems, managerial accounting,marketing, and finance in identifying andsolving contemporary business problems.Students will examine regional culturesand changing pr actices impacting global business. *For theology, education programs contact graduate program director.GRADUATE SCHOOL 117 IThe concentration component allows students to specialize in an area of interestin entrepreneurship, finance, global busi-ness, health care, management, or market-ing. Students may also choose to designtheir own concentration by selecting courses from more than one field.

Admission Requirements M.B.A. applicants must have a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or uni-versity recognized by the University ofPortland and an admissions index of 1100or higher. This index is the sum of the ap-plicant's Graduate Management Admis-sions T est (GMAT) and 200 times the appli-cant'sunder graduate grade point average (G.P .A.) on a 4-point scale. Current admis- sions standards are a score of 500 on theGMAT and a G.P .A. of 3.00. Admission to the M.B.A. program is based on the entire application and letters of recommendationnot mer ely quantit ativefactors. It is strongly recommended that applicants have three to four years of professional ex-perience after their bachelor's degree tofully benefit fr om the pr ogram. Applica - tion r equirements may be subject to change. Applicants whose nativ elanguage is not English or did not complete their degree at auniversity wher eall courses were taught in English must achiev eaminimum scor e on the T est of English as a Foreign Lan- guage (TOEFL) of 570 (230 CAT version or88 iBT). See pr ogram dir ector for specific requirements. Jesuit T ransfer Agreement The University of Portland is a participant in an educational consortium with mor e than twenty other faith-based and AACSB- accredited institutions. This program al-lows M.B.A. students exceptional flexibili-ty if their education is affected in such away as to require a move to another geo-graphic location. Under this agreement, students who have completed at least 50 percent of theircredits at the Univ ersity of P ortland may attend another AACSB-accredited M.B.A.program at one of the participating schoolsinvolved in this consortium and transfer units back to the University of Portland tocomplete their degree. If a student has lessthan 50 percent of the credits required toaward an M.B.A. degree, they may apply toaparticipating school and transfer the credits already earned at the University of Portland to that university. Under thisagreement, the student transferring out ofthe University of Portland is required to meet all application and admission criteria of the receiving school and will, in turn,earn their degree from that school. For fur-ther details please see the M.B.A. coordi-nator. Degree Requirements The M.B.A. program consists of 36 to 54 hour of course work: 9 hours in the Inte-gration courses, 15 hours of Advancedcore, 9 hours of Concentration courses,and 3 hour sin the Capst one course. The Foundation courses include six pre- requisites that provide the incomingM.B.A. students with the foundation knowledge necessary for graduate-level course work in the various business disci-plines .Students without the necessary background may be required to take up to18 additional hours of Foundation courses.Students are expected to be proficient inboth st atistics and Ex cel applications .
