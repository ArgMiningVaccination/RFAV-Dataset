As a Doctor of Chiropractic, Dr. French will not simply treat the pain with drugs, but will root out the underlying cause of your condition, ideally eliminating the pain permanently. With over 20 years experience and over 6,000 patients, Dr. French has mastered the Gonstead chiropractic technique which is unparalleled in specificity among chiropractic techniques.

The term \"arthritis\" is a broadly used term and commonly misunderstood. For this section we will discuss the most common form of arthritis which is osteoarthritis (also called degenerative arthritis, degenerative joint disease, DJD, or spondylosis in the spine). Rheumatoid arthritis has a completely different cause. Degenerative arthritis affects almost everyone to some extent over the age of 50, and for this reason is often said \"it is just part of getting old.\" Unfortunately many people accept unnecessary amounts of pain thinking they are just too old. Learn how chiropractic care can help your arthritis pain today. Functional Medicine is a systems biology-based approach that focuses on identifying and addressing the root cause of disease. Each symptom or differential diagnosis may be one of many contributing to an individual's illness.A diagnosis can be the result of more than one cause. For example, depression can be caused by many different factors, including inflammation. Likewise, a cause such as inflammation may lead to a number of different diagnoses, including depression. The precise manifestation of each cause depends on the individual's genes, environment, and lifestyle, and only treatments that address the right cause will have lasting benefit beyond symptom suppression.

BHRT is a healthy option for both men and women for achieving natural, normal hormone balance. BHRT offers advantages over convential hormone replacement in that hormones that are identical to those made by the human body as opposed to synthetic, man-made 'patentable' hormones which carry more risk of side effects. Men and women suffering from low testosterone, progesterone deficiency, adrenal fatigue, low thyroid, unbalanced estrogen, insomnia, hair loss or mood swings can benefit greatly from a comprehensive treatment plan developed by Dr. Jensen who is specially trained in BHRT practice.
