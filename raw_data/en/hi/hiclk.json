Current statistics show that two-thirds of American adults are overweight and one-third are obese. Obesity increases our risk of developing more serious issues such as diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, and cancer. We often associate weight gain with over-consumption of calories and lack of exercise. At times, even lowering our calories and increasing physical activity does not give us the effects we expect. Factors other than diet and exercise can affect how we lose weight. An ideal weight loss program should help an individual achieve optimal health, not just weight loss. These factors are unique to each individual and influence the body in different ways. Lack of customization in weight loss programs is why they are not effective for all of us. A weight loss program should not be a universal plan. When we begin to address contributing factors, we work our way to the root cause of what is slowing your weight loss. "}
