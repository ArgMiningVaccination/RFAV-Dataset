In one of today's articles, [Professor Chris Nutting](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/doctor/chris-nutting), a highly proficient clinical oncologist, explains why it is so important to get the HPV vaccination at an early age, and reveals whether or not there are any related side effects of the vaccination. What is human papillomavirus (HPV)? It is a very common illness that affects adults, and most people will actually suffer from it at one stage or another in their lifetime. The reason why it is important is because after many years (sometimes even up to between 20 and 30 years) after infection, a previous HPV infection can predispose the development of a certain cancer. This is why it is so important to try to eradicate this disease through vaccination. What is the HPV vaccination? The HPV vaccination is mostly given to young adults. It is administered as two doses, usually three to six months apart. This will prevent the individual from contracting the illness in the long run. In many countries, the vaccination is given to all children, normally around the age of 12 or 13. If it is given to children early on in order to greatly reduce the risk of them getting cancer in the long run. The vaccine works wonders when it comes to reducing the chances of people contracting cancer in later life. The most common cancers that are prevented include [head and neck cancer](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/head-and-neck-cancer), amongst others. How painful is it? Fortunately, it is not painful at all, and is normally pinched into either the shoulder or the buttock, and the patient will not suffer from any noticeable pain. Are there any potential side effects? The HPV vaccine has, fortunately, been very well studied. There are no recognised short-term nor long-term side effects of this particular vaccination.
