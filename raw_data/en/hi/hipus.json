Keeping this in mind, there's a few important things you can do to ensure your immune system is in tip top shape before, during and after getting vaccinated. This will ensure optimal outcomes of the vaccine by producing lots of antibodies and reduce the likelihood of any possible side effects or adverse reactions. - Immune support - - having a robust immune system will ensure the best response to the vaccine by optimising antibody production, making the vaccine more effective. The best immune support nutrients are: - - Vitamin C - 1g to 2g daily - take for one month after each vaccination. - - Zinc - 40 - 50mg elemental zinc daily (with food) - take for one month after each vaccination. - - Vitamin D - 1,000 - 5,000 IU daily (dose depending on your current vitamin D level) - take for three months after your vaccination. - Optimal Vitamin D level = 100 nmol/L - The BEST time have your vaccination jab is 11am for optimal immune response. - Healthy gut microbiome - - before and during the vaccination period, rectifying gut microbiome dysbiosis with prebiotic and probiotic supplementation will not only prime the immune system (as 80% comes from the gut!) but will also help reduce the possibility of adverse reactions. - - Probiotics - start taking 1 capsule twice daily ideally 2 weeks prior. - - Prebiotic fibre rich foods (refer to the 'Prebiotic Foods to Nourish Your Gut Microbiome' in my blog) and supplements such as Partailly Hydrolised Guar Gum, resistant starch, inulin, etc. - Sleep - - good quality sleep plays an important role in immunity. Research has shown that people sleeping less than 6 hours a night on average were 11.5 times less likely to mount an antibody response to the vaccine. Refer to the ['Improve Your Sleep'](https://naturaltherapeutics.com.au/2021/08/diet-and-lifestyle-recommendations-to-improve-sleep/)blog. - - Key nutrients and herbs to improve sleep: - -Magnesium - -Passionflower, Californian poppy, Jamaican dogwood, Withania, Magnolia, Zizyphus - - Key nutrients and herbs to improve sleep: - Stress management - - for the best results make sure you are calm and relaxed around vaccinating. This can be easier said than done, so here's some suggestions that can help: - - B group vitamins - - Magnesium - - Herbs to support the nervous system and adrenals - - Meditation - - Exercise - Reducing pre-exisiting inflammation - - Good quality fish oil - 4 - 6g daily - - Turmeric - 2 - 6g daily - Healthy weight - - research has shown that vaccines do not work as effectively in people who are overweight.
