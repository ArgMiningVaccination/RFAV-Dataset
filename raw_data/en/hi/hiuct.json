An ineffective solution is one that simply hides symptomatology temporarily and perhaps even creates new problems to add to the original one. Unfortunately, many medical solutions, like prescription medications, fall into the latter category. Natural solutions, such as essential oils, tend to fall into the former category. What Are Essential Oils? Essential oils have long been used by many different cultures for a variety of medicinal and health purposes. They are created by distilling or extracting different parts of plants, such as flowers, leaves, bark, roots, resin and peels, which means that they are highly concentrated and therefore highly potent. For example, it would take roughly four thousand pounds of Bulgarian roses in order to extract a single pound of essential oil. Essential Oils and Your Health As essential oils have increased in popularity so too have the number of essential oil products on the market increased. Unfortunately, this can present a problem for uninformed consumers as not all essential oils are created equally. It is important to look for high-quality, therapeutic-grade oils, ones that are pure, medicinal and steam distilled. When you find a high-quality essential oil you should never apply it directly to your skin as it may very well cause irritation or other reactions-unless it is specifically designated for topical use. Essential oils that are used topically should be diluted either with water or with a gentle carrier oil, such as jojoba or almond oil, and they should never be ingested without medical supervision and direction. Essential oils have natural antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties without also causing any side effects. They are used for aromatherapy, household cleaning products, personal beauty care and natural medicine treatments. The natural smells provided by essential oils can help an individual to relax or sleep, improve their skin or digestion and much, much more. Some of the more popular and beneficial essential oils include: - Tea Tree. This essential oil, which is distilled from the Australian Melaleuca alternifloria plant, is very good for treating skin issues like fungus and blemishes. - Lavender.
