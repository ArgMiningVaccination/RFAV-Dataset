It provides information about the examinations, applic ation and examination procedures, program policies, examination content, and scoring. About the Examination Purpose of the Examination The purpose of the Pan -Canadian examinations is to determine if candidates have acquired the minimum entry -level compe tency for p ractice as a TCM Practitioner, TCM Acupuncturist and/or TCM Herbalist to be considered for registration by the provincial regulatory body. The public is thus protected when receiving treatment from registered professionals. The examination(s) mu st be written by all candidates, including graduates from Canada and those completing their education outside of Canada. The e xamination is designed to assess knowledge, skills and abilities required for practice. A passing result on the examination indic ates that the candidate has demonstrated the minimal standard of competence. A fail result indicates that the candidate has not yet demonstrated the minimal standard of competence. Each Pan-Canadian examination consists of two parts: a written and a clinical case -study component . For some regulatory bodies, c andidates are required to pass the written examination before advancing to take the clinical case -study examination. Please refer to the examination application package of your regulatory body for the specific policy related to the sequencing of the examination papers. Written Examination Length of written examinations There will be three written examination papers . The Pan -Canadian Written Examination for TCM Practitioners . This paper will have three sections: one to assess competencies that are common (applicable to both TCM acupuncture and TCM herbology), one section relating solely to TCM a cupuncture ; and one section relating solely to TCM h erbology . It will consist of approximately 200 -210 multip le-choice questions. Candidates will have 4 hours to complete this examination. The Pan -Canadian Written Examination for TCM Acupuncturists .

Code of Conduct for the Examination Candidates are subject to the Rules of Conduct as described below. Candidates who contravene the Rules of Conduct may be denied participation, may have results invalidated and/or may be denied admission to the examination. Each candidate, by t he act of participating in a Pan - Canadian examination, agrees to abide by the following Code of Conduct. 1. Candidates acknowledge that the examination and the items therein are the exclusive property of the r egulatory body. 2. Candidates acknowledge that they CANNOT remove any part of the examination from the test site, nor can they give or receive assistance from another candidate during the examination. 3.

Candidates acknowledge that their participation in any act of cheating, as described below, m ay be sufficient cause for the r egulatory body to terminate their participation, to invalidate t he results of their examination or to take any other n ecessary action. 5. Cheating refers to any act or omission by a candidate that could affect the result of that candidate, another candidate or a potential future candidate. These acts include: a) non-eligible individuals posing as eligible candidates; b) bringing study or reference materials to the test area; c) giving or receiving assistance to or from another candidate during the examination; d) removing or attempting to remove examination material by any means, electronic or otherwise, from the testing site; and 10 e) recei ving or giving information about the written component or the clinical component either before or after1 the examination. For example, releasing information ab out questions such as diagnosis or tasks and activities involved in the examination. Note: this i ncludes discussing examination items or other information about the examination with examiners or other candidates after the examinations . Protocol in the Event of Suspected Cheating 1. If the ex aminers and/or examination invigilators suspect that cheating ma y have occurred, they may confiscate a candidate's test materials, as well as other documents or objects or materials that could be used for cheating, and require the candidate or other person(s) to leave the examination site.

Candidates may be asked to change their seats during the examination if they are suspected of cheating. 3. The examiners and/or the examination invigilators shall report any suspected cheating to the registrar or designate (herein known as the \"Head Invigilator\"). 4.

Cheating may be declared at any time after a candidate has registered and includes the time after the examination as well as afte r results have been released. 7.

The Head Invigilator shall report findi ngs to the regulatory body . The candidate may be prosecu ted.

Information gained in debriefing could act as an unfair advantage to unsuccessful candidates on future examinations. Confidentiality of information should be considered in the same way as confidentiality of patient information; the duty to maintain confidentiality is continuous. 11 Scoring Setting the Passing Score: Written and Clinical Case -Study Examinations Marking the Examination: Written Examination The computer answer sheets are e lectronically scanned and sc ored. It is very important that these answer sheets are filled out correctly. Quality control reports and checks are done during and after marking to ensure accuracy. Each multiple -choice question is worth one point. A correct answer receives a score of one point and an incorrect answer receives a score of zero. There is no penalty for incorrect or blank responses. If you are not certain, select your best option. The passing score for the examination is set by the Examination Co mmittee using the modified Angoff method. The modified Angoff method is one of the most widely used and accepted methods for establishing the passing score in registration/licensure examinations. The modified Angoff method requires each member of the commi ttee to independently rate each question on the examination in terms of the minimally competent candidate. The minimally competent candidate can be conceptualized as the candidate possessing the minimum level of knowledge and skills necessary to perform at a registration/licensure level. To do the rating, the committee members ask themselves \"what percentage of minimally competent candidates will answer this question correctly?\" The ratings from all members are then collated and tabulated to achieve the average rating per item. These ratings are then averaged to obtain the passing s core for the total examination. A candidate's total score is computed using the total number of correct answers selected by the candidate. The total score is compared to the pass ing score to designate their pass/fail status. The status of \"pass\" is reported for candidates who's total score meets or exceeds the passing score; the status of \"fail\" is reported for candidates who's total score is below the passing score. Marking the Examination: Clinical Case -Study Examination Each case -study examination situation, depending on the components of the question, will be scored on a scale ranging from 0 (no understanding of the problem) to 4 points (complete response). The final mark for a candidate is simply the sum of all score points for the clinical case-study questions. The passing score for the examination is set by the Examination Committee using the extended Angoff method. Instead of asking participants to estimate the probability of a correct response on a multiple -choice question, the participants will be asked to indicate the score a minimally competent candidate would obtain out of the maximum points allowed for the question. Th us, the passing score for the exam is the average r ating of all the participants ' standard -setting responses . Examination R esults A candidate must pass both the written and clinical case -study components of the examination to be considered for registration as a TCM Practitioner, TCM Acupuncturist or TCM Herbalist. Results will NOT be given over the telephone or by fax for reasons of confidentiality. 12 Refer to the examination application package of your regulatory body for more information on when to expect results and the method of how you will receive t hem (e.g. , mail, e -mail, online).

The regulatory body will determine whether a refund of should be issued to the candidate. If an exam is disrupted through circumstances beyond the control of the examination site and the regulatory body (such as power failure or extreme weather), the invigilator will contact the regulatory body about adjusting the timing of the examination. On examination day, if you cannot reach the examination site because of circumstances beyond your c ontrol, you must contact you r regulatory body before the start of the examination.
