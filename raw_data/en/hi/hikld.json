Despite the highly successful vaccination strategies, the number of cases among vaccine preventable diseases has increased in the last decade and several of those diseases are still endemic in different countries. Here we discuss some epidemiological aspects and possible arguments that may explain why ancient diseases such as, measles, polio, pertussis, diphtheria and tuberculosis are still with us. diphtheria; measles; pertussis; polio; Vaccination is still the most successful method to prevent infectious diseases. Since the introduction of public immunization against smallpox by Jenner in the 18th century, vaccines have drastically reduced the number of deaths caused by infectious diseases. The best achievement of immunization programs are the induction of long-term protection against life-threatening consequences of infectious disease. This is obtained by the generation of protective immunity elected by antibodies and antigen specific B and T cells, which lead to protection. Despite global public health successes of vaccines, to date, the only eradicated disease is smallpox. Nevertheless, several other diseases were eliminated, meaning it stopped circulating in certain region of the globe, for example polio in the United States by the end of 70s and in Brazil by the end of the 80\u00b4s (Albert et al. 2001ALBERT MR, OSTHEIMER KG AND BREMAN JG. 2001. The last smallpox epidemic in Boston and the vaccination controversy. N Engl J Med 344(5): 375-379. , eradication initiative. http://www.polioeradication.org/http [http://www.polioeradication.org/http... ](http://www.polioeradication.org/http)a). There are several reasons that may explain the permanence of certain diseases, preventing its eradication. These reasons range from the rise of more virulent clones that are resistant to vaccine-induced immunization (Zakikhany and Efstratiou 2012ZAKIKHANY K AND EFSTRATIOU A. 2012. Diphtheria in Europe: current problems and new challenges. Future Microbiol 7(5): 595-607., Mills et al. 2014MILLS KGH, ROSS PJ, ALLEN AC AND WILK MM. 2014. Do we need a new vaccine to control the re-emergence of pertussis? Trend Microbiol 22(2): 49-52.), to more recent observations in which parents choosenot to vaccinate their children, due to concerns about vaccine safety. All this contributed to the resurgence of certain vaccine preventable diseases (Wolfe and Sharpe 2002WOLFE RM AND SHARPE LK. 2002. Anti-vaccinationists past and present. BMJ 325(7361): 430-432., Godlee et al. 2011GODLEE F, SMITH J AND MARCOVITCH H. 2011. Wakefield's article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent. BMJ 342: c7452. , of vaccines http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/history-anti-vaccination-movements [http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content... ](http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/history-anti-vaccination-movements)). In fact, anti-vaccination movements exist since the first immunization campaigns. Futhermore, public opinion may vary for several reasons depending of cultural or religious points of view. Controversies over the efficacy, safety, and morality of compulsory immunization stem from the longstanding tension between two, sometimes divergent, goals: to protect individual liberties and safeguard the public's health (Rodgers et al. 1993RODGERS DV, GINDLER JS, ATKINSON WL AND MARKOWITZ LE. 1993. High attack rates and case fatality during a measles outbreak in groups with religious exemption to vaccination. Pediatr Infect Dis J 12(4): 288-292., Parmet et al. 2005PARMET WE, GOODMAN RA AND FARBER A. 2005. Individual rights versus the public's health - 100 years after Jacobson v. Massachusetts. N Engl J Med 352(7): 652-653., Salmon and Omer 2006SALMON DA AND OMER SB. 2006. Individual freedoms versus collective responsibility: Immunization decision making in the face of occasionally repeating values. Emerg Themes Epidemiol 3: 13.). In addition, compromised vaccination in several war areas, such as Syria (Aylward and Alwan 2014AYLWARD RB AND ALWAN A. 2014. Polio in Syria. Lancet 383(9916): 489-491.) and Afghanistan (Rutter and Donaldson 2014RUTTER PD AND DONALDSON LJ. 2014. Mandatory polio vaccination for travellers: protecting global public health. The Lancet 383 (9930): 1695-1697.) exposed these populations to different disease burdens. Furthermore, international travelling strongly contributes to disease spreading worldwide: in this scenario unvaccinated and immunocompromised groups are at the highest risk, and also may work as carries. For this reason, immunocompromised people - HIV, elderly, transplanted and cancer patients - should avoid travelling to endemic area, such as western Africa or south Asia (India, Pakistan and Afghanistan) where polio transmission still occurs. As a rule, live vaccines should be avoided in severely immunocompromised travelers due to risk of dissemination. However, in special circumstances, the use of inactivated vaccines could be an alternative. Elderly people are also particularly susceptible to infections and therefore preventive vaccination is crucial. However, this population presents a lower ability to mount an effective immune response to vaccination since both innate and adaptive immune system functions are affected by aging. Due to the increase of incidence of pertussis in adults, vaccination against the disease is strongly recommended in US for example. Vaccination of the elderly remains the best strategy to prevent infection, but is suboptimal because of immunosenescence. Thus, lifelong vaccination programs should be promoted in order to achieve the herd immunity threshold, moving from the current concept of childhood-based vaccination to a more balanced lifelong vaccination schedules (Lang and Aspinall 2012LANG PO AND ASPINALL R. 2012. Immunosenescence and herd immunity: with an ever-in-creasing aging population do we need to rethink vaccine schedules? Expert Rev Vaccines 11(2): 167-176. ). Polio, measles and pertussis (whooping cough) are diseases related with recent outbreaks. Moreover, tuberculosis and diphtheria remain observed and are endemic in several areas of the globe. Endemic diseases and outbreaks are particularly threatening since the microbe can easily be spread by traveling residents and visitors. Furthermore, unvaccinated people are vulnerable and may serve as reservoirs, increasing the problem. Here, we will focus on bacterial and viral diseases that, despite high vaccination rates, are still endemic or have re-emerged in the past decade. Measles Measles is a viral disease caused by members of the genus Morbillivirus. The disease is preventable by immunization with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Measles is a potentially deadly viral disease, especially for unvaccinated children. It spreads easily from person to person via droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of infected people. Symptoms include high fever, running nose, bloodshot eyes and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth followed by a rash on the face and upper neck and gradually spreading downwards. Most people recover within 2-3 weeks, however measles can cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia, particularly in malnourished children and people with reduced immunity (WHO 2014b WHO. 2014b. Measles. http://www.who.int/topics/measles/en/ [http://www.who.int/topics/measles/en/... ](http://www.who.int/topics/measles/en/)). Nowadays, because the disease has been absent in several countries, the symptoms of measles are not always easily identified by doctors and parents leading to misidentification of cases. Measles is endemic in several areas of the globe ( [Fig. 1]()). In 2013, 194.139 cases of measles were reported and 145.700 deaths documented worldwide (WHO 2014c WHO. 2014c. Measles reported cases http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tsincidencemeasles.html [http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitor... ](http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tsincidencemeasles.html)). The disease returned in countries where it was considered eliminated. In the US for example, 644 cases of measles were reported in 2014, three times more than what was observed in 2013. The majority of people who got measles had not been vaccinated (CDC 2014CDC. 2014a. Measles cases and outbreaks. http://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html [http://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbrea... ](http://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html)a). This is particularly frightening, because the disease was considered eliminated since 2000. In Brazil, cases of measles also increased reaching more than 200 cases in 2013 ( [Fig. 2]()A) (WHO 2014g WHO. 2014g. global summary. http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary [http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitor... ](http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary)). - Measles global annual reported cases (2009-2013). Countries are distributed by regions; data summarized from WHO (2014) http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/ globalsummary/timeseries/tsincidencemeasles.html - Measles, pertussis and diphtheria annual reported cases in Brazil (2003-2013). A, measles; B, pertussis; C, diphtheria; data summarized from WHO (2014); http://apps. who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary Several studies have reported associations between measles antibody concentration and HIV infection and exposure; for example, infants born to HIV-infected women have lower levels of measles-specific transplacental antibodies, potentially leaving these infants at greater risk of infection before they receive the scheduled measles vaccination. Other reports have shown that HIV infection is associated with greater severity of measles disease, higher mortality and prolonged measles virus shedding (Polonsky et al. 2015POLONSKY JA, SINGH B, MASIKU C, LANGENDORF C, KAGOLI M, HURTADO N, BERTHELOT M, HEINZELMANN A, PUREN A AND GRAIS RF. 2015. Exploring HIV infection and susceptibility to measles among older children and adults in Malawi: a facility-based study. Int J Infect Dis 31: 61-67. ). Most importantly, the increase of measles in the US and other industrialized countries resulted from anti-vaccination movements which started 16 years ago following the statements made by a British doctor named Andrew Wakefield. Wakefield associated the MMR vaccine with diseases such as bowel disease and autism, arguing that the vaccine had not been properly tested prior to being used. Another argument of the anti-vaccination groups was that thimerosal, a mercury-containing compound used as a preservative in many vaccines, was associated with autism, however these claims were never proved (CDC 2014bCDC. 2014b. Frequently asked questions about thimerosal ](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/Thimerosal/thimerosal_faqs.html), Williamson 1984WILLIAMSON S. 1984. leagues.

Following the claims made by these doctors, several groups of parents started a movement to reduce vaccination, generating public confusion and fear about vaccine safety. Additionally, some religious groups refuse vaccination, increasing their vulnerability to infectious that can spread quickly (Salmon and Siegel 2001SALMON DA AND SIEGEL AW. 2001. Religious and philosophical exemptions from vaccine requirements and lessons learned from conscientious objectors from conscription. Public Health Rep 116(4): 289-295., Salmon and Omer 2006SALMON DA AND OMER SB. 2006. Individual freedoms versus collective responsibility: Immunization decision making in the face of occasionally repeating values. Emerg Themes Epidemiol 3: 13.). Even though, Wakefield's publication was retracted and evidences showed that he committed scientific fraud and gained financial profit by falsifying data (Godlee et al. 2011GODLEE F, SMITH J AND MARCOVITCH H. 2011. Wakefield's article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent. BMJ 342: c7452. ), the damage had already been done. Recently, a systematic investigation reviewed more than 20.000 studies on adverse events of vaccines used for routine immunization of children from US (Maglione et al. 2014MAGLIONE MA, DAS L, RAAEN L, SMITH A, CHARI R, NEWBERRY S, SHANMAN R, PERRY T, GOETZ MB AND GIDENGIL C. 2014. Safety of vaccines used for routine immunization of U.S. children: a systematic review. Pediatrics 134(2): 325-337.). The authors concluded that some vaccines are associated with adverse events; however these events are extremely rare and must be weighed against the protective benefits that vaccines provide. Adverse events, such as, sore arm or allergic reactions are tracked. Importantly, while all vaccines carry some small level of risk, the dangers of the illness exceed by far the dangers of the immunization (CDC 2014cCDC. 2014c. Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) Maglione et 2014MAGLIONE MA, DAS L, SMITH A, CHARI R, NEWBERRY S, SHANMAN R, PERRY T, GOETZ MB AND GIDENGIL C. 2014. Safety of vaccines used for routine immunization of U.S. children: a systematic review. Pediatrics 134(2): 325-337.). Although a large number of studies have demonstrated that there is no correlation between MMR vaccine and autism, anti-vaccine movements are still active and some parents are refusing to vaccinate their children (Stratton et al. 2001STRATTON K, GABLE A, SHETTY P AND MCCORMICK M. 2001. Immunization safety review: Measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism. Washington, DC: Institute of Medicine, National Academies Press., Maltezou and Wicker 2013MALTEZOU HC AND WICKER S. 2013. Measles in health-care settings. Am J Infect Control 41(7): 661-663.). Polio Poliomyelitis, infantile paralysis or simply polio is a viral disease caused by a poliovirus. In most (90 to 95%) people, the infection causes no symptoms , the remaining 5 to 10% present fever, diarrhea, headache, vomiting, neck rigorousness and pains in the arms and legs. The most severe cases of polio lead to paralysis and death (WHO 2014d WHO. 2014d. Poliomyelitis. http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs114/en/ [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheet... ](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs114/en/)). In the 80's polio affected around 350.000 people in 125 countries. At that time, the World Health Assembly decided to launch the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. In 2000, there was a reduction of 99% in the number of cases and in 2002 polio was eliminated in 118 countries (WHO 2014aWHO. 2014a. Polio global eradication initiative. http://www.polioeradication.org/http [http://www.polioeradication.org/http... ](http://www.polioeradication.org/http)). Despite the excellent progress to control the disease spread, polio is still endemic in Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan ( [Fig. 3]()) ASAD ALI AND ZAIDI ANITA KM. 2013. Review Pakistan's expanded program on immunization: An overview in the context of polio eradication and strategies for improving coverage. Vaccine 31(33): to the fact that the maintenance of the circulating virus is a constant threat to countries were polio was eliminated. In these countries, since 2011, 770 individuals, mainly young children, were paralyzed by polio (WHO 2014eWHO. 2014e. Case breakdown by country. http://www.polioeradication.org/dataandmonitoring/poliothisweek.aspx [http://www.polioeradication.org/dataandm... ](http://www.polioeradication.org/dataandmonitoring/poliothisweek.aspx)). Nigeria and Pakistan have also exported wild poliovirus to no fewer than 20 other countries, affecting an additional 470 people (Rutter and Donaldson 2014RUTTER PD AND DONALDSON LJ. 2014. Mandatory polio vaccination for travellers: protecting global public health. The Lancet 383 (9930): 1695-1697.). - Polio global annual reported cases (2009-2014). Countries are distributed by regions; data summarized from WHO (2014); http://apps.who.int/immunization_ monitoring/globalsummary; http://www.polioeradication.org/ dataandmonitoring/poliothisweek.aspx Religious objections may contribute to endemic scenario in these countries. For example, in Southern Afghanistan the local Taliban called polio vaccination an American strategy to sterilize Muslim populations. Resistance to vaccination has even resulted in violent beatings and kidnappings (Warraich 2009WARRAICH HJ. 2009. Religious opposition to polio vaccine. Emerg Infect Dis 15(6): 978.). Similar objections halted polio vaccination campaigns in Nigeria years ago. In 2003, religious leaders in three different Nigerian states claimed that the vaccines were contaminated with HIV, sterilization and cancer-causing agents, despite tests confirming the vaccine's safety (Clements et al. 2006CLEMENTS CJ, GREENOUGH P AND SHULL D. 2006. How vaccine safety can become political - the example of polio in Nigeria. Curr Drug Safety 1(1): 117-119. , Jegede 2007JEGEDE AS. 2007. What led to the Nigerian boycott of the polio vaccination campaign? PLOS Med 4(3): e73.). In 2013, a wild poliovirus spread from Pakistan to Syria, where it caused a substantial outbreak in the midst of civil war (Aylward and Alwan 2014AYLWARD RB AND ALWAN A. 2014. Polio in Syria. Lancet 383(9916): 489-491.). Polio was considered eliminated in Syria 15 years ago, but now, because of defective child immunization caused by the civil war, there is a high risk that the disease could become endemic. Civil war also makes the surveillance difficult, therefore, several cases may be unaccounted for (Butler 2013BUTLER D. 2013. Polio risk looms over Europe. Nature 502(7473): 601-602.; Roberts 2014ROBERTS L. 2014. A war within a war. Science 343(6177): 1302-1305.). Healthy authorities alert that this is an emergency not just for Syria, where millions of kids are at risk, but also for surrounding countries, including Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq, as refugees pour across the borders (Rutter and Donaldson 2014RUTTER PD AND DONALDSON LJ. 2014. Mandatory polio vaccination for travellers: protecting global public health. The Lancet 383 (9930): 1695-1697., Roberts 2014ROBERTS L. 2014. A war within a war. Science 343(6177): 1302-1305.). Inadequate surveillance and suboptimal vaccination rates bring a real risk outbreak. In addition, many cases of polio do not present easily recognizable symptoms and, as a result, an infected person can remain unnoticed and spread the virus (Butler 2013BUTLER D. 2013. Polio risk looms over Europe. Nature 502(7473): 601-602.). Recent international spread of wild poliovirus has created a particularly complex outbreak of polio. Even though Europe is considered free of polio since 2002, surprisingly it is now vulnerable since poliovirus has re-emerged in Israel and Syria. Most countries in Europe use inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) for immunization. IPV protects against all polio strains and induces a high level of individual protection, but it provides poor gut immunity. An alternative to IPV is the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), a weakened form of the live virus that provides strong gut immunity. It has been used for mass vaccinations and outbreak control because it is effective, cheap and easy to administer. However, in rare cases it can cause polio, so polio-free countries prefer to use IPV, which carries no such risk (Butler 2013BUTLER D. 2013. Polio risk looms over Europe. Nature 502(7473): 601-602.). For that reason, the US for example, uses IPV, while in Brazil both vaccines are used for children (SBIM 2014SBIM. 2014. Vacina\u00e7\u00e3o. Calend\u00e1rio SBIM. http://www.sbim.org.br/vacinacao/ [http://www.sbim.org.br/vacinacao/... ](http://www.sbim.org.br/vacinacao/)). Given the weaknesses in European polio defenses, the extensive levels of travel between Europe and Israel (42 infected people with no symptoms) and the millions of refugees fleeing Syria, there is a real risk of outbreaks in the European Union (EU) (Butler 2013BUTLER D. 2013. Polio risk looms over Europe. Nature 502(7473): 601-602.). To prevent disease spreading, the new recommendations from WHO recommends residents and long term visitors to receive one dose of the vaccine (IPV or OPV) between 4 weeks and 12 months before international travel, and that those who are undertaking urgent travel have one dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure (Rutter and Donaldson 2014RUTTER PD AND DONALDSON LJ. 2014. Mandatory polio vaccination for travellers: protecting global public health. The Lancet 383 (9930): 1695-1697.). The international spread of wild poliovirus in 2014 is a public health emergency of international concern that shows how the world is vulnerable. Pertussis Pertussis is an acute respiratory tract infection caused by Bordetella pertussis. Clinical manifestations include fever and a cough illness lasting at least 2 weeks with one of the following: paroxysms of coughing, inspiratory \"whoop,\" or posttussive vomiting, without other apparent cause (WHO 2014f WHO. 2014f. Health topics. Pertussis. http://www.who.int/topics/pertussis/en/ [http://www.who.int/topics/pertussis/en/... remains endemic ( [Fig 4]()A) and life-threatening, especially for the very young, mainly in unimmunized children in developing countries, with significant morbidity and mortality. In 2013, 136.036 cases and 89.000 deaths were reported. (WHO 2014f WHO. 2014f. Health topics. Pertussis. http://www.who.int/topics/pertussis/en/ [http://www.who.int/topics/pertussis/en/... ](http://www.who.int/topics/pertussis/en/)). - Pertussis global annual cases. A, annual cases in the world (2009-2013), countries are distributed by regions; B, pertussis cases in the US, Australia and UK (1980-2013); data summarized from WHO (2014) and CDC (2014); http://apps. who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary; http:// www.cdc.gov/pertussis/outbreaks/trends.html There are 2 types of vaccines against pertussis, a whole cell (Pw) preparation which is composed of inactivated bacterial whole-cell, and a subunit vaccine also known as pertussis acellular (Pa), that contains purified pertussis antigens such as pertussis toxin and filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA) (Witt et al. 2013WITT MA, ARIAS L, KATZ PH, TRUONG ET AND WITT DJ. 2013. Reduced risk of pertussis among persons ever vaccinated with whole cell pertussis vaccine compared to recipients of acellular pertussis vaccines in a large US cohort. Clin Infect Dis 56(9): 1248-1254.; [http://www.who.int/biologicals/areas/vac... ](http://www.who.int/biologicals/areas/vaccines/apertussis/en/)). Both Pw and Pa vaccines are mixed with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and absorbed in aluminum adjuvant (DTP vaccine). Because of its toxicity, the Pw preparation was discontinued in several countries such as the UK and US, however in Brazil both Pw and Pa remain on vaccine schedule (SBIM 2014SBIM. 2014. Vacina\u00e7\u00e3o. Calend\u00e1rio SBIM. http://www.sbim.org.br/vacinacao/ [http://www.sbim.org.br/vacinacao/... ](http://www.sbim.org.br/vacinacao/)). Although, considered safer, the Pa vaccine does not induce a robust immune response as compared to the Pw vaccine, since the effectiveness of acellular vaccines in preventing typical whooping cough ranges from 59% to 85%. It was demonstrated that having a whole-cell vaccine as any part of the vaccination series improved immunity (Sheridan et al. 2012SHERIDAN SL, WARE RS, GRIMWOOD K AND LAMBERT SB. 2012. Number and order of whole cell pertussis vaccines in infancy and disease protection. JAMA 308(5): 454-456., Witt et al. 2013WITT MA, ARIAS L, KATZ PH, TRUONG ET AND WITT DJ. 2013. Reduced risk of pertussis among persons ever vaccinated with whole cell pertussis vaccine compared to recipients of acellular pertussis vaccines in a large US cohort. Clin Infect Dis 56(9): 1248-1254.). In addition it was shown that Pa may protect against the disease, but does not prevent bacterial infection and transmission (Warfel et al. 2013WARFEL JM, ZIMMERMAN LI AND MERKEL TJ. 2013. Acellular pertussis vaccines protect against disease but fail to prevent infection and transmission in a nonhuman primate model. PNAS 111(2): 787-792.). Pertussis incidence increased dramatically in US, Australia and UK ( [Fig. 4]()B) (CDC global summary. http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary [http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitor... ](http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary)).This re-emergence was also observed in Brazil where more than 5000 cases were reported in 2013 ( [Fig. 2]()B). It remains unclear why is pertussis incidence rising in different countries worldwide. Several considerations could explain the reason for this phenomenon. One strong argument is that the switch from Pw to Pa in the mid-1990s reduced the vaccine efficacy. Another possibility is that antigenic variation of circulating B. pertussis strains decrease protection against antigens used in the Pa vaccine. Alternatively, it is possible that Pa does not include the combination of B. pertussis components required to induce the appropriate antigen-specific immune responses that mediate protection (Mills et al 2014). In addition, the immunity generated by pertussis natural infection or by the vaccine is not long-term (Guiso 2014GUISO N. 2014. Bordetella pertussis: Why is it still circulating? J Infec 68: S119-24.). Furthermore, reduction in vaccination rates against pertussis may also contribute to disease burden (Gangarosa et al. 1998GANGAROSA EJ, GALAZKA AM, WOLFE CR, PHILLIPS LM, GANGAROSA RE, MILLER E AND CHEN RT. 1998. Impact of anti-vaccine movements on pertussis control: The untold story. The Lancet 351(9099): 356-361., Baker 2003BAKER J. 2003. The pertussis vaccine controversy in Great Britain, 1974-1986. Vaccine 21: 4003-4011.). It is important to point out that the diagnosis of B. pertussisis particularly difficult. The bacteria can be isolated in a small period of time (catahral stage) during the course of the disease, plus the microbe is only found in the nasopharynges making the clinical specimen recovery challenging for unprepared staff. Besides that, the disease incidence is increasing not only in children, but also in adults and adolescents that sometimes do not present the classical disease symptoms (Clark 2014CLARK TA. 2014. Changing pertussis epidemiology: everything old is new again. JID Blaylock 2014HARTZELL JD AND BLAYLOCK Cough in 2014 and Beyond. Chest 146(1): 205-214.). Altogether, these factors may contribute to the misdiagnosis of pertussis in several areas, including Brazil. Disease surveillance, with standardized, biological diagnostic methods, is required. Such diagnosis must be both sensitive and specific. In addition, improvement of the vaccine to induce long-term immunity is urgent (Melvin et al. 2014MELVIN JA, SCHELLER EV, MILLER JF AND COTTER PA. 2014. Bordetella pertussis pathogenesis: current and challenges. Nature Rev Microbiol 12(4): 274-288. , Guiso 2014GUISO N. circulating? J Infec 68: et al. BD AND MESSIONNIER NE. 2014.

Diphtheria Diphtheria is an infection of the upper respiratory tract caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Besides the throat, the microbe may be isolated from leishmaniotic ulcers, and other atypical body sites, such as the ears, conjunctiva, vagina, sperm, heart valves and in cancer patient lesions (Mattos-Guaraldi et al. 2003MATTOS-GUARALDI AL ET AL. 2011.

The major virulence factor of C. diphtheriae is the diphtheria toxin, a potent molecule of 58kDa witch a systemic effect lead to protein synthesis inhibition and cell death, especially in high perfusion organs. The vaccine formulation contains inactivated toxin (toxoid) aluminum hydroxide and [http://www.immunizationinfo.org/vaccines... ](http://www.immunizationinfo.org/vaccines/diphtheria)). Between 1920 and 1950, widespread vaccination was implemented across Western Europe, Russia and North America resulting in a significant reduction of diphtheria incidence, and the onset of World War II coincided with the last diphtheria pandemic in western civilized countries. In Brazil, the disease incidence dropped gradually since the 80's, but it is still endemic ( [Fig. 2]()C) (Mattos-Guaraldi AND HIRATA J\u00daNIOR R. 2003. Diphtheria remains a threat to health in the developing world--an overview. Mem 2014 global summary. http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary [http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitor... ](http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary)). As a consequence of these widely implemented vaccination programs, global diphtheria incidence declined approximately 70% between 1970 and 1980 (Rappuoli et al. 2014RAPPUOLI R, PIZZA M, DEL GIUDICE G AND DE GREGORIO E. 2014. Vaccines, new opportunities for a new society. PNAS 111(34): 12288-12293. , Ganeshalingham et al. 2012). Despite the successful immunization program against diphtheria, the disease returned massively in the 1990s with more than 150,000 cases and around 4000 deaths (1990-1998) in the Russian Federation and the newly independent States of the former Soviet Union (Galazka 2000GALAZKA A. 2000. The changing epidemiology of diphtheria in the vaccine era. J Infect Dis 181(Suppl1): S2-9., Zakikhany and Efstratiou 2012ZAKIKHANY K AND EFSTRATIOU A. 2012. Diphtheria in Europe: current problems and new challenges. Future Microbiol 7(5): 595-607.). Many factors contributed to the 1990s epidemic, including reduced vaccination coverage, increased adult susceptibility, large population movements and lack of adequate treatment and prevention (Zakikhany and Efstratiou 2012ZAKIKHANY K AND EFSTRATIOU A. 2012. Diphtheria in Europe: current problems and new challenges. Future Microbiol 7(5): 595-607.). Despite the implementation of widespread immunization, diphtheria remains endemic in some regions such as southeast Asia, with more than 3.750 cases reported in 2010 (WHO 2014k WHO. 2014k. Global and regional immunization profile. Number of reported cases. http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/gs_seaprofile.pdf?ua=1 [http://www.who.int/immunization/monitori... ](http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/gs_seaprofile.pdf?ua=1)). Although vaccination protects against toxin tissue damage, it does not prevent colonization or infection by the bacteria, thus immunized people may get ill or become asymptomatic carriers. The effectiveness of toxoid vaccination varies from 45% to 90%. It remains unclear however, why vaccinated people develop the disease. Some authors argue that mutations in the toxin gene reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine and that the genetic diversity of C. diphtheriae favors the emergence of outbreaks. It is possible that epidemic clones, different from the strain of C. diphtheriaebiovar. mitis Park-Williams (PW8), which is used in the production of the vaccine are not sensitive to vaccine induced immune response. In addition, the increased number of diseases caused by non-toxin producer C. dipthehriae alert to the necessity of studies for the development of more complete or alternative vaccine formulation (Wagner et al. 2012WAGNER KS, WHITE JM, LUCENKO I, MERCER D, CROWCROFT NS, NEAL S AND EFSTRATIOU A. 2012. Diphtheria in the postepidemic period, Europe, Infect AND EFSTRATIOU A. 2012. Diphtheria in Europe: current problems and new challenges. Future Microbiol 7(5): 595-607., 2004-2013. Emerg Infect Dis 19(11): 1870-1872.). Due to the high degree of susceptibility of children to diphtheria, vaccination at an early age is universally recommended (Fredlund et al. 2011FREDLUND H, NOR\u00c9N T, LEPP T, MORFELDT E AND HENRIQUES NORMARK B. 2011. A case of diphtheria in Sweden, October 2011. Euro Surveill 16(50): 20038.). However, the concentration of protective antibodies by the age of 14 years old is 50% lower than what is observed in younger children, and in adults protective antibodies decreases around 10% per year, therefore the development of new and better vaccines is necessary mainly for the elderly population. The second population with a high need of vaccines is adolescents (Rappuoli et al. 2014RAPPUOLI R, PIZZA M, DEL GIUDICE G AND DE GREGORIO E. 2014. Vaccines, new opportunities for a new society. PNAS 111(34): 12288-12293. ). For this reason, many countries, including Brazil, recommends booster doses of the vaccine every 10 years (SBIM 2014SBIM. 2014. Vacina\u00e7\u00e3o. Calend\u00e1rio SBIM. http://www.sbim.org.br/vacinacao/ [http://www.sbim.org.br/vacinacao/... ](http://www.sbim.org.br/vacinacao/)). Studies showed that to prevent disease outbreaks, it is necessary that 90% of children and 75% of adults exhibit satisfactory levels of antitoxin antibodies, i.e., 0.01 IU / mL of 2005. Prevalence of IgG diphtheria antitoxin in blood donors in Rio de AND MATTOS-GUARALDI AL. 2006. Diphtheria-neutralizing antibody levels in healthy adults from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz 101(4): 459-462.). Thus, more effective immunization strategies are necessary, aimed at all ages, ethnic and social groups. National and international serological studies have highlighted a reduction in the immunity of adults (Pimenta et AND MATTOS-GUARALDI AL. 2006. Diphtheria-neutralizing antibody levels in healthy adults from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz 101(4): 459-462., Sears et al. 2012SEARS A, MCLEAN M, HINGSTON D, EDDIE B, SHORT P AND JONES M. 2012. Cases of cutaneous diphtheria in New Zealand: implications for surveillance and management. N Z Med J 125(1350): 64-71.). However, even with the visible progress in global public health, there are still many reports arising from lack of vaccination. In Pakistan, an endemic zone, the general conception about diphtheria among the population is that it is a childhood disease (Faryal et al. 2013FARYAL R, NOREEN Z, TAHIR F AND ZAHID-UR- REHMAN. 2013. Seroprevalence of Corynebacterium diphtheriae among vaccinated population of Rawalpindi/Islamabad, Pakistan. Pak J Pharm Sei 26(3): 649-651.). However, the circulation of toxigenic strains is still observed in all parts of the world, posing a constant threat to the population with low levels of seroprotection, and the occurrence of diphtheria is characterized by periodicity and epidemic waves, with a high incidence and mortality (Zakikhany and Efstratiou 2012ZAKIKHANY K AND EFSTRATIOU A. 2012. Diphtheria in Europe: current problems and new challenges. Future Microbiol 7(5): 595-607.). Furthermore, toxigenic C. diphtheriae isolated from unusual non-respiratory sites, such as, urethritis involving toxigenic C. diphtheria transmitted by orogenital contact (Berger et al. 2013BERGER A, LENSING C, KONRAD R, HUBER I, HOGARDT M AND SING A. 2013. Sexually transmitted diphtheria. Sex Transm Infect 89(2): 100-101. ), may result in unusual manifestations of diphtheria-like disease. Thus, prompt subsequent public health actions are necessary. Tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic lower respiratory tract infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Besides the lungs, Mtb may achieve other organs, generating a wide range of clinical disease manifestations (Golden and Vikram 2005GOLDEN MP AND VIKRAM HR. 2005. Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis: An Fam 2011PFYFFER GE AND F. General Characteristics, Laboratory Detection, and Staining Procedures. In: Versalovic J, Carroll Landry ML and Warnock DW (Eds), Manual of Clinical Microbiology. 10th ed. Washington, DC: ASM Press 472. ). Despite the fact that TB is a threat to humans since antiquity, and one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide for centuries, there is neither effective vaccine nor treatment to stop the ongoing pandemic. In 2013, an estimated 9.0 million people developed TB and 1.5 million died from the disease (WHO 2014i WHO. 2014i. Tuerculosis. http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/en/ [http://www.who.int/tb/publications/globa... ](http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/en/)). In 1993, WHO declared tuberculosis a global emergency. Mtb is an intracellular microbe that infects alveolar macrophages. Approximately 70% of Mtb-exposed individuals will clear the bacteria, some will develop the disease and most of them will develop latent TB or non-clinical TB, where the bacteria remains physiologically inactive or dormant in the host (Cayabyab et al. 2012CAYABYAB MJ, MACOVEI L AND CAMPOS-NETO A. 2012. Current and novel approaches to vaccine development against tuberculosis. Front Cell Infec Microb 2: 154.). Latency is established by tuberculous granuloma formation, composed of a large number of immune cells - such as epithelial macrophages, neutrophils, T and B cells - which, altogether with a fibrous cuff, restrain Mtb from spreading. Only a fraction (5-10%) of latently infected hosts develop TB and can potentially infect new hosts (Barry et al. 2009BARRY CE, BOSHOFF HI, DARTOIS V, DICK T, EHRT S, FLYNN J, SCHNAPPINGER D, WILKINSON RJ AND YOUNG D. 2009. The spectrum of latent tuberculosis: rethinking the biology and intervention strategies. Nat Rev Microbiol 7(12): 845-855.). Latent TB is quite difficult to diagnose and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one third of the world's population is infected with Mtb (CDC [http://www.cdc.gov/tb/... ](http://www.cdc.gov/tb/)). latency is associated with changes in host's immune response and it is particularly threating for patients with some immunodeficiency. HIV infected individuals for example are more susceptible to developing latent TB reactivation in 20- to 37-fold, suggesting that the HIV pandemic may contributes to the maintenance of TB worldwide (Getahun et al. 2010GETAHUN H, GUNNEBERG C, GRANICH R AND NUNN P. 2010. HIV infection-associated tuberculosis: the epidemiology and the response. Clin Infect Dis 50(Suppl.3): S201-S207.). TB is the main cause of death in HIV patients (~29%) (Pawlowski et al. 2012PAWLOWSKI A, JANSSON M, SKOLD M, ROTTENBERG ME AND KALLENIUS G. 2012. and HIV co- PLoS Pathog 8(2): e1002464. ). Additionally, multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extremely drug-resistant (XDR-TB) Mtb also contributes to disease burden. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to, at least, isoniazid and rifampicin among first-line drugs, while XDR-TB refers to MDR-TB with additional resistance to, any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three second-line injectable drugs (i.e. capreomycin, kanamycin and amikacin). Their development is mainly associated with inadequate and inappropriate use of antimicrobial therapy (WHO 2014j WHO. 2014j. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) http://www.who.int/tb/challenges/mdr/en/ ](http://www.who.int/tb/challenges/mdr/en/)). proportion of new cases with MDR-TB was 3.5% in 2013 and has not changed in recent years. However, some countries (especially in Eastern Europe and the Russian Federation) are experiencing serious MDR-TB epidemics. This translates into an estimated 480.000 people having developed MDR-TB in 2013. On average, an estimated 9.0% of them had XDR-TB. (MDR-TB) http://www.who.int/tb/challenges/mdr/en/ [http://www.who.int/tb/challenges/mdr/en/... ](http://www.who.int/tb/challenges/mdr/en/)). Social marginalization is often responsible for limited access to health services leading to diagnostic delay, clinical worsening and poor adherence to treatment, and eventually to a less favourable outcome (Sulis et al. 2014SULIS G, ROGGI A, MATTEELLI AND MC. 2014. J Hematol Infect Dis 6(1): e2014070. ). Therefore, poverty is not only one of the major causes of MDR-TB, but it is also one of the great barriers to treatment, making MDR-TB a huge challenge on TB eradication. Recent observations suggest that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is a risk factor for TB. Smoking leads to faster and more severe progression of tuberculosis, but it is still unclear if the cigarette smoke (CS) compromises anti-TB immunity, increases Mtb transmission or both (Altet-G\u00f4mez et al. 2005ALTET-G\u00d4MEZ MN, ALCAIDE J, GODOY P, ROMERO MA AND HERN\u00c1NDEZ DEL REY I. 2005. Clinical and epidemiological aspects of smoking and tuberculosis: a study of 13.038 cases. Int J Tuberc Lung Dis 9(4): 430-436., Chan et al. 2014CHAN ED, KINNEY WH, HONDA JR, BISHWAKARMA R, GANGAVELLI A, MYA J, BAI X AND ORDWAY DJ. 2014. Tobacco exposure and susceptibility to tuberculosis: Is there a smoking gun? Tuberculosis 94(6): 544-550., Davies et al. DAVIDOW AL, REICHMAN LB, DHEDA K AND ROOK GA. 2006. Smoking and tuberculosis: the epidemiological association and immunopathogenesis. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg 100(4): 291-298. ). In addition, passive smoking seems to be an important risk factor for TB especially in children (Lin et al. 2007LIN HH, EZZATI M AND MURRAY M. 2007. Tobacco Smoke, Indoor Air Pollution and Tuberculosis: A Systematic Review and meta-analysis. PLoS Med 4(1): e20. ). Although drugs and diagnostic tests have an essential place in disease control, the best way to control any infectious disease is through preventive vaccination, however, the current vaccine, bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), is far from adequate. The main limitation of BCG is that it confers limited and highly variable levels of protection against pulmonary disease. Because of its side effects, BCG was removed from the vaccination schedule in several countries, such as US and Australia. Nevertheless, when administered at birth, BCG protects against severe disease, particularly tuberculous meningitis, in the first decade of life (Nunes-Alves et al. 2014NUNES-ALVES C, BOOTY MG, CARPENTER SM, JAYARAMAN P, ROTHCHILD AC AND BEHAR SM. 2014. In search of a new paradigm for protective immunity to TB. Nat Rev Microbiol 12(4): 289-299.). That is particularly important in countries where the disease is endemic, such as in Brazil. The BCG vaccine, is generally contraindicated at all levels of immunosuppression. Severe adverse effects of BCG vaccination are extremely rare in immunocompetent children however immunocompromised hosts such as HIV-infected individuals or those suffering a primary immunodeficiency tend to be unresponsive to treatment. Thus, BCG vaccination should be delayed when a primary immunodeficiency is suspected and/or a newborn has a family history of primary immunodeficiency. Primary immunodeficiency such as IL-12/IFN- axis defects, combined immunodeficiencies (SCID) and idiopathic CD4 lymphopenia, increase the susceptibility of individuals to mycobacterial infections (Santos et al. 2010SANTOS A, DIAS A, CORDEIRO A, CORDINH\u00c3 C, LEMOS 2010. axillary 530-537. ). Hence, current strategies involve incorporating BCG into a new vaccine regimen, either by boosting BCG with subunit vaccines comprising either protein-adjuvant combinations or recombinant viral vectors (Aagaard et al. 2011AAGAARD C, HOANG T, DIETRICH J, CARDONA IZZO A, DOLGANOV G, SCHOOLNIK GK, CASSIDY JP, BILLESKOV R AND ANDERSEN P. 2011. A multistage tuberculosis vaccine that confers efficient protection before and after exposure. Nat Med 17(2):189-194. ; McShane et al. 2004MCSHANE H, PATHAN AA, SANDER CR, KEATING SM, GILBERT SC, HUYGEN K, FLETCHER HA AND HILL AV. 2004. Recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing antigen 85A boosts BCG-primed and naturally acquired antimycobacterial immunity in humans. Nat Med 10(11): 1240-1244. ) by developing genetically improved, safer, more effective strains of BCG or by attenuating Mtb strains (Martin et al. 2006MARTIN C ET AL. 2006. The live Mycobacterium tuberculosis phoP mutant strain is more attenuated than BCG and confers protective immunity against tuberculosis in mice and guinea pigs. Vaccine 24(17): 3408-3419.). Ultimately, the best vaccine must find a solution to the problem of latency and immune evasion which is fundamental to destroy hidden Mtb within the population and, therefore, critical for TB eradication (Cayabyab et al. 2012CAYABYAB MJ, MACOVEI L AND CAMPOS-NETO A. 2012. Current and novel approaches to vaccine development against tuberculosis. Front Cell Infec Microb 2: 154.). The emergence of MDR-, XDR and now totally drug- resistant Mtb strains, the HIV epidemic and the lack of efficient vaccine for adults may explain why TB still epidemic. CONCLUSION Despite the efforts of global health organizations, several areas of the world are facing serious challenges, such as wars, poverty; inexistent infrastructures for vaccine manufacturing or difficulties in receiving imported vaccines. Additionally, the increase in the number of cases of vaccine preventable diseases is not restricted to poor countries or the ones in war. Economically developed and healthy sustainable countries, such as Canada, US and Australia are also experiencing the resurgence of diseases that were considered eliminated. Although most of the current vaccines are effective, researchers are developing ways to increase the effectiveness of vaccine formulations, to innovate delivery systems, reduce the cost and develop better methods for vaccine conservation to prevent degradation. In addition, new vaccines are urgently needed for several other diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, dengue, ebola, malaria and leishmaniasis. Vaccines are still the best way to prevent catastrophic infectious diseases. The maintenance of high vaccination coverage rates is necessary to eradicate vaccine-preventable diseases globally. Importantly, vaccination brings benefits to individuals, once it protects the person that has been vaccinated, and helps to protect vulnerable members of the population who cannot receive all vaccines, such as immunocompromised and the very young.
