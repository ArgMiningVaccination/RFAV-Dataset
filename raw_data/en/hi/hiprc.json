Its use has been associated with significant and serious adverse reactions involving haematological, hepatic, immune, dermatological and respiratory systems. The long half-life of leflunomide may delay resolution of some of these reactions. However, regular monitoring and patient education of early warning signs can reduce morbidity. Leflunomide indicated for rheumatoid arthritis Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are being increasingly used early in the course of active rheumatoid disease. [1](#1) Leflunomide (Arava\u00ae) is a relatively new immunomodulatory DMARD indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is a pro-drug activated by metabolism in the gut wall and liver, and excreted by the renal and biliary systems. [2](#2) The active metabolite has a long half-life (1-4 weeks [2](#2)), which may contribute to adverse effects that persist, worsen or even appear after leflunomide has been stopped. [3](#3), [4](#4) International adverse reaction reports include serious events Global exposure to leflunomide is estimated to be 662,302 patient-years, to date. [5](#5) While leflunomide has demonstrated efficacy in some groups of patients with active RA, international post-marketing experience includes reports of serious adverse reactions in patients treated with leflunomide. Although confounding factors such as concomitant use of known hepatotoxic or haematotoxic medicines (e.g. methotrexate) are present in many of the reported cases, a causal relationship with leflunomide cannot be excluded. [3](#3), [4](#4), [6-8](#6) International adverse reaction reports associated with leflunomide include the following: - Hepatic adverse reactions including 15 cases of liver failure (nine with fatal outcome). - Haematological adverse reactions ranging from neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis, through to severe pancytopenia. - Dermatological adverse reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, bullous eruptions and skin necrosis. - Respiratory adverse reactions such as interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary infiltration. - Immune response impairments including reports of severe infections such as sepsis. New Zealand experience with leflunomide is comparable It is thought that between 500 and 1500 patients in New Zealand have been prescribed leflunomide, up to the end of 2003. [5](#5) The adverse reactions reported in New Zealand for this medicine are similar to those seen internationally. Examples of the more serious local cases include: - Elevated hepatic enzymes, along with neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and diarrhoea. - Sepsis leading to multi-organ failure and death; concomitant medicines were methotrexate, ketoprofen and triamcinolone. - Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, resulting in life-threatening respiratory compromise. The patient was taking leflunomide and methotrexate but did not relapse when methotrexate was re-introduced. - Multiple bullous eruptions occurring within three weeks of starting leflunomide, and resolving upon discontinuation. Awareness and monitoring reduces the impact of adverse effects Post-marketing experience with leflunomide estimates the frequency of severe hepatic, dermatological, respiratory, haematological and infection reactions as being less than 1 in 10,000 (i.e. very rare). However, some blood dyscrasias have been reported to occur at a frequency of between 1 in 1000 and 1 in 10,000 (i.e. rare). [2](#2) Despite the serious adverse reaction profile of leflunomide, it is an effective DMARD. As with all medicines use of leflunomide requires an assessment of its risk and benefits on an individual patient basis. Prescribers should be aware that the concomitant use of other immunomodulating agents may have an additive effect, not only on improving symptoms of acute RA but also on the frequency and severity of adverse reactions. To minimise the risk of serious blood and liver adverse reactions, all patients taking leflunomide should have their haematological and liver function monitored. Once a pre-treatment baseline is established, monitor monthly for the first six months, then every 6-8 weeks thereafter. Ongoing monthly monitoring is recommended if methotrexate is used concurrently. [2](#2) Prescribers are advised to refer to the recently updated [Arava data sheet](../Datasheet/a/Aravatab.pdf) [2](#2) for comprehensive monitoring recommendations. Patients should be informed of early warning signs of possible adverse reactions and asked to contact their general practitioner as soon as possible if they experience any of the following: easy bruising, tiredness, pallor, skin lesions or rashes, shortness of breath, or increased frequency/susceptibility to infection. If serious reactions occur, the long half-life of leflunomide's active metabolite may such as cholestyramine. [2](#2) Leflunomide has recently been added to the list of Adverse Reactions of Current Concern.. This means that prescribers are requested to report all leflunomide-associated adverse reactions to the Centre for Adverse Reactions Monitoring (CARM) in Dunedin.
