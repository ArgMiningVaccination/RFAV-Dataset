Footage obtained in the Melbourne's Federal Court case against Annabelle Natalie Gibson shows the disgraced health personality being questioned by Penguin publicists before it was revealed she had lied about her diagnosis. Gibson did not attend the hearing and has failed to file a defence to the case against her as the video was submitted to court on Tuesday by Consumer Affairs Victoria. The 90-minute interview - recorded in the lead-up to the release of her book in 2014 - a Penguin representative tells Gibson they want to prepare her for questions from investigative journalists. 'This is just for us, so that if you are sitting opposite a Good Weekend journalist who's asking you quite investigative questions, we want to rehearse some questions with you,' the Penguin representative said. 'What we suspect might happen now is that because you are the success story of the moment - you know what journalists do, they want to start scratch, scratch, scratching away.' 'They already are,' Gibson responded. 'And we're concerned about that,' the Penguin representative said. Penguin released Gibson's book in October 2014 but it was withdrawn from sale five months later.

Gibson made more than $420,000 from her fabricated story and despite saying 'large' portions were going to charity, she only donated $10,000, the court heard. Her Whole Pantry app and book made the 24-year-old $420,000, however, it has been also reported she made as much as $578,005. During a 2014 interview, she said she chose charities to donate large amounts of the money to quarterly, [7 News](https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/32608035/cancer-con-belle-gibson-netted-420-000-but-gave-just-10-000-to-charity-court-hears/#page1) reported. 'So far we've given to nine charities,' she said in the interview, which was shown in court. But instead the money was spend on cars and travel, and only $10,000 was given to charity, it was reported. During the interview, Gibson tried to explain alternative cancer treatments she was receiving The consumer watchdog has accused Gibson of 'unconscionable conduct' while she was promoting her Whole Pantry app and book Gibson failed to appear in court for the fourth time on Tuesday for a hearing with Consumer Affairs Victoria, which has launched legal action against the disgraced author after she falsely claimed to use 'natural remedies' to cure terminal cancer. Consumer Affairs told the court the mother-of-one engaged in 'unconscionable conduct' by claiming she was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2009 and given only four months to live before miraculously healed herself naturally after rejecting conventional treatments. She is also accused of engaging in misleading or deceptive commerce to promote her Whole Pantry wellness app and failing to donate $400,000 from the sales of her app to various charities. 'What surprises me is that anyone close to me, that saw the beginning of my experience with cancer, knew that I always knew this one was coming. I called it,' she wrote In footage provided to the court, a Penguin Australia publisher asked if Gibson had a spokesperson who could confirm her extensive charity work, but she said none of them spoke English The watchdog also accuses her of engaging in misleading or deceptive commerce by making the unsubstantiated claims on social media to promote her Whole Pantry book and app. Consumer Affairs' barrister, Catherine Button, noted Gibson publicly stated she had a stroke at work and was subsequently diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour in June 2009. Gibson told her Facebook and Instagram followers she started receiving oral chemotherapy for her cancer before abandoning conventional medicine. Gibson then told her large social media following she started 'getting back to basics' and opted for healthy foods and natural therapies which healed her cancer, the court heard. She removed the posts once it was revealed her diagnosis and health empire was a sham. In July 2013 she posted on The Whole Pantry Facebook account that she had been healing used only 'natural medicine, gerson therapy and foods' and shamed those who were trying to 'discredit' her healing path Gibson removed the posts once it was revealed her diagnosis and health empire was a sham Consumer Affairs has alleged Gibson made false and misleading claims and engaged in unconscionable conduct 'Her publisher went out and published her book on the basis of her claims,' Ms Button said on Tuesday. Penguin paid Gibson's company almost $264,000 for her The Whole Pantry cookbook, according to court documents. The book was released in October 2014 and withdrawn from sale five months later. Her app was downloaded more than 115,000 times between between August 2013 and May 2016 at $2.99 a pop. The barrister also read out excerpts from a transcript of a 60 Minutes interview with Gibson last year during which she admitted she'd never had cancer. This comes as a judge was urged to 'throw the book' at Gibson by cancer sufferer Ashley, who did not give her last name, as the court prepared to try her case despite her already failing to attend three court dates. Ms Button said Gibson claimed she fell pregnant with her son two weeks after being told she couldn't have children because of her cancer Consumer Affairs has alleged Gibson made false and misleading claims and engaged in unconscionable conduct Justice Debbie Mortimer said there would be 'tough consequences', if she failed to appear. When earlier questioned on whether she thought she'd ever face charges, Gibson said: 'No, I don't think I will'. Consumer Affairs Victoria said it would push ahead with the civil case in her absence, aiming to see her severely fined for duping thousands of followers. Gibson could be fined up to $1.1 million and the watchdog also wants her to apologise with public notices in major newspapers. Friends of Gibson are reported to have said she is 'hoping [the case] will all go away' if she ignores the court warnings. The hearing before Justice Debra Mortimer continues. The 24-year-old admitted she falsely claimed she had terminal brain cancer and cured it with natural remedies - making $578,005 in the process BELLE GIBSON'S ILLNESS DOCUMENTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA Ms Gibson has deleted thousands of photos and social media posts which directly reference her multiple cancer diagnoses, but an example of them - seen by Daily Mail Australia - can be found below: Back in July 2013, Ms Gibson posted on The Whole Pantry Facebook page: 'It's unfortunate that there is someone on my Instagram trying to discredit the natural healing path I am on.' She went on to say: 'As always, with everything, this is my journey and I encourage you to do what is best for your body and situation with love and an open mind. 'I have been healing a severe and malignant brain cancer for the past few years with natural medicine, gerson therapy and foods. 'It's working for me and I am grateful to be here sharing this journey with over 70,000 people worldwide. Thank you for being here - xx Belle.' In a reference to her liver cancer, she posted on Instagram under her account @healing_belle, a photo of a pink smoothie enriched with 'extra support'. 'This one is for my rash (thanks, liver cancer), inflammation (thanks flying) and for general immunity.' In another Instagram post she wrote: 'Going from 6 weeks to live, to celebrating my fourth year with brain cancer, I know now that respecting your own journey and intuitively healing, listening and living as YOUR body, mind and path intended is staple.' In July 2014, she broke the news of further illness to her followers through an impassioned post to her personal Instagram page. It read in part: 'With frustration and ache in my heart // my beautiful, gamechanging community, it hurts me to find space tonight to let you all know with love and strength that I've been diagnosed with a third and fourth cancer. 'One is secondary and the other is primary. I have cancer in my blood, spleen, brain, uterus, and liver. I am hurting,' Ms Gibson wrote. About 12 weeks after the initial post she followed up, revealing she was undergoing 'German integrative oncology protocol'. The barrister also read out excerpts from a transcript of a 60 Minutes interview with Gibson last year during which she admitted she'd never had cancer (pictured) Barrister Catherine Button told the court on Tuesday there was 'no reasonable bias' and 'no evidence' for Gibson (pictured) to believe she had terminal cancer She could be fined up to $1.1 million and the watchdog also wants her to apologise with public notices in major newspapers Most watched News videos - [Animation shows how Leicester City owner's helicopter crashed](/video/uknews/video-3011535/Video-Animation-shows-Leicester-City-owners-helicopter-crashed.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Inside look at Delta flight after passenger had diarrhea](/video/news/video-3011529/Inside-look-Delta-flight-passengers-diarrhea.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Moment Ryanair chairman splattered with pies by Belgian eco-mob](/video/newsalerts/video-3012773/Video-Moment-Ryanair-chairman-splattered-pies-Belgian-eco-mob.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Man pushed into sea by ferry crew while trying to leap onto vessel](/video/greece/video-3011733/Video-Man-pushed-sea-ferry-crew-trying-leap-vessel.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Rishi Sunak's statement about prison escape of records helicopter](/video/russiaukraineconflict/video-3011761/Video-Ukrainian-troops-blasting-Russian-helicopter.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Public catch 'watch thief' and pin him in Sloane Square](/video/crime/video-3012673/Video-Public-catch-watch-thief-pin-chair-Sloane-Square.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Former detective: Fugitive ex-soldier may already have fled country](/video/crime/video-3012533/Video-Former-detective-Fugitive-ex-soldier-fled-country.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [William and Kate receive flowers from kids outside St Davids Cathedral](/video/katemiddleton/video-3013659/Video-William-Kate-receive-flowers-kids-outside-St-Davids-Cathedral.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Mark Rowley says Daniel Khalife escape could have been an inside job](/video/crime/video-3013349/Video-Mark-Rowley-says-Daniel-Khalife-escape-inside-job.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Heartbreaking footage of a dog stranded on a roof in Greece](/video/greece/video-3012727/Video-Heartbreaking-footage-dog-stranded-roof-Greece.html?mwv_rm=rta) The comments below have not been moderated.
