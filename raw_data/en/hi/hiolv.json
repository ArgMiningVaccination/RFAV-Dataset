Introduction to spiritually cleaning your house (Vastu Shuddhi) Studies show that we spend over 90 per cent of our time indoors, almost 70% of which is at home. Now in 2020 and 2021 with lockdowns in place due to the pandemic, the proportion of time that we spend at home may be even higher. For many of us, our home is our little space in this world where we can relax and be ourselves. We invest a lot of time and effort into making it exactly how we want it. Usually, our focus when doing up our home is on our material needs and comforts along with creating a place where we can be comfortable physically and mentally. Our homes are a reflection of our personalities, tastes and lifestyles. With so much of our time spent at home, how we keep our home is bound to affect us. We are aware of the physical aspects that affect us such as if it is unclean, untidy or something is broken. We make efforts to rectify it. We are aware of any stress that we may be having with other family members, and we try to resolve it to clear the air. However, most of us are unaware of any negative vibrations that are present in our home that affect us adversely at a spiritual and subsequently at a physical/psychological level. The fact is that every house has subtle vibrations associated with it, which affects us and our families. So how do we go about cleansing the premises to ensure that it has positive vibrations? 1.1 Meaning of Vastu Shuddhi Ancient sciences like Vastu Shastra (Science of the premises) provided people with guidance as to how to go about ensuring that their premises attracted positive vibrations while minimising negative vibrations. Vastu Shuddhi is a part of this science that is specifically about the spiritual cleansing/purification of the premises. This article aims to provide information on Vastu Shuddi that will help to cleanse the premises spiritually. It is based on the philosophy from ancient Sanskrit scriptures and spiritual research conducted by Maharshi Adhyatma Vishwavidyalay (also known as Maharshi University of Spirituality or MAV) under the guidance of Paratpar Guru Dr Jayant Athavale. 2. How do I know if my home has negative vibrations? Did you know that it is possible to sense the subtle vibrations as soon as you enter a house ? Nowadays with the general increase of spiritually impure vibrations around the world and the heightened activity of negative energies, most houses will have some level of negativity. It is therefore recommended that one regularly takes measures to remove negativity from the house. At the outset, our spiritual research has found that more than the premises, it is the personality of the residents and their activities in the premises that are the main causes of negative vibrations building up in the premises. 2.1 Excessive personality defects and ego lead to high levels of negative vibrations The personality defects of people in the premises spreads negative vibrations A leading cause of negative vibrations in the house is due to the personality defects of the residents themselves. Residents who have a higher intensity of personality defects like anger, greed, jealousy, revengefulness, etc., are bound to create a spiritually toxic environment around them and in the house. As a result, negative thoughts fill the premises, increase the negativity in the house and attract negative energies from the subtle realm. 2.2 Effect of regular spiritual practice or lack of it One way that helps to transform one's personality for the better is undertaking regular spiritual practice that conforms to universal principles. Regular spiritual practice attracts positive energy and the grace of God. Unfortunately, most people do not practice Spirituality or work on their defects and ego. Hence, very often people remain where they are and tend to bring down the environment at home. 2.3 Use of the premises According to an evolved Saint, Adi Shankaracharya from India (8th - 9th century AD), Righteousness (Dharma) is that which accomplishes the 3 tasks of : - Keeping the social system in an excellent condition - Bringing about the worldly progress of every living being - Causing progress in the spiritual realm as well. - Shri Adi Shankaracharya There is another benefit of spiritual practice, which is that it increases one's spiritual purity or sattvikta. As per the principle 'like attracts like', sattvik (spiritually pure) people tend to choose sattvik things and make decisions that lead to sattvik outcomes. Such people tend to use the premises in a righteous manner. Using the premises in an unrighteous manner leads to the attraction of negativity. With spiritual growth, another very important process takes place. One's sixth sense begins to get awakened, and one can perceive vibrations whether they are negative or positive. Once this stage is reached, one can assess whether something is emitting negative vibrations and hence avoids it in the first place. In short, one gravitates towards a more sattvik or spiritually purer way of life. As we are not formally educated to understand this vitally important aspect of life, which is sattvik living, we make choices for the place that we live in based purely on intellectual information and aesthetics. 2.4 Some common indicators of negative vibrations in the premises Apart from the above-mentioned points, it is important to note that there are numerous things (which when placed in a house) that can be a source of a constant bombardment of negative vibrations. Some of these things are listed below. - Dirt and uncleanliness - Cluttering and stuffing one's house/lack of organisation - Artwork on the wall ( [artworks often emit negative vibrations](https://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/spiritual-research/other-spiritual-research/spiritual-research-in-art-design/famous-paintings-by-famous-artists/)) - Placing artefacts at home that emit negative vibrations - Improper placement of furniture - Design and colour on sheets, curtains, wallpaper, etc. - Painting the walls with colours that are not sattvik or that have high contrast like white walls and black flooring - Using flooring tiles where the design or colour is not sattvik - The type of music and entertainment programs that are playing in the premises (sound has a strong effect on the premises which can be positive or negative) - Cooking any type of meat or eggs (the smell changes the vibrations of the house making it negative. It is one of the fastest ways by which the premises becomes impure.) It is said that prevention is better than cure. Preventing negative vibrations from entering the premises goes a long way in minimising the build-up of negativity in the premises. After reading the above, it may not be immediately apparent as to what objects generate negative vibrations. We have put together a slideshow of some examples of things/home decors that emit negative vibrations and should be avoided. 3. Spiritual cleansing or purification techniques (Vastu Shuddhi) Through spiritual research, we have identified some techniques that make use of various objects and sounds to help spiritually cleanse a premises. These are simple yet powerful tools that can be used by anyone. We recommend that these techniques should be used by everyone for cleansing their home premises on a regular basis. Even if one is doing spiritual practice, these techniques given below will help to ensure that the valuable energy generated through spiritual practice is not wasted in fighting the negativity in the premises. We have grouped them as per the [Absolute Cosmic Principles](https://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/spiritual-research/the-universe/cosmic-elements/) they are associated with, i.e., Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether. 1. Sprinkling Holy Water (water mixed with Holy Ash or vibhuti) around the house (Related to the Absolute Water and Absolute Fire Principles) Use Tulsi leaves to sprinkle Holy water to spiritually cleanse your home - Take a glass/bowl of water and mix a pinch of Holy ash in it. - Pray for protection. - Use one's fingers or a twig with Tulsi (Holy Basil) leaves to sprinkle it around the home premises whilst chanting God's Name. Do ensure that the Holy water reaches the corners of the house as that is where negativity can accumulate. - For more information about Holy water made with Holy Ash and how to procure Holy Ash, please refer to the article on [Holy water from Holy ash](https://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/spiritual-healing/healing-using-objects/making-holy-water/). Negative energies generally collect in the corners of the house. The corners are where 2 directions meet. This creates some amount of friction which results in the creation of spiritually impure or Raja-Tama vibrations. Negative energies are attracted to this spiritual impurity. It is for this reason that in this article we will recommend applying different healing remedies especially in the corners of the house. 2. Sprinkling Gomutra (Indian cow's urine) mixed with water Use a few drops of Gomutra in water to spiritually cleanse your home The same steps can be followed as above. However, instead of using Holy ash, one can use a few drops of Gomutra. It has a powerful spiritual cleansing effect. More information on Gomutra can be found here - [Gomutra (Cow Urine) as a Spiritual Healing Remedy](https://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/spiritual-healing/healing-using-objects/gomutra-cow-urine/) Please note that the Gomutra needs to be obtained only from an Indian cow. Urine obtained from any other breed of cow will not have a healing effect. 1. Lighting a ghee lamp or a sesame seed oil lamp The ghee lamp is a time-tested way to attract and emit positivity into your home Ghee is clarified butter made from an Indian cow's milk. A lamp fuelled by ghee attracts Divine consciousness and emits this positive energy into the environment. This results in a rapid spiritual cleansing of the environment. It can be lit once a day preferably in the evening at the time of sundown. In case ghee is unavailable, one can also use Sesame seed oil (also known as Til oil) as it is also a spiritually pure oil. 2. Lighting an SSRF incense stick Taking lit incense sticks around the perimeter of your home removes negativity - Take an SSRF incense stick of any fragrance available on the SSRF shop. - Light 2 or more incense sticks of the same fragrance. - Make a prayer for protection. - Take the lit incense sticks around the house while chanting Om Namo Bhagwate Vasudevaya (This is the recommended chant to be use till 2023). - One can take the lit incense sticks around the house in an anti-clockwise direction. Taking it in an anti-clockwise direction activates the Destroyer Principle of God. The Destroyer Principle of God can nullify negative vibrations. Destroyer vibrations rotate in an anti-clockwise direction. So, if we practise spiritual cleansing in this way, the negative vibrations are destroyed to a greater extent. - It is important to wave the lit incense sticks a few times (2-3 times) in the corners of the house. - After taking it around the house, it can be placed near the home temple, living room or any place in the house where you feel cleansing is needed. For more information, refer to our articles : [Best usage of SSRF incense sticks for maximum benefit](https://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/spiritual-healing/healing-using-objects/incensesticks-practicaltips/) [How to use and handle SSRF incense sticks after burning](https://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/spiritual-healing/healing-using-objects/handling-incense-sticks/) We have recommended using SSRF incense sticks as it has been developed with the [resolve](https://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/spiritual-research/the-universe/resolve-power-of-mind/) of Paratpar Guru Dr Athavale. A Paratpar Guru is a Guru who is above the 90% spiritual level. Commercially available incense sticks may not have the requisite spiritual strength for spiritual cleansing of the premises. 3. Blowing Holy Ash Pertains to the Absolute Fire and Absolute Air Principles Blowing Holy ash dispels negativity - Take some Holy ash on your palm. - Make a prayer for protection. - Blow the Holy ash in the premises whilst chanting Om Namo Bhagwate Vasudevaya. The direction should be towards some exit. For more information refer to our article [Blowing Holy ash from SSRF incense sticks - healing remedy](https://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/spiritual-healing/healing-using-objects/holy-ash/) 4. Purification with Dhoop Pertaining to the Absolute Earth and the Absolute Fire Principles The smoke and fragrance of the Dhoop acts as a spiritual cleanser - Take one SSRF dhoop stick, light it, place it in its holder and keep it on a plate. - Make a prayer for protection. - Take it around the house whilst chanting Om Namo Bhagwate Vasudevaya. Make sure that the smoke spreads into the environment as the smoke and its fragrance produce the healing effect. Like the SSRF incense sticks healing method mentioned above, the dhoop can be taken in an anti-clockwise direction around the premises. - After taking it around the house, it can be placed near the home temple, living room or any place in the house where you feel cleansing is needed. As per spiritual science, some positive energies exist in the Vayu (air) form in the environment. When dhoop is lit, these positive energies get attracted to the spiritually pure fragrance of the dhoop and enter the premises, thus purifying it. This helps to drive away the negative energies in the premises. 5. Burning camphor Pertaining to the Absolute Fire and the Absolute Earth Principles (When camphor powder is smelt, it works at the Absolute Air Principle level. When camphor is burnt, it operates at the level of the Absolute Fire and the Absolute Earth Principles.) Burning camphor and taking it around the home spiritually purifies the premises - The smell of camphor attracts the Deity Shiva Principle. Deity Shiva is the Deity who is associated with the Destroyer Principle of God, which helps with spiritual cleansing. - Take any metal or clay container and put some pieces of camphor in it. Please note that the container will get stained, so choose the container accordingly. - It is recommended to use Bhimseni camphor (a type of natural, pure camphor) as it is spiritually pure, so it attracts a greater proportion of the Deity Shiva Principle. - Make a prayer for protection. - Light the camphor and take it around the premises whilst chanting Om Namo Bhagwate Vasudevaya. Let the smoke spread. This helps to purify the premises. As camphor is highly inflammable, be careful when lighting it and taking it around the house. - Lighting camphor may emit black smoke depending on the quality of the camphor used, so please take the necessary precautions when taking it around the house. - The lit camphor can be taken around the house in an anti-clockwise direction. 6. Performing the Agnihotra ritual The Agnihotra ritual has many benefits, one of which is purifying the environment where it is conducted Please refer to our article : [How to perform Agnihotra](https://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/spiritual-healing/healing-using-objects/how-to-perform-agnihotra/) 7. Putting up Name strips of Deities The Names of Deities have Divine Energy associated with them, which brings positivity into the premises The energies of Deities are associated with their Names. Placing the [Name strips](https://shop.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/chanting-strips-one-set.html) of higher-level Deities in a specific sequence around the room in certain directions helps to protect the premises at a subtle level. By doing so, the premises is protected from all directions including the upward and downward directions. The following are the directions where the associated Deity's Name strips should be placed. The Name strips need to be placed on the wall in the region where the walls meet the ceiling. In doing so, they form a subtle protective ceiling, which protects the premises. Please note that for some directions more than one Deity Name strip is suggested. Both should be put in that direction. |Direction||Deity's Spiritual cleansing through boxes The box treatment harnesses the power of the Absolute Ether Principle to suck negativity out of the premises. - Take clean, empty cardboard boxes. Any reasonably sized boxes can be used. - Place them in the corners of the rooms. One with the void of the box facing the towards the room and the other facing the wall. One can also place four boxes in the four corners of a room with the void facing the centre. - The void in the box contains the Absolute Ether Principle, which helps with spiritual cleansing. - The boxes can be purified by keeping them out in the sun for a few hours or waving lit SSRF incense sticks inside the box. Read our article on [Spiritual Healing Therapy | Box treatment](https://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/spiritual-healing/self-healing/healing-therapy-box-treatment/) to know more. 2. Playing the audio of guidance or devotional songs sung by a Paratpar Guru or Saints of the highest order The voice of Saints of the highest levels like Saint Bhaktaraj Maharaj (left) and Paratpar Guru Dr Athavale (right) are charged with Divine consciousness (Chaitanya), which cleanse the premises at the level of the Absolute Ether Principle. - The voice of a true higher-level Saint is charged with Divine consciousness and vibrations from it produces a strong healing effect. The voice of Saints of the highest levels like a Paratpar Guru generates the strongest healing effect. - Sound is associated with the Absolute Ether Principle (Sky), which is the most powerful Cosmic Principle. Hence, spiritual cleansing through sound is fast and effective. - When any devotional song is written, composed and sung by higher-level Saints, then the positivity it emits is immense. - Playing such audio clips at home helps to spread Divine consciousness in the premises and disintegrates any black energy accumulated in the premises. - Ideally, the audio should be played at a reasonably loud volume. If this is not possible, then playing it at a very low volume will also help with cleansing. Playing such audio clips throughout the night helps to provide a continuous source of positivity throughout the night, which provides spiritual protection. - We recommend playing the audio for at least a few hours per day. However, one can play it throughout the day and night as well. To download an audio of devotional songs sung by Saint audio of guidance about spiritual practice by Paratpar Guru Dr Athavale, please click [here](https://media.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/Sadhana.mp3). (Please see some more information and a commentary about the audio file. - [Download PDF](https://media.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18140122/Some-points-and-commentary-Audio-file-of-a-Saint.pdf)) You can also play chants of Deities' Names recorded in the voice of a Saint. Click here to download the chants 3. Blowing the Conch The sound of the conch removes negative energies and clears the premises to receive positivity The sound of the conch has the ability to destroy negative vibrations in the environment and spiritually cleanse the environment. When a conch is blown 3 times, the activity of negative energies in the environment is reduced and a protective sheath is created. Due to the environment being cleansed, people residing in the premises derive more positivity. Also, seekers doing spiritual practice in the premises are able to derive the maximum spiritual benefit from their spiritual practice as it is not wasted in fighting the negativity in the environment. A conch can be blown in the morning after having a bath and at sunset. Click [here](https://media.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18140122/Shankh.mp3) to download the audio of the conch being blown. 4. Pictures of Deities and having a Temple/Altar at home An altar or temple at home is a continuous source of positivity - Having a temple at home adds to the sattvikta or spiritual purity of the house. - It acts as a reminder to increase our spiritual practice. - However, care needs to be taken to ensure that it is looked after and basic ritualistic worship (this includes cleaning, lighting a lamp and incense, offering flowers and paying obeisance to the Deities) is done daily. At the bare minimum one should ensure the Altar is cleaned daily and a lamp or an incense stick is lit and pay obeisance. - It should not be cluttered with pictures of numerous Deities. A maximum of 4-5 pictures or symbols should be placed. In the case of seekers at the spiritual level of a disciple, generally, only one picture is kept and that is of one's Guru. 3.4 Sattvik or spiritually pure plants Tulsi is one of the most spiritually pure plants and emits positivity - Tulsi (Holy Basil) is one of the most sattvik - It has the ability to continually spread positivity into the environment. This is more so when it is watered and taken care of by a seeker with spiritual emotion. 4. What happens if we do not remove negative vibrations? Those who are not familiar with Vastu Shuddhi may wonder about the importance and seriousness that should be given to it. Spiritual research has shown that there are many adverse consequences for a household if it is not practised. These consequences are not only at a spiritual level, but they also affect us at a physical and psychological level. We have listed below some of the problems that can occur due to negativity in the premises. This list is only to give you an idea of the kind of problems that can occur and is by no means exhaustive. |At the level of||Problem/Obstacles| |Physical||Tiredness, sloth, physical illnesses, food and water have low spiritual energy and tend to have a negative aura, heaviness in the head and headaches, excessive drowsiness, nausea, financial loss, breakages in the house and equipment not working, obstacles in activities.| |Psychological||Irritation, negative thoughts, lack of clarity and clouded mind, lack of enthusiasm, excessive sexual thoughts, depression, family fights, inability to study or concentrate, excessive anger, the environment is conducive for addictions.| |Spiritual||Attacks by negative energies, heightened negative effect on full moon and new moon days, experiencing the presence of negative energies, obstacles in chanting and any form of spiritual practice, increase in attachment to worldly life, getting doubts about spiritual practice or one's spiritual guide or Guru, detrimental effects on pregnant women, can increase chances of untimely death.| 5. Benefits of doing Vastu Shuddhi Doing Vastu Shuddhi on a regular basis is like spiritually cleaning the house, and this allows positivity to come into the house. Due to this, all the residents in the house benefit at the physical, psychological, and spiritual levels. There are less obstructions, fewer illnesses, people feel more enthusiastic, there is more harmony amongst family members, and all of this results in an overall greater sense of well-being. Our spiritual research has shown that when the residents of the household do regular spiritual practice along with Vastu Shuddhi, it positively affects the aura of the soil and water in and around the premises.
