The COVID-19 vaccine is designed like many other vaccines to teach your body to fight infection. Sometimes, this can cause a spike in fever or other symptoms that signal your body is building immunity. Some recipients have reported effects of the immune response the vaccine triggers, like soreness at the injection site or fatigue. Any potential side effects are required by law to be reported by the drug manufacturer. So far, none of the approved vaccines have reported any significant safety concerns in their trials. The CDC also has an app called [\"V-Safe\"](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/v-safe/index.html) that allows users to report any side effects experienced after receiving the vaccine. Monitoring of potential side effects will be on-going as the vaccine is distributed, with mandatory reporting of any adverse effects to the [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)](https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.html) and the [Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vsd/index.html).
