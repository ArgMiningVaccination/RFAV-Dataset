Out of this realization, Habib Todd Boerger, one of our Practicing Democracy Fellows, composed a [Values, Virtues, and Spiritual Practices chart](http://sandp.bndpr.com/pdfs/Democratic-Values-Virtues-Practices2.pdf ) to use as our standard for choosing. The chart contains meaningful markers of democracy that we often hear about but seldom explore in depth. Wanting to substantiate them, Habib launched into a remarkable quest into quotations about democracy, categorizing each by the values, virtues, and practices it presents. We will continue to add to this page, but as we post it in December 2018, it contains nearly 300 quotes. They range from before the American Revolution to the present day, and from the United States to further reaches of the globe: Austria, India, Ethiopia, South Africa, and more. We trust that you will find this list helpful and enlightening. Use Ctr F (Windows) or Alt F (Mac) to search for quotes on a specific virtue, value, or practice of interest to you.

We have to be one of us to be there...to really truly be genuine about it, grounded and rooted into why we're there and why we need to be able to push against this kind of corporate greed that continues to fester in all parts of our government. And I think that that is what's happening...people like us are now running for office. And I think that is transformative, maybe to Congress, maybe to the party, maybe to the world or to the country.\" \u2014 Rashida Tlaib, U.S. Representative (2019 - present) Democratic value(s): Common good, Popular sovereignty Democratic virtue(s): Assertiveness, Awareness, Consideration, Fairness, Honesty, Idealism, Integrity, Purposefulness, Responsibility, Social conscience Spiritual Practice(s): Hope, Questing, Transformation, Vision \"I think American Muslims and Muslims around the world needed a sense of...some light, some feeling that, yes, this is exactly why people need to run and speak up and fight back, because of this possibility, the fact that now two Muslim American women are going to be able to walk onto the House floor of Congress. What an incredible moment in our country. Celebrate it. It is something that speaks volumes, because we can do press conferences, we can do marches, we can do protests\u2014and those are so important\u2014but running for office, getting elected in a predominantly non-Muslim community\u2014my sister Ilhan Omar is going to represent a 70 percent white community.

And when you come across that crossing, you have 20 different ethnicities.... And all I've seen is ICE militarizing our neighborhoods...inside residential areas.... But that kind of militarization and...targeting of American people, of my immigrant neighbors, that...says to me that ICE is not for border security. ICE is moving us towards a more militarized approach towards Americans and towards American land.... I've seen ICE do operations in front of schools, picking up parents after they drop off their children.... ICE is not as it was supposedly intended. It is actually going beyond border security and actually targeting and terrorizing families right here at home.... I don't want to see my families scared of its own government. I don't want my families worried about what's going to happen after they drop their child off at school.... they're not supposed to be doing operations near churches, and they are.... That kind of intimidation and targeting of people is completely wrong.\" \u2014 Rashida Tlaib, U.S. Representative (2019 - present) Democratic value(s): Equality, Freedom, Justice, Liberty Democratic virtue(s): Awareness, Caring, Consideration, Embrace of diversity, Empathy, Fairness, Integrity, Mercy, Respect, Sincerity, Social conscience, Truthfulness Spiritual Practice(s): Compassion, Hospitality, Justice, Openness \"I've been talking about the fact that the 1964 Civil Rights Act hasn't been...implemented as it was intended. [In the] last 55 years, we've seen the courts, very heavily stacked with conservative judges, completely change how we apply it, and saying that we can only show our civil rights...[were] violated with intent -- intentional discrimination. And what I want to do is introduce a proposal that would change it back to saying that if you show...that the impact of the policy may be redlining through the car insurance industry, may be denying people of color the right to homeownership...[that] if it's discriminatory when it's implemented...then it should be considered a violation of our civil rights.\" \u2014 Rashida Tlaib, U.S. Representative (2019 - present) Democratic value(s): Equality, Freedom, Justice, Liberty Democratic virtue(s): Awareness, Consideration, Dignity, Empathy, Fairness, Purposefulness, Respect, Social conscience, Truthfulness Spiritual Practice(s): Justice, Questing, Vision "}
