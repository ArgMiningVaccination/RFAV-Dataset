(23/01/22) - Kharisrain, 200EF[ ] Involved Party Members: After setting up camp on Chronicle Coast for a few weeks now, a group of refugees and wayward souls decide it would be a good idea to learn of their new neighbours. They venture North aiming for a lighthouse further up the coast. Lead by Alzara and Suzuki the party find there way at the crossing of a river and head inland to find a better place to cross. Finding themselves headed towards a small lake the group hear the cries of a woman in distress. Soaking wet and calling for help. Kreev moves towards her though everyone is reluctant to move too close. Just out of her reach a large black hound appears and begins to growl and snarl at Kreev and the party getting to close. As Kreev creates a towel to help the sorrowful woman she claws for him. Seeing the woman turn aggressive, her waterlogged skin revealing herself to be a Morgen. Kreev manages to shake her off with dissonant whispers, as she flees into the lake she disappears beneath the water. Avalon rushes as a front line for the group while the others prepare actions for her reappearance. Azar with the help of Cecilia begins to move around the lake with a plan to remove the Morgen from its watery protection. As she reappears she screeches at Avalon, and while she manages to stave of any effects she is still hurt by the Morgen's attack. The lake providing some cover from the parties attacks. She charms Kreev into protecting her. Seeing the sudden shift in alignment Alzara casts sleep on Kreev and pulls him away before he can do anything against the party. The Morgen grabs Avalon and pulls her into the water, under the surface she sees the watery graves of many other victims. She manages to free herself from the Morgen's grasp and with commands from Cecilia gets free of the lake. Azar uses dissonant whispers to make the Morgen flee the lake, as she is then pushed towards Suzuki. The Guardian Dog and Suzuki armed with a mace manage to attack the Morgen and put her down finally. Kreev is woken up, Cecilia and Azar loot the Morgens lair, and as the Morgen returns to a human form she is given a burial. As the group move on the find a bridge to cross, an emaciated man, covered in filth and grim is repeating prayers and rhymes to himself with his arms outstretched. As the party move past he is unresponsive say for new verses in response to boons and charity that are imparted on him. Believing little more can be given to the man as he is gifted rations, clothing ect Avalon moves past without imparting anything. To which a more sinister verse is spoken as Avalon is seemingly punished. Setting up camp the party awake rejuvenated, except for Avalon who is exhausted and plagued by hunger, unable to regain any vigor. The emaciated man seemingly making his position apparent. Nevertheless, the party move on towards the lighthouse, not long before meeting a band of three soldiers carrying the Elderfall banner. The party are informed they are in fact squatting on Queen Ciara Hylands kingdom and that meeting her would be a good idea given the parties current living situation. They are also warned of the dangers of the lighthouse and further North, tension between Elderfall kingdom and the supposed Ravencourt Queen. After another rest, Avalon still feels weak. The party moves towards the lighthouse, old pagan markings defaced with Zitus symbols. The building seemingly abandoned bodies and loot litter the dark building. Notes on parchment seem to note the lighthouse is a prison for Sabathiel, the light of the tower. Guarded by Asteraoth a Hound Archon on mission to prevent their release for eternity; by Order of Zitus, and Douma the divine advisor of the God Emperor. As the party make their way up the tower they are watched by constructs that begin to repeat tenants of Zitus as they party look through the scattered refuge. Sure enough as they reach the top of the tower, they meet the Hound Archon. The Archon warns that if they are here for sanctuary they can stay, however if they are here to loot, or free the prisoner, they will be punished by divine fury. Many on the party, feeling outmatched by the celestials clear out what they picked up. However Alzara and Suzuki mention they have no right to order ownership of possessions left here by people they inturn killed. As proposals of sanctuary are revoked the party are led downstairs. Alzara elects to make her opinion on the followers of Zitus apparent, as she misty steps out the lighthouse with 3 potions she picked up. The hound archon decides to punish the entire group as it becomes a battle to flee the bounds of the Lighthouse with there collective lives. As the party slowly flee the Archon teleports ahead of the party dealing blows to Alzara and Suzuki. The many constructs attack the rest of the party. Cecilia and Kreev manage to help the party move and avoid attacks as Azar and Avalon absorb many blows and deal damage. Ultimately the sheer force and numbers of the Celestials start to overwhelm the party. So begins a cycle of falling unconscious, being revived and pulling eachother down the bridge to safety before falling back down again. Seeing the state of the party, Alzara reluctantly places the potions down, swallows her pride and bows to the Archon awaiting him to deliver \"atonement\". The Guardian Dog reappears having silently followed the party since the Morgen, solidifying himself to be the goodest of boys, healing the party and attacking the Archon. As Alzara is struck down she is revived and placed under sanctuary much to the anger and frustration of the Hound Archon as he is unable to deliver \"divine retribution\". In the aftermath, the party manage to leave with their lives intact. Avalon is quietly questioned by Azar as she seemingly mention to having previously been a follower of Zitus herself, thought that time far behind her.

(16-02-2022) Dualfar, 200EF[ ] Planning on stopping the foul, vicious demon goats of elder hills from raiding the fair lands of Elderfall the heroic party heads westward. An excessively dark clothed Fogel, an excessively bushy big Fogel and a curly haired Fogel introduces themselves. The curly haired Fogel offers us all some liquid energy called \"Coffee\" as we stop to rest. Far to the west we can see smoke rising. At first watch, Pickle and Dazomar are on watch. Ever clever Pickle detects something inside a rock, after taking a pick to the rock he finds a beautifully shiny emerald, but he doesnt notice the two owlbear cubs that have taken interest in him. As Pickle backs up the cubs seem to think it's a game and chasing but it's not, get away from me! Whenever there are cubs there is a big one and sure enough mother waltzes into camp. Dazomar wakes up everyone else, Tasia startled by the mother strikes out ateher Ered tries to calm the mother but is unsuccessful. The cubs rush at Dazomar and Tasia, Tasia is knocked unconsious. Pickle tries to shove the cub away from Dazomar but fails. The mother tears into Azar. Dazomar launches a ball of acid that sizzles the big one to death. Ered sorrowfully finishes off one of the cubs and the other runs away. Pickle helps bury the dead owlbears and the act is heroic sort off. We continue travelling west and find the bridge. We set up to rest for the night after a day of travelling. 8 figures approach and asks to spend the night with us, Dazomar asks a riddle. A knight, a pirate and a ninja are on a sinking boat, the ninja and the pirate jump in a life boat, who drowned? Pickle answers the knight which is correct. A stocky small fogel seems annoyed that he didnt get to give the answer. Dazomar gives another riddle, what can be broken but not picked up? The stocky fogel grumbles for a bit before finally answering a promise. The travellers say that they are here on a pilgrimage for Zitus to the old capital of the Elysian empire. Some seem untrusting after being told this. Azar pulls Pickle aside, telling him that he doesnt trust them, Pickle agrees and says that his people have no love for Zitus. The party offers to take watch in turns with their guests. Tasia speaks with the leader. Ered speaks with one of the pilgrimages, they ask if people each other here, Ered responds with a laugh and says that is not the case. Illinoy speaks with Brida. They speak cordially and exchange holy symbols. A high elf asks why Pickle is afraid of him. Pickle rants about how Zitus and his followers drove the Kobolds out of Eskarya. The Elf asks if Kol wouldn't drive out Zitus's followers. When Pickle answers only if he brought violence the elf mocks the Kobolds ignorance and hints that he knows something about Kol that the Kobold does not, but refuses to elaborate. Dazomar and the Stocky Fogel have a battle of riddles. After a while they start betting on gold, and Dazomar wins after a long bout. Azar has a seemingly cordal conversation with the priest about the nature of Zitus and their beliefs. As the priest says that it's not the god or their teachings that is evil or good, just how people interpreet it. Pickle tells Azar that the elf he spoke to had told him that Kol's followers had violently attacked followers of Zitus without reason, Pickle found it hard to believe and became increasingly frustrated at the prospect of not all Zitus followers wishing evil on his kind. The party meets a soldier on the road who is on the lookout for demon goat monsters, when the party mentions they are here to help they point them towards the town. We meet a druid woman who said that their town hadn't been attacked yet unlike Mulgar, Glenmara and Achlyne. The druid points the party towards three Harengon. One of them, Meurig explains that they ran from one of the towns, seeing people being dragged away. Tall, 6ft, black fur, yellow glowing eyes, horns, face and head like a goat hooves.

Attacks started 3 months ago, Achlyne was attacked 1 month ago. Illinois figures out that an attack will take place this night. A goat wanders into town and Pickle immedietly challanges it to a fight but before he can slay the beast, the druid woman kills it. The guards of the town kill 3 goats they found in the town.

Realising that the attack is imminent, the elder reasons to let the villagers escape while all the fighters and the party stay to fight off the lycanthrophes. Discussing their limited options as lycans can seemingly only be hurt by silvered and magical weapons. Azar suggests luring them inside one of the buildings and litting it on fire.

A young wizard called Killian introduces himself somewhat awkwardly to the group along with his unusually warm and snake tongued cat, Forfin. Nevertheless the group begin to make their way to Elderfall in a hopes of helping the Queen deal with \"Bloody Bones\" a creature stealing children from their homes. On their way they come across a small watering hole visited by a herd of water-walking horses known as Morvak. Alzara offers one of the mares some food from her plam, to which the horse accepts. Other than that the party keep a wide-birth in the hopes of not startling the peaceful creatures, enjoying a peaceful moment before moving on. As they camp for the night the group begin to take watches. When it comes to Avalon and Killians turn, Killian feels like he know Avalon but cant quite place her, inquiring if she has ever visited Nel Kuldohr or where she is from in Eskarya. Rather abruptly Killian asks if she kills wizards professionally, too which the conversation comes to a screeching halt. Avalon simply stating; Whomever you think I am, I'm not. The pair spending the rest of their watch in unbearable silence. The next morning Ered scavenges for rations and Alzara provides some of her own before the group move on. As they walk they come across another camp, jovial and lively.Much to the joy of Dazomar and Kreev they seem to be a troupe of carnival/circusfolk. Varying races and abilities, storyteller, acrobats, some wearing masquerade masks, lead by a tiefling named Bazzaar. Kreev waste no time in introducing himself with a song and divulging all the information about Freehearth in the hopes of getting them to visit. Other members of the party are a bit more reluctant to join; as Alzara subtly casts detect thoughts she finds nothing particularly malicious coming from the new group. Bazaar; mentions they will be performing in Elderfall the first night of the newmoon. They take a shine to Dozamar as he proclaims his fascination and enjoyment with the arts. Kreev, hoping to display his own storytelling abilities performs a rendition of The Unfamiliar Family and is overjoyed as he is invited to be the opening act for the troupe in Elderfall. Ered notices an owlbear cub in a cage and makes his way over, after casting speak with animals, he feels sorry for the owlbear as he recognizing that it could very much have been himself that killed its mother and sibling leading this cub to its capture. With an overwheling sense of duty Ered hopes to buy the owlbear from the troupe, wishing to release it, in way of penance. The troupe however exclaims that once it is tamed it will be a crowning jewel for the carnival and so wont let it go for less than 500gp. Later in the night Ered seemingly takes himself aside and has a conversation with someone or something debateing what they could do for the cub, deciding to make up the money and return as soon as he can. As a night of comradary and libation draws on Avalon pulls Kreev aside mentioning she is rather anxious around there new companions as she can smell powerful illusion, divination rituals and other magics lingering on the troupe as well as them all carrying a large numebr of enchanted weapons. With no way to detect any magic they return to the party suggesting to keep watches just in case something unterward were to happen. As the party get to Elderfall they are directed to the Queens Guard, at the site of the latest kidnapping. they are informed that usually the childern are taken 2-3 weeks apart at night, with no trace say for the bloodied footprint leading in and out towards the river. This time however the parents have been killed also and the door is pulled off its hinges. As Killian goes to follow the footprints he uses Gather blood to distinguish 2 seperate enteties leading from the scene, one to the outhouse and one down a manhole. Returning to the group to inform them of what he found the group elect to go into the manhole hoping to find the lost children before its too late. As they jump inside Avalon sniffs out necromancy and Killian picks up a stick. As they make there way throught the underground system acid begins to drop on Kreev and Alzaras shoulders as the party are attacked by Ooze. In the small pipe systems the party manage to dispatch the slow creatures and move on. As they continue following the footprints they meet 4 ratfolk and a tortle, the legally distinct sewer dwellers demand payment or food to allow the group to pass. Upon being paid they inform the group the direction of bloody bones and exclaim that their is an unspoken agreement that they keep out eachothers way. Having followed the footprint to bones and gory totems Ered is distracted as he walks right into a gelationous cube. As the party are attacked by 2 large oozes and in a bid to get the upper hand... Killian places the stick in his mouth as a gag before severing his own hand and commanding it to help the party. Much to the shock of the rest of the party. With Forfin the cat being the only vicitim of the cubes some of the party refuse to move on before Killian explain himself. As he re-attaches his own hand Ered and Alzara mentions that now is not the time as children are in danger and the party move on. Having seemingly found the lair of bloody bones, a sacrificial alter in the centre, held above a pool of swirling water a tiefling is tied to a post with his own intestines, the room is surrounded by mirrors as bloody bones appears in all of them. Backed up by a much larger flesh golem named Raw Head. Bloody bones screams and charges the party using the mirrors as transportation. With Ered ahead of the party he takes the brunt of the damage before managing to attack Rawhead and destroy one of the mirrors himself. As the party begin to through chromatic orbs and spells to kill the abominations. As Killian throws a firebolt at Rawhead he notices the fear in the large attackers eyes. As rawhead falls Bloody bones calls for another form of backup as plagues of rats join the fray. Alzara manages to take a group out of play by putting them to sleep and allowing them to be washed away. As the rats slow the party, bloody bones uses the remaining mirrors to attack the isolated Dazomar, dragging him away, with many of the party still frightful to give chase. The party take turns reviving eachother as they attempt to pin down the shifting enemy. Eventually Ered manages to restrain him with a call of faith as vines tangle around bloody bones allow the rest of the party a chance to attack bloody bones, though some still struggling to keep composure and hit effectively. As bloody bones is surrounded a final insult to injury is given as Bloody bones twist and recoils, defeated. (25/2/22) Tyor, 200EF[ ] The party arrived in the town of Elderfall make their way to the bazaar, ready for the festivities. The troupe spotted were an eclectic people of boisterous personalities, each making their booths known loudly. Kreev made his way to the dining area and handed out owlbear-sourced bao, to the enjoyment of the attendees. Bazaar, the leader of the circus troupe, pulled Kreev aside and reprimanded him for handing out the food for free. The two struck a deal so that Bazaar would sell the goods and reap the profits, but would promote Freehearth as their place of origin. Bazaar instead proceeded to sell the bao for half a gold each without promoting the town. Nonetheless, a large crowd gathered in-line to purchase the bao, with Ered at the back of the line, waiting to do business with Bazaar. Meanwhile, Ana and Myrtille approached Tomerei's Visions, a fortune-telling booth. Ana had her fortunes read first, and the cards were drawn... The Artefact, for there was something in her past which must be found and dealt with; the Abjurer, for she must follow a trail of clues which are laid upon the foundations of logic, not faith; the Beggar, for Ana will soon meet her fate and be short of fortune for it. Myrtille was next... The Charlatan, for his past was full of lies, either told by him or told to him; the Druid, for he searches of that which is rooted in the natural world, for the chaotic; the Trasmuter, for he will find what he is looking for, but who can say if that will be for good or ill. Following the reading, Ana scans the room and attempts to read an Abyssal book called The Anathema's Whispers, but the fortune-teller reacts angrily and bars her from reading past the title. The two leave. Whilst that occured, Ered made his way to the front of the line and talked with Bazaar about the purchase of the owlbear. Bazaar suspiciously counters with the announcement that an investor was looking into business with the bazaar, and the owlbear was integral to his investment. Thus, the original asking price of the owlbear would have to rise. Cecilia, low on coin, tries her luck at a game of archery. However, she quickly deduces that the bow handed to her would throw off her aim. She mentions this to the con-man running the stall, but having already paid him, she takes a stab at it. Her first arrow misses entirely, her second only barely misses. Her third, however, (with the inspiration of Kreev) hits dead-on... and explodes the target with a burst of thunder. Tasia, having searched for a place to gamble, and failed, decided to try her hand at the apothecary. The alchemist presented her potions of every variety, of which she chose the Focus Potion. The troupe began to pack up and call for people to enter the tent, so the party finished their last pieces of business. Cecila got a reading from the fortune-teller (revealing the cards for the Mercenary, Healer and Monk), Ana and Kreev browse a magical trinket stall, and Myrtille gets his face painted as the Archfey Tuar\u00e1idh. The party regrouped, but not before the Queen Ciara Hyland arrived, accompanied by an armed escort. The party paid their respects and ceded the way to her before following on her tail. The tent had tiered seating, twelve-feet tall, with the richest at the far back with the best view. Bizarre Bazaar stepped out from behind a curtain and talked tall of the greatness that awaited the audience, before calling out the opening act: Kreev B. Earbender! Kreev, with the use of illusion magic, told an enrapturing story about the Emerald and the Lime, in verse, concluding with an illusory tree sprouting the symbol of Elderfall on its bark. Kreev retreats and Bazaar introduces the next act: Firebreather Atrios, the con-man who ran the archery booth. He breathed fire all around, and the shape of the fire changed to that of magical beasts. The stage appeared that it would begin to burn before it erupted in a burst of flames, and Atrios was gone. Bazaar once again introduces the act; from the far-off land of Sumeria, a beastly elephant, and on its back the Tabaxi Song of Paradise. Next, a tamed owlbear is beckoned forth and is commanded to dance on its hind legs with the use of Song of Paradise's whip. Finally, the Illusionist Kasdiel and the story-teller Vephyr are summoned forth, and begin to tell the \"greatest story every told in this world\". The braziers dim and erupt again, purple. Starlight energy filled the room and the hairs on the back of everyone's necks stand up. Vephyr speaks of primordial existence, a dreaming force which grants wishes, one whom the gods should fear. She names the Volute, the One, the Dark End... A bell tolls, and all hell breaks loose. Ana leapt from her feet, bolting out of the tent; Myrtille drew his rapier and batted at invisible illusions of chains and shadows; Cecilia sat enraptured, paralysed by the magic. A riot erupted within the tent and the guards escorted the Queen outside. With Kreev, Tasia and Ered confronting the circus staff, the news came: the city was under attack. The party ran outside and found the city in chaos. The bell continued to toll, and Boca hoards ran rabid, tailed by giant goats and Tribocs. A full moon settled in the sky. The fight would be bloody. From the Queen's keep came Hrornirr, Ludithas and Captain Keegan McCann with legions of infantry and archers. The party, with the Queen, fought their way to the centre of the city, where the reinforcements awaited. The group fought in the crossroads of north, south, east and west. Many times, each party member had their bodies shattered, only to rise with the healing of another. Ludithas continually banished powerful enemies as Hrornirr transformed himself into a fiery spirit and leapt into the crowd. The infantry squadrons were directed and led by Captain Keegan, who nearly singlehandedly defended the northern road. Even the Queen herself demonstrated powerful magic in the city's defence. It was then that Gobhar showed himself. Emerging from invisibility, he struck at Keegan with his short-swords before shuddering off into the darkness. Then, he leapt from the rooftop to stab the Queen, retreating again. But the goat-man would not find his path unhindred. Hrornirr gave chase, conflagrating the goat and blinding him. As the party took shots at him from below, he attempted another retreat, fleeing across the bridge to the north. His escape seemed inevitable, but Hrornirr pursued and incinerated him with a burst of sunlight. The day had been won, but who could truly measure the human cost of the defence? After all, a portion of the city had been enslaved by retreating Bocas... (05/03/22) Kaarina, 200EF[ ] The Party start in [Elderfall](/wiki/Elderfall), Killian makes a faux pas when meeting the queen but the party rally together Ludithas hands each member of the party an item - -Ana receives a Diviners Die - -Killian is handed a badge of the savant (transmutation) and 3 scrolls - -Dazomar is given a wand of the Wyrwood - -Ariana is gifted a Staff of the Vineyard - -Raisuboi is handed a Battle-chef Field Dresser - -Ered is blessed with a Hyland Shield The party spend the night in [Elderfall](/wiki/Elderfall) attuning to their items and copying down spells, the party reach the bridge West of Elderfall come nightfall and decide to push into the night Raisuboi, Arania and Dazomar suffer exhaustion they settle in the mountains Killian and Ana take first watch Forfin smells iron on the air they deduce that it is blood drifting down from the mountains.

Arania takes the next watch she feels unsettled by a feeling coming from the hills, she inspects her new staff and notices that it has shrivelled slightly in the night. Ered takes the next watch he feels the same unease as everyone else but wanders off and speaks with an unseen being named Trilly but his watch too is uneventful.

Dazomar takes the last watch and hears the sound of drums in the night but the drums petered out come morning looking up to the mountain he sees a regular goat stood on the mountain side watching them. The next day Medrawt attempts to stalk the goat but biffs it and slides down the cliff face, they discuss the smell of blood and the drums and conclude that things could be taking a dire turn, they climb up the mountain the ground becoming more barren as they climb eventually losing the path in a mist that forms in the higher reaches of the hills Ered wanders ahead and the group are ambushed by three Manticores.

Present - The Shephard, those that aid bearing burdens for those who cannot shoulder it alone. Future - The Traitor, betrayal from someone close or trusted a loss of faith. Arania is thankful for her reading, Raisuboi offers Aid to Ered, Ana and Killian, Killian as they continue on Ered discovers a stone path leading further into the hills they find effigies with eyes carved upon them Killian covers them as the party move on the night draws near and find a stone bridge leading to torches burning with a red light and large carved stone pillars everyone prepares as Dazomar walks ahead, the group enter to a gruesome sight a terrified man is beheaded by Boc\u00e1nach in front of an Altar surrounded by a congregation, the congregation turns as the party enter.

(13/03/22) Kolopa, 200EF[ ] The night before Ana is awoken by midrawt. She sees a single black feather on the floor, and finds that there is a trail of feathers leading to the shrine. The is a mist and haze coming from it. Before the altar is a creature, bare of chest with a torn cloak. A raven sits on it's shoulder. The being bids Ana to stay, asking her to swear an oath, a binding to the queen in perpetuity. Ana swears an oath to the queen of fate. The group meets up by Ana's caravan, but Dazomar hasn't shown up. Brochlilly introduces herself to the group. Azar insinuates that Kreev embellishes his stories. Kreev finds a note left by Dazomar's door. A riddle that gives them the clue to head north to his new lair. The party travels north to his mine/lair, Dazomar sits by a table in his lair by hoards of random trinkets and invites the party for food and drink. Kreev offers wine to everyone, but changes Azar's to taste like onions. Azar accuses Kreev of changing the taste but Dazomar tries to play it off. Azar changes Kreev's wine to taste like old sour milk. Dazomar, Kreev and Azar continue to take shots at each other. Azar, Ana and Brochlilly seem sceptical about Dazomar's claims of being a dragon. The party head west for luchtaine's tomb. Two statues flank the half hidden entrance, their faces worn, one holding carpenters tools, another a shield and javelin. The party finds a paladin of dagda by the entrance. The tomb of the Aes'ahn, the gods. Memorial to a person who stayed behind to protect the Aes'ahn At the base of the statue is a engraved riddle. We four are drawn. We four are life. We four are the light We four are the darkness. We four are the beginning. We four are the end. The statue is surrounded by 4 empty bowls. They have four symbols on them, the party surmises that they represent the four elements. The party manages to solve Air, fire and earth. Pickle casts Armor of Agathys and jumps into the water bowl, it turns red and one foot of the statue breaks free. Azar fills the bowl with normal water and prestiditates the water to be warmer. It lights up and opens the way, the paladin of Dagda(Glynmaer Stillspell) wonders if it was too easy, but he was just not smart enough to solve it. The paladin tries to move through the tunnel but is hit by a magical spike trap. Pickle tries to put a bunch of gravel on the floor to walk across but he is pierced. Ana climbs across the tunnel, not touching the floor in the process. The paladin gets hurt somewhat trying to cross. Brochlilly follows suit. In the chamber beyond is a sarcophogus. Here lies Luchtaine, shipwright of the Aes'ahn. There is an incription on the tomb: Upon the seas of yore, We sail to the land anew. Rejoice before the Aes'ahn, We are powerful but few. We bring only life and hearth, To bring light to the lands of shadow, From the ships we sail through storms, Earth and roots shall grow. We are the Aes'ahn. We are the light. Pickle tries to walk across the trapped tunnel on stilts but they soon fail him and he has to scramble back. Ana and the paladin offer a prayer as they deliberate on what to do. They choose to run through with the chest. Glynmeer the paladin offers food and rest for the party to partake in. Ana reads Azar's fortune: Past: the Missionary, those who spread wisdom and faith to others; warnings of the spread of fear and ignorance Present: the Anarchist, A fundamental change brought on by one whose beliefs are being put to the test Future: the Torturer, The coming of suffering or merciless cruelty; one who is irredeemably evil or sadistic Ana also reads Pickle's fortune: Past: the innocent, a being curious and unaware of the outside world Present: the conjurer, the coming of an unexpected supernatural threat; those who think themselves as gods Future: the Guild member, Like-minded individuals joined together in a common goal; pride in one's work Ana does Glynmeer's fate Past: the trader, Commerce, smuggling and black markets; fair and equitable trades Present: the thief, those who steal or burgle; a loss of property, beauty, innocence, friendship, or reputation Future: the Rogue The paladin seems shook by the reading and he goes out to get some fresh air. Azar tries to cheer him up and tell him that his fate is in his hands. Kreev tells a story to cheer everyone up about a dwarf and a faberge egg. But Glynmeer who can only think about his fortune reading seems bothered by it and thinks it's calling him a thief. The party takes a rest and on Brochlilly's watch Glynmeer goes out for a walk. Brochlilly wakes up Pickle with a horn of silent alarm, who procedes to wake up everyone else with a scream. Azar looks for Glynmeer but cannot find the Firbolg. Pickle almost broke the sacred relic inside the chest. The party skirts the base of the mountain northwards, seeing the smoke of a large bonfire in the distance. By the fire sits two giants, Kobar(Hill giant), Sloog(stone Giant), and their pets a giant goat(Gip) and an owlbear(hoot). Pickle approaches the giants and they seem friendly one of them looks at pickle and asks him to help him get a bone out from in between his molars. He proceeds to do so with the nervous party looking on, some perhaps expecting the giant to eat him. The giants are planning on attacking the war camp to the north because they stole from their people. The giants wants to kill everyone in the camp but the party convinces them to spare those that give up. The party follows the giants as they attack in the middle of the night. As they approach the camp a stone genasi woman comes out on the walls but is yeeted by a rock from one of the giants. Azar calls out for them to lay down their arms, but the inhabitants of the camp seem confused. She calls out to Pickle who has charged up to the gate and says that they are willing to let the party in if the giants stay at a safe distance. Pickle burrows under the gate and says that the giants promised not to attack if they laid down their arms. Kimberlite the stone genasi seems confused about why they are here as there seems to be a misunderstanding with the giants mistakely thinking that they stole from them. Kimberlite asks for a bit of time, but Ana sees that she is stalling. The gate bursts open and a swarm of earth elementals attack the party. Kimberlite turns into a giant dragon made from individual stones. Kognar and Sloog throw boulders at the dragon. The dragon goes after Pickle when it notices his gem. It shows him a symbol of a jagged crown on one of it's scales wants Pickle to join them, in a family and to meet the king. After Dazomar, Pickle and Kreev are blasted by a breath of jagged rocks, Kreev manages to trick the dragon into thinking Pickle has the gem, when he had instead taken it when Pickle was unconsious. Pickle allows himself to be taken and the dragon tries to fly off with him. Dazomar finishes off the dragon using a well aimed chromatic orb. The giants find the relic they were looking for, which is called a stone of Terra. The stone genasi turned dragon had been sent by someone called Onyx to get the stone and pretend to be a band of the fangs of the begger king. A letter detailing her mission was found: Hold the east and continue to play the part. Our work continues and we hold three of the six Stones of Terra. Four with your own included. The King shall return. The prophecy shall be fulfilled. Your duty to the King shall be well rewarded. We hope you find this gift as an acceptable down payment for your efforts. When the Frosting Mourn ends, we shall destroy all that remains of Elderfall as they lick their wounds. When all is done, we shall celebrate in the halls of Therra and rejoice before our King and Queen. Onyx. (26/03/2022) Val, 200EF[ ] The party decides to set out to investigate the Temple of Danu, although they are joined first by a newcomer by the name of Auxley St. Crow, an associate of the shopkeeper Rassad. The town is ever growing, and the man hopes to establish a means of business within Freehearth. The growing chill inspires the party to gather winter clothing before they head out. The group sets out to the South, encountering along the way several animals, some alive and some feeding on the corpses: a dire wolf feasting on an elk, a bear being eaten by griffons, and finally an assortment of smaller animals embedded deep in craters, having been left unperturbed. Though Brochlily attempts to entreaty with the griffons, they spurn her and encourage her to leave. Azar hypothesizes that the deaths of these animals may have been caused by some sort of Earth elemental. The party arrives in town, and are directed towards the Elder, a genasi dressed in purple called [Sadanna Al-Baahish](/wiki/Sadanna_al-Baahish). He claims that a witch, Wealda,, likely now residing in the temple of Danu, has placed a blight upon the town. He explains that she was a bitter woman, who left after being denied access to the elder's burial site. Killian inquires after her role in the town, to which the Elder explains that she knew medicine and healing. He also provides Killian with a scroll, in hopes it will allow him to dispel any curse. Dazomar requests a riddle from the Elder, which he presents. \"Two bodies have I, though both joined in one, the more I stand still the faster I run\" Auxley, Dazomar, and Pickle puzzle over the riddle, although Auxley maintains that he has already solved it. Killian and Azar discuss the Elder. Killian expresses the belief that the Elder has given an unfavorable opinion of the witch, and that he thinks that likely she did not cause the blight she is being blamed for, mentioning the inconsistency of the \"famine\" the elder described. The two search for her house, and after hearing that she did not have one, the two have a conversation with one of the witch's disciples, a healer named Caihome, who says that Wealda was a kind and pious woman, if a bit gruff, who disappeared. Dazomar returns to the Elder, Pickle, in tow, and presents his answer: An hourglass. Satisfied, Dazomar presents his own riddle, which Sadanna promptly answers. The group continues to the church, where they find the way blocked by vines, which attack Killian when he attempts to examine them. They attack each member of the party other than Brochlily, who they allow to pass into the chapel after she displays her holy symbol. The rest of the party rush the doors, bringing them inside but awakening a swarm of blights. The party engages in battle. Much of the party is trapped in vines, but after some aid from Forfin's teeth, and a withering spell from Killian, the vines are broken. Brochlily shreds some vine monsters, as Dazomar and Azar face the largest blight, who seems very frustrated by the whole situation. Although it angrily demands the party leave, the party refuses to do so unless it explains itself, and so Azar slays the plant creature. The vines retract to reveal that the monster was in fact, the witch Wealda, whom Killian gentle reposes. A search of the chapel reveals an unsent letter, showing that Wealda was in collusion with Ludithas against Sadannah, as well as the ritual that Wealda undertook in order to transform herself into a blight creature. Brochlily is shaken by this revelation, and apologizes to her God profusely. Pickle, soured by his past experience with Genasi, believes that Sadanna has deceived them. Killian suggests the party travel to the Elder Burial Grounds, where Sadannah had urged them not to go, and investigate whatever secrets are there. They lock the door, setting up an alarm of salt, and set off. Upon arrival at the Burial Grounds, Dazomar notices a spirit, later revealed to be [Markus ,](/wiki/Markus_Tosima) take form and follows it to a tomb, where he finds the riddle that Sadannah gave to him engraved on a tomb. Following the ghost's action, he draws an hourglass in the sand and the coffin opens up, leading to a secret passage leading downwards. The party, except for Brochlily, are sucked into a glyph when the stairs turn into a slide, and Brochlily follows afterwards. The party awakens in a large tomb of sand and glass, quickly surmised to be an hourglass. There is a temple ahead of them, which they enter, noticing a scrying sensor focused on Sadanna and a great map. Continuing into the next room, they discover a regal woman sitting on a throne, who introduces herself as [Cytherea](/wiki/Cytherea). Upon hearing Dazomar claim himself to be a dragon, she gets immensely upset with him and demands that he leave the room. Cytherea reveals that Sadanna is both her master and a dao, and that he had trapped her within the hourglass to keep an eye on his treasures. This was after Sadanna was freed by Markus, in exchange for making the man a king. She says she can help the party escape if they agree to free her, and the party does. To ensure they don't run off and leave her, she takes items of insurance from each member of the party: A necklace from Azar's parents, Auxley's buisness documents, Brochlily's stuffed focus, Dazomar's wand, Pickle's focus gem, and an origami crane from Killian which he does not explain. She allows each party member to select a treasure from the tomb, although she maintains that no containers can be opened and no detection magic may be used. The party make their decisions, and Pickle steals a gem. Then, she gives the party an invocation, which they use to teleport out of the hourglass. They then free Cytherea, who returns to the party their insurance. Killian offers that she join them for some sort of revenge on Sadanna, but she says she must join her family in Sameria, who she has never met. She then takes on a draconic sphinx-like form, and then flies off. Upon returning to the town, the party discovers that they have been gone for three weeks, and that Sadanna has disappeared. However, there is no evidence that he has intruded upon the temple grounds. 02/04/22 Aldwar, 200EF[ ] The Party start in Elderfall, Pickle, Brochlily and Azar approach Ludithas in the royal court and ask for a private audience with him where they explain what went down at the Temple of Danu, Ludithas asks for the body recovered by Killian and the party agree to hand it over. Ludithas explains that the six stones of Terra contain souls of a great elemental spirits and if they were to be brought together they would cause calamity, he also tells them that he is the holder of one of the stones, the group then show Ludithas the Remembrance Orb and the sights within, they come to the conclusion that Ludithas travelling with the stone is too great a risk and should stay put for now, they spoke of Ludithas meeting with the giants and seeking an alliance, after the bleak meeting the party set off for Killeith Pickle argues for attempting to talk to the King of Dun Therra Raisuboi, Ered and Brochlily are all for it and Ana and Azar are cautious but willing to give it a go. The party enter Killeith, Brochlily and her uncle the town elder Brochroot catch up they then go to the tavern the party settle down with drinks of Gleaming Bear, Ana does a card reading for their mission to Dun Therra: The Beast The Avenger The Mercenary Pickle looks dejected as this gives the impression that this quest will not go as he planned, Raisuboi asked for a card reading.

The party rise the next day and head straight for Dunn Therra when they approach they see a statue of a man his features obscured by distance and weathering but the party are able to tell that it is a statue of a humanoid male with ruby eyes and a jagged crown Raisuboi suggests Pickle talks to the statue and receives a booming reply in response the talks with the gem devolve into \"Protect Pickle\" Combat begins and the Mud statue comes to life and grabs Pickle, Raisuboi drops his weapon and shows that he means no harm the mud golem releases Pickle and reforms itself as a ball of earth and rolls into Dunn Therra and orders the door open it then leads the party through the Fortress passed rows upon rows of Terracotta Soldiers and into the throne room where they meet a human woman claiming to be the wife of the King, she explains to Pickle that the king has been waiting for him to bring him the Gemstone as it is his voice, the party discover that the human woman is Brianna Hyland and Markus Tosima is the King of Dunn Therra, the party try to talk the King into a peaceful solution but they are interrupted when Sudanna reaches into The King's mind and forces him to attack.

(11/04/22) - Zetos, 201EF[ ] Defence of Elderfall[ ] Involved Party Members: Before setting off for Elderfall, Pickle beseeches his patron for guidance, uncertain how to act given his prior promises to both protect the innocent folk of [Elderfall](/wiki/Elderfall) but also to Markus Tosima. No answer comes, leaving Pickle in further uncertainty still, but the party sets off, travelling with haste in response to Queen Ciara's call to arms. At the walls of Elderfell, the party is joined by a small number of martial folk, those trained with bow, with axe and sword, and militia groups enlisted from the general populace of the city. With the repeated attacks of the [Boc\u00e1](/wiki/Boc%C3%A1nach), the city's forces and defences have been greatly depleted, with many of the calls for aid to the surrounding nations and kingdoms yet unanswered. Nonetheless, there are a few familiar faces likewise present to lend a hand - the giants [Kobar](/wiki/Kobar) and [Sloog](/wiki/Sloog), the elder of Barnard [Se\u00f2naid Mcguinness](/wiki/Se%C3%B2naid_Mcguinness) and defenders Elderfall [Ludithas](/wiki/Ludithas) and [Keegan McCann](/wiki/Keegan_McCann). Both [Avalon](/wiki/Avalon) and [Auxley](/wiki/Auxley_St._Crow) offer up inspiring talks to the groups of infantry in their care, both to middling effect, with Avalon's being deemed ultimately mediocre and Auxley's offers of a discount on survival only generating further questions. To save them their awkwardness, an army of a dozen units of terracotta warriors marches from the edge of the horizon, joined by a pair of genasis - Scoria and Onyx, a elemental creature referred to as [Markus Tosima](/wiki/Markus_Tosima)/Therraczar by the opposition, a number of cult warriors and [Brianna Hyland](/wiki/Brianna_Hyland), now in battle dress. They carry with them two curiosities - the petrified remains of [Ered](/wiki/Ered), and a white flag. An impromptu parley breaks out, with Ludithas and much of the party meeting with the leaders of the invaders outside the city gates (near to a previously cast Magic Circle intended to trap an elemental being). After a frosty welcome home to Brianna, the invaders make their demands - the Terra Stone, noting that the elemental 'Markus' already appears in possession of four of them, with obvious intentions to claim a fifth. They rebuke claims of their bloodthirsty nature, instead suggesting that Elderfall's resistance to their intentions to be folly, for only united under Markus could a true and better future be forged - instead of the chaos of disparate nations as currently present. Azar beseeches Onyx to relinquish Ered's body to them, or at the very least a neutral resting place, with the pair ultimately agreeing to a one-on-one duel for it. Though cunning use of Mirror Image and Shield, Azar manages to fend off a number of strikes from the earth genasi, protected as they by means of Metamorphic Mantle, but once they start connecting, they quickly fell the Janni, who is promptly healed by [Ludithas](/wiki/Ludithas). With the likelihood of an agreement between the opposing parties dwindling with concerns about the influence of [Sadanna al-Baahish](/wiki/Sadanna_al-Baahish), they return to their ranks, and battle commences. Infantry and Fyrd hordes rush into combat, meeting with the legions of terracotta warriors, with all but Alzara and the Ranger Hordes fighting at their side. From afar, the latter pair harry the foes with volleys of arrows and Chromatic Orbs. Avalon, empowered by her potions leads with blade in hand, Auxley emboldens his allies with masterful words, aiding all the while with his crossbow, Arania and her Awakened Air thundering and entangling the landscape. Azar, while still reeling from his duel hexes those marching forth, shattering them with bolts of force, while Pickle proves a devastating combatant as his Armor of Agathys gives back far more than he receives. The Giants Sloog and Kobar cast rocks from afar before raising their clubs high, and for a time a stalwart defence is afforded. Complications come in the form of earth and mud elementals that spring from the soil at the heroes' feet, along with mud mephits that restrain many within sluices of stinking mud. Avalon is knocked unconscious, only to be healed by Ludithas shortly after being dragged clear, leaping back into the fray once more. As Scoria rushes to meet Pickle in combat, he is targetted by Kobar, who wounds the genasi deeply enough to allow Pickle to finish him off - the body melting to just leave a smouldering blade - but a second wave terracotta warriors start to close in. Calls for retreat back to the walls from Keegan echo true as a number of infantry units begin to fall. Horns call from the north, a pair of mounted units and reinforcements of infantry from Port Arden, blue shields proudly displayed. As Therraczar and a pair of Earth Elementals start to close in, the cavalry charge tears through a group of terracotta warriors, but leave themselves vulnerable, now engaged and surrounded on all sides by stone-faced soldiers. Once again, the battle turns against the defenders with an unyielding wave of terracotta warriors simply outnumbering the dwindling residents of Elderfall, though perfectly on cue, [Hrornirr](/wiki/Hrornirr) arrives with rangers and barbarians from Ravencourt. They cannot engage quickly enough to prevent Onyx from striking his blade into the stone at his feet, casting Earthquake and devastating the eastern part of the city's walls, gate and buildings. With Alzara and the Elderfall bowmen tumbling from the damaged battlements, the rubble also temporarily buries [Azar](/wiki/Azar_Toraven). Flames erupt across the battlefield courtesy of a Fire Storm by the bugbear Hrornirr as the Ravencourt reinforcements move into position, barbarians raging wildly while rangers shoot from afar. Fighting alongside the pair of giants, Pickle puts down a number of terracotta warriors, both through blade and his frigid arcane defence, but is knocked unconscious when his Eldritch Rock misfires and explodes in his face. Coordinating their volleys with Alzara's casting of Slow through use of the Staff of the Snail, a cluster of Earth Elementals, Therraczar and Onyx are assailed from afar, breaking Onyx's concentration on Earthquake and prompting him to flee directly into the arrows of a further volley from the rangers of Ravencourt. Like Scoria, he too crumbles to ash leaving behind his weapon. Therraczar moving forwards into the Glyph of Warding, trapping him temporarily in an inverted Magic Circle, before being freed by the efforts of his wife, Brianna. The reinforcements from Port Arden and Ravencourt continue to clear up the terracotta warriors, though suffer heavy casualties as they go, while Kobar has a bold idea to awaken Pickle - tossing him directly at Therraczar. Pickle takes bludgeoning damage and awakens, Therraczar takes Pickle-collision damage and then responds by pummelling Pickle into unconsciousness, then earth gliding beneath the surface. Hrornirr turns into a giant eagle, flying the petrified Ered to cast Greater Restoration on the firbolg and freeing him from his affliction, although the pair are now surrounded by Terra Guards and cultists - most prove to be short-lived courtesy of both Divine Smites and a Fire Storm. Volleys of arrows continue to pick off stray groups of terracotta warriors, with another landing directly on Brianna and her pair of honour guards, wounding them greatly. Brianna flees, her guards are struck down by a mounted charge by the Ardenian cavalry. Using his Steady Aim, Auxley makes a near impossible shot and catches Brianna in the leg, slowing her escape further. While Hrornirr avoids slaying the Queen's sister, a volley of arrows from the rangers of Ravencourt starts her bleeding out, unconscious. Ludithas and Alzara start to move for the Keep, fearing it to be the destination of the burrowing Therraczar, who shortly after re-emerges, its neck glowing with a jagged crown-like golden haze and glowing yellow eyes. Attracting the attention of volleys and giant-wielded greatclubs, the inanimate elemental fails to react, prompting concern from both Ludithas and Pickle of Sadanna's imminent involvement. Ludithas, in response, uses Mind Blank on himself, and the rest of the group ready themselves. Discussion breaks with regard to Sadanna's plan, fearing that the Dao might seek the destruction of Markus/Therraczar to claim the stones for themselves, and so the party ceases their assault at Ludithas' suggestion that he might be able to do something, but only if the elemental is subdued and held still for a minute. As Kobar and Sloog move to do so, Therraczar stirs into motion once more, clobbering both of the giants in turn. After a few moments hesitation, the defenders start harrying Therraczar once again at Alzara's behest, who intends to use Sleep to help subdue the elemental further while Ludithas starts to cast Magic Circle. Therraczar reawakens, flailing widely at Ludithas by only hitting his Mirror Image duplicates, while Pickle and longbowmen attacks start to cause cracks to propagate over the elemental's form, and so Alzara rolls the dice on her Sleep. The spell takes hold, subduing Therraczar long enough for Ludithas to cast Magic Circle, trapping him. Repeatedly assaults, by magic and metal alike, break down the elemental's form, spilling four Terra Stones (including Pickle's arcane focus and the [Heart of Umgor Azkhron](/wiki/Heart_of_Umgor_Azkhron)) to the floor, and facilitating the trapping of Markus through use of Imprisonment. The group agrees to share the Terra Stones across the Kingdoms to further bind them together as a sign of unity, with the Heart of Umgor Azkhron being put under lock and key in Port Arden, one to Ravencourt, Pickle's arcane focus returned to him, and the final green stone to [Freehearth](/wiki/Freehearth) to watch over, most likely in Arania's Hallowed Grove. Evara, 201EF[ ] Party Members: The party meets up in Dazomar's lair, and discuss their plans to travel to Toorboney, where there is tell of a curse that infects the town. The townspeople who live there have not been seen or heard from for over a year, and the people give it a wide berth. The party sets off in the morning for travel. Along the way, the party encounters a group of traders, who try to sell the party gemstones that have fallen from the sky. As Rasaad had put out a bounty on such things, Killian, Azar, and Tasia fork over 700gp for about 1000gp of gems. They also learn that the Elder of Toorboney had an affair resulting in a half dwarf child, and that the people of Toorboney were radical human purists. There's also whispers of incest, which leads Killian to associate the curse with some sort of focus on blood purity. Azar is not convinced. The party decides to rest before continuing. An ominous mist appears as the sun sets, with it seizing control of Forfin's mind and encouraging him to wander deep into the town before Killian poofs him away. Kreev takes this event to be an inspiration for some sort of spooky ghost cat story. The next morning, Tasia casts Augury and learns that danger lies ahead, despite the fact that the mist seems to have cleared up. The village has fallen into decay, and Forfin notices a great many ghosts walking around. Using see invisibility, Azar is also able to see these ghosts, and Killian and Azar move ahead to scout. Dazomar and Tasia are both cursed after crossing paths with ghosts, Dazomar feeling an urge to eat plant life and Tasia being stunned. Examining a house, Killian and Forfin see a Shadow, which makes Killian very nervous. Kreev, Tasia, Dazomar, and Auxley head off to adventure on their own, with Kreev being knocked unconscious when he crosses paths with a ghost. This allows him to witness the past momentarily, as one of the ghosts explains to him that the elder is a madman who uses dark magic and steals daughters, and invites him to join in a revolution the townspeople are planning on holding. The party agrees to venture up to the elder's manor, but along the way, they pause to examine a local schoolhouse. This house is filled with will o' wisps, which beat the fuck out of Killian. After a brief engagement, they're defeated, and the party checks out the school. They find the word \"Rith\" written on a blackboard, but are unable to translate it from Druidic. Though they briefly pause outside the manner to discuss a rest, the mist appears again and forces them inside. The party breaks a window and clambers in to find a study, and from there, they examine several rooms. Upon entering and exiting a room, they often seemed to change. A Dining Room - Originally, this room was empty and filled with decaying, rotting food. Dazomar discovered a secret passage in the bookcase, leading to a side area. This room also had a painting of the elder and his dwarf bastard. On a later visit, the room had changed to a feast of skeletons with half eaten meals at their fingertips, which Forfin was able to confirm was poison. Though the secret room was blocked, Dazomar managed to return to it, where he found a book bound in human flesh and numerous poisons. He refrained from mentioning either to his companions, although Killian and Azar returned on their lonesomes to take the poisons and books respectively. The skeletons later come alive. Study Area - The party determines from a letter that the family's name is Doylei, and that the dwarf is sometimes called 'the Abhartach'. He seems to have taken over eldership after his father, and seems hateful and distraught at how little the people here trust him. He resolves to marry the blacksmith's daughter, Deirdre, as he believes this will help him to mend the gaps. Hallway - After a few journeys, the gargoyles here came to life and attacked the party, joined eventually by the skeletons from the dining hall. Kreev uses his pipes of haunting to keep most of the skeletons trapped in the room, and they're promptly locked in. After the gargoyles are defeated, the party journeys upstairs. Bedrooms - The party journeys around, finding two bedrooms. The Abhartach talks in more letters about how he learned magic from a druid, and that he needed to use the key on a book. Dazomar is able to find a cold iron dagger hidden in a piano, which the party assumes is the key, but Azar and Dazomar does not share the information about the book the former has taken. Examining a closet in the hall, Killian is able to find a lever which allows the party to descend down into a tomb lit by blue light. Following it, which Killian insists they do as a group, the party passes through crypts to arrive at a coffin marked \"Dearg Due\". Killian hesitantly opens it to find a woman, clutching a note. It is the Abhartach's bride, the blacksmith's daughter whom he stole away and who rejected his advances. The Abhartach arrives, furious with the party, who he commands to leave. He is obviously vampiric in nature, and his wife, who seemed dead, rises from the coffin. It comes to light that the Abhartach is holding the souls of all the villagers he killed, not allowing them to pass into an afterlife. The party seems reluctant to leave, and Killian makes an attempt to seize control of his mind, which fails, and combat begins. Kreev utilizes a major image to try and convince the Abhartach that the peasants are still alive and distract him. The Abhartach reveals himself to be a practitioner of dissidence magic when he attempts to lull Tasia with the call of the void. It fails, but this distressses Killian somewhat as the creature's bride attacks, As Dozamar falls, Azar runs ahead to try and force the dwarf to flee, but before he is able the unsettling change of the Abhartachs appearance throws off the spell. Dozamar is healed by Kreev and launches a chromatic orb at the vampire before getting to safety. Now with Azar, prone, and in an unfavorable situation, he is forced to be the front line of defence as he is hounded by attacks from the vampires. Despite his shield he is still attacked and bitten by the Abhartach as he uses him to regain health. Killian firebolts the vampire and he is forced to flee with dissonant whispers. With a final mind whip from Azar the fleeing Abhartach is killed though his body remains. Immediately Dearg Dues persona changes as the charm effects from her capture wear off. Asking to be called Dierdrie again and after a quick discussion, she wishes to walk into the sunlight and end her torment/transformation forced on her by the dwarf. As they leave the manor Tasia and Azar have a slight, as Tasia opts to check the remaining crypts for loot. Hoping to end the curse on the town and put its ghostly residents to rest, the pseudo-vampires body is also pulled into the sunlight. To which it crumbles into dust. With see-invisibility still up, Azar proclaims that the ghostly villagers seem to have departed and the party believe they have managed to end the curse on the abandoned Torbooney. 05/06/2022 - Kharisrain, 201EF[ ] After meeting the potential candidates in the town square regarding the future election of Freehearth the group head to stonevale. Pickle calls upon his Peryton Steed ready to ride forwards. As they get to the bridge they pass on to an emaciated man that seems to speak in rhyme and holds out his hand for charity, familiar to some of them. Ana, having not met him previously, vibe checks him and gets a feeling of both weal and woe. Azar, having recognised the man from a previous trip passes by after giving a gold coin and some rations. Thought he has to seemingly give more than what was previousl acceptable. Kreev offers 2 set of rations and continues, which is seemingly not enough for the man this time as he speaks of the tears he will shed. After hearing Azar and Kreevs warning Illinois offers 5 coins and a poem; \"Over hills and over meadow, See the crow fly, feel her shadow. Beneath the earth and miasmic blight, Clandestine, covert, yet bears the light.\" To which he is prompetly grabbed before moving on. A mind speaks in his head \"Be careful of the words you speak\" in his mind. As he moves forwards somewhat startled. As Pickle moves ahead; 5 coins and 2 rations are given but the man seemingly requires more and so 5 more gold is given. Ered moves forward, offers 30 gold after offers some kind words, believing to share a kinship to the seemingly sad man, recognising a lonelineess and sorrow within him. Ana sits near him and begins to start make a tarot reading. The past; the Raven; A hidden source of information or secret. The present; The philanthirpist - Charity. And Future; The evoker, Supernatural power you cant control. Unsure as to whether the spirits were in the favour and providing a good reading, the man quickly turns to her; in floods of tears. Ana elects to share the night with him, not passing by, and making a camp near him. Ered and Azar also share his company. Still not feeling calm with the new camping arrangement Pickle communes with nature, of which a voice call out to warn him of the man on the bridge. \"Sorrow consumes his, hatred alike. He is Fear Gorta and he is unending.\" The voice also warns that the stream flows from the moutain, from a poison within and flows from both North and South. And that they should not drink the water. As he relays the information Ana takes a sample of the poison water. Illinois looks at the one eyed man through his spyglass. Instantly recoiling, Illinois leaves scared and says we shouldnt stay on the bridge. Illinois passes the spyglass to Kreev at which it gets passed to Azar and Pickle as they see the true visage of the man a seemingly undead man aswell. As it gets to night, Ana sees something in the distance, a radiant light on the horizon. And the voice of the man calls out towards the light. She finds herself walking towards a village placed somewhere in Tosima. A figure of the man appears on the edge of the village, wind celestials flying throught the village, a ringing in her ears. She hears the sound of bloody thristy cries and anguish. The streaks of light appear to be thrown spears of energy striking the village. With 3 bodies to him as he mourns them, they look starved but killed by the lighting. As they wake up the next day, Ana wakes up crying. Kreev feeling hungover and weaker, effected by the emaciated mans curse. Everyone else feels refreshed and great. As Ana casts Ashen Memories she sees the tales of the night before; With the undead form of the man holding her head, seemingly giving her the vision of the village she had the night before. Pickle leads the way to stonevale. A light in the distance moving towards them. As it moves closer, the creatures moves within 100ft. With candles for hands. The night is dark and frightening. The creature is short and has hands for candles. Yangant introduces himself as a humble servant. Offering light in the darkness from evil. He proclaims he is a devil. But a good one. Says he was summoned by another group that were practicing summoning things. They want to bring through his master, Coarthannach. They have a temple and sacrifices. As they try to find out where the temple is he is dismissivie and evasive. It comes out he created the darkness to be able to offer his light, supply and demand. He leads them to the village. but leaves before they get too close. As they make it to the settlement slowly constructed amongst the ruins of another. The group are met by the defacto leader and cleric of the new settlers/pilgrams. Alexios, most of the group is immeditely tense as they mention they are followers of Zitus and have taken the village as a holy sight in his name. As Kreev attempts to ease the tension he is recognised as a playwright back in ESkarya and immedietely put back on edge. Alexios mentions that they are a pacifist community and the dont necesserily agree with Eskaryas/ the states interpretation of Zitus' tenants. He tells a story of how often these dogmas/scripture can be misinterpreted by its followers, giving the example of some followers of Kol in history. As an avatar of Kol sent an Avatar to Tosima to ask all his followers on a hunt, with which they would smite every none beast (i.e human) that stand against the will of the pagan gods. Much to Pickles confusion. They go on a tour. Alexios shows them to a statue of a figure called Kosmos. Plaquarded; Commemoration Dominion, Kosmos. Believed to be the son of Zitus. And he shows the old ruins of a village before, seemingly worshipped by pagan worshippers. As night draws in Alexios is called away; a supposed force moving ahead, he asks the group to stay inside. A rival group of Zitus followers and Generals in armour move from the north. Lead by a Leonin named Leoques; he claims they are heretics that they worship the false dogma of Zitus. And that they should come to the capital to recieve \"judgement\". As he begins to forcefully pull Alexios away, the group begin to jump to their new friend/clerics aid. Azar tries to get the Leonin to drop Alexios but fails. Ered compels the Leonin to a duel throwing himself between the pacifist and the Leonin. Pickle, his Peryton, and Ana also run to the front lines to hold off the Leonin, his two generals and the horde. Kreev and Illinois throw spells to attempt to hinder their assailents and boost their party. The frontliners are continuilly attacked by the paladins absorbing many blows, but manage to remain on their feet for the most part; by the healing of Alexios and other party members. As Leoquis and the party trade smites, the Leonin is slowly harmed, and after being pulled back by the horde he calls forth a Deva into his service, ordering it to sack the town, to which it must comply. The deva heals the leonin and apologise to the party as a deal has been struck. Thought still injured the Leonin begins to flee as the Deva and the remains of the horde continue to knock the melee fighters to the ground. As Leoquis escapes the party manage to get the upperhand, dispatching the generals nd more of the hoarde. As the Deva falls to a thuderous inspired swing of the sword from Ana, Kreev asks Does it feel good? Do you feel youve earned those wings? Attacking a village of pacifists? To which it answers, with dying breath, No. The Deva does not seem to dissapear to the upper planes as the corpse remains slumped over and liveless on the floor. The remaining Horde leave seeing the battle lost and having been given mercy by the pacifists of the village and the party. Confused as to the circumstances they find themselves; defending followers of zitus from followers of zitus, questions are asked of the dead Devas corpse. Why help attack the town in you dont wish it? Treason, and a deal struck long ago. Ana requests they ask was he one of the party that attacked this town and brought it to ruin years ago - the same village shown to her by the emaciated man on the bridge; to which he replies Yes, Regrettably. The reason being under the same conditions of the current deal struck, seemingly forced to do so. When asked does he believe the paladins of the north or/and the paladins or the south/eskarya are following the true path of zitus? He disagrees. In the aftermath of the battle, Pickle begins to harvest the Deva, and the party seperate out the spoils of victory. As thanks; Alexios hands over a 300 diamond hoping they have no need of it in the future, but believing it be better to have if it is required (i.e for revivify). In the following days, Ana travels to Stonevale, as she is so inclined. Pickle has nightmares of firery hells, rattling chains and godless land, his sleep disturbed by visions. (19/6/2022) - Verdair, 201EF[ ] Killian, with the assistance of Illinois, cast Phantom Steed. However, the party protested at the creature's lack of skin, leading to a few edits by the Wizard. With their transport secured, the reconnaissance group set out towards Elder Fall - their destination simply to travel North. The were making good time, despite a lack of familiarity with land vehicles. The group moved North, deciding to investigate a potential bandit settlement north of a Leystone not far from Elder Fall. Not far from the stone they discovered a stone pathway towards it. They discovered the Leystone as the expected. Illinois sends his Crow Familiar, Raven into the center as Kreev himself also enters the circle. The stones light up at his presence but do not activate further. Illinois deduces that the Leystone was made for Pagan Gods and no one could activate it. The travelled Northwest to investigate the Bandit Camp next. Discovering some bandits indeed, Illinois sends in his Crow Familiar, Raven. Unfortunately, the bird stood out to the bandits. One of the bandits identified the Raven as being Illinois' Familiar, telling the group to come out and chat. After some hesitation, the Recon Party decided to emerge and speak. Killian attempts a disguise self, but it is seen through by the same man who spotted Raven. This man then noted how many amongst the recon party were Spell Casters. The Bandits chose to spare Killian and moved to 'take' the party. The bandits targeted the Spellcasters. They also showed resistance to the Magical Powers of the casters in the party. In the chaos, Killian even addressed the leader of the bandits by name - Aleida Darkdraft. After a few more words to Killian, the bandits retreated (harassed by Cecilia and Alzara). Alzara reads Killian's thought, determining that the two do indeed know each other rather well. Killian crossed the river to speak with Aleida, leaving the party to determine their next move. However, Illinois and Auxley spied on the conversation with their looking glasses - determining that Aleida and Killian were indeed working together. The group elected to revoke their trust in Killian. They elected to travel without the horses provided by Killian following this, staying close to the river. They soon came across a bridge - where the soldiers guarding it demanded tribute. Through various amounts of gold and favor, the party managed their way across without further conflict. As they crossed, Cecilia noted a Paganstic marking on the skull banners the soldiers were using. The soldiers departed with a warning to watch the skies. That night they made camp. With Killian offering Leomund's Tiny Hut for protection and being rebuffed by all his traveling companions. Illinois watched for half the night before the corpse boy awoke Alzara. Alzara declared to Illinois that she would be speaking with Killian. Illinois offered backup but was rebuffed. As they spoke, Alzara convinced Killian to open up. Killian revealed Aleida was his \"sister\", of a sense, and they were linked by an organization. After their discussion finished, Kreev took the final watch. When the group awoke in the morning, Cecilia, Killian, and Auxley spotted a small brass construct in the shape of a raptor watching the group. The party continued north, the raptor seeming to follow them. Illinois lead the party for the day, bringing them nearly twenty miles. He spotted a herd of rams being lead by Stayr shepherds. Alzara inquired nonchalantly about the metal bird, to which the shepherd explained that \"they\" are keeping an eye on citizens. The Recon Group also deduced that the guards of the bridge were no friends of the Shepherds people. After purchasing the strange fleece of their rams the Shepherds warned them to avoid the \"spooky\" village to the north west. The group continued one north proper - spotting a strange cottage in the mountains and witnessing the death of a gliding creature as it plummeted. They then found the slime trail of a gastropod that seems to have been traveling in the same direction as the group. With the party thoroughly spooked, they moved north west towards the Whispering Woods. They settled in for the night, Kreev joining Killian in his hut and Alzara noting the Raptor watching them. Cecilia seeked out Illinois as the camp settled in for the night, asking after advice to improve her own survival skills. After a lengthy lesson, Cecilia and illinois begin to bond over their mutual memory loss. After discussing their wonder at their old lives, Illinois showed Cecilia a book with script he could not read. Cecilia proved unable to do so either, but did deduce it was written in an archaic druidic. Kreev and Killian also spoke for a bit before the Dragonman left on his watch. Sometime later, Killian's Hut became more opaque, blocking out the outside. What transpired inside was known only to Killian. The next morning the Wizard, seeming spooked, offered their horses again. The others put it to a vote. The vote was in favor. As the rode on, Killian, Illinois, and their Familiars. fell victim to the seeming power of the Whispering Wood, slipping into a trance. Kreev quickly countered Killian's state, but Alzara had to chase down Illinois a bit to get them all on track. Raven returned as well, but Forfin had to be dismissed. Spotting a structure in the distance, the party rode for it. Only to discover the shell of the gastropod they had been tracking the day prior. They quickly deduced the snail had expired, with a settlement made atop it's shell. Alzara climbed the corpse via Misty Step and sent a rope down for the others. Illinois, Auxley, and Cecilia discovered a greenhouse, ravaged and destroyed with broken potions. Cecilia discovered many plants used for potions in this area. Alzara, Killian, and Kreev moved towards the other side of the shell, finding a similar destructive scene and seemingly a corpse. Alzara determined that the corpse was alive and spoke via Detect Thoughts - learning that the corpse, wrapped in a cocoon, is named Molly and only alive due to the cocoon. Alzara vows to bring Molly south, to save and free them. They elected to start working their way home, stopping at a nearby monument. They discovered Pagan Priests and a Fire Giant, chanting around a stone monolith in the fields. After much debate the party elected to leave, especially upon seeing the arrival of golden constructs. Alzara left a parting gift of disrupting the ritual long enough for the constructs to arrive and begin killing the Pagans. On the way home Cecilia and Auxley mercilessly slaughtered an Hippocamp, despite Alzara, Illinois, and Killian's best attempts to stop them. (25/06/2022) - Ripplesun, 201EF[ ] With recent expansions to the town of [Freehearth](/wiki/Freehearth) only recently completed - most notably walls and an expansion to the docks, it already appears that more constructions are underway in the form of a fledgling town hall (with plenty of space to expand). Alzara visits [Raisuboi](/wiki/Raisuboi) to deliver his trio of Yukata robes, having embellished them beyond his original request with a filigree of daffodils across the sleeves and back, and then shortly after meets [Pickle](/wiki/Pickle) just outside the temple of Kol to provide him with his commissioned costume - a set of doublets and breeches in medley of fuschia pinks, spring greens, azure blues and deep reds, with white camellia-like frills, a large orange bowtie and a soft flat cap with a dozen brown feathers pinned into one side. Gathering up the party, Pickle uses his connection with his patron [Foltcha\u00edn](/wiki/Terra_Stone_(Foltcha%C3%ADn)) to cast Commune. - Is this individual actually Dagda? (Unclear) - Are they up to anything nefarious? (Deemed too non-specific and thus no response) - Is the man in Mulgar who claims to be Dagda doing this for personal benefit? (Unclear) - Can we find the individual that claims to be Dagda in Mulgar? (No) The party starts to suspect that the individual is likely on the move, having first been spotted in Glenmara, then Mulgar and so they suspect that they might be bound for [Achlyne](/wiki/Achlyne) next. The party pledges to travel via [Elderfall](/wiki/Elderfall) to [Banard](/wiki/Banard) and then Achlyne, with Raisuboi hoping that they will simply need to pledge back to the church that they are an individual of no ill-intent, but quickly warning the party of the dangers of an individual dabbling in potential blasphemy. The party resolves to seek out his intentions, and on the way there Alzara catches up much of the party on the dealings with the snail - the First Son of Danu - and the curse on Molly, after which conversation drifts to [Stonevale](/wiki/Stonevale) and [Yangant](/wiki/Yangant). Pickle confesses that he is still getting nightmares in significant frequencies, which Raisuboi promptly blames on his possession of the devil's finger candles. As the party nears the bridge over to [Banard](/wiki/Banard), the party hears wailing calls and cries, seemingly echoing from a shrine atop a hill to south, the circle of stones dedicated to [Nuada](/wiki/Nuada). Fearful that folk might be in distress, but cautious for further trouble and trickery. Within the circle, some 75 feet across, they find a small wizened figure, some two foot tall, lamenting that he is trapped by nature of his fey heritage. He remarks that the Aes'ahn don't like his kind (presumably fey), and so became trapped whilst picking berries. They try and dig him free by going under the ward which fails. Pickle tries to dig a mound up to free him, but this is quickly disregarded too. Alzara subtle casts Detect Thoughts, prying deep and uncovering his malintent - and will to get back to his master, and wanton destruction. She warns the party, and as they turn back the creature has created a spiral and eye out of flowers. When Raisuboi tries to burn them as the group recognises the malign symbology, the creature enlarges and transforms into a bark-covered monstrosity. The party engages mainly from range, using the ward to hold the creature back, but when [Brochlily](/wiki/Brochlily) rushes in, she is bludgeoning by its huge claws before being dragged clear by [Ered](/wiki/Ered). Raisuboi burns some of the flowers with Flaming Sphere, sending the creature into a further rage. Pickle's Eldritch Rock thunders against the monster's flank, while Auxley's shortbow, aided by his Steady Aim is inhibited somewhat by the seemed resistance to non-magical sources of damage. In response, it tries to summon a storm of lightning overhead, but is promptly Counterspelled by Alzara, stirring a sense of mounting concern from the outplayed monstrous fey. Brochlily and Ered rush back into the fray, while the flames continue to consume the foul flower symbology. Pickle's ongoing assault knocks the creature down, but in the end, it is an arrow from Auxley's shortbow that puts him down - although but for a moment. To the group's horror, the vines and flowers now weave into the flesh of the fey monster, puppeteering it into new life. It promptly turns to Alzara and conjures a sudden Whirlwind around her, which she is unable to effectively counter, but instead manages to dodge somewhat. Brochlily attempts to Turn the Faithless, Ered swings his Mace of Disruption to little avail, while Raisuboi's Flaming Sphere struggles to find purchase. Pickle's Peryton seems the only creature able to strike it, with Alzara spending her turn escaping the bludgeoning gale of the Whirlwind. Lily breaks the streak when she smites the fey creature, while Ered is now buffetted by the Whirlwind, unable to avoid it conventionally and so relying on Misty Step instead. He heals up Alzara who is only just still standing. Raisuboi's Guiding Bolt and Flaming Sphere now prove particularly effective, allowing a thunderous Chromatic Orb from Alzara to put it down. Raisuboi recognises the similarities between the sigil created and that used by the [Boca](/wiki/Boc%C3%A1nach). Noting the creature's ability to transform between a mundane form and a monstrous form, Alzara takes a sample of its blood for study, and the party bury the remains within the circle itself. The party arrives at the bridge over the Elder Stream near Banard, where they find it occupied by an autumnal eladrin called Relurian, a pixie, a sprite, a fey hound and a brigganock. They discuss the seasons, before introducing themselves as the Bards of Infinity - and regaling the party with a song. Raisuboi recognises the song from the [Treatise of the Titan Accord](/wiki/Treatise_of_the_Titan_Accord), their leader claiming that he wrote the song, but has no knowledge of the book itself. Raisuboi asks for clarification on the meaning of moos (muse: a source of inspiration for a creative artist), wall of times (the passage of the seasons and so forth), as well as asking about the wars between the Fomar (that became the Fomorians) and the Aes'ahn, supposedly caused by the latter turning up in the evil former's territory. Asking about the \"Bencawr\" finds little answers, save that it is used to describe a malevolent entity that guided the Fomorians. Relurian rebukes ideas of a union as per the book, before remarking that the \"Turned\" are Fomorians are those that joined the Aes'ahn, with [Mann\u00e1n](/wiki/Mann%C3%A1n) being the most amongst them - the Son of the Sea, and one of the ancient Fomar. Relurian finally revels in the news that the group has killed a \"White Feather\", or angel, citing long-standing disagreements with them. The Bards give them one last song, revealing once that the lands themselves were also called Aest\u00fdris, but haven't heard much of the [Dadga](/wiki/Dagda) claimant. Sharing thanks for their songs and companionship, the groups depart, offers are made for the trope to visit Freehearth, and shortly after the party find themselves approaching the village of Banard. As they do so, they spy a light emerging from the gloom, surrounding with an engulfing darkness - and so the party stumbles once more upon [Yangant](/wiki/Yangant). Yangant remarks that he has been searching everywhere for Pickle, having been seeking his aid. He wants Pickle to meet Mother Caor\u00e1nach, who has been watching him through his dreams, and wants to adopt him. As the rest of the party discusses red flags, a portal opens, from which an Arcanaloth called Amenti strolls. After confusion about who is Pickle after Brochlily also claims the name, Auxley jumps in as an improvised lawyer, with Raisuboi taking a paternal role and rebuking attempts at adoption. It turns out by accepting a candle, Pickle has signed on for three lifetimes of adoption. Auxley scours over the contract (written in Infernal!), picking out the salient points: - Caor\u00e1nach will take care of Pickle over three lifetimes - Caor\u00e1nach is not accountable for any damages done during this time, but will endeavour to aid against this - Past and/or ongoing patronages or pacts are considered null and void upon signing - The contract lasts at minimum for three lifetimes Pickle declines the gift, to which Amenti is quick to remark that it wasn't a true gift, but more of an exchange. It is remarked that Caor\u00e1nach is unchanged by whether or not it was initiated by Pickle previously under false pretences, and Amenti seems unhindered by the growing sense of refusal from the party, even when Brochlily tries to Command them to sign instead of Pickle. Pickle instead gives the candle/finger back to Yangant, who seems delighted, before refusing to sign the contract - after which Armeti promptly leaves. The party discusses what to do with Yangant while Pickle distracts him as the devil chats about brotherhood, local orphanages and taking a trip to the \"nice and warm\" Nine Hells. Pickle high-fives Yangant (after the candles are extinguished - and therefore \"safe\"), and under the promise that they are now Best Friends mentions he'll pop by (without any of friends for at least the first time, at Pickle's request) to Freehearth, before setting off into the night. In a mixture of well-meaning scolding and kindly advice, the rest of the party shares their concerns with the kobold. At Banard, they find [Se\u00f2naid Mcguinness](/wiki/Se%C3%B2naid_Mcguinness) finishing off a number of swarming termites and ankhegs, which she reports tend to grow bold with the full moon alongside with an odd amethyst mist. She has tried using badgers to dig them out to little effect, though reports that it seems to be proportional to the number of folks in the village - the more inhabitants, the greater the swarm. Pickle gets to carving up the insects for sake of snacks for later, while Ered and Raisuboi prepare dinner for the group - fish stew, tomato soup and flatbreads. The following day the party makes an uneventful journey to Achlyne, where at the tavern of Dagda's Bounty they find the proprietor getting ready for bed, but is willing to aid the new arrivals after they sign the book (alongside the names of Trefor late sleepers of the party are awoken by the sounds of reconstruction further afield, and as they leave the tavern they find a long queue of folks waiting outside a house near the centre of town. Two women, a goliath and an elf leave the room is quick succession, somewhere between joyful and titillated. After another local called Cedrik enters the house, Raisuboi gets chatting with a half-troll called Duffthug, learning that the village has prospered in the last couple of weeks with folks coming from further afield for blessings, wishes, and a remarkable talent for spurring fertility. In fact, it seems since his arrival, near every individual capable of growing pregnant is now doing so. The line continues to grow shorter - with continued remarks of exaltation with each departure from the building, with each individual subsequently jumping at the opportunity to help. After a long while waiting, the group's turn arrives - and with permission from the voice within the building - they enter into the home together. 'Dagda' calls Raisuboi and Ered by name, before asking after Brochlily, Auxley and Alzara's names. The former two give so freely, Alzara is hesitant and unimpressed and resistant by his shows of affection. With Pickle hiding in Raisuboi's robes, 'Dagda' summons a barrel of fine wine. Brochlily's Divine Sense does register as a Celestial, and so she partakes in his wine at his offer. The party starts their questioning, although Alzara finds her Detect Thoughts yields naught: - Alzara asks why 'Dagda' had come now as an Avatar, to which he responds that the suffering of the region has inspired him to take a step beyond being a force from afar, and so taking a physical form or manifestation to better aid his peoples. - Raisuboi asks about the nature of the form he is using. 'Dagda' responds his appearance and form of his avatar is more of an echo of what it once was. - Raisuboi inquiries with regard to his concerns about the sword in [Ana's](/wiki/Anastasia_Ekatarina)possession, to which he seems to get confirmation of his worries. - Raisuboi confirms that 'Dagda' has been watching them from afar, including the [attack](/wiki/Boc%C3%A1nach)on the village, but grows hesitant to share in the wine when 'Dagda' seems unable to name Pickle, seemingly having noticed him beneath his cloak. - Ered pries after the survivors of the [Boc\u00e1nach's](/wiki/Boc%C3%A1nach)attack, trying to gauge the validity of 'Dagda's' claims that he was watching, the avatar dancing around the question and answering with vaguities. After noting that Pickle seems to be trying to cast Read Object, 'Dagda' starts to demand his cup back, prompting both Alzara and Raisuboi to stall for time. Brochlily accuses Raisuboi off having lost his faith, which is quickly rebuked as an inappropriate comment by 'Dagda', for a questioning mind is one less likely to be beguiled or lead astray. After all, what if everyone blindly followed Zitus? The conversation turns to the Lawmaker, the Empire to the north, but 'Dagda' has no answers from the past, only talking of the brightness of the future. He remarks that even those with the purest intentions, whether divine or elsewise, may be led astray under false ideals. The Read Object proves inconclusive, revealing only images of 'Dagda' carving it from a tree trunk with a delight and joy, and so is handed back to the Avatar after a short back and forth. Pickle comes out of his hiding spot, declining to give 'Dagda' his name too, instead asking to simply be called Green. Pickle asks whether 'Dagda' knows about the other gods, and satisfied with his answers proclaims that he is surely the true being, a growing sentiment amongst the group. Alzara proves more difficult to sway, instead asking Dagda one more question. After confirming that in his higher form, in which he has existed for an age and more before manifesting a physical form more recently, he would have heard the prayers of a girl pleading for aid and help, to save home and hearth. He apologises that not every prayer is answered - Alzara immediately hits back that her prayer was, but by the wrong entity. Through a scowl, she lambasts his lack of action in twisted words. 'Dagda' asks what he can help with - to which Alzara simply remarks that if he truly was Dagda, he would know what she prayed for. Raisuboi seeks forgiveness and fealty for his need for inquiry, and is reluctant to accept a blessing from the Avatar, despite it being freely given in the form of a ring (from a satchel on the table, nowhere else, defo not his loincloth). Raisuboi accepts it, seeking guidance on how to proceed next - and is told simply to be himself. As Raisuboi contemplates on the encounter at the town well, hesitant nonetheless. After wondering about honorifics, Pickle asks why [Foltcha\u00edn](/wiki/Terra_Stone_(Foltcha%C3%ADn)) would be uncertain about him, to which 'Dagda' remarks that not everyone can be certain of everything all the time. With his permission, Pickle once again casts Commune: - Is this man before me Dagda? Roots and vines push through the ground, combining into a 20 foot tall tree that breaks through the roof of the house. This is taken as an affirmative response. Auxley declines 'Dagda's' offers of happiness given unto him, by has a moment of agreement with the Avatar about stretching before and after engaging in assorted physical acts that Dagda seems to delight in. Ered responds to 'Dagda' with warmth, accepting his blessing in ring form freely and musing over it matters not whether individuals believe or not, for whether the Avatar is a god or not, he is acting in the interests of a god, as a godly man. Brochlily is given a large potion by 'Dagda', but it is dropped when he is distracted by a threat, remarking instead that he needs Brochlily's skill with arms. Meanwhile, Alzara waits for the group at the southern city gates, before feeling a wicked piercing at her side, as a Redcap leaps from the roof attacking her. A number of malaligned fey attack the village, the party rushing to defend it. The villagers are instructed to evacuate south, while Auxley and Alzara hunt down a Redcap, Pickle's Peryton collecting up the Priest Dania from a Quickling's strikes, shortly after which Pickle himself cuts one down. As 'Dagda' rushes into the fray, he flattens one quickly, but further more come, springing from hiding spots in bushes, trees and shrubs. Ered, Brochlily and Raisuboi are quick to dispatch the wave of foes on the northern edge of town, while those to the south prove more of a challenge for Alzara and Auxley alone. After failing to hit the Redcap with Ray of Frost, Alzara Misty Steps away to put space between her and it, much to Auxley's annoyance, although Pickle moves to reinforce him. A pair of Meenlocks burst from the undergrowth, bearing down on Raisuboi and Brochlily, who are aided by Guiding Bolts from the priests of the village. 'Dagda' clears the path for the villagers, killing a Redcap and two Quicklings, but more malign fey soon move to reinforce them, screaming that \" [Drachmas](/wiki/Agnes_Marshcradler) is coming for them all.\" As a group of Darklings march into town from the northeast, and a trio of hags headed by a wizened woman from the northwest. The crooked woman paralyzes Ered in place with a spell, but is quickly freed by a priestess. Alzara casts Slow on all but one of the hags using the Staff of the Snail, and Raisuboi rescues Brochlily (paralysed by means of Meenlock toxin) with a combination of Channel Divinity and Oni strength. Pickle further ties up the hags with Erupting Earth, while the Slow stalls their attempts at spellcasting. 'Dagda' crushes a Quickling and a Redcap, before moving up to Drachmas with a grin. One of her hag companions attempts to attack the Avatar, bypassing his lacklustre armour of a simple loincloth, but finding her claws do naught to him. Brochlily is healed of her paralysis by a Priest, allowing Ered to instead turn his attention to a nearby Meenlock. A trio of Korreds emerge from hidden spots throughout town, but as the hags continue to struggle to cast spells at their normal pace thanks to Alzara's Slow, the party continues to fight on three main fronts - northwest, northeast and south - with Raisuboi being knocked briefly unconscious by a rock hurled by one of the Korreds. After being roused by a Priest, he incinerates a Meenlock using Flaming Sphere, after which the northeastern front is reinforced by the arrival of a Priest casting Spirit Guardians. Pickle cuts down one Darkling, the rest are sent scattering by Brochlily's Channel Divinity: Turn the Faithless, along with one of the Korreds. 'Dagda' banishes Drachmas with a smiteful strike, and then laughs off an attempt to poison him by one of the sea hags, even though it deals enough damage to floor most conventional adventurers. Auxley, despite being knocked unconscious by a Korred's club, springs back to his feet, stabbing his foe in the back when it chases after his allies. Nonetheless, the Fey is not slain by rather charmed by means of Suggestion into painting a wall to distract it. The combined efforts of Ered, Brochlily, Pickle, Raisuboi and the Priest Cennyd frighten, bludgeon and arcanely destroy all but the now wounded Korreds, one of which is then prompted to leave by Dagda's own Mass Suggestion, the other then cut down by Ered and Spirit Guardians in unison while it considers what to do. With the remaining folks thrown into flight, only the charmed Korred remains. After casting Greater Restoration on it, 'Dagda' persuades it round to helping out by its own volition, at least at a passing glance, before using Banishment to send it back to the Feywild. 'Dagda' gives them his thanks, pledging to help Pickle with clearing the tree from the home 'Dagda' had assumed as his own, and the rest of the party offers aid in their own way for a few hours until the villagers return. Raisuboi's find confirmation about 'Dagda's' legendary artifact to feed the people of the lands, while Pickle asks about Drachmas, but 'Dagda' remarks that he cannot remember much from before his physical manifestation, but with the mentioning of the name [Agnes Marshcradler](/wiki/Agnes_Marshcradler), he recalls her links to the Bowels of Tal'Dosh, as well as commenting that they should bring the person cursed and afflicted to him, after which they would hunt down Agnes together - never mind the dragon also nesting there. (28/06/22) - Alor, 201EF[ ] After a commossion at the gates about a devil outside the walls, Pickle makes his way out before being stopped by an elderly man, revealed to be Amenti, after asking Pickles name he serves him a summons to the infernal court, to discuss his breach of contract for not relinquishing his soul. After requested legal council he goes to see Auxley, they relent that there isn't much they can do at the moment and so they need to agree to the court summons. The devil gives him an obsidian rock that can be used to get to court. They are plane shifted away to an infernal reception foyer. Surrounded by imps and pitfiends. A court date is arranged for the end of the month. As they return Alzara meets them as they head to the group to return Auxleys magic fleece. Pickle looking somewhat deturb is immediatly fronted by Kreev asking if he has finished making a figurine for him. They head off from Dazomars lair and follow the mountain terrain up towards Ravenguard Heights. Pickle leads the way through a revein populated by mountain goats, Pickle notices a gold mound in the earth, as he and Ered move closer with caution they realise it is a gold trim chest. As they open the chest, their seems to be a toy owlbear inside, as Pickle picks it up it screams. Seemingly revealling a trap has been sprung as an Ettin makes its way up. Alzara frustrated with the trap tells the Ettin to go to sleep, to which it obliges. Pickle runs up a hill cropping just in time to see another Ettin come round the otherside towards Ered. After being told to go for the kneecaps by Auxley Ered swings and burst through his legs. While the other Ettin sleeps the group surround it electing that they will have to come back this way and deal with the problem now. Finding the giants camp, Ana casts Ashen memories and see a discussion between the Ettins and another large cloaked figure with hooves, hands them the owlbear and orders them to do something in Fey then Giant, seemingly delighting Faoimorach. As they camp for the night, Alzar and Ered prepare some of the killed goats for rations and Kreev talks to Ana about their mutal interests in the Wyrd and performance. Kreev asks for a tarot reading from Ana; recieving the Torturer (past), The Conjurer (present) and the Berserker (the future). They then go on to talk about the Wyrdcolleges' tradition of passing on Prophecies, electing to share; Kreev recites; Jewels of the land, jewels of the sea, Hidden in mounds and under the tree, Lost but there, feet upon stone, Rightful and willing, a King on the throne. Ana recites; A Kingdom split, a nation broken, United by the gift from Sea Son's ocean, Stand upon stone, name thy Lord, A joyous laugh, a crown and sword As Pickle Communes with Nature and learns of the following warnings; a danger from above and below. Fiends watch and fiends hide. The earth here is soiled/plagued. With the mentions of fiends hiding Pickle asks the camp around him are we being watch and surprisgingly gets a No in response. A hidden imp reveals himself claiming to be Pickles new familiar once Pickle becomes Caor\u00e1nachs pet. And in the most brutal of guilt trips tells Pickle of all the things he will help with him and how he has chosen a new name, Devils Lettuce, to be closer to Pickle. The group protests the imps arrival in camp and his fratinization trying to stay for tea. Eventually the group convince Pickle to send him away much to his wails and crocodile tears. On watches, Alzara speaks candidly and earnestly to the snail staff pondering and what Molly, the spirit within may experience, may hope or yearn for; \"Were we to swap places, for a few minutes, a few hours, a day or two, do you think you would do as I do? Stretch a face unfamiliar into a smile, play at things that once forged happy memories?\" Expressing a kinship in feelings and perhaps a parallel to her own? She goes on to say their may be a solution to her predicament but she is reluctant to follow it as past experiences halt her commitment to the cause of action. \"There might be a way to get rid of this, Molly, if you want. But to do so would be relying on a path that has failed in the past, perhaps not for you, but nonetheless. I want to offer certainty, an answer clear and definitive, to say with confidence that this option is as they claim to be, but, I can't. I can't. I've placed myself in their hands before. They might not even be the same hands. Huh, I'm not sure it even matters really. I don't know what you were really like, before well, this. Would you have run into his arms, grasping at the promises of happiness, of cheer and comfort? Would that be forthright, or just a desire to feel something, anything but sadness?\" On Pickles watch, Devils lettuce appears and is immedietly killed with a crossbow bolt that was making its way towrds Pickle, pleeding that he tried to help. As the group is suddenly attacked in the night by drow. Pickle shouts to wake up the group. Awaken from their rest the party scramble to cover. Auxley, particularly angry in loosing beauty sleep stabs one, as Ana frenzied bolts two drow melting one with acid and freezing the other. Despite the element of surprise the party manage to pull back and turn the tide. Ered chases down the leader and smites him down to the ground. As the drow raiding party are cut down they try and run. As the final drow pleads for his life Ered apologises and he and Pickle hesitates for a moment. As they both hesitate, Kreev whispers that You attacked us so deal with the consequences as the words kill the final attacker. With the danger passed the party collect and bury the drow before running back to sleep. The next day they spend most of the day travelling to Ballyargus and upon arriving in the town it is overrun with mushroom and fungi seemingly abandonded for a few years. Pickle immedietly pokes the mushrooms and it releases spores to no immediate effect. Kreev sees a man in one of the huts and when approaching it blares a beam of spores at them. Alzara detects thoughts on the other mushrooms and discovers a joint sentience in them. As Fungal spores awaken to defend its hivemind. Kreev annoyed with the constant barrage of wierd creatures trying to kill them animates a wooden chicken figure named Buck to help attack. Killing the spores seems to release a burst of poision, to vary degrees of effectiveness on the party, Ered and Ana not as perturb and move forward to finish the fungal group. In a seeming silence, Pickle flies up on the Peryton to scout ahead. Ana and Ered find a message written in giant scrawled on the walls \"The eye shall open\". Auxley checks a hut and finds a similar omen, Later to say \"Only the Depths blind us\". Eventually they find in the other huts multiple messages; \"Damned be the seas, the depths and the dark\". Alzara and Pickle investigate another hut and alert more spores; with Alzara seperated from the group Pickle sends Antlers, his Peryton to move her away from danger. As the party make their way clearing the town they notice the veins and body of all the mushrooms throb as any other Fungal spores in the village are alerted to the seeming invasion of the group clearing them out. As Ana charges forwards; she goes to swing her sword but stops abruptly. Turning on the spot as an eye opens up on her forehead as a beam of fire shoots towards the Peryton and Alzara flying upon it rather than any fungal attackers. Ered runs up to Ana as she screams and drops to her knees. But still being surrounded by spore creatures the discussion has to wait as the party fight back the remaining, fast approaching attackers. With the immedite danger dealt with the party turn to the shaken Ana, whom immedietly runs passed everyone to look for a magical makeup item she spotted previously, quickly painting on more stoic conserved expression. They discuss why she would do such a thing and she reveals that she does not trust fey or celestial creature and felt compelled to act. Alzara detects thoughts and hears a different voice coming from Ana, laughing maniacally and revelling in the moment. They determine Anas sword holds some blame and that at some point in the near future they will need to deal with it. After collecting anything useful left in the town they approach the village well and realise it to be a potential entarance to the underdark or at the very least, the origin of the fungl spores. And they elect to go down. Part Two (30/06/2022)[ ] BRINGING THE FUN TO FUNGI (a.k.a. introduced partway through the session...) - Maeve Before descending, the party discuss preparations for what might await them below - and so elect to take a short rest. As the party recovers, Ana uses Ashen Memories on a fireplace in the tavern, witnessing a innkeep or staff member tending to a chicken on a spit, the sky warm and pleasant, and not a mushroom in sight. Discussion turns to whether they try and squeeze Antlers down the tunnel with them, but ultimately elect to leave them as a look-out on the surface, which likewise reduces the likelihood of further issues pertaining to Ana's 'affliction'. At the base of the well, they find themselves surrounded by the funk and damp of a bioluminescent cavescape, uncertainly looming in the shadows between. Echoing calls and cries, the rushing of winds through tunnels large and small and the continuous deposition and ejection of spores fill the empty silence - until Ered speaks, garnering a verbal response, proclamations of pride towards the adventurers' bravery, even if the darkness would become their grave. They claim their eye is opened, and that not even the shade would hide them - their possessions, their bodies, all will soon be arms for them, to be wielded as brings delight. In response to the sudden burgeoning glow as the party tries to light up the cavern, creatures somewhere between humanoid and bestial, though seemingly more dead than living rush forwards, clicking from beneath wide fungal blooms that make up most of their head. As a Hook Horror looms from the dark, the cavern breaks into combat. The source of the voice makes itself known, a towering fomorian who drags with them a tiefling prisoner - Maeve - taunting the party as it casts Cloudkill. The party starts to scramble out of the way of the noxious fumes, finding that they are being closed in on by the horde waiting beneath. While the Cloudkill seems static, within the gloom as more animated form of the same spell seems to hunt them. With Pickle and Ered as their front line - the former revelling in his new showmanship blade and the latter destroying undead with frightening destructiveness using his Mace of Disruption, Alzara uses Slow to bog down a large number of the foes, while Kreev terrifies many more still using his Pipes of Haunting. The fomorian steps out from cover again, casting Confusion on Pickle, all the while Maeve continues to struggle against her bindings as the Living Cloudkill descends upon them. Ana empowers Ered with the Tale of the Avenger, punishing any creature that strikes him. Pickle breaks free of his Confusion, dodging strikes to cast Incite Greed but finds it is ineffectual on the eyeless creatures. Ered's mace continues to be particularly effective against the fungal undead, while Kreev continues to dodge the magical strikes of the Living Cloudkill, having garnered its anger with a flatulence jape. Pickle rushes to the aid of Alzara and Auxley, who has been afflicted with a short-lived bout of Confusion, broken shortly before the fomorian then uses Confusion on both Ana and Kreev. The Living Cloudkill mimics its namesake, knocking Pickle unconscious, to which Alzara rushes to rescue him. Kreev tries to heal Pickle, but cannot see him through the fog. He and Ana are then engulfed in another mimicry as Auxley triumphantly cuts down the last fungal undead but is engulfed in spores that knock him unconscious. Kreev struggles against his Confusion, Ana finally comes face to face with the fomorian, only to be harried by its psychic-trauma inducing third eye. Pickle, stuck in a cycle of falling unconscious and spring back to his feet, using his Archaic Avatar to try and block the Magical Strike from the Living Spell, but it narrowly fails, and so he is dragged free by Alzara again, who promptly misses with an upcast Chromatic Orb. Maeve, now free, heals Pickle by siphoning some of Alzara's lifeforce - with her permission - by using Wither and Bloom. The Living Cloudkill fells both Auxley and Ered as Ana turns, corrupted akin to that of her blade once more as she moves to cut down Maeve, but after the Cloud is dispatched by a flurry of Eldritch Rocks from Pickle and a Ray of Frost from Alzara, Kreev uses Mass Healing Word to restore the party in health and for some, consciousness. In response to Ana's assault, Maeve casts Tasha's Caustic Brew on her and the fomorian, lamenting all the while at the Halo of Spores around the latter and its insistence on using her staff as a club. Ana seems to come to her senses, throwing Faoim\u00f3rach to the ground and instead pulling out her rapier. Kreev evokes the name of Kasialama to send the fomorian sprawling in a state of Hideous Laughter, giving the group a chance to deliver a number of coordinated strikes before it can stand again. The fomorian psychically assaults Ered, who is promptly healed again by Maeve, but as he opens his third eye to do so, a well-placed arrow pierces it through, finally killing Goll the Fomorian Spore Druid. As an uneasy stillness rests in the spore-laden cavern Maeve makes her introductions, using the title of \"Lady Wizard of the Feydark\". She claims that she was abducted by the fomorian for her belongings and perhaps intending for her to be a snack, and eventually agrees to join them in Freehearth, at least long enough to read through the books in the town library. Pickle offers up his 'spare' house for her to stay in, and after Ana confirms that she has relinquished claim over her cursed blade, they return to the surface. After a short while comparing conjured companions and their compositions as combinations of conventional creatures - Maeve's Enfield and Pickle's Peryton - they remark that Ana has already departed without them. On the way back, about three hours after departing, Kreev starts to succumb to a illness brought on by the spores, but is promptly healed with a measure of Keoghtom's Ointment they found in Goll's possession to heal him, but are horrified to find Pickle seems to be exhibiting the same affliction shortly after - and they have nothing to aid him with. As Pickle starts to wain, Kreev compels Auxley to contact Amenti, who arrives shortly after with [contract](/wiki/Caor%C3%A1nach_Contract) in hand. The party stands divided on the matter, with Pickle eventually finding the strength to cast Commune through his Terra Stone - I promised I would protect you, but I can't do that if I am dead. Will you let me relinquish this pact for that purpose? No immediate answer comes, but in the silence Pickle feels the presence guiding him to make his own decision. Alzara tries to interject, but it is too late - Pickle marks the paper, and after a little aggression from Kreev directed towards Amenti, a threat that if the pact changes Pickle he will hunt the arcanaloth through the Hells, the fiend leaves, remarking that the court date will no longer be necessary. Broken, dejected, the party moves on - sans Antlers - stumbling across the body of Ana about an hour further down the road, spores spilling from her mouth. Upon Ered's Find Steed, the paladin and Ana's remains race back to Freehearth with haste, seeking to use the diamond recently acquired from Dazomar's mine to raise her from the dead. \"Please Dagda help me, get this soul back to where it belongs. It may have wandered down the wrong paths, but I truly believe she deserves a second chance.\" Time passes, with growing resignation on the faces of priests in the Chapel of Dagda, they remark that Ana was not truly alive to begin with - and yet, a deep breath is drawn as she chokes back into life. Ana's first words are to ask after the rest of the group, of whom Ered remarks that there have been some complications, but persisting nonetheless. When they arrive a day or so later, a reunion of mixed emotions is made with her, while Auxley promises Pickle that he will continue to work hard, given that he feels he pushed Pickle into signing. Alor, 201EF-(06/07/2022)[ ] The party head out from Dazomar's lair and move along the coastal paths, they pass close to the noted town of piracy after a few hours of travel they come to a circular set of stone pillars with a large hole at the centre, the party cautiously approach and Auxley spots a deer/goat creature walk by and it appeared to be radiating something Maeve identifies these creatures as Bulezau the party decide to rid the land of these malevolent denizens, Ana casts Mage hand and has it throw a rock to attract the attention of a singular Bulezau, they all rush over to investigate the noise. Auxley fires his Wyrwood arrow at the Bulezau alerting them all two of the hellish goats attack Ered and miss, Raisuboi moves behind one of the attackers and misses with his mace, a mystery figure drops from the trees and rushes to the prone Bulezau hacking into it three times, one of the Bulezau rushes to the new ally and swings and misses, Ana fires a Frenzied Bolt hitting the Bulezau, Ered swings his Mace of Disruption critically striking the goat demon between him and Raisuboi it dies, Ered then takes a second swing hitting the second Bulezau, The bound Bulezau snaps free of it's bindings and moves to flank the mystery ally, Maeve misses her attack.

Ered ends the combat by crushing the Bulezau with radiant light. The new ally introduces themselves as Esdra the party investigate the circle of stones and the hole at their centre Ana, Ered and Maeve enter the hole and find a door with carvings that depict scenes seen within The Treatise of the Titan Accord, Maeve makes it known that she is not well read, the party see that a key is required to enter the door. Esdra reveals that they have the key, Maeve is very stubborn and goes into the tomb and is faced with a Formorian and many Bocha she returns hastily, the party get to know Esdra a bit better. The party head on and camp out in the open for the night during the night Ana is approached by a Copper Kobold who asks if he can keep Raisuboi's knife, Ana thinks for a moment and asks him to return the knife in exchange for food the Kobold accepts. Ana chats with her new friend and learns that they are from the South and have a big brother who they are searching for in the North their brother is Kitaris The Juvenile, The next day the Kobold makes himself known to the rest of the party as daybreaks and says his name is Tin he acts very peculiarly, he accepts gifts from the party and eats breakfast with them. Heading off upstream the party come to the lake and camp for the night, Maeve spots a Large ship near a cave at the north of the lake, during the night gemstones start raining from the sky cutting up the Party's tents and bodies. As Esdra scrambles to get to cover a large black dog emerges from under a nearby tree and attacks them, Ered kills the beast and everyone makes their way under the now empty tree Ana spots more big black dogs Maeve fires at the closest one and it runs in firing it's flame breath at the party Esdra Auxley and Ered gang up and kill the intruding beast, the last remaining beast sees it is outmatched and runs away, the party wait for the gem rain to stop and then begin collecting gemstones. The next day the party head north towards the skull cave, there they meet Captain Chipper Toes a sun addled pirate who was laying claim to the cave despite being too underpowered to enter, Auxley adopts a pirate accent and Chipper Toes locks on to him and starts questioning Auxley about his past, Maeve stitches Auxley up by saying he was part of Captain Shark-Tooth's crew, Chipper Toes takes Auxley to one side and strikes a bargain with him out of earshot. The party enter the cave and hear a speech from a mystery voice. To kill, or not to kill. That is the question. To giveth in to mine own primal urges and englut the v'ry flesh yond walks within mine own lair. The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without merit, and lost without deserving All that glisters is not gold. and see bodies covered in crystalline forms, Maeve deduces that the growing crystals is a mix of Diamond and quartz known as Raindrop Crystals. Ana inspects one of the bodies covered in crystals and finds a sigil on their clothes, another segment of the mystery voice is heard again. With each grise thee trespass into landeth yond is not yours. Yet i senseth nay guilt f'r thy actions. Doth these people has't any senseth of law and 'rd'r? I am the most wondrous bahrnabals'r whom yond rules this cave. Boweth bef're his palmy lair. A pleasure to meeteth thee all. If 't be true thee cometh f'r treasure, thee shalt taketh none. If 't be true thee cometh f'r blood, thee shalt taketh all. most of the bodies in the crystal casings are dressed as Pirates, as the Party go up a set of stairs they approach a Minotaur encased in Crystal the mystery voice wraps up it's speech and the Minotaur breaks free.

Tyor, 201EF - (7/10/2022)[ ] Killian, having been feebleminded by a certain evil magic book, is brought to Arania's grove for healing. Alzara takes his coinpurse and uses it to purchase a diamond, which is grinded into dust and used to heal him. With Killian newly conscious, the three approach Azar's home where Killian recounts the events leading up to his feebleminding. Killian hypothesizes that Azar has been taken beyond the crack in the wall, and Alzara uses dispel magic to seal it. This unnerves Killian, and the two have a conversation about consequences. The party gather and set off upon steeds to the town of Banard, stopping at a bridge along the way. A herd of rabbits blocks the party's path whenever they try to cross the bridge, although the party sees an Almiraj amongst their number. Killian and Arania decide to take the creature to Ludithas for preservation. Whilst the rest of the party tries to find a way around the rabbits, Forfin accidentally awakens a troll sleeping beneath the bridge. The party defeat this monster, and continue on, and Killian and Arania eventually catch up. The party then arrives in Banard, meeting Se\u00f2naid Mcguinness, who explains that the bugs come at night, and always leave a strange sigil that Killian deduces contains divination magic. The party decides to break out into pairs to take watch. Dazomar and Maeve, Forfin and the bear spirit Alzara and Arania. Upon Alzara and Arania's watch, the ground begins to shake, and a horde of bugs emerge, led by an Umber Hulk and two Ankheg. The group does battle, having particular trouble with a swarm of death butterflies. Emyr is slain in single combat with the Umber Hulk, and Arania and Seonaid are temporarily downed. Dazomar plays dead to avoid being devoured by an insect swarm. Eventually, however the creatures are slain. The party finds a fresh divination eye sigil, and they wipe it away. After a night's rest, the party sets out, using Forfin scouting the tunnel below and sending directions to Killian above. The party follows the tunnel to a small village, with bones scattered about and haphazard trails of blood everywhere. Killian determines that the blood is most likely Giant in origin, with help from Raisuboi. They follow the trail to the outhouse, where Forfin notices a large cerberus inside. The creature busts out and traps Killian in molten slag, which he only escapes due to a well-timed misty step. Maeve unleashes a spray of thorns, and the creature tears itself to death trying to travel over and attack the party. The group sends Forfin down to investigate, but he is hit by a spell and banished. The party decides to check out the mill before proceeding downwards. Dazomar wanders into the mill, alerting several Duende to his presence. The rest of the party trickles in, noticing a large industrial bone grinding apparatus. They continue down to the factory floor, where Dazomar tries very hard to recruit the Duende, and the other members of the party struggle to find them. They learn that the \"bosses' are in the other tunnel, and that they are the ones who fetch the bones for the duende to grind. The party proceed into the other tunnel, finding hags in the process of cursing some poor soul who is asking for a prayer. A firefight ensues, with several counterspells being exchanged and Alzara breaking the witch's cauldron. One of the Witches casts an illusion of a woman at Alzara, which enrages her to the point of casting a Dissidence spell, although nobody in the party recognizes it as such, Killian being asleep at the time. The battle is hard-fought, and the hags go to flee, although not before trying to get one last parting shot. Raisuboi casts Darkness to shield himself and Alzara, leaving only Killian available for the hag's attack: a Finger of Death. He is unable to resist, being slain and risen as a zombie, although his hand, cut off for use as a Crawling Claw, remains humanoid. The party slays the zombified Killian, and Alzara attempts a Gentle Repose, although it fails. Deeply upset, the half-troll takes Killian's spellbook and implores the party return him to Freehearth, where he can be properly buried. Kaarina, 201 EF - (15/7/22)[ ] It was a cool Autumn day the party departed from Elderfall. Alzara and Maeve cast Phantom Steed, taking a page from Killian's book. With their steeds set, they marched southwest. Not far into their journey, they were flagged down by a Halfling. \u00c8amon Finn Mac Ch\u00f9da, the Halfling identifies himself, explaining his thesis that bridges were the number one danger on the continent. Much of the party concurred, recalling their own concerns with crossing bridges. The Halfling joined Pickle, Maeve, Alzara in the cart, as the Halfling continued explaining his plans. Guarding the bridge was a familiar face, a Water Genasi by the name Vanora. Pickle, Raisuboi and the man began to argue. Vanora eased their hostility some, stating he wanted to talk. In exchange for never returning to the farm, Vanora requested they rid the area to the west of the bridge of vagrants. The party balked at the idea, believing that Vanora's offer was far too vague to honor. After some further discussion, the party elected to simply move passed him, with Cecilia giving a poor attempt to kick him off the bridge. As they continued west, Raisuboi recalled that hags lived in the area, filling in Pickle and Illinois on how Killian perished. At Ch\u00f9da's insistence, they rode towards another bridge near the Elder Hills. This one, however, was much more narrow and impassable on their steeds. Ch\u00f9da offered to stay with the cart, peaking the suspicion of the group as they had only gone this way at his instruction. The group stops to inspect the bridge before crossing. Pickle declares it safe, whilst Alzara becomes distracted by circling winged beasts above. Alzara's distraction is picked up by the rest of the party, and Pickle launches an unprompted attack on the creatures. The beasts dove down towards the group. To their shock, riders were upon the creatures. After some rattled spears, Pickle corrected his mistake and got the riders to consider talking. Illinois deduced they were the vagrants Vanora had informed them of. The leader identified himself as Gordon, of the Order of the Volant. Raisuboi engaged the man verbally, trying to discern their intention. Gordon claimed to \"serve man\" and his order was also going to be facing down the creature the party was heading to take out. Raisuboi alerted Gordon that Vanora had put a hit out on him. Further talks revealed that Gordon's leader G\u00e1lasia was \"in talks\" with the three-headed beast to move on from. Alzara stepped up beside Illinois and Raisuboi, trying to use her magic to get them passed. She failed. After some further debate, and a failed attempt at diplomacy by Illinois, Gordon agreed to send a man up the mountain to ask his boss for permission to let them pass. As they waited, Alzara began to theorize with Pickle about the factions around the continent. She decided to press Gordon for more information on the matter. The rider did disclose the Hydra spoke Auran. Patrick, the man Gordon sent, returned and informed the party they were not allowed to pass. Feigning compliance, they retreated to find another way around. They circled to another way up, some six miles away. As they continued on, discussing Ch\u00f9da's theories about the dangers of bridges, Pickle began to say \"hi\" repeatedly. The rest of the party, spotted a moss-covered rock creature, repeating its greeting over and over again. Alzara, Pickle, and Maeve engaged the beast, the wizard girl discerning the beast \"Hi\" wanted to protect them. The beast Hi responded with \"Hide\". It was too late, as the party realized they were surrounded. Hi tackled Pickle, covering the Kobold. The enemies proved to be a challenge, inspire of Alzara's fireball wiping many out. Both Illinois, Cecilia, and Pickle went down during combat. With the battle cleared, Raisuboi and Pickle interrogated \"Hi\" as the creature showed signs of intelligence, but did not get anywhere. Alzara and Illinois suggested taking a rest to recover, but further away from the battle ground. Continuing on, the group parted with Ch\u00f9da as they found a section of the mountain where the horses could not go. They soon discovered a field of corpses, cattle, and goats, vultures feasting on the buffet of decay. Gordon, along with several other creatures were amongst the field as well, along with three female Air Genasi, and an Aaracokra. One Genasi intercepted the party, the girl informed the party that they could negotiate with the Aaracokra of their own accord, and they disappeared, along with Gordon and his people. Maeve engaged the creature first, ruffling the feathers of Ell\u00e9n Trechend. The Draoi Wizard cuts to the point, inquiring about Trechend's roll in the field of corpses. The words were cutting between both parties as they sized one another up. Pickle cut in, seeking to battle Trechend for his \"territory\". The Vulture-Man also disclosed that the dead humans had demanded He worship their God, Aeravisa. Trechend then demanded Maeve bow, which she did only lightly. Raisuboi then created food and water to appease the Vulture God. Pickle moved to examine the corpses, determining most were commoners. Trechend demanded more, but Maeve balked, questioning his status as a Deity. Discussing the past of Trechend, Raisuboi determined he and the Vulture were from the same place. Trechend then demanded Raisuboi worship him, and Raisuboi rebuffed him. Trechend then revealed the Three-Headed Vulture was an \"equal\" to him. Pickle challenges Trechend to single combat. The battle is brutal, but short, with Pickle the ultimate winner after taking several brutal hits. He spared Trechend, at Maeve's request. However, the beast did not take this defeat lightly. Trechend grew in size. Maeve made short work of the foot soldiers as massive vultures flew in from the east. Trechend let out a screech, stunning Illinois and Cecilia. Pickle moved the two to safety before Trechend attempted his screech again. This time Maeve and Raisuboi fell to his terrifying shriek. Cecilia was also knocked down by a gargantuan vulture creature. Illinois followed her suit shortly after. Alzara raised Illinois, killing the gargantuan vulture to keep him alive. Trechend sensed Alzara's power, brutalizing the Wizard. Pickle sensed his friend's situation and raised to Alzara's side. Raisuboi healed the party, bringing Cecilia back to life. Maeve called down a lightning storm, ending Trechend's life in a radiant explosion of light, only to transform into a three headed vulture. He lets out another screech, stunning Illinois, Cecilia, and Maeve. Trechend got his revenge, knocking Pickle down. Raisuboi healed the whole party again. Cecilia rallied Pickle, who unleashed a holy attack upon the false God. Raisuboi, the familiars, Maeve, and Alzara continued the brutal onslaught. Trechend continued his battle against the Kobold warrior, dropping him. Cecilia roused him again. With the boost of Cecilia and Alzara, Pickle killed the God. Kolopa, 201 EF - (19/7/22)[ ] The Party travelled south to Stonevale, spurred on by Killian. They met with the town's leader, Alexios. Ana explained the situation to the man, hoping to parley in exchange for a look around. At Killian's own spurring, Alexios guides the group to the town's edge, where the ruins of the old world remained. He brings them to a deliptated shack, labelled as a medicine shop owned by one of the people Killian named. The building was quite ruptured, the ceiling caved in. The party all the same ventured inside, with Ana using her Unseen Servant to move rubble whilst Killian searched for signs of magic. The Dragonborn finds abjuration magic from the bed frame in the basement. Raisuboi moved the bed, finding the source of the magic to be a rug on the floor. Killian inspected further, finding a potentially false bottom. Tossing the rug back, Killian found the true source of magic - a trap door in the floor. Illinois and Killian sent their familiars through to the other side to inspect what was up ahead. They found an underground chamber with a door. Killian, through Forfin's eyes, determined that the magic was explosive in nature. Pickle dispelled the magical trap and the group entered inside. The door that Killian and Illinois had detected earlier via their Familiars were once again enchanted with magic, though not another explosion Killian determined. Illinois once again sent Raven to scout ahead, determining that the door was not trapped in the same manner. Auxley offers to pick the lock, though he is unsure that he can. Boosted by Ana, Auxley manages to open the door. Forfin and Raven appear in the next room, only for the Cat Familiar to be attacked by a sentient rug. Pickle rushed in to the room to save the cat, inadvertently killing the Familiar. Killian finished the rug of with a blast of flames. With that defeated, the party inspected the skeleton laying upon the bed in the bedroom. Her necklace was determined to be magical. The door revealed a bathroom. The last door lead to an alchemist's workshop, with five barrels of potions, countless scrolls, and empty vials. Illinois and Auxley stayed behind to bottle the potions whilst the other four continued on with their search. Killian and the others found an apothecary, attempting to communicate with the plants inside. The conversation proved difficult, as the plants failed to understand many concepts Killian spoke of, such as death and rugs. The party continued on, finding a library, with some documents of interest to them. At the end of this room sat a room labelled \"do not open\". Illinois once again scouted ahead with Raven. On the other-side of the door, Illinois found arcane coils of power. Raven flew around the the room, accidentally arcing into the power lines and disappearing. Illinois warned the others that the room may be trapped, and he, Ana, and Killian opened the door with caution. Ana, Killian, and Illinois were hit with a bolt of arcane lightning, with the witch boy taking the worst hit of the three. Behind the arcane coils lay what appeared to a cage. Killian and Illinois began to ritual cast Find Familiar, recalling their creatures whilst the others rested. Illinois sent Raven through first, discovering a massive demonic beast in the cage which killed his familiar instantly. Killian, meanwhile, began to explore the next area. After deducing there was a long trail of rooms, Forfin was destroyed as well. Using a key they found on the skeleton, they followed this trail of rooms. After some debate, they decided to attempt to kill the beast. Raisuboi and Pickle went back up to warn Alexios and the village, then the party prepared for the fight. The demon creature was revealed, not sparked by the electricity as they had hoped. The beast dispelled the lightning, racing towards the attackers. The group attacked quickly, however, dispelling the beast with little effort. Illinois, Pickle, and Raisuboi continued on to the back room Killian had discovered earlier. Following a long corridor, they found a second cage. Illinois discovered a control panel, pressing one of the buttons on the panel, much to the dismay of the others. They soon discovered a second passageway, resulting in Illinois being knocked unconscious by another arcane jolt. With some delay, Raisuboi stabilized the corpse boy. They spent some time experimenting with the buttons, before ultimately coming to one that seemed to control the cage in the room. The cage broke open, revealing a monstrosity, with pig like features. It was a sleep, possibly thanks to their messing with the controls. They closed the cage, leaving it to rest. Illinois, Pickle, and Raisuboi ventured once again down the tunnel. Ana pressed the last button, accidentally separating Pickle and Raisuboi from Illinois, but allowing the corpse boy into a final chamber of lead. Inside, Illinois found a corpse in a chambered off living quarters. He was able to open all the doors for the others to follow. Inside they inspected the corpse and played more with the buttons, only for the facility to begin to lose power. They all ran from the chamber, save Ana, who found herself speaking now with the risen corpse of Ekver. As they moved to speak with the corpse, however, the demon rose and escaped. In a desperate move to keep their mistake contained, Auxley St. Crow released Ekver from his prison. The others flee to the surface, save for Ana, who takes Ekver's journal. On the surface, Ekver banishes the demon without much effort. The party began to interrogate Ekver, who revealed his past in part. His focus drew to Pickle, asking how \"she\" was treating him. Although first feigning ignorance, Pickle soon began to answer his questions. Ekver revealed to Pickle he knew \"her\" and was friends with them. Raisuboi offered Ekver some food, and eventually offered to let him stay in their town. Ekver turned him down bluntly. This conversation broke down into an argument between Raisuboi and Killian whilst Ana read her cards. They tried to convince Ekver to avoid his path of vengeance and destruction. Pickle was distraught by this, as the party felt helpless to stop him. Auxley recalled reading Ekver's name in The Infernal Contract shortly after he left. The party alerted Alexios the town was safe and departed, feeling somewhat defeat. Val, 201EF - (24/07/2022)[ ] The party of three meet with the spellbreakers and are introduced to their entourage, Aleida teleports the party to Tosima lake and shows them the way to an entrance they have discovered, a sewer that leads straight to the Palace, Albreich instructs Clayton to take point, the party are quickly beset by giant Crocodiles as Clayton is grabbed, the party fend off the Crocodiles and a Gelatinous Cube they move a little further on and see a Drenagg crunching on bones it engages the party and stuns Clayton and Ana, Albreich kills it the party collect themselves and continue through the sewers.

As the party go to find the vault a sound is heard coming from a northern door so Albreich barricaded it with a table as they fought two guards in front of a metal door running through narrow corridors they heard the entity bust through the makeshift barricade, the entity starts chasing them down. They enter the vault and Killian immediately steps on an explosive rune and falls unconcious the rest enter and grab items to fight the threat, Albreich turns and comes face to chest with a Planetar his gleaming sword in hand with the words \"Douma: Divine Advisor of The God Emperor\". Albreich stood his ground and was felled by one mighty swipe from the angelic foe, Douma strides forwards and swings at Clayton meeting his shield, the Eskaryan paladins held their own for a time even giving Tasia a chance to revive Killian and try to escape, Killian fed Clayton a Health potion and slipped away using misty step, Tasia fell to a surprise ambush of incoming Paladin hordes, Killian used Forfin to Misty Step out of the choke hold the last of the Eskaryan Warriors falls and Douma chases down Killian.

The group are later revived and interrogated but they all remain tight lipped, except Killian who buckles the second someone smiles at him. Aldwar, 201EF - (14/08/2022)[ ] Rumours have made their way north, of a suspected attack on the Sanctuary within the Empire of eskarya, a destructive wave set off in the hospital. And with such there has been a hightened presence of military in Badagbett and south of the Elderfall kingdom. As they get to Ojiros farm; the farm is feeling the effects of a cold winter, the rice fields frozen over. Illinios feeds Hoji. As Pickle calls out for Ojiro there is no response; Raisuboi makes his way around to the shrine there is a tall figure standing there. Ojiro sits among his alter, turned into a troll. Believing he has angered his god and suffering a curse, thinking his prayers are nolonger answered. Reassured that it was not his own doing by Raisuboi, Pickle and Arania said they could take him back to Freehearth to potentially remove the curse. Ojiro exclaims that he believes it is a response into his own actions, having defended himself against people that took to attack him. He claims they came from the East and likely pirates as he could only recognise them as not natives to Tosima. As they make tea in his house, they see multiple sigils drawn around the house. When pressed Ojiro says that he had a vision of the sigil the night of his transformation. He passes the scroll to Alzara from Vanora trying to convince him to abandon his faith and take advntage of him. The group take watches incase the pirates return. As Illinois takes watch; A cow falls through the ice as Vanora appears in its place. Having heard from the party, and believing he is bad news, Illinois manages to get him to leave. The next morning before they head back to Freehearth, Kreev goes for a walk and finds a black candle amongst his alter, not placed by Ojiro. Telling the group, Pickle reads the object and recieves a vision of 3 voices in the darkness chanting around a cauldron, which are recognised by the party as the Mallacht Coven; confirming Raisubois theory that various prayers are being intercepted by the coven. As Pickle melts, and angrily steps on the candle; Alzara detects magic and sees it had a divination aura seemingly to keep tabs on their victim. They take Ojiro back to Freehearth and after they collect the components to remove curse Arania casts the spell. Ojiro slowly returns back to his Oni self as her divine magic fits against the curse. Seeing the success Alzara asks Arania if she is able to cast the same spell on Molly Mollusks shell. As the exoskeleton starts to fall away they find Molly Mollusk, still unconsious. Discussing they may need to try again the snail on the top of Alzaras/Molly's staff tries to move towards her. And as it reaches her, her eyes open as she wakes up. Alzara and Molly take a moment, to reintroduce themselves, despite having talked for a while. Molly thanks her for the company, bringing her back and hopes to give her the snail staff as a thank-you. Shes plans to stay in Freehearth, at the tavern; for a time before possibly moving on to Elderfall. As does Ojiro. With there two cursed friends now freed, the party decide to travel to one of the shipwrecks up north. As they make their way to the coast Alazara casts water walk and the party walk out into the sea, much to Raisubois unease. Illinois manages to sees the ship wreck far below with his Devils sight. Arania casts waterbreathing as the effects of water walk dissapear and the party sink into the dark watery depths. Seeing the shipwreck, Illinois scouts ahead to try and distract sharks attracted to it, as they move towards him he tries to put them in darkness but the seem accustom to the condition, attacking him. Pickle and Kreev move forward as a large great white circles around to attack Alzara. Alzara polymorphs it into a snail. Arania creates a water elemental as more and more reef sharks appear attracted to the battle and blood being spilt. There is a thunderous cry as wave of pressure pushes everyone back. Rasuboi cast spirit gaudians and manages to consistently harm some sharks. Arania manages to thunderwave and toast some more. Kreev manages to frighten a few and seem adamant on following pickle around, trying to pull himaway from any and all danger. Pickle manages to Fear a few more as they try and keep them away from Illinois, surrounded on the frontline. After another roar a giant undead looking hammerhead comes out the shipwreck and takes down Illinois, but he is slowly healed and brought back by Raisuboi and the other party members healing spells. As the hammerhead harried by the party and an animated plank of wood, Illinois manages to take it down. With only a polymophed Shark snail left to deal with, the party surround and finish it off. Pickle asks Kreev to stop pulling him away from helping, to which Kreev fains ignorance and the group investigate what treasures are within the shipwreck before returning to the surface and home. Zetos, party sets out to meet up with Barnabalzar at his lair, but along the way they hear a group of people who seem to be digging or mining ahead. Vanya and Esdra attempt to approach stealthily, but this is somewhat hampered when Brochlily withdraws her bagpipes and starts enthusiastically playing a song. The party continues on to find a very suspicious group who frantically cover their work and begin to dodge questions. The party notices a young woman tied and bound, and questions the diggers. They waffle on stories, first claiming she is a thief, then she is insane, and eventually that she is a dangerous undead, complete with a demonstration that she does not bleed. This does not convince the party, and they demand the right to speak with her. They acquiesce, but when Vanya and Esdra attempt to walk into their camp, a man blocks their path. Esdra shoves him aside, and a fight breaks out. The heroes easily defeat the bandits, with them all fleeing. Esdra gives chase, however, and is struck down by a fleeing bandit. The party rushes over to check on her, whereas Vanya instead pauses to determine if the captive young woman is an affront to the Morrigan and ought to be executed. She is not, and is eventually freed, revealing herself to be a mute and the hidden work to be an ornate coffin. They attempt to question her, but she ends up stabbing herself in an effort to open the coffin. It works, revealing a young woman tucked inside, who announces herself as Vaalia. Vanya befriends the bandit's oxen, Butterscotch and Brownie, and they agree to take the coffin and Esdra's corpse back to town. With Esdra resurrected and after a half drunken exchange between Vanya and Dazomar about dragons, the party continues on to Barnabalzar's lair. The deal is struck: if the party can rid Barnabalzar's family's lair of the usurper Gauldurgvoar, they may have half of the treasure contained within the lair. The party agrees to this relatively quickly. The party continues to Ravenguard Heights, where they find the entrance quite easily. Vanya approaches a snow fox named Crisp, who informs the party that the dragon often leaves during the day to hunt. Vanya suggests the party wait until the dragon is gone, clear out the lair, and start an ambush. After a quick vote, the party agrees. They wait until the dragon scatters, with Esdra and Vanya's bird skippy keeping watch. The party continues in, sweeping through the lair and eradicating any draconian fiends they run into, until they come to a room with no floor. Glancing at the walls, Vaalia discovers the name Diadoras, which is door of the gods in Druidic. The images adorning the walls show Dagda, the Morrigan, the Silverhand, and Oghma battling against a group ot titans. However, it also shows images of women with raven wings, a large wolf which Oghma uses as a mount, and a large warrior with a hammer, which are unfamiliar to the party. Brochlily tests the room and finds a bridge beneath, but it falters and she almost fallows. It seems to be a test of faith. Vanya is able to walk across the bridge via her faith in Morrigan, Brochlily in Danu, and Esdra in Karnon. Vaalia across the walls. Ered attempts to carry Dazomar across, but the extra weight challenges his faith, and the two almost fall. The gals go adventure while Dazomar and Ered discuss riddles and look at the wall more, discovering a grave with a description that says \"Here lays \u00d3engus Macan \u00d3c, rider of Nurveiathaal and son of the Aes'ahn\", a sign of the metallic dragons battling the titans, and a great eye on the horizon. With some help from Vanya, Vaalia is able to carry Dazomar across the walls and this allows Ered to venture across the chasm through his faith in Dagda. The party continues to fight, leading up to the horde. They find a group of people gathered around, all non draconic. They claim to serve the Great King of D\u00fbrandur. They say that this one of the lairs of the Predator of Prisms and it is ruled by a messenger of the Apex Prism. The party refuses to leave, and there is a large fight. The heroes win, but the dragon is called back. Vaalia decides to search the horde for anything to help beat the dragon, and the horde is revealed to contain many mimics, who almost kill her. Vanya runs around healing everyone as Brochlily, Dazomar, Ered, Vaalia, and Esdra do battle with the mimics, as Skippy flies above and warns when the dragon approaches. When the dragon comes in, the remaining mimics run to block the door. When the dragon arrives, Esdra sprouts demonic wings, whereas Vanya transforms into a strange creature with the wings and feathers of ravens. He rushes Ered and knocks him and Brochlily down with a wall of fire, although they are healed and hit the dragon very hard. Esdra flies up to do battle with the dragon, and damages him significantly, although they are knocked to the ground. Dazomar hits a fucking goated chaos bolt, and the dragon swears vengeance and goes to retreat. Vanya rushes to heal the fallen tiefling, but they discover too late Esdra has already died, and the dragon is able to flee. The party gather to debate their next moves, which is to return to Barnabalzar Kharisrain, 202EF (24/10/2022)[ ] Alzara checks in on Molly, finding that she has continued to be a solitary individual, occasionally visiting the grove of Dagda but otherwise keeping to herself. Not wanting to intrude, Alzara leaves her be, meeting up with the rest of the party as they visit the bathhouse before setting off for Elderfall. Upon arrival, they are advised that there was once a lumbermill in operation in the forest to the west, but had abandoned it following fears that the area was haunted by a malign spirit. On entering the forest, supposedly even in the middle of the day, the thickets grow unnaturally dark, and thus the flow of timbers has entirely dried up. The rumours prove to be true, the party stepping forth into the gloom, even within a clearing by the waterside. Despite having only travelling for an hour since the morn, there is nothing above them besides grey sky, illumination afforded only by moonlight and passing fireflies. While Alzara starts to ritually cast Detect Magic, the rest of the party investigating their surroundings. Raisuboi makes note of black liquid dripping from the canopy, so shoots a Fire Bolt upwards, briefly illuminating a creature that only he sees. Ered suddenly slips, falling prone, while Kreev and Illinois are affixed in place by the ichor, restrained, and while Kreev manages to break free, they are promptly interrupted by a group of wraiths materialising from the mist. Illinois, still stuck, surrounds himself in darkness, while the rest of the party is suddenly ambushed. Raisuboi is sent into flight by a lurching sense of terror, while the party discovers they cannot target or wound them, leading them to surmise that they are likely illusionary. When Alzara finally manages to cast Detect Magic, the surroundings are brimming with the School of Illusion, save the ichor upon the floor. As the party discusses the possibility that the 'spirit' might be just protecting the wood from the lumberers, Alzara's ear is flicked by an unseen creature that reaches out from an impossibly small hole in a tree trunk, but they fail to respond to Illinois' attempts to talk. They try and bait the creature to return, but instead notice something moving rapidly through the canopy overhead. Kreev proves an amusing sight as he juggles sparks using Prestidigitation, prompting laughter from the treeline, before the creature is smote by a sudden bolt of lightning and falls down dead. Crying out that it wasn't him, Kreev uses Healing Word on the trickster fey, but it promptly runs away. Ered identifies it as a Boggle, but does not think that it is the ultimate culprit, because they are usually relatively harmless. Save several squirrels, the forest is otherwise quiet, so they continue onwards. Pushing further into the forest, they find a trunk fallen over a gulley, serving as an improvised bridge. As the party japes about the dangers of crossing bridges a voice calls out to them and tells them to venture no further, for the land belongs to the land itself alone. The group questions why, if the river is the boundary, the illusionary magic extends far beyond it, for which the voice answers that simply only those that have the willpower to deal with the spirits can claim those lands. The voice remains resistant to the attempts to talk, refusing to allow passage, at the orders of the 'Master', the so-called \"Night and the Haunting\". The voice grows increasingly agitated at the party asking questions, with storm clouds circling overhead, as the party notices countless boggles in the trees around them. The source of the voice is suddenly struck down by a bolt of lightning, stumbling into the light, a deep gnome-like creature pockmarked with wounds - and is violently rebuked by another voice from above, one filled with more authority, that demands they let the party past to parley with them. He counsels them haste, before all are struck by root branches that transform the party into giant elks. Galloping west for an hour, the journey greatly expeditated by their transformation, they enter another clearing, finding a scene of desolation, the twisted and ruined remains of numerous fey creatures - blink dogs, redcaps, wood woads and faerie dragons - with many of the wounds suggestive that the redcaps had found conflict with the others. Recalling their previous interactions with the redcaps, the party seeks to learn their master through the lipstick allowing a creature to cast Speak with Dead. Their Sylvan speaker, Ered, asks after its master - \"The Many-Eyes\", that the Night and the Haunting, also seemingly known as the Night Shepherd (the Archfey Bugul Noz) is cowardly and consumed by fear. The Redcap also confirms their suspicions, the Many-Eyes is indeed the Archfey Kalandaer, the \"Most Beautiful Creature in the Worlds\". Raisuboi recalls what he knows of Bugul Noz. While they do not hold court or habitat in a particular forest, they do favour the Material Plane, because they crave humanoid companionship. Despite this, they are accused of malign actions with accidental murders, but not maleficence. The party guesses that the boggles previously encountered were probably associated with Bugul Noz, while the Call Lightning and thundering voice may have instead been Kalandaer. As they notice another tree filled with squirrels, the party's slow and steady investigation is interrupted by a marauding group of troll-like humanoids. Charging forwards in a frenzy, with spells slung to thin their ranks in the strike, Ered and Raisuboi take the brunt of the clubs and claws, before another group makes itself known on the far side of the lumberyard. In response the voice in the sky empowers the squirrels watching into a coordinated horde, seemingly to help the party. With Ered now Haste'd by Alzara, the squirrels glide into action on the side of the party, helping the group deal with the first horde. Kreev distracts the other group briefly with use of Major Image mimicking another group of buff squirrels, allowing the party to regroup and refocus their attention. Both Raisuboi and Ered continue to take the majority of their strikes, most so the former, the final trollkin are slain by the furious squirrels that immediately after drop their improvised bark weaponry and flee. The trollkin are quite unlike anything the group had previously come across, not quite troll, not quite humanoid, but they find no further bodies of the trollkin amongst the dead, but note that none of the other combatants would be capable of preventing their regeneration. Noting that no fallen lumberers are amongst the dead, the theory is posited that they may have been scared off to spare them the chaos of the coming conflict, which may be akin to the interests of Bugul Noz, but equally note that the lumberers may have brought on the ire of the forest - owing to the presence of wood woads and a treant. The treant appears to have suffered an unusual wound, a charred point across its trunk, as if struck by lightning as had been seen previously with the boggles. The alignment and angulation seems more apt for something standing alongside it had unleashed sudden arcane energy, but it proves to be the only oddity as they search throughout the rest of the camp, save that nothing had been taken. Instead, once again it seems the lumberers were ultimately sent into flight to stop what they were doing, rather than seeking to harm or steal from them. Subsequently, they start to question why the voice in the sky had guided them to this place, and find themselves following a squirrel, searching around its perch and finding a cavern system behind the waterfall. The tunnels are initially filled with wild roots and fungi, with muffled voices drifting faintly through the tunnels. They speak of a trade for a number of objects - a seed of a sister, a mask that serves as a family heirloom - which turns into demands by the Mallacht Coven to give them up in exchange for their life. The Coven sisters refer to the speaker as a wyrm, who rebukes their threat, simply remarking that they would wait them out, should intervention come from an unexpected place, seemingly aware of the party's approach. The party do indeed approach, spying the hags, a hoard of redcaps and a troll, squaring off with a wood golem and a dragon-like creature hewn of living bark and twig. The party intervenes, with Alzara casting Slow on the hag's minions while the dragon tries to flee, only to be cut off by a Wall of Fire. Ered and Raisuboi seek to slay at least one of the hags to stunt their coven magics, with Kreev aiding through his Dancing Item, cast on a discarded mace. Raisuboi, Ered and Kreev avoid the worst effects of a Stupefying Cackle, as the dragon-like creature moves to leave, remarking that the items it protects are more important that any of the party's lives. Instead, it sends its wood golem to aid the three of them engaged in close-quarters combat. Kreev covers the redcaps and Bolva in acid while Alzara uses a distant Counterspell to thwart Kirous' attempts to Hold Person both Ered and Raisuboi in place. After being targetted by her, Forbanna harasses Alzara with Magic Missile, breaking her concentration on Slow. Raisuboi casts Darkness on himself as the redcaps rush in, inadvertently knocking down both Bulvo and the Troll. Ered repositions, hunting down the weakened Forbanna, but is affixed in place by Kirous successfully casting Hold Person on him. Bulvo finally breaks free but cannot move far, due to the Irrepressible Dance of his Dancing Item, and the troll struggles to find Raisuboi in the rabble - before both the troll and horde are slowed again by Alzara. Nonetheless, the horde manages to destroy Kreev's Bonk, the mace-shaped version of his animated chicken Bork, Kreev getting revenge by both forcing Kirous to Counterspell his Hideous Laughter, and mocking Forbanna relentlessly as she is fixed in place. Bolva orders her sisters to flee, before using Finger of Death on Ered, which nearly kills the firbolg. Once again, despite Alzara's efforts, Forbanna manages to Plane Shift away, Kirous following shortly afterwards. Ered is repeatedly knocked prone, healed up by near every member of the party around him. Having rushed in to aid Ered, Illinois' Darkness starts to prove a hindrance by blocking his allies sightlines, but falters when he and Ered are knocked unconscious by Bolva's Stupefying Cackle, along with her troll ally. Raisuboi continues to hold fast against the remaining hag alongside the Wood Golem, before the latter is banished, turning the battle unfavourably, with much of the party wounded or unconscious. Alzara wakes both Ered and Illinois with Magic Missile, allowing Ered to subsequently heal Raisuboi, but Illinois is knocked down by a marauding troll. Kreev continues to bleed out, Alzara unable to heal him due to Bolva's Counterspell stopping her attempts to use Wither and Bloom, before she is cut down herself by the hag's claws after remarks that she is \"fine work indeed\". With Ered the only one standing, he manages to heal Illinois with a potion, but is hacked down by a troll's claws, but gives Illinois enough of chance to in turn heal Raisuboi. Bolva picks up the unconscious Alzara and starts to climb away after the cavern face. Raisuboi tries to break the hag's concentration with a Guiding Bolt, dealing damage but failing to achieve his intent. It proves only a matter of time. Ered bleeds out, as does Raisuboi, Kreev and Illinois stabilise and are carried off by evil fey, leaving the dead within the cavern. A day later, both Ered and Raisuboi awaken, wracked in pain. Before them stands Ludithas, having successfully cast Raise Dead on both in turn. Upon his shoulder perches a squirrel, to the curiosity of the pair, the voice resonated from within, the same as from the clouds before: \"Don't worry heroes, we'll find them.\" Kharisrain, 202EF (28/10/2022)[ ] Before The Party leaves Pickle contacts his Patron and asks for information regarding the location of the Mallacht Coven at first he offers up an indefinite extension to his contract but this is refuted and is instead asked to locate an object for The Mother, Pickle accepts the terms of the arrangement, \"One life for One axe\" Auxley sits in his office and contacts the unknown Being through the Terra Stone, Auxley asks for aid, The being assess his soul and deems him a lost soul and decides it is unclear if he would be a good protector or not, Auxley explains his case and that he will do what ever it takes for his friends, The Being accepts his request and shares with him the Terra Stone's power.

Past: Eight of Glyphs - The Bishop, The adherence to a code or a belief. Present: Four of Stars - The Abjurer, Guided by logic and reason but overlooking something vital Future: Five of Swords - The Myrmidon, A reversal of fate, the underdog who overturns the odds on a mighty enemy. Ana asks once more if he would undertake this burden, Ered agrees and Ana relinquishes the sword to him. Ered attunes to the blade and is given a vision of Elderfall but the ground begins to fissure and fall away leaving him stranded on a pillar in the middle of an abyss, he gazes down and sees a large red eye staring back, the sunny sky turns to a fierce storm and a voice rings out. \"Our Eye's are opening\" Ered snaps out of this vision and reaffirms his dedication to his faith, as he passes by a mirror to leave he notices the faint outline of an eye on his forehead. The Party eat their Hero's Feast and prepare to be shifted, Ludithas strikes the Tuning Fork and sends The Party to Idirghu\u00ed.

Following Bracelets - Verdair 202EF (17/12-2022)[ ] Journey's Start An interesting little journey, to be sure! I simply walked through the doors to a local tavern, I believe it's called the Hearth and Home? To get a meal. I certainly did not expect to overhear a conversation about \"following a bracelet\", how does one follow a bracelet? Naturally, I asked; as it turns out, one of them had found a bracelet and determined it was pointing towards its twin and now they were intent to head in that direction. A splendid goal, to be sure, exploration and answering questions! A fascinating group as well, even invited me along, an offer I could not refuse. We spent some time getting horses to make the journey smoother. Sir Dazomar and Miss Maeve had a short verbal sparring match over a specific horse, rather entertaining to watch. The classic \"she's not good for the money\" responded to with \"he only pays in copper\". Miss Maeve got the horse in the end, the merchant was not too keen on being paid in a mountain of coins. As we started our journey, we passed by two villages, Bernard and Achlyne. Good opportunity to see the surrounding lands. Some of the group wanted to check in with an acquaintance, a Mr Daffthug, to check whether his family was alright. Apparently he had recently had a son, though one that did not fully resemble his mother nor father, owing to the appearance of one with troll ancestry, which both supposed parents were missing. Sounded like this was some sort of poor sign? As we were on the west side of the mountain, the bracelet led us off road along a woodland path, the obvious sensitivity in its movements making it clear we were getting closer. The path led us to a small village, Laergyton, rather secluded and seemingly self-sufficient. Apparently they were having some problems recently, where someone they called a \"Nightwalker\" had appeared and taken their children, keeping them inside the former Elder's house, which was currently a school. This \"Nightwalker\" was fast, only left the house during nighttime and had the power to enslave the minds of others. Spoke of how she had killed the village Elder and any villagers who tried to flee or find help. I started suspecting that this \"Nightwalker\" might be a vampire, then shared and discussed this with the rest. Thus, we decided it'd be best to head over during the day, with the protection of the sun, which vampires are not too fond of. So we went over to the school to look over the place, found a strange mark on the door, along with a name - Helda's Home for Blessed Younglings. Helda's Home for Blessed Children As we went inside, the bracelet was turning strangely, and we quickly realised the pair was upstairs. The beds on the bottom floor looked strangely unused, whilst those on the top floor, where the windows were thoroughly boarded up, were used. This, along with a suspicious bloodstain seemed to point further towards my hypothesis of \"vampire\" and the placement of the beds for the children did not bode well for the possibility of them no longer being children. We found Miss Helda, along with several children, and she spoke of adopting the children, and spoke of how she protected them. She had several scars, like small cutting marks and the children looked malnourished, and the way she spoke was strange. I began to suspect that Helda was not the vampire, but rather dominated. She shared a story of a strange man coming to the village, offering to \"bless\" the children and the villagers, in awe of his abilities to cheat death and be \"unending and eternal\", accepted it. The tragedy that had befallen this woman and these children became more and more clear, and the situation was seemingly worse still! Miss Helda told us how the villagers were deliberately sending travellers to their deaths, to feed them to the children, and how their talks of trying to leave was a lie. Sir Ered also reached the conclusion that the children were turned, whilst Miss Helda was still human, after sensing the presence of the group. Sir Dazomar asked Miss Helda about the bracelet she wore, to whit she spoke of her beloved sister, who had the other one, prompting a question in return as to how and where Sir Dazomar got hold of the bracelet. He initially tried to lie about how he bought it from a merchant, but did not succeed in convincing her, later he tried to give the truth: it had been found on a dead body, sacrificed for some dark end, but alas, by the 'twas too late. She'd already told the children that \"dinner is ready\". The former children were vicious and fast, spreading around the house in attempts to divide and conquer. One of the spawns could manifest psychic attacks, and two of them dragged me into a room. Sir Ered and Miss Avalon were both unwilling to fight the spawn at first, owing to their former nature as children, but Ered was willing to fight properly once I reminded the kind soul that these younglings were no longer quite the innocent children they might elsewise appear to be. Miss Avalon stuck to her principles to the end, preferring to incapacitate the children, rather than deliver lethal blows. Noble, though given the state, perhaps not the wisest act. One of the spawn in the room with me was dispatched by Sir Dazomar, before the other trapped me in the room with her. Alas, my weapons were not suited to deal with such a foe, but Sir Ered eventually came to my aid. Because of these unfortunate circumstances, I could not quite keep track of the battle as it ensued, but I gathered that Sir Dazomar was in a rough spot, and was aided by Miss Maeve, Miss Arania and Miss Avalon. Once the battle was over, Miss Maeve seemed particularly done with the entire house, but was willing to head back to look for Miss Helda. The Aftermath After grouping back up, we went where Miss Helda had run off too, and found her dead next to a strange crack in the world, her hand placed within. Apparently the crack was similar to one that had appeared back in Freehearth a while ago. The same mark from the door was also on Helda's amulet, and whilst I could not identify it, it brings another reason to find the College, as it might have the answers that I seek.. Miss Avalon examined the room, using heightened senses to find magic. She spoke of a strange magical signature that was left on the crack and Helda, of a kind that cannot be copied down for later study, only sensed, like a lingering aura given shape. After examining the room and house thoroughly, finding the bodies of previous travellers, as well as some of their belongings, a discussion ensued about what to do about the children. Given the information we learned from Miss Helda, I believed the kindest and safest action both to be bringing the children back under the sun, giving them a merciful end. Alas, the others disagreed, and I suppose talking to the parents before deciding what to do was not unwise. Thus, Sir Dazomar and I stayed to keep watch over the spawn, whilst the rest went back to look for the parents, they quickly returned sans the parents though, as in trying to find them, they only found death. The dead bodies of the villagers, killed via arcane magic, primordial in nature, were spread about the town square, placed in a pattern spelling out words in common. \"We see you\" Slightly ominous, don't you think? Certainly not the way I expected this little excursion, and it only opened further questions... (18/02/2023) Ripplesun, 202EF[ ] The Party arrive in Elderfall and find flyers detailing wanted insurgents Lachlainn Setanta, Awen The Witch, Maldwyn The Wise, Cynogthorn The Brave, Braith The Bear. The group stop in Banard and find it in good standing with Dagda having visited recently and aiding in the rebuilding of the town and a wall, the party then arrive in Achlyne and meet with Dafthug and speak with him over his concerns regarding his son who has been afflicted by the Hag's malicious spell, Ered and Raisuboi promise to return and guide the family to Freehearth to undo the spell on Dafthug's son, moving on the party approach a group on the side of the road a man hands one of his group a small pouch and asks the party to escort him to Port Arden the group agree and he claims his name is Ewan (a failed insight check from Raisuboi), the group move to the border between Elderfall and Port Arden and come to a checkpoint Ewan panics and asks the party to help him hide his pet an illegal creature from a foreign land, Ana hides the tiny beastie in the lead box that she keeps Faoim\u00f3rach in.The party and ewan are one by one checked over by the border patrol and given the all clear. The party settle down for the night in the Arden Ridge mountains and Ana does a card reading Rix and draws - Anarchist - Abjurer - Tax Collector The first watch is taken by Ewan and Ana, Ewan starts the watch with questions about Elderfall and mentions how he is a traveller and that he is looking for a place to settle down where greed and war are not the overruling problems. Ana reads his cards. - Merchant - Enchanter - Thief The rest of the night runs smoothly and the next day they set off into the mountains, after a few hours travel they come to a lake with a gargantuan log cabin built next to it, Ewan makes preparations to leave but Raisuboi suggests he stick around so they can take him safely down the mountain, he agrees to stick around but is understandably worried so the party let him remain with the wagon. The party approach the town and are met by two Half-Ogre guards after explaining they are here to research an item they have, they are granted access and make their way through the town to what they are told is the Warlord's hut they are met by a challenge as the room is bathed in darkness, Maeve falls down a 50 foot hole and is met by statues and a Goregon makes itself known the group work together to pull maeve out when a more threatening Goregon barrels up to Maeve, getting past that ordeal they enter a main hall where a conversation is taking place, talk of aid in matter involving the six kingdoms and the capital but his requests are rebuffed by the leader then the party are greeted by the Elder of the giant tribe Karmog. Karmog is very welcoming and translates as much as he can... When darkness comes, the eye opens, Crackling and blinding, the smiter shalt rise, Under and Other, the worlds collide, A crown, a throne, and a thousand eyes. Follow the darkness, beyond the deepest depth, Where worlds converge and walls have cracked, Through darkness of Fey, beyond light of Aes'ahn, Balor slumbers in the tomb of Faoim\u00f3rach The party interrogated the prisoner and gained a few words more for the prophecy, in return for information which Ered answered as truthfully as he could allow himself. Returning with a half filled sheet Ana was disgruntled by the method of information gathering and went in with her spells and returned with nothing as the Prisoner's mind was too strong. The party decide to stay the night and try the next day, as they left they found Ewan talking to the man who sought aid from Karmog, they attempted to leave as the party approached, Ana spoke with the man who revealed himself to be Maldwyn The Wise he invited Ana to contact him by sending up a spell while beyond Killeith. After a night of dedication to Dagda the party arrive the next day and begin interrogating the prisoner again and with assistance from Raisuboi they managed to force the information out of him along with knowledge of a spy within Karmog's court. The party are thanked for their efforts and revealing the conspirator in their midst. The party then return home and save Dafthug's son along the Wilhemina Vanderwilt) Alzara starts the days making the rounds to the members of the party, delivering costumes to each to make them more convincing as their pirate roles in anticipation of their travel northbound at Auxley's behest. Taking on alternate identities, the party sets off up the Chronicle Coast, past the still-glowing lighthouse - a silhouette visible at the top - but the party is quickly distracted by the presence of numerous shipwrecks, and an encroaching wave seemingly created by a creature shifting beneath the water. At Auxley's command, Vaalia starts to shift the sails to align the ship better with the wind blowing northwest. They gain a little leeway on the creature, which Alzara spots as looking like a huge turtle covered in thick scales. Vanya's casting of Gust of Wind gives the ship an edge to escape their chaser. As they race past a shipwreck, they spy a body of a sea elf laying amongst wreckage and coral on the furthermost one. Vaalia is Vortex Warp'd over to the ship, snatching up a druidic staff etched with the glyphs \"Warden of the Sea\", with Auxley's griffon swooping in to scoop up the body, clad in a wooden set of chain armour. Vaalia claims the armour while Ana tends to the body. Fifteen minutes or so pass, before the party hears a hideous cracking noise, the ship taking on water from below as a dragon turtle emerges on the starboard side to enact tribute. When Vanya tries to feed the dragon turtle a large amount of Goodberries, the dragon regurgitates the berries, along with an amber comb, muffin, book and rock and a vast jet of steam that knocks Auxley unconscious. The party offers up a number of tributes, including the Hide Mail, the Lingo Lipstick and a Vial of Spriggan Blood. There was a further ripple in the water sparking panic in the dragon turtle. While distracted, Ana casts her Vial of Nightshade into its maw, the party pushing forwards suddenly with another Gust of Wind, clearing their path before a vast 200 foot plus long serpentine creature snatches the dragon turtle into the depths. Fleeing, the party addresses the leak by means of Ana and Alzara casting Borrowed Knowledge, repairing the ship sufficiently so that Vanya does not need to cast Shape Water throughout the night to hold back the water creeping inwards. Rested, the party passes near Toorboney early the following morning, shortly after which Ana conducts a spirit session to cast Speak with Dead. - Q: What fate befell you and your ship? Q: What/who The Dragon Turtle - Q: Have you any kin on Elysia? A: Yes - Q: Is there anything you would like them to know, now that you have passed? A: The deed was done, the fortunes hidden - Q: Where might we find your kin? A: The Reef of the Roc/Rock/Rocke/Rocqe/Roq/Roque/Rourke/Rorke/Rork/Rorq/Rorc/Rorck/Rorqe They decide that is best to dispose of the body of the sea elf before their arrival and lower it into water with mutterings towards Mammon to guide into into the afterlife. With their disguises subsequently donned, hair styles and facial appearances augmented through the arcane, they shortly after make their approach - seeking to gather information, learning of the potential threats they present, their scope, strength and weaknesses, as well as being on the lookout for any pillaged loot worth taking. On arrival, they find the port to be occupied by just one other ship, but only one small wharf side available - that proves a slight challenge for Auxley for pilot the Pride of Azar into place, with the sound of scratching and scraping. The party is immediately chastised by an elven figure coming out from the cliff-side tavern called the Scurvy Sea Hag. Placating the elven Michael with a gold piece for the moment, the party learns there is a non-enforceable 5gp docking fee, which Auxley pays readily, claiming to have be blessed by a number of \"legal gains of late\". Trying to put on a confidence face, Vanya and Auxley both try to enter the tavern simultaneously, Vanya winning out, although the commotion garners the attention of the dozen or two patrons already contained within. The rest of the party follows swiftly after, with Auxley breaking the ice by buying the contents of the bar a drink for a total of 180gp, claiming to have just made a fair sum of coinage. They are subsequently invited to partake in a gambling game called the \"Rock of Destiny\" that involves a pair of boxes - and trying to end up with the box containing the rock in the end. Ana plays first, offering up an enchanted harp against the tabaxi Bounty's Amulet of the Drunkard. Ana goes first, and claims she has the rock in her box, prompting the tabaxi to barrage her with a range of odd questions. The tabaxi claims Ana's box, finding a stone contained within and thus taking Ana's harp. Vanya goes next, mulling over her options for a while before agreeing to a wager of 500gp. When the tabaxi insists on going first, Vanya takes her money and leaves, so Auxley instead takes her place, raising the sum to 750gp. Bounty goes first, Auxley decides to keep the box he is dealt, finding a rock contained within a winning 750gp. Vanya then sweeps back in, offering up her Cup of Sobriety in exchange for his Orb of Time. In an act of defiance, Vanya decides not to look in her box, confusing the tabaxi until finally she agrees to at their insistence but then claims that she has not one, but two rocks in hers. Bounty takes her box, finding it empty and delivering Vanya the win. Alzara positions herself across from Bounty, using a Subtle Spelled Detect Thoughts to win, despite the tabaxi's efforts to obfuscate things by using Vanya's tactic against Alzara, but the giff placing the rock in the box each time's thoughts subsequently betray him. Alzara declines to claim the Bag of Holding as her prize, handing it back to the giff, remarking that perhaps from time to time he should make decisions for himself, in place of following direct orders from his captain so freely - having been ordered to offer it up in the wager by Bounty. Auxley works his way round the tables, making small talk to the residents of Port Roc Reef, claiming to be from the western seas, having crossed the continent over the land as an unconventional shortcut. One amongst them starts pulling out Wanted Posters - the scruffy and bearded Darin Balo (1000gp), level of internalised flusterment. Auxley claims the lattermost is dead already, having seen him dead in a shallow ditch somewhere in the mainland - a disappointing result for all individuals present. Alzara and Vanya speak with Blirth, an ogre. They learn that people come and go frequently from the port, and that they have often contested with Karkadann, the dragon turtle. Auxley uses the coin he won from Bounty to buy another round, earning him further favour with the residents, while Ana catches sight of an individual doing tarot readings. Overhearing the placement of the Traitor card to an unsettled pirate, she sits across the table from the individual, at which point they agree to read each other. For Diego Martinez, as read by Anastasia Ekatarina - Past: Trader - remarking the bartering and somewhat questionable methods of commerce engaged by means of piracy - Present: Hooded One - the mysterious presence of a new-comer, making direct reference to herself - Future: Horseman - a foul omen, although Ana remarks that it may be the destruction of a foe's bloodline, rather than his For Anastasia Ekatarina, as read by Diego Martinez (and focused on the cards, not just trying to get a measure of Ana) - Past: Traitor - a betrayal in the past, prompting a crisis of being or faith, and perhaps what originally guided her to the Phantom Queen - Present: Darklord - whether following or contained within, a darkness that forces Ana to look over her shoulder with each and every step - Future: Beggar - an uncertainty, but a portent of a change in economic fortune Diego remarks that he was not always a pirate, having travelled a troupe around Eskarya and the Freehold but was eventually ejected by his companions due to the grimness of the prophecies offered. Ana asks him for a story from his travels, at which point he appears to be possessed, eyes ablaze in pearlescent white - \"I come in may forms whether it's irony, love, laughter, or hate. I am always around, but never seen, I am often avoided, but I always catch up.\" Ana offers death as her answer, which amuses Diego, or whatever Diego had briefly become, before the tarot reader suddenly drops dead. Channelling her connection to Morrigan, Ana revivifies him and comments on his possession, which also seems to amuse Diego. Diego calls over Captain Bounty, saying that they need to change their fortunes, for fate has caught up with them, and now they can achieve what they previously could not with Ana's involvement. With Auxley's approval, they agreed to items rather than gold, sufficient to change their fortunes, making reference to some kind of haunt, curse or affliction. The party moves to investigate, moving through a storage room filled with barrels, the same below by means of a trapdoor, before noticing a padlocked barrel which Auxley, after some 20 seconds of working away, opens up to reveal a passageway. Beyond is a small cove filled with rowboats, more storage, but nonetheless they proceed with caution, Vaalia's Psychic Whispers connecting her mind to Ana and Vanya. Behind a brick wall, Vanya finds a tome, and while Ana searches the crates a barrels finds a pair of swirling emeralds - Elemental Gems (for Water Elementals). Pressing further, they overhear a bold presentation by an individual trying to make a case for using a number of relics in place of hiding them away to counter that which they need to bind. The voice, they recognise as Vanora, the water genasi previously responsible for assailing Ojoro's Farm. They are quickly shutdown by another voice, reminding Vanora that they are a slave, bound to their master's bidding - threatening to put them back in their place if they have forgotten. Ana's Dispel Magic on the door removes the Glyph of Warding noted there as she investigated, allowing Auxley to pick the lock. Opening the door slightly, but otherwise unnoticed, spying Varona within, and a humanoid covered in barnacles and other oceanic detritus. Auxley tosses his Blue Sapphire Elemental Gem into the room, summoning an Air Elemental. Vanya bolsters her allies with a surge of divine energy, before using Entangle to restrain the individuals within the room. Ana's Frenzied Bolt chases after, dealing massive damage but prompting a casting of Maelstrom in retaliation that threatens to catch the entire party - and although Alzara attempts to dispel it, she fails to do, sending them tumbling inwards. With Entangle, Maelstrom, Sleet Storm, the battlefield proves hazardous to navigate, with Vaalia and Auxley pushing in firing away at Vanora, breaking their concentration on the Maelstrom. Vanya utilises her raven familiar to deliver a grievous Inflict Wounds to Vanora, Ana following up with a radiant energy-infused Frenzied Bolt, seemingly actually killing Vanora, his body not vanishing into water as it had before. The Air and Water Elementals continue to duke it out, repeatedly slamming into each other, at which point Auxley is felled by a Dark Tide Knight wielding a Shortsword and a Crushing Wave Priest upcasting Magic Missile. Falling unconscious, Auxley is killed by a Reaver with her Sharktoothed Longsword. As Ana, Vanya and Alzara move to help, hampered by the Sleet Storm, they are forced back by a sudden Water Jet from another figure in the room, stuck in the swirling snow and mist once more. Eventually all the party manages to make it into the room, cutting through the last of the Tsuraine cultists, save the Water Elemental - directly focused on the rampaging Air Elemental, and the Marid, who fires another Water Jet, who then flees. Ana manages to cast Suggestion on the Marid, persuading them to return into the room. Even when the magical compulsion breaks, the party offers to parley nonetheless, but moves to instead deal with the rampaging elementals. Heals aplenty are passed through the group by Vanya and Ana, the latter avoiding a strike from the Air Elemental - which is then felled by Water Elemental, which in turn is then cut down by Ana herself. Combat comes to an abrupt end as Vanora breathes his last, and with no means to return either him or Auxley from the dead, the party does indeed sit and converse with the Marid. They comment that they did not know of the cult's presence, having been brought there by fate alone, and at Auxley's interest. The Marid remarks that it has little difference to the bindings upon Vanora, that humanoids are slaves to their fate, as Vanora is a slave, although has been given a choice better than fate, or death. As servants of Tsuraine, they have infiltrated the Material Plane to aid Tsuraine seize control of the Plane of Water, and that the best way to stop them here is to aid them in the Plane of Water by ejecting Mann\u00e1n. Deeming Mann\u00e1n to be inadequate, having failed to protect the Material Plane due to his infatuation with claiming the Plane of Water. The Marid attempts to tempt Ana into making a wish, but Ana rebukes her offer to \"go to the Plane of Water\", saying that instead the Phantom Queen will guide her fate, just as her destiny had brought her here. The Marid leaves, the party deciding against giving chase, given the loss of Auxley and acknowledging that she ultimately was not the head of the operation, instead just another pawn on the playing board. Before leaving, they find a location marked near the isle of Wildewatch, as well as a number of spell scrolls. Hidden by means of a magic switch marked with a tidal wave symbol, they also locate a room filled with loot - items and gold, as per the comments made by the patrons. They find the patrons in the tavern having thrown aside bracelets of woven kelp, and promptly demanding a share of the loot - the party then remarking they have left the gold in the vault for them, as promised. Finding this to be true, they are permitted to leave, but before they do so, Diego, at Alzara's behest, peers into Auxley's fate, drawing cards. For Auxley St. Crow, as read by Diego Martinez - Past: Wizard - mystery and riddles; the unknown; those who crave magical power and great knowledge - Present: Tempter - a new discovery; the coming of unexpected things; unforeseen consequences and chaos - Future: Dictator - all that is wrong with government and leadership; those who rule through fear and violence Looking at the Dictator card, he asks if Auxley ruled with fear and violence, to which Alzara replies unequivocally not, the half-troll remarking that he has gone out of his way to aid others, suffering burdens that would otherwise be shouldered by others. With that, Diego revivifies him, castigating him that he must stand fast against such things. The party leaves, sailing back - via assorted chunks of dragon turtle scattered throughout the water. (01/05/2023) Alor, 202EF[ ] After a few mundane matters are dealt with in Freehearth, the party travels overland towards the bridge north of the settlement, passing through the bridge fort constructed by Brochlily, now occupied by a smattering of animalfolk warriors to watch over the crossing. Nonetheless, the emaciated individual previously found to be sitting upon the bridge sharing riddles is seen, stoic and cold, but then vanishes as they look back - and so with the promise to provide them with a chair should they reappear from the occupants, the group continues on their way further still. Leading the way, Ered spies hooves accompanied by small reptilian set of footprints bound much in the same direction as they are. Ered and Alzara share a quiet moment wondering the fate of the owlbear cub held by the circus, lamenting that they have not had a chance to do anything about it. After a evening filled with leak and potato soup, the party rests, settling in for the night. In the morning, Ered and Auxley come across a fallen horse, slain, with a pair of kobolds harassing the rider, bound on the ground. Wondering if the kobolds may be affiliated with the nearby Dazomar's Lair, the party does not want to immediately attack and instead sends Auxley's griffon Raio to scout out the surroundings and potentially try and spook them. Raio quickly reports that there are numerous kobolds lying in wait nearby, while Alzara notes that the trader does not look too distressed, casting suspicion on them too. Serving as a distraction, Raio grabs the horse and flies off, garnering the ire of the kobolds. Auxley and Alzara use the opportunity to rush up into cover flanking the larger group of kobolds, while Vaalia tosses a Bloodroot Blade at one of the pillaging kobolds, killing it instantly. As the party closes the ground the horde of kobolds tries to flee, Raisuboi casts Wall of Fire to prevent their immediate escape, but inadvertently sets off another trap - one set by the kobolds themselves. A vast lattice of flaming fuel ignites, burning a number of kobolds - and putting the trader in a direct place of threat. Vaalia launches herself through the walls of fire to help the merchant, at which point a red dragon launches themselves from a hiding spot - Gauldurgvoar, who had taken over the lair of the gem dragon Bahrnabalser - recognised by Ered, Vaalia and Brochlily. The dragon tears into Raio, who narrowly survives the onslaught, prompting retaliation from Auxley with his shortbow and a Tanglestrike Wyrwood Arrow, and Alzara with a Banishment, which fails, despite a Counter-Counterspell. Brochlily attempts to Command the dragon, garnering their ire - and prompting them to unleash a Breath Weapon on Auxley and Alzara. Ered swings at the kobold hoard with his Mace of Disruption, who respond with a mass of vials of alchemist's fire and acid. Raisuboi evokes a Mass Healing Word to aid the party. Auxley looses a poisoned arrow at the dragon, Alzara's spell swings wide, while Vaalia and the trader, freed from the flaming walls with aid from a Water Elemental conjured by an Elemental Gem, take cover on a rocky crag. As the dragon circles down towards them, Brochlily rushes to their aid, leaping onto the dragon's back. The pair circle upwards, leaving the deeply wounded Vaalia to finish off the kobold hoard. Brochlily attempts to restrain the dragon with their Channel Divinity but it bursts free of the roots and vines, continuing to fly higher and higher, out of the rest of the party's reach. Vaalia uses her Psychic Whispers to goad the dragon, trying to get them to embrace their pride and stand and fight instead of fleeing, to which the dragon seemed to start to descend - only to be revealed to be a result of Brochlily managing to cast Command to force her to descend, before she then leaps free. Alzara manages to catch her with a Feather Fall, but it follows after, knocking her unconscious. Ered heals her with his Lay on Hands, but Gauldurgvoar seems set on killing her. This proves to their folly, as they are quickly whelmed by the Water Elemental, restrained by Auxley using their Korred Hair Rope, and then battered by the once-again healed Brochlily using her Khopesh of the Vulture. Options desperately closing, Gauldurgvoar offers up an amnesty between them and Freehearth, which the party quickly rejects - with Ered bringing a reply to the dragon with a smite-infused mace strike to the skull. Aided by means of a Suggestion spell, the party question the surviving kobold, Yip, likewise dealing with the arrogant and brattish trader who demands compensation for the troubling day she's been having. Alzara tries to assail her by conjuring a Phantom Steed for her, sending on her way before stirring further anger from the group. Yip remarks that he is familiar with Dazomar, referring to him as the \"Puddle Drinker\" and proclaiming them to be a joke amongst kobolds who don't believe he is a dragon. They have also heard of Pickle, but feel that they have veered off the course of what should be expected from a kobold. Auxley offers him a business card written in draconic, though their ego starts to become a little grating for some - with claims of being able to count up to 500, having lived over 3 years and being clearly the strongest out of their clan, \"after all, they do say survival of the fittest\". They let Yip leave, and then spend best part of a couple hours collecting parts from the dragon, finding a Wand of Eyes, a chest of coins, a magical frying pan and a Cloak of Protection within its belly. They travel further towards the Tower of Light, before camping for the night. The Hound Archon Asteraoth awaits them at the Tower. Alzara calls out, questioning their intentions for their arrival, to which Asteraoth demands once again her repentance to which Alzara refuses, considering him a tyrant. As such, the rest of the party heads onwards without her. Passing by the sites previously investigated, the party makes a particular effort to not touch or move anything, before reaching the apex of the lighthouse. Now standing at Asteraoth's side, they ask after Alzara's crimes, to which declarations of her being a liar, deceiver and thief are cited. The Tower of Light is claimed to a bastion of safety for all those travelling the Elysian seas, to guide them from afar to sanctuary. Vaalia asks about clarity on a few facts pertaining to the God-Emperor, being under the impression that the entire dynasty was sundered a long time ago, to which it is reported that the blood of the divine will always find a way to return to its throne, and that in doing so that salvation will come to all within the lands under the hammer and light of Zitus. Brochlily remarks they seek salvation through Danu, prompting ridicule from Asteraoth, who remarks there is no such to be found through Danu, for there is only one truth, as made clear by the passage of time, of history itself. Zitus once walked amongst men, responding to a call in the time of great need when demons rose up and sought to deliver destruction and cast chains onto that they did not eradicate. They struggled against the chaos and heresy, forging law against it, having been born into divinity itself in a celestial bloodline and arisen through faith and effort. Conflict rises in their words as they speak of heresy in particular, Raisuboi pressing for answers to Zitus' parenthood, to which it is said that there was no mother, just a father, the father being himself. Asteraoth dismisses the idea of Dagda being of note, reminding the histories tell that they did not stand against the chaos as Zitus did. The party reminds the Archon that others tried, and that was as great as Zitus, for they had to give their all and more, given that it ultimately proved insufficient, while Brochlily placing particular emphasis on their indebtment to Danu for giving them life. Asteraoth once more scoffs at the idea, for the badger from which they were awoken would not exist without Zitus' efforts, and thus only they are worthy of praise and offerings. Discussion then shifts to the people of the south, who wield Zitus as a tool of oppression to those other than themselves, to which Asteraoth concedes that it is a point of contention, the stronger Zitus' praise in the north, the more emboldened those in the south might be, but revokes them as false worshippers of the Decider, misunderstanding their teachings. Raisuboi and Vaalia are unmoved, to the commonfolk, they see the act of mortals in Zitus' name as the will of Zitus, regardless of whether the deity's intentions are met. Vaalia instead suggests that Asteraoth repents of their ways that have caused such spilling of blood throughout the continent. Asteraoth refuses to repent on behalf of heathens, unyielding in their belief that despite the name and banner of the Paladins of Zitus of the south they have naught to do with the true Zitus. Questions are asked about Sabathiel, the captive within the lighthouse, who bore crimes of attempting to sever the ancient bloodline and birthright, setting the sparks of revolution. Asteraoth spits at the mention of the Tosimas, calling them pretenders, and then declines to allow the party to speak to Sabathiel, who they say is unable to do so unless Zitus forgives them. Asteraoth remarks that the rising tide is coming, and it will wash aside all the rest, but when Ered presses on the matter of free will of choice, they are giving troubling replies of ideas of re-education, seeming to not acknowledge that others might resist this, and if they did, then they would be re-educated. Asteraoth adds that it was Dagda that first called for aid from Zitus when hardship came, which Raisuboi rebukes, for there is no shame in asking for help to protect \"Home and Hearth\" when he knew the threat was beyond their scope. Raisuboi then asks how Asteraoth would seek to re-educate them, to which the reply is made that they would be taken to the capital, to bathe in the presence of the wisest of sages that would illuminate his mind of the histories, many of them having lived long and divine lives since the days of the First Emperor themselves. Raisuboi brings up the Treatises of the Titan Accord when Asteraoth suggests the Aes'ahn only survived before they fled, saying that the tome makes no mention of this. Unmoved, Asteraoth asks if they helped with the recent illithid threat, garnering a fiery rebuke from Raisuboi that remarks they could not, for their followers had been hunted and cut down, leaving the pagan gods without their eyes. Asteraoth considers it of little matter, for only those that pray to Zitus would find salvation anyway, and that a peace cannot exist - as made plain by the fact that with each answer given, each question asked, only seems to stir anger despite they consider all their answers to be truthful. Vaalia remains dismissive, Asteraoth verbally combative in return - stating that the Empire in the North will soon sweep over the south, clearing heresy from those that proclaim Zitus' name without understanding. The Hound Archon accuses the group of coming to the Tower of Light with the intention to gain a reason to deliver violence, siphoning instead of learning, but Ered replies that while he has found the answers troubling and disagreeable, he will not use it as an excuse for him to draw his mace. Conversation once again returns to Sabathiel, that they are the light of the tower, as punishment for their rebellion, with Raisuboi questioning whether Asteraoth would even be capable of considering free thought, uncapable of seeing past what bound them. What if Sabathiel's cause to which they were bound had changed before Asteraoth came to be, and thus was justified to rise against it? Asteraoth once again dismisses the notion. Vaalia reaches out to Alzara at Raisuboi's request to ask her to fly close, though this seems to start to stir Asteraoth's ire, and thus she does not move at present. In turn, Vaalia lashes out with words, proclaiming the Archon's cause is filled with bloodshed, Alzara raising her voice, making an impassioned speech on the nature of tyranny, and the strong and steady nature of iron can be used to bind together structure and community as a foundation, or as a rod to pummel those standing before the floor to be stepped over and trampled under foot. Alzara throws her arms wide, inviting whatever violence Asteraoth would deliver unto her, proclaiming that is them that seek any excuse, not them, and that she will stand tall and steady, to be crashed against, refusing to bow and thus inviting the celestial to crush her beneath them. Having had enough, responding to Asteraoth's calls of heresy, Vaalia stabs at Asteraoth, bringing the group into combat. A pair of Couatls spring into action as the Tower stirs to arms. Auxley is constricted by one but slips free, while Raisuboi casts Spirit Guardians to protect the party. Ered moves to try and block the way, with his Mace in hand. Vaalia is knocked unconscious by the Archon using Verdict before pulling out a pistol and firing away. Alzara, aided by Raio, manages to reposition sufficiently so to toss out a Cone of Water catching nearly all of the Lantern Archons. Brochlily rushes up the Hound Archon, trading blows, before Asteraoth teleports after the healed Vaalia, but Raisuboi imposes himself between the pair swinging with his new magical frying pan Giant's Share. Giving chase, Brochlily pummels the Hound Archon from the top of the Tower of Light, falling with a definitive crunch and falling limp at its base, the life lingering as they bleed out. As those few Lantern Archons remaining after Alzara's Fireball and Ered's continuous steady work with his Mace of Disruption rush to try and heal Asteraoth, the party rushes to put an end to them. Raisuboi engulfs the body in a Wall of Fire depicting the symbol of Dagda, channeling the heat and warmth of the hearth, Brochlily calls down a Moonbeam with the power of Danu, and Alzara, evoking calls that tyranny falls as the small breaks cause the foundations of oppression to falter sends a Toll the Dead as a pronouncement of doom. While a Lantern Archon and Couatl attempt to heal Asteraoth, it ultimately proves for naught as a stream of Magic Missiles, cast at 4th level, by Alzara definitively strikes the Archon down. Vaalia, once again healed by Ered, rushes for the the central light, pulling free a large urn-like structure - the Orb of the Seraphic Chains. Atop Raoi, Auxley flies down to give pursuit to the Couatl that collected up the fallen Hound Archon's body but is knocked unconscious by the celestial-serpent's bite. The party starts to rush down the inside of the tower, but Alzara instead leaps from it, catching herself with Feather Fall. The Couatls ultimately flee, unable to carry on the fight, as the party clears through, a resolution achieved. (03/06/2023) Tyor, 202EF[ ] As Alzara swings by the Copper Sonnet to drop off the last few supplies for the play, she is drafted in by the panicked dragonborn, on account of [Brochlily](/wiki/Brochlily) needing to drop out last minute. With representatives from Elderfall, Ravencourt, Port Arden and Hammerhorn making their arrivals - amongst them the Queen of Ravencourt in a carriage, the King of Hammerhorn upon a horse, and a gilded carriage from Port Arden that stands out by a measure more. With the crowds starting to swell through, the gates are thrown open, bringing with them tents and carts of goods and supplies and setting up camp on the eastern side of Freehearth. Raisuboi, Pickle and Ana travel to greet the new arrivals, starting with those associated with Elderfall, learning that Duffthug has been temporarily appointed Elder of [Achlyne](/wiki/Achlyne), but meets some passive-aggressiveness from Gwyndaf Erwood of Glenmara Atrio Silvertuft their villages having gone unaided by the adventurers thus far. Ana is approached by [Saoirse](/wiki/Saoirse_%C3%93_Caisidei), who notes that she recently read something that made her think of Ana, a sonnet that Ana stops her rendition of partway through, remarking the power in the words. Instead, Saoirse tears the page from the book, offering it out, before ducking back into the tent. Raisuboi offers snacks to [Hrornirr](/wiki/Hrornirr) and [Ludithas](/wiki/Ludithas), before sending his Tiny Servant to fetch ales for warriors assumed to be from Hammerhorn but later confirmed to Wildewatch (despite not replying to the letter) - clashing with them on the price of the ales before Ana suggests the first round will be on the folk of Freehearth, to some passing approval. Next is King Barra O'Brian of Wildewatch, a stoic bear of a man, to which Raisuboi leaves the entirety of the remaining buns and apples, after feeding the guards outside to prove its quality. With Pickle returned with his bowtie - given he was to meet royalty - while Raisuboi rushes back to the tavern to collect more food, Ana and Pickle greet Queen [Ciara Hyland](/wiki/Ciara_Hyland), who immediately brings up the draconic threat of either [Kildrid](/wiki/Kildrid) or [Kaendrythar](/wiki/Kaendrythar) as delivered by Yip, as well as remarking that the play has become a diplomatic opportunity and thus best not disrupted. After a period of panic from Pickle, they approach the camp of the folk from Redreach, who are all combative and disbelieving of Pickle's demon-slayer status. However, their King offers to pay to relocate them, to serve him and his lands exclusively. Pickle declines on account of the abuse faced due to kobold nature by Uldwyth, prompting King Fearghas Sloani to try and goad the pair into a duel - saying the guard is bound by their creed to meet the challenge. Pickle handily defeats the guard, but deigns not to slay him as the King demands. Artair Donoghuei, the King of Port Arden resides in a splendid tent filled with expensive furnishings and fabrics, who likewise makes an offer to the adventurers, should they wish to move to the region. Ana politely remarks that she will put it to the group, as well as agreeing to send word to the owner of the General Store [Rasaad](/wiki/Rasaad). Raisuboi offers cold water to the Raven-Knights of Ravencourt, who drink without completely removing their helmet. At the Queen's tent, they are stopped by the aarakocran guard Corvus, who declines food and drink until after the festivities, and turn to leave, before Ana is called into the tent - the elven Queen Aislinn Fiaich\u00edn seemingly familiar with her, having watched her for the last couple of years at least, linked as they are by the [Phantom Queen](/wiki/Morr%C3%ADgan). Utilising a crystal ball at the centre of the tent, the Queen of Ravencourt, showing Ana a vision of eyes and a wide maw that starts to speak in riddles: In realms untamed, where dragons roam, a cunning beast finds its treacherous home, With scales of midnight, its gaze so cold, a calculating mind, its stories unfold. This dragon sly, a master of deceit, it plays its games with hearts it seeks to defeat, Crafting illusions, a web so fine, to trap its enemies, one by one, in its twine. But beware, oh warriors, of this serpent's guise, for it thrives on power, where darkness lies, Its games, a mirage, a deceptive show, meant to break the will of those in its woe. She warns that there is something fated to happen associated with the show, but its motivations unknown, and surely lessons to be learned from harm that does not slay, so it should not be feared. The Queen presents Ana with a gift, a dark oak chest fancifully decorated, with a request that Ana and her companions come to court to hear of their struggles, for while they can oft see them coming but cannot do enough to stop it. Inside is another Diviner's Die. Last is that of King E\u00f2in Gunnarch of Hammerhorn, his guards dozing in their drunkenness outside. Introductions are made, and predictably more offers to move the party to their territory to aid the efforts in the region, but seems far more relaxed and complementary than many of the others. Enquiring to their religious beliefs, a follower of Nuada themselves, seems content with the range of intertwined pagan beliefs represented by the group, before segueing into a question pertaining to Ciara's relationship status. When the party doesn't have an immediate answer, he asks for Kreev to put the pair of them together in the seating plan. Ana goes to warn Ciara of E\u00f2in's affections, who seems to be at least passingly interested in him in return, so Ana commits to a reading of the future to come - pulling The Ghost, trying her best to spin the outwardly sinister card into reference to an ancient secret rediscovered perhaps echoing the linking of the Kingdoms in the past, but with the warning of an ancient enemy awakening in anticipation, or as a result of the pursuit of such things. After directing Ciara to pick the blue dress, they are interrupted by Ludinas and Hrornirr, having been told by Raisuboi and Pickle, remarking negatively to the suggestion. Meanwhile, Alzara announces to Kreev that she's tried to cast Find Familiar, but all she can create is, surprisingly for the pair of them, Killian's old familiar [Forfin Azurewhisker](/wiki/Forfin_Azurewhisker). Instead improvising a bird out of felt that she intends to animate by means of a Unseen Servant, they agree it is a better idea than putting a set of wings on Forfin. Notes arrive for Kreev from E\u00f2in, Ciara and Ludithas, the first two requesting the pair sit together, the lattermost warning against it. Kreev, after much thought, sits them apart but with matching pink flower lapels. Instead, E\u00f2in and Artair are sat together, Ciara and Aislinn likewise on the other side. Kreev inspires the party with his speech, hiding any anxiety that may or may not exist, with particular focus given to Raisuboi. And with that - [the play](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sz1qaUUs5KC170CQ7Fiq7XxLsV4Bd4sVZnAPmRk-eWE/edit) begins! - Scene 1 - Kreev shines, putting on an exceptional display as Cedar - Scene 2 - Applause follows Pickle's performance, while the animation of the felt bird seems a bit lacklustre. At the end of the scene, two figures, one claiming to be the Ripplebark Prince bickers with a so-called \"Lord of the Deluge\", seemingly an odd and wildly incorrect re-enactment of one of Vyodros' many adventures, before the \"Lord of the Deluge\" storms off, weeping at their failure to overcome the might and wonder of the Ripplebark Prince. The party tries to move to stop them, but finds the curtain resilient and near indestructible to their efforts to stop the process - and thus are forced to let it play out. As Scene 3 eventually plays out, Alzara uses Subtle Spell to cast Magic Circle on the stage, hoping to stop any further ingress. Further mischief remains afoot, however... - Scene 3 - Partway through the act, the harmless fireball from the stuffed dragon's mouth turns out to be quite real indeed, knocking Kreev unconscious, before E\u00f2in tosses a healing potion with utter delight to Raisuboi on the stage, garnering applause - even when Alzara finds she has to cast Dispel Magic on the dragon's head to prevent it repeating the action, seemingly mid monologue. - Scene 4 - During a montage in the first half of the scene, a gargantuan octopus starts to thrash about on the stage, prompting battle, ink covering the floor. Kreev calls an early intermission to investigate the goings-on, explaining to Ludithas when asked about the dragon that \"something is out to get him\". They decide to change the upcoming \"killing\" of Clove, out of fear of what might occur should it be corrupted. Instead they will just rely on Raisuboi's acting, rather than any magical influence. Ludithas reports the presence of Conjuration and Transmutation magic, but no presence of the caster. Ludithas and Hrornirr are pulled away by E\u00f2in and Ciara starting to share a booth, and so the play continues... - Scene 5 - As Clove/Raisuboi's death scene starts to play out, he feels an ethereal hand grasping at his heart, causing him a great deal of pain - which he tries to play into. Stunned, he is dragged off stage by Kreev and Alzara when the darkness settles in at the end of the scene. Kreev tries to make the best of the situation, persuading Pickle to persevere by describing the meddling as \"someone wanting to help, in their own twisted way\". As Raisuboi heals himself, Pickle steps back onto the stage... - Scene 6, Scene 7 & Scene 8 - Play out without incident, received with quiet reverence by the crowd. - Scene 9 - Met with rapturous standing applause from near all of the crowd gathered, to which the cast return to the stage to take a bow. They are interrupted by a figure, Awen the Witch, who claims to be familiar with all the monarchs, demanding they set aside their pride and embrace Lachlainn Setanta, the High-King, so to stand together in unity against any threat and foe. In the Dawn of Tosima, six kings & queens did reign, their crowns adorned with glory and with might, yet darkness loomed, a sinister campaign, a greater evil will challenge the light. A land veiled in shadows deep and wide, a foe arises, malevolence untamed, a High King, steadfast, may step to lead the stride, to vanquish darkness, honor must be claimed. But pride possessed each monarch's noble heart, their kingdoms strong, yet fragmented by strife, to conquer evil, unity impart, to cast aside their feuds and end the rife. Six kings & queens, their pride must now relinquish true, united 'neath the High King, strength imbue. For when the six kings & queens stand in loyalty, no evil shall defy their united gallantry. Oh, six kings & queens, set aside your pride so true, embrace the High King's destiny, and evil shall be subdued. Lachlainn Setanta calls upon the Kings and Queens to unite their banners to vanquish the threat that sits upon the High King's throne. Let legend and destiny name the true High King. The location of the Stone of F\u00e1l has been found. A buried treasure of long ago. And it lays within the vaults of Valenguard. The the very thing that may unite these lands against the enemy being who would see you squabble and fight. The fate of this land lays within your hands. We pray you do not squander it. Fearghas immediately points fingers at Kreev, remarking the whole play was a clear stunt to claim their crowns, but Ciara speaks in his defence, of an ancient secret that might be rediscovered - in reference to Ana's tarot reading earlier - but Fearghas refuses still. Aislinn seems open to the idea, Artair too, but in a better time and place, while Barra quotes the play, neutral in their response. Nonetheless, resounding applause once again echoes through the theatre, which the party direct towards Kreev. (01/07/2023) - Kaarina 202EF[ ] As the group take a bath, Vanya takes a moment to talk to the Almaraz to see if there is a way to attract more so they can continue to save the species, after learning they have an affinity for bolied eggs raising a debate in how exactly they acquire them in the wild. On the second day they come to a camp led by a Tabaxi, whom Kreev and Dazomar seem to recognise as Song of Paradise; previously of [Bazaars Bizarre](/wiki/Bazaar), whom had left Elderfall after the Carnival was overtaken by a ritual. Song seemingly had left shortly after, hoping to head South to Eskarya with a bunch of beast of burden from the circus. Including an Elephant (which has alot of interest to Dazamor) an Almiraj (of interest to the party) and a rather familiar looking Owlbear, though slightly older. As Vanya checks over the animals health, Ered quickly hands over 750gp to purchase the owlbear that he seems to care and remember. The convince Song to change her plans to detour to Freehearth where more of the animals can be purchased/liberated. As they get into [Gortbaun](/wiki/Gortbaun) on the third day they see the town, struggling with its crops, there is a large cooking pot with Elderfalls sigil on it. As Raisuboi heads over they learn that despite druid intervention any spells to help the crops doesn't seem to hold. They mention that since [Sadanna](/wiki/Sadanna_al-Baahish) left the problems had persisted and the defacto Elder, [Saoirse Caisidei](/wiki/Saoirse_%C3%93_Caisidei) has been trying but failing to improve the issues. The party meet with her as she mentions she has kept the Daos history with the village away from the townsfolk. Vanya tests the water from the stream and it doesn't find any traces of a distinct poison or disease, however there is some oddity that doesn't seem to make it healthy/drinkable. As Ered checks the river he senses the presence of something coming from town. In doing his divine sense again he traces the aura to a tree, which they discover was previously planted by Sadanna. Raisuboi tells Saorise to set a perimeter away from the tree before they can deal with it. As the part plan to burn the tree, in the hopes of the removing the corruption; Vanya hopes to collect so of the sap to investigate as it suddenly begins to uproot itself and bite back. As the party begin to attack the Treeblight the wilted crops about time also begin to uproot themselves as blight hordes. Arania summons a fire elemental to attack. Dazamor jumps onto a building briefly before the treeblight destroys the building knocking Dazamor to the ground and at the mercy of a horde of blighted creatures. As the treeblight continues to swing attacking the rest of the party poisoning some of them. Raisuboi and Aranias elemental manages to burn some of the horde away. Dazomar manages to slow the Treeblight allowing Buck, Kreevs wooden chicken, to peak the blight in half destroying it. As the hordes release a spray of needles Arania falls unconcious before being brought back by Vanya. Ered manages to spot the Seed of Corruption within the Treeblight begin to wrap itself in veins and reanimate itself. Ered takes the tree down for a second time before smiting the heart. But as the hordes remain Kreev sends a mass healing word to his allies before being assailed by the horde, killing him as he is stampeded under foot and bark. As the party continue to try and repel the reaming hordes Raisuboi sends a flaming sphere to deal with the hordes, Dazomar lives out a torrent of acid in anger, Ered continues to lumberjack the hordes and Aranias fire spirit turns them to ash. As Raisuboi and Dazomar run to Kreevs side, he places a diamond on his chest willing his spirit to return. As they wait Vanya begins to check for lingering corruption; while the roots remain they seem dead but still lightly corrupted, the group agree to return to to help dig up the roots in the future after they visit the forest. They regroup taken a short respite as they find a Wand within the Treeblight, Raisuboi keeps it fornow believing it is likely cursed. As they tell the town what happened they find that the river has been diverted; they follow the river down to what looks like a lake bustling with life. Fish, sharks, octopi and giant sea serpents. There seems to be an island in the centre with people onland though hard to make out. As Raisuboi shouts over a figure raises a hand before whistling. One of the sea creatures seems to grow in size and offers them passage. It falls short of the land as they are stranded on the serpants back. As the Locathah address them they say that the fish will not be returning as they dont want to be eaten. They say they will not leave the land as it is sacred, but they are unwilling to divuldge to whom. Though judging by there attire it seems fitting they follow [Mannan](/wiki/Mann%C3%A1n). They name the place The Nursery, though what they are nursing is never revealed. As Kreev questions what is the necessity of this island is, he is asked what God he follows he states Kasialama he is promptly shook off the serpent before being dragged by a Mannar back to the Lake edge. Kreev continues to try and question from the mainland writing questions with major image but is ultimately ignored. The party agree that Gortbaun will not fish or come south to the Nursery anymore; as the Locanth say that security and privacy are of the most importance. Re-iterating that now the corruption has been cleared, crops and fruit will likely return and they can survive off that. The party notice an Almiraj on the island, which Vanya names Gavin. They yeet the Almiraj into the lake before it is scooped up by one of the Mannar and given to the party. The party return to Kreev and mention that they are going to keep the island secret. Heading back to Freehearth they find Song again and proceed to purchase her animals before she leaves East; - Arania and Ered pay for the female Almiraj. - Vanya buys the boar (Boris), goat (, weasel (Kenzington) and badger (Ashewan) - Raisuboi buys the Axebeak for 400gp & free room and board - Dazomar buys the elephant in the hopes of turning it into a Kobold War Machine (16/07/2023) - Kolopa, 202EF[ ] The Group approach the Leyline portal and stood outside of it was Dagda, he greeted the group and offered to guide them through the Leyline, Pickle puts on a show while Arania actually cast the spell, the group step through the portal followed by Dagda and find themselves at a spiritual crossway, Dagda notices that the Spiritual crossroads has been sealed off and now stands as a lone chamber, Dagda begins freaking out that things had changed and they were unable to go where they wanted, they began berating the party and demanding Pickle recast the spell Auxley catches some inconsistencies in Dagda's words and calls attention to it, Raisuboi asks Pickle to stop casting and places a hand on Arania's shoulder as she was actually the one casting the spell Dagda became more erratic and began making threats to the rest of the party, Dagda attacks Kreev and a fight breaks out over the course of the fight the being posing as Dagda is unveiled to be an unknown Archfey who bragged about sabotaging Kreev's play. After Pickle dealt the finishing blow to the imposter a spindly being tried to force it's way out of their mouth but the imposter held it in and vanished, after discovering that they can now get out of the Leylines the group leave for Port Arden as planned and land in Leyline station of the college of Oghma, heading to the Arden Ridge mine the party find the entrance barricaded with guards stationed outside. After announcing themselves and their intent the party are given access to the mines after passing a few dead guards the group encounter an Umberhulk and a pack of Mud Mephits, the party dispatch of their challengers and drag the dead to the exit so that they may be recovered and buried properly, the party then head further down into the mine using an elevator that Kreev created a gear for, as they reach the bottom of the mineshaft they find the ground littered with the skeletons of dead miners, after a brief search the group are encountered by Sadanna al-Baahish. The wicked Dao engages the group, summoning minions to fight the party Sadanna engages Ered and takes many hits he then traps Ered in a stone wall to gain some distance and triggers an earthquake, Ered breaks free and the party flee the mines, taking constant hits from falling debris the party reach the top of the mine shaft wounded, Auxley and Raio grab Kreev and fly to the exit and Kreev orders the Guards to help the party escape, Auxley begins shepherding the rest of the party out till just Raisuboi and Pickle are left, Raisuboi pumps his last healing word into Pickle and is knocked out by falling rubble Pickle feeds him a healing potion and pulls him to his feet and Auxley returns on Raio flying them both to safety. (20/8/2023) - Val, 202EF[ ] The party sets off, belabored on several bridges by Illinois's repeated portents of doom and gloom when they cross, which Vanya is forced to rebut with augury. Nevertheless, upon crossing another bridge, they are met by a young boy, who passes them a letter, an angry one, from a dragon whom the party have met on prior occasions, demanding both gold and flesh. After a moment of discussion, Maeve decides to defer the request to Dazomar, and the party sends that back to the group. The party continues on to town, where they meet several people washing graffiti about the Void, and certain praises. After asking around, the party is introduced to Atrio, the village elder, who mentions how he receives a different symbol spray-painted on his house, a symbol which Maeve identifies as meaning danger. The party decides to stake out the evening and then visit the church to see what's going on. The party waits in town, with Illionois and Rix taking positions on the roof. Vanya, distraught by the lack of pillows in the inn, also decides to wait outside. She strikes up a conversation with nearby owls, who promise her that the entertainment is about to begin, and that the acolytes will be trying not to get caught. Meanwhile, Illinois and Rynros spy some fellows in owl masks, as Vanya begins to chase after them cawing and Maeve and Ered join the case. Rix begins to try and read their minds as Illinois swoops down on one with shadowy wings, catching him with aid from Maeve's entangle. The others use magical rings to disappear. Coel takes the ring from the captured owl, Jacob. Vanya attempts to convince him the only way to regain his stolen honor is to collaborate with them in playing a trick on his comrades, but he demands his ring back first. Illinois refuses to cooperate and calls himself an agent of the void, which clearly terrifies Jacob. Eventually, he wriggles free and runs away, hooting, as Illinois heads to bed. Everyone agrees to go to the Church in the morning. In the morning, they go to the Church, being invited in to a sermon in a packed cathedral. Vanya attempts to follow through on the plan to convince Jacob to challenge for the position of High Trickster, as the rest of the party chews out the incumbent High Trickster for the harmful pranks he plays upon the people of the town. Then, a member of the Church of Vyodros appears, Farva, who calls the High Trickster, Yozra, a heretical follower of Vyodros. He demands the congregation repent or face his judgment, but only one priest, Ephra, does. The party intervenes, but generally refrains from combat as Yozra and Farva trade blows with Vyolnir and psychic blasts. Illinois does end up hitting Favra, but he requests penance, which is granted. The party's efforts are mostly focused on getting the people to safety, which they manage with the help of some holes in the wall. Ered holds the door to stop Farva's reinforcements from entering, and Jacob and Yozra are barely able to escape. With the tricksters gone, Farva is frustrated, and explains to the party that the Tricksters play tricks on people until they snap, and then call them servants of the void before killing them. Farva says they have done this to two towns already, and by speaking to the Owls, Vanya learns that they arrived covered in blood. As a result, she sends the owls, accompanied by Skippy, to spy on Yozra and his band of tricksters, waiting to see where they strike next. (27/08/23) - Aldwar, 202EF[ ] Before the group leave for Glenmara Kreev takes Dazomar aside, adding the Honorary Pin to his locating bracelet. Vanya informs Dazomar that the red dragon has potentially been subverted to his lair by the way of Maives letter, to which he immediately sends a letter to Pumperkickel and his kobolds to hide within the treasure room for their safety, atleast until he returns. Pickle hangs posters around town informing the folk of his safety bunker should any surprise threats make themselves present. On the journey Cucumber, Pickles dire wolf, displays the begins of domestication, though still very wild at heart. On their way north they pass a camp noticed by Vanya. As they approach they find that the seem to have a captive Badgerfolk in the wagon. The group introduce themselves as mercenaries, Valarian, Lawrence, Yarn, Melkure whom have caputred an Insurgent, Cynogthorn, thought the badgerfolk didnt see it that way. After striking up conversation they mercenaries share their camp and rations with the group, recognising a few of them from stories of their adventures. Whilst talking Vanya notices a bluebird that seems to flydown into the cage with the Badgerfolk, word quickly gets around to the party (excluding the mercenaries) that their may be an attempted jailbreak. Kreev begins to tell a story to thank the group for sharing his meal. As they are distracted a band of people slowly move their way up. They are however heard by Auxley, Pickle and Dazomar, as Auxley entangles on of them with his korrods hair. Pickle somewhat conflicted by his role as a Sheriff joins them and begins to follow the tracks of the jail breakees. As his location is quickly given up the mercenaries manage to tackle him to the ground. And Vanya finds another hiding on the side of the horse. With them captured they make a plea, first to be handed over to Sheriff Pickle and the party for a price to appease the mercenaires. Then they ask if they are able to atleast explain their side of the story. The story begins; about a king; A King that would stand on a stone to bring everyone together, to bring and end to the shadows. They barbinger the true harsh dangers to the world. These winged creatures are so called angels but they are not the leaders. One king will rise to unite the people and bring an end to them. But when one true king rises, others will fall. The true king is one born from Gods. This plane was built by men by the helps of said gods. And that the gods as we have known them used to be human. And as humans do they have children, and those children have children, and so the descendent of Gods can live amongst us. This true King or Queen may not know of their ancient heritage or blood lineage, their godlyness lost with time. This brings fear into the minds of current leaders, Kings and Queens across the land, who are unwilling or unable to relinquish their leadership,control or protection. And so they are unwilling to allow the prophecy to come to pass. A king/queen would stand upon a stone. And the Stone would laugh. The Stone of Destiny. And they will be named the true king. His story seems to sway some of the party, Mainly Kreev and Vanya. Auxley pays the 600gp bounty to have the prisoners released. At which point Cynogthorn thanks his captures for treating him kindly and then speaks to the party. Kreev resights a prophecy of his own past to him by the Wyrdsinger College which seems to insight new interest in them as they suggest either the stone or something of significance is under a tree far North. They tell the party they should travel to a village a days walk from Glenmara to meet with the Oracle that may Illuminate them further. Grateful they go on their way. The party talk of prophecies and stories to varying degrees of opinion on the power of such things and of destiny. As the make it inside the walls of Glenmara they meet with the Elder; a half-elf named Gwyndaf Erwood asking about the attacks on lifestock. The animals seem to be left ravaged, drained of blood, with puncture wounds on their necks but otherwise in fair/still edible condition. Leaving them to believe it is likely a vampire of sorts. As they investigate further Dazomar is forced to leave as word returns from his lair/kobolds that require greater attention. Upon leaving however, he finds Raisuboi, who travelled to meet the group in a hurry riding on his Axebeak. He mentions that Queen Ciara Highland has been running emergency evacuation drills as farms not far from Freehearth seems torched to the ground. He instructs that once our buisness is done hear we should return home as fast as possible. With a more sense of urgency they continue investigations. Vanya talks to the cows. They talk that the creatur is quite quiet, sneaks up pretty well. Pickle finds potential tracks leaing into nearby woodland. Vanya uses Speak with Plants, the plant seems more preoccupied about being in sunlight than proveding tangible answers. But eventually they are lead to a smattering of (what they believe to be) cows blood. Pickle asks Cucumber to follow the trail which occurs a heavy bounty from the semi-trained wolf. On their way to a cave clearing, Kreev finishes his story from earlier; about two young lovers; one of which turned into a vampire spawn tries to cut the relationshp short to protect the other, But their love, and her new vampiric urges are to great causing them to spend a day together and ending with her feeding on him and the lovers dying together watching the sunrise as she turns to ash. As they make their way towards a cave and are immediately told to turn away but persons unseen. It becomes obvious that the voice does not want to hurt them but feels he is unable to control himself. He has been feeding on the lifestock to try and sate himself and protect the town from himself. Noticing a growing nervousness and angst Raisuboi sends his Axebeak into the cave to allow the vampire to feed and keep himself from harming the party. The giantkin introduces himself as Ukohr. Seeing that he is desperately holding onto his humanity the party arent willing to slay him and scramble to come up with a solution; potentially informing the town whom he is and that he means no harm, and that he could essentially become a butcher, feeding on the lifestock and allow them to use the meat but issues arise of the possibility of such things and the longevity of such a task. Eventually Urkhor elects to walk into the sun, he is asked on who did this to him; Which he explains as a Dark haired, Darkened robes and Dark skinned man whom demanded his servitude and that he would join his masters army. He is then questioned on nicer thing and nicer memories, such as his brothers and sisters, Deri, Rhodri & Dewey as he walks into the sunlight. Last prayers are given, Raisuboi collects ashes and finds a ring. Pickle manages to read the rings past and finds that the Vampire that turned him was none other than [Azar](/wiki/Azar_Toraven)! A previous companion and founder of Freehearth whom dissapeared under mysterious circumstances. Confused the party return to Glenmara to explain the 'issue' has been resolved. In lew of payment Pickle is offered a book about Kol, Called the Wild Hunt. On their way home Auxley spots a red Dragonborn-like figure in the road. He shouts to the party and failing to spot an immediate danger aside from the obvious sketchy individual they approach. He explains he is to deliver a message from The Red Dread, The Vale blazer, Kildrid. The message needn't be delivered by words as one person can simply, crawl home, with broken eyes and broken spirit. Quickly Trees fall and begin to burn as the trap is sprung as hoards of half dragons rise from hidden trenches to join Kordyn to fight the party. Some of the party are trapped under the tress but manage to navigate themselves out. Auxley casts Wall of Sand to slow one of the hoards. The fight itself is slow and grueling, Raisuboi is seperated from the party and left to contend with one hoard himself. Many of the party are only kept in the fight by Vanyas healing abilities as Pickle and Auxey chip away at the hordes defences. Kordyn is hit but regenerates as quickly as he is harmed leaving the party contemplatng running. Eventually the battle starts to shift in the partys favour but not before Kreev is killed by the hoard. Auxley manages to kill Kordyn, as he slit his throat and the party slowly cut down the last of the half dragons. Raisuboi revives Kreev to show the last remaining half dragons that they failed to send their message. Auxley ties the last one up for Pickle to finish. They mourn the lose of Cucumber, the last casualty off the fight before they can move on. Netherless the message is cleary recieved, as they recognised they barely survived what was even potentially just a skirmish party and not a true reflection of Kildreds true force. The party soon realise that is was Ojiros farm that had been torched. With Ojiro is nowhere to be found. "}
