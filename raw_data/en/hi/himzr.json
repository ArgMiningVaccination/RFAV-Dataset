You may have heard some misinformation about the vaccines' safety and effectiveness on social media or from people you know. To help you separate fact from fiction, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina Medical Directors are breaking down some of the most common myths. Fact: It's true that the COVID-19 vaccines were developed at a rapid pace. But they were rigorously tested for safety and effectiveness. In approving the vaccines, the FDA made sure that they are as safe as possible. Because of the pandemic, vaccine development benefited from generous federal funding and many volunteer subjects. Scientists also had a head start in developing vaccines for similar viruses. Many years of research laid the foundation for the development of COVID-19 vaccines. Fact: Some conspiracy theories say the Pfizer vaccine contains a tracking microchip planted by the U.S. government. In reality, the vaccine has only 10 ingredients, none of which are capable of surveilling the American public. The [ingredients are commonly found in everyday medications](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/12/12/pfizer-covid-vaccine-ingredient-list-nothing-too-surprising-there/6520511002/) and vaccines you've seen before. The active ingredient in the Pfizer vaccine is a messenger RNA (mRNA). It works by preparing your immune system to fight off an infection if you come into close contact to someone who has COVID-19. Fact: The approved vaccines went through large clinical trials. Medical professionals have [administered millions of doses](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/) of the COVID-19 vaccines. Testing showed vaccines are [safe and more than 94% effective](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577). It is true that we don't yet have data about potential long-term effects of the vaccine. However, experts such as Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, are confident of the safety of the vaccine. Like with all vaccines, the FDA will continue to monitor for safety. Fact: The [COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html). After getting a COVID-19 vaccine, some people may have a soreness in their arm, fever or tiredness. This is normal and is a good sign that the body is building immunity to protect you from COVID-19. The CDC says side effects may feel like the flu. It may affect your ability to do daily activities, but side-effects should go away in a few days. To learn more about potential side effects, [visit the CDC's website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html). Fact: The vaccine cannot cause COVID-19. Instead, it prepares your immune system to recognize and fight the infection. Experts say that side effects are a result of your immune system responding. This is often a sign that the vaccine is working. As you continue your research, remember to look to credible sources rather than social media comments.
