Exemptions from one or more vaccines will be granted for medical reason upon certification by a physician that there is a medical reason for not administering the vaccine. Exemptions for personal or religious reasons will be granted upon request of the parent or legal guardian. To request an exemption, a parent or guardian must submit a signed COE that the parent/guardian has either a philosophical, personal, or religious objection to the immunization of the child. Forms must include a statement to be signed by a health care practitioner stating that he or she provided the parent/guardian with information about the benefits and risks of immunization to the child. The form may be signed by a health care practitioner at any time prior to the enrollment of the child in a school or licensed day care. Photocopies of the signed form or a letter from the health care practitioner will be accepted in lieu of the original form. Any parent or legal guardian of the child who exempts the child due to religious beliefs is not required to have a COE signed by a health care practitioner if the parent or legal guardian demonstrates on the COE membership in a religious body or a church in which the religious beliefs or teachings of the church preclude a health care practitioner from providing medical treatment to the child. Students with exemptions will be identified in the system for easy notification should the local department of health order that exempted students be excluded from school temporarily during an outbreak or an epidemic.

If the parent requests a hearing, the parent or guardian and school principal will be notified in writing of the time and place for the hearing and will present the case to a hearing officer appointed by the superintendent.
