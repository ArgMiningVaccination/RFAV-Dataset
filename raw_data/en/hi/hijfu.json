The classes will be held at a conveniently located Group Health Facility. | Active Comparator: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction | Participants randomized to the MBSR arm will attend eight weekly 2 hour MBSR sessions. | Behavioral: Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction | The Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction Classes will be delivered in 8 weekly classes each lasting 2 hours. | No Intervention: Usual Care | Participants randomized to Usual Care will continue to receive care for their low back pain as prescribed by his/her Primary Care Physician. - Back pain-related dysfunction [ Time Frame: 26 weeks ]Back-related dysfunction will be measured with the modified Roland Disability Questionnaire (\"Roland scale\"), which asks whether 23 specific activities were limited due to back pain during the past week (yes or no). This measure has been found to be reliable, valid and sensitive to clinical changes and is appropriate for telephone administration and patients with moderate disability. - Bothersomeness of back pain [ Time Frame: 26 weeks ]Symptom bothersomeness will be measured by asking participants to rate how \"bothersome\" their back pain has been during the previous week on a 0 to 10 scale (0 = \"not at all bothersome\" and 10 = \"extremely bothersome\"). This question worked well in our previous trials and is highly correlated with a 0-10 measure of pain intensity (r=0.8 to 0.9). It is also highly correlated with measures of function and other outcome measures. Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.
