As a full-service family physician, I and many of my colleagues feel this crisis on a daily basis. Although this editorial focuses on the family medicine crisis, I acknowledge that our specialist colleagues, in many cases, are also worried about the future of their disciplines. As family physicians, we regularly navigate the health care system on behalf of our patients. Every day, I search the Pathways website to find specialists who will be able to see my patients in a timely fashion. It seems that specialists in cer- tain disciplines are also leaving private practice for settings that do not involve them running an office with overhead costs. In my community, there are no psychiatrists in private practice. They all work in the hospital or mental health units funded by the health authority. There are fewer general internal medicine specialists in office-based practices in our community as well. They can be found working hard in our hospital CCU, medical wards, and outpatient clinics at our hospital. We no longer have an office-based dermatologist in our community. In fact, we have no dermatologist in our com-munity, period. Physician Master Agreement negotiations between Doctors of BC and the BC govern- ment are underway at the time of writing. I believe that the crisis in family medicine in BC is going to get much worse unless drastic measures are taken very soon. I have heard that the nurses' and teachers' unions are preparing to strike, which means that the BC government is having to look at the bigger picture. They need to look at the big picture of the health care needs of all their citizens, including their teach- ers and nurses, who all need family physicians. Twenty-five years ago, the government in- troduced something called prorationing. When expenditures for medical services ran over bud - get, the government clawed back money from physicians. In response, the then-BC Medi- cal Association introduced reduced activity days, where family doctors closed their offices, and anesthesiologists did not work on elective surgeries, effectively shutting down operating rooms on those days. There was public outcry, and eventually prorationing was stopped. Twenty years ago, after agreeing to binding arbitration with doctors, the BC government passed a bill in the legislature to cancel the agreement, after a well-reasoned and fair judg- ment by a retired chief justice of the BC Su- preme Court went in favor of doctors. Doctors were incensed, and gradually and increasingly withdrew services (does anybody remember education days?), until another agreement was reached. Today, doctors are again, in effect, with- drawing office-based family medicine services by going to work as hospitalists or UPCC phy- sicians, or retiring earlier than planned, or just working less. I hope that the government and Doctors of BC realize the magnitude of the problem and can come up with meaningful ways to solve it. I will leave you with a song, sung to the tune of \"Where have all the flowers gone,\" with apolo- gies to Pete Seeger. In case you're not famil- iar with the tune, here it is: https://youtu.be/ bI3QVsW30j0. Where have all the fam docs gone, long time passing? Where have all the fam docs gone, long time ago?

The association's first president, Sir Charles Tupper, was a founding father and the first and last physician-prime minister. Unlike provincial associations, the CMA is not involved in remunerative negotiations. It is free to critique government policies that clash with the needs of patients and health workers without fear of reprisals from its de facto employer. About 15 years ago, I was elected CMA president. The CMA staff I encountered were extremely impressive and knowledgeable. They and the elected delegates welcomed and supported me in my mission to create a bet- ter system for all. My years there were hectic, productive, and filled with optimism. Canadian doctors lack the political influ- ence that doctors in Britain enjoy. I attended the British Medical Association's 2008 annual meeting in my birth town of Liverpool. Tom Sackville had been a junior health minister un- der Margaret Thatcher. He revealed that the Iron Lady feared confrontation with doctors, remarking, \"She fearlessly took on Gorbachev and the Red Army and asserted her will over Ronald Reagan; she decimated the power of the British trade unions; she ordered the British Navy, with heir to the throne Prince Andrew on board, to the South Atlantic to engage Argen- tina in war. She drew the line at waging battle against the BMA.\" There is no such fear of the CMA by our government. Governments avoid controversial pol- icy issues. That's why decisions on abortion, same-sex marriage, assisted dying, prisoners' rights, safe-injection sites, and medicare have ended up in the courts. A 2007 independent study on the costs of waiting for care revealed the economic cost of waiting across just four provinces was $14.8 bil- lion. Long wait times impose both medical and monetary harms on patients and the economy. The CMA: Something needs to change The calculations did not include waiting from GP to specialist consultation, nor the long-term costs of chronic irreversible harms, drug addic- tion, and depression. Other studies estimated that mental illness cost our economy $51 billion in just 1 year. We pay to prevent patients from being treated, and shorter wait lists would actu- ally save money. Preventive medicine should not mean preventing patients from being treated. We also advocated for wait-time guarantees and patient-focused (activity-based) funding (both will soon be policy in Quebec). Dr Barry Turchen presented a study at the CMA using BC's Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (despite government opposition). He found that administrative costs in BC's system were 16%, representing 6 to 7 times what was claimed, and over 3 times that of US public Medicare. An earlier report by Commissioner Judi Korbin had pointed out that 80% of all new health care jobs in BC were in middle management. During my tenure, Dr John Haggie (CMA president, 2011), put forward a motion at the CMA asking that Canada's Auditors General investigate such costs. They did not respond. Dr Haggie later became Newfoundland and Labrador's Minister of Health and, so far, has not ordered such a review in his province. My time at the CMA taught me a great deal about the health disparities between different communities in Canada. We did succeed in pres- suring governments to train more health work - ers in Canada. That was too little and too late. Last year I surveyed former CMA leaders on their thoughts on the state of our system and how the CMA was performing. Almost all respondents opined that the CMA had lost influence with doctors and government. It was not reaching out to its grassroots membership and was enjoying its new status as a very wealthy entity after the sale of MD Financial Manage- ment to Scotiabank for almost $3 billion. The following CMA policy preceded my tenure: \"When timely access to care cannot be provided in the public health care system the Editorials patient should be able to utilize private health insurance to reimburse the cost of care obtained in the private sector.\" Yet the CMA refused to participate in a constitutional case aimed at making its own policies on health insurance and freedom to practise matters of government policy. Its membership among practising physicians has dropped and, sadly, given the CMA's historical roots in Quebec, the Quebec affiliate has dis- banded. Doctors of BC has ended compulsory membership. For what I believe was the first time in its long history, the CMA recently suspend- ed a member, denying them the chance to stand in a democratic election for nominee as president-elect. The courts overturned the sus- pension and awarded substantial costs against the CMA. The CMA's action appears to dem- onstrate a lack of concern for the democrat- ic process and members' assets. Its $3 billion windfall means it does not need to consider its members, nor does it need their annual dues to remain viable. Our 1926 BCMA president, Dr J.H. Mac- Dermot, warned: \"Our noble tradition that no sick person of any age, sex, race, or religion whatsoever, shall ever suffer for need of medical care . . . should be based on our willingness to give. . . . It should not be exploited: nor should it be assumed as a God-given right. . . . Least of all should it be a right-of-way for needy and penurious governmental and administrative bodies.\" Dr MacDermot's warning has become a reality. Patients and their doctors are now con- trolled and dominated by the state. I am concerned about the CMA's lack of action and support for doctors, their patients, and the democratic process. Something needs to change, and I see some hope in light of the current impressive elected presidential line. But they need democratic grassroots support and input. Let's give them what they need. n \u2014Brian Day, MB247 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 6 | July/august 2022247 distribution of adult infectious diseases ser- vices in BC. I am the medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre in down- town Vancouver. Our three physicians and three nurses (and other support staff ) are dedicated to the development and evaluation of systems of care for inner-city residents living with HIV, HCV, and other chronic medical conditions, including cellulitis, endocarditis, and osteo- myelitis, to name a few. We offer services in both French and English. We also have a novel \"community pop-up clinic\" model, conducted once a week at selected single-room-occupancy buildings in the inner city, interacting with men and women (many with untreated HIV and/ or HCV infection) who are often disengaged from care. Our team congratulates the BC Medical Journal for highlighting the importance of the infectious diseases community in our province. Following in the footsteps of Dr Chow's pio- neering work to develop our specialty, it is a privilege to have developed our centre to serve the most vulnerable among us. \u2014Brian Conway, MD, FRCPC Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centrere: Where have all the family doctors gone? It is with sadness and frustration that I reply to Dr Suzanne Montemuro's letter in the BCMJ [2022;64:105-106], \"Where have all the family doctors gone?\" She chose to bring up the issue of physician remuneration as one reason there is a shortage of family doctors. On this issue I agree. Howev- er, her letter implies that specialists, in particular ophthalmologists, are overpaid. On this issue I completely disagree. I argue that family doctors are underpaid. I don't know of any Canadian physician who feels overpaid. Ever. Unless Dr Montemuro has experience with a successful application to a specialty residency program, successful completion of a Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada program, and experience practis- ing as a surgical specialist, then I feel she is in no way qualified to imply that specialists are overpaid. I would be happy to have Dr Mon- temuro visit my office and surgery day so I may demonstrate to her some of the challenges and stressors, as well as the costs of my equipment and overhead, which are also 40% like hers. If she then still feels that I am overpaid, so be it. I acquired my licence to perform family practice during my training and worked walk-in clinic shifts during residency to help pay my way through ophthalmology training. I feel I have enough experience to fairly state that family doctors are underpaid. Period. There is no need to imply that specialists are overpaid. This creates animosity among physicians. Ex- actly what some politicians want. Instead, we need to support the areas of family practice that require help, including remuneration. \u2014Robert Semeniuk, MD, FRCSC Ophthalmologist, Penticton re: the subspecialty of adult infectious diseases It was a pleasure to read Dr Chow's perspective on the subspecialty of adult infectious diseases in British Columbia [BCMJ 2022;64:155-159]. I met him as a trainee in 1986 and I can attest to the fact that he is one of the founding fa- thers of our specialty in Canada and a mentor to many of us.

While there will always be conflict and people who disagree, imagine a world with more awareness, consonance, and trust. Imagine a world where we lead with courage. As humans and as physicians, we have a daily choice in how we show up in our clinical envi-ronments, our personal lives, and the world in general. Our internal compass, emotional regu- lation, and cognizance can remarkably alter our course and the way in which we participate in life. Equally, our environment can influence our ability to choose how we engage. If we regularly face conflict, adversarial approaches, and toxic environments, it can hinder our progress. On the flip side, if we are surrounded by support, irre-spective of the adversity of the landscape, odds are that we will survive, perhaps even flourish. Fostering daily commitments to be collegial, to lead with love and responsibility, to engage with like-minded individuals, and to respect those with differing opinions are all examples of how many of you choose to show up every day. They are also actions that require coura- geous leadership. I am not ignorant to the en-vironment or culture we are confronted with; however, if we embody a mindset that allows us to show up differently, perhaps others will have the courage to do the same. It takes a consistent, conscious effort to cul- tivate, shape, or co-create a harmonious culture. But it is possible. It requires us to self-reflect and to challenge ourselves and our under- standing of our intentions. It requires us to be authentic, resilient, emotionally intelligent, self-disciplined, and committed. And it requires us to lead with courage. All of these things we are capable of doing. Each of you shows up for your patients this way every day. We are at a critical juncture; while the world around us may seem like it is falling apart, I see an opportunity to look within and come together. An evolu - tion of courageous leadership into a collective consciousness could liberate our profession and create revolutionary positive impact. As William James said, \"Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does.\" What we do makes a difference to our patients, to each other, and to our health care system. And today we have the power to make a real difference, to be part of the systemic change we have been asking for. Today we have the power to lead with courage, to make positive change a reality, and to create a system\u2014a world\u2014with more humanity. n \u2014Ramneek Dosanjh, MD Doctors of BC President 249 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 6 | July/august 2022249WorksafEBC Some physicians report significant de- lays or denial of payment for their Initial Expedited Comprehensive Consulta- tions (19911). According to recent data from WorkSafeBC, a top reason for this is missing or illegible consult reports. When your 19911 is submitted to Work- SafeBC, the system automatically searches for proof of a consult report. If the system is unable to find such a report, the 19911 is reviewed manually by WorkSafeBC, which may result in payment delays. If WorkSafeBC is unable to find the appropriate consult report, it may result in a payment rejection. When to bill a 19911 fee The Initial Expedited Comprehensive Consul- tation (19911) fee may be billed when: The physician has received a new referral for consultation from a referring physician or from WorkSafeBC (on behalf of the re - ferring community physician), including when the consultation occurs as a result of an emergency. More than 6 months have lapsed since the physician last saw the injured worker and the physician has received a new referral. The Initial Expedited Comprehensive Consultation report must be received by WorkSafeBC within 15 business days from the referral. Details on billing Initial Expedited Comprehensive Consultations can be found in the Physicians and Surgeons' WorkSafeBC Services Reference Guide at www.worksafebc .com/en/health-care-providers/provider-types/ physicians.Tips for billing Initial Expedited Comprehensive Consultations (19911) Please note that physicians with a Royal College specialty, apart from anesthesiologists, should bill fee code 19911. Anesthesiologists should use fee code 19934 for the initial ex- pedited consult, and family physicians with areas of expertise (e.g., sports medicine, diving medicine, addictions medicine, family practice anesthesia) should use fee code 19945. Billing 19911 tips A new WorkSafeBC Physician Consult Report Fax Cover Sheet (Form 83D556) can be found on WorkSafeBC's website to fax with your consult report to Work - SafeBC at 1 888 922-8807. Physicians can use this cover sheet to submit their consult reports\u2014this is voluntary and is meant to help physicians reduce their related pay - ment rejections and delays. The new fax cover sheet tags and identi - fies your report for easier payment. The consult report should be sent as soon as possible and must be sent before your billing for 19911. Clearly document the worker's claim number on all pages of your report. If you choose not to use the new fax cover sheet: Clearly note \"Consult Report\" and the worker's claim number on your fax cover sheet. The consult report should be sent as soon as possible and must be sent before your billing for 19911. Clearly document the worker's claim number on all pages of your report. Ensure your documentation is legible; typed reports are recommended. Consult reports must be comprehensive and must be documented in keeping with professional standards (according to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia's practice standard on medical records documentation). Label your consult reports, and fax them separately from OR reports. Ensure any consult report transcribed by the hospital has been faxed to WorkSafeBC at 1 888 922-8807. While a claim is pending acceptance by WorkSafeBC, physicians do not need to wait for approval from WorkSafeBC to expedite the initial consult. Please see the patient as soon as possible to ensure the consultation and report are completed and received by WorkSafeBC within 15 business days to meet time - lines for payment. However, for pending claims, subsequent visits beyond the initial consultation may not be covered by WorkSafeBC. Please obtain the claim number from the worker or from the referring physician and mark it on your consult report and fax cover sheet.

Funded by a grant from the UBC Strategic Investment Fund, the website was created to provide a knowledge hub to support the clinical care of patients, re- search, and education. It became an invaluable tool for province-wide communication during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandem- ic.1 The utility of the virtual surgical network is exemplified by a popular new video feature through which surgeons can share strategies, techniques, and innovations in surgical care seamlessly across the province [Figure 1]. Buoyed by the success of UBC Reticu- lum, the UBC Division of General Surgery adapted the website as a platform for a new Hamish Hwang, MD, FRCSC, FACS, FACS General Surgeons of British Columbia launches province- wide peer mentorship program The UBC Reticulum website was launched in May 2019 to help connect general surgeons in British Columbia. Now with the help of industry funding, General Surgeons of BC has launched a province-wide peer mentorship grant program. Dr Hwang is a clinical associate professor at the University of British Columbia and associate head of the UBC Division of General Surgery. Dr Sampath is a clinical assistant professor at UBC and head of the Division of General Surgery at Richmond Hospital. Dr Morad Hameed is an associate professor of surgery and critical care medicine at UBC and head of the UBC Division of General Surgery. This article has been peer reviewed.province-wide mentorship grant program, which launched in January 2022. Surgeons can self-declare interest in mentoring their peers on a procedure-specific basis, on a searchable section of the site [Figure 2]. The intent of the mentorship program is to universally improve access to and quality of surgical care across the province by creating opportunities for peer mentoring and coaching. Barriers to peer mentorship include loss of clinical time, travel expenses, and administrative costs. The mentorship grant aims to remove these barriers for any general surgeon in the province who identifies a willing mentor or wishes to undertake a mentorship project as a mentee. Funding comes from General Surgeons of BC, a Section of Doctors of BC, as well as from indus- try sponsors. At the time the program launched, sponsors included BD, Ethicon, Medtronic, Pen- dopharm, and Stryker. Surgeons approved for a grant receive funding equivalent to the Doctors of BC specialist sessional rate for administra- tive preparation, such as applying for temporary privileges, nonclinical meetings between mentor and mentee, travel costs, accommodation, and weekday time away from clinical practice. FIGUrE 1. Screenshot of the searchable repository of user-posted videos on the UBC r eticulum website.251 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 6 | July/august 2022251 sPECial fEaturE Examples of mentorships include one sur- geon visiting another to see how a surgical procedure is done or having a mentor visit to give feedback on how a procedure could be improved. Other possibilities include review of recorded videos for surgical coaching or live feedback during broadcasted intraoperative vid- eos. The Royal College of Physicians and Sur- geons has a framework in which both mentor and mentee surgeons can obtain Maintenance of Certification credits for these activities. The first recipient of a UBC Reticulum Mentorship Grant was Dr Nicole Robbins, a general surgeon in Williams Lake. She spent a week with the colorectal surgery team at St. Paul's Hospital. Here are some of her comments about the program: \"The access to the program in terms of low administrative burden is great. In many pro- grams or grants for physicians the paperwork burden is onerous and becomes a disincentive to apply. \"Access to CME has been especially chal- lenging since COVID. I really appreciated the chance to be hands-on in the OR and present to listen to the discussion and teaching of senior learners such as fellows. \"The chance to work again with surgical profs from residency was wonderful. Everyone was welcoming. I thought often of how isolated rural surgeons can be in the OR. I was envious at times of the five or so surgeons and trainees who were all contributing or learning from some of the more complex cases. \"When I was completing my residency (finished in 2010) the number of laparoscopic bowel resections being done was minimal, and as a senior resident we did not receive much training as it was reserved for staff or fellows. It was, therefore, helpful to focus on these pro- cedures and ask questions again. \"I can see how doing a mentorship like this could be a way of helping with rural surgeon burnout and help with recruitment and reten- tion in community sites. Also, inviting subspe- cialized surgeons to community ORs would then become easier and less intimidating.\" Surgeons from around the province have already begun to follow Dr Robbins' lead in exploring a diversity of mentorship and techni - cal coaching opportunities. FIGUrE 2. Screenshot of a sample search for mentors by procedure.

Book review: Your inside guide to the emergency department: And how to prevent having to go! By Dr Fred Voon. Frie- senPress, 2021. ISBN: 142 pages. This 142-page book with a self-explanatory title has been written with Canadian patients in mind. The author is an emergency physician in Victoria, BC. Part 1 lays out what patients should expect to encounter if they've decided to attend the emergency department. Part 2 outlines frequent patient frustrations, includ- ing wait times, and offers guidance about when to visit the emergency department and how to decide if a visit is required. Part 3 delves into an emergency department's physical layout and describes the professionals who work there. Part 4, the bulk of the book, is devoted to home remedies for common symptoms and condi- tions. Appendices and glossaries define terms used in the book, and references are included. Dr Voon, using easily understood language in conversational form, has done a commend-able job of advising patients how a Canadian emergency department functions and what to expect, and not expect, when visiting. While the book's title suggests that readers may dis- cover strategies to prevent a visit, less than three pages are devoted to a discussion of alternatives to an emergency-department visit, and while health information phone lines (e.g., 811) are discussed, there is no discussion of common alternatives such as walk-in or urgent care clin - ics, or telemedicine. Additionally, undermining the hopeful tenor of the title is the following disclaimer in the foreword: \"Even if the in- formation in this book suggests medical at- tention is not needed, readers who think they have an emergency medical concern can and should go their nearest Emergency Depart- ment (ED) or call an ambulance. If in doubt, get checked out!\" This medicolegal disclaimer reflects an important truth understood by all emergency-department personnel: it is tough to know which patients really need the services of the emergency department prior to workup. Of course, a 142-page paperback cannot be exhaustive; authors of concise guides must make the hard choice to exclude certain ma- terial if critical topics are to receive adequate treatment. In this regard, it is intriguing to note that while two pages are devoted to the home diagnosis and reduction of nursemaid's elbow, there is no discussion of the critical role of the emergency department in assisting patients with mental-health crises. Nor is there guid- ance as to how patients living in proximity to more than one hospital should decide which one to visit, or a discussion of the charges facing uninsured or out-of-province patients. Setting those concerns aside, Dr Voon has written a book that is fun to read and offers an insider's perspective that patients will appreci- ate. In particular, I see it as a useful addition to clinic or emergency-department waiting rooms, where our long-suffering patients wait their turn and ponder why it is taking so long. \u2014David Esler, MD, CCFP(EM) Dr Esler has practised emergency medicine in and around Vancouver for 34 years.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Canada and worldwide. In BC, seven people die of lung cancer every day. With 70% of all cases currently diagnosed at an advanced stage, the Lung Screening Pro- gram aims to detect lung cancer at an earlier stage, when treatment is more effective. Lung screening involves a low-dose com- puted tomography (LDCT) scan of the lungs. A network of lung-screening sites has been es- tablished across BC within each health authority using existing CT equipment within hospitals. The scan takes less than 10 seconds and is not painful. Patients do not need to take any medica- tions or receive any needles for this test. After a patient's LDCT scan, a radiologist with expertise in early diagnosis will review the images taken at a designated reading site located within the patient's health authority. A computer-assisted diagnostic tool and standardized reporting for- mat will be used to improve consistency and accuracy of reading and recommendation. Re- sults of the patient's lung scan will be sent to the patient and their primary care provider. Who is eligible for lung screening? Lung screening is best for those who are at high risk for lung cancer and who are not experienc- ing any symptoms. This includes people who: Are 55 to 74 years of age. Currently smoke or have previously smoked. Have a smoking history of 20 years or more. Interested individuals can self-refer directly to the screening program. Primary care provid- ers can encourage eligible patients to call the Lung Screening Program (1 877 717-5864) to complete a risk assessment over the phone to confirm their screening eligibility. A fax referral option is also available (referral form accessible through the Health Professionals link below). Role of primary care providers Primary care providers play an important role in the Lung Screening Program, including: Supporting patients with their decision making and recommending lung screening when appropriate. Providing smoking cessation pharmaco - therapy support. Providing follow-up for additional findings and support for abnormal results.

If you are nearing retirement, there are some things to know about your Doctors of BC insurance. Physicians' Disability Insurance (PDI): PDI remains in effect as long as you have more than $10 000 of eligible income in a calendar year; however, it terminates at age 70 regardless of your income. Cancel your coverage once you retire. If you forget, PDI automatically cancels after a period of no income. Member Disability (INCOMEprotect): IN - COMEprotect expires the 1st of May following your 70th birthday, regardless of your working status. Disability benefits replace your earned income if you cannot work due to illness or injury. Cancel your coverage once you retire, as the plan is no longer applicable. Changes in membership status or reported earned income will not trigger an automatic cancellation. Professional Expense Insurance (PEI): PEI expires the 1st of May following your 80th birthday. Benefits are payable only if you are incurring business or professional expenses. Cancel your coverage once you retire, as the plan is no longer applicable. Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D): AD&D expires the 1st of May fol- lowing your 75th birthday. Since premiums remain level and are relatively inexpensive, we encourage keeping coverage until expiry. Life insurance: Life insurance expires the 1st of May following your 75th birthday. Generally, you can consider reducing or canceling term life insur- ance if you have no debts or financial dependants and are in good health. Evaluate your life insur- ance needs before canceling or reducing coverage. Health Benefits Trust Fund (HBTF): HBTF can cover you and your family for life. Currently, there is no expiry age, although the plan benefits change after your 70th birthday. Contact us if you are winding up your corporation or if you are retiring and you have the Core Plus plan. If you have the Cost-Plus feature on your plan, speak to your accountant about whether it is useful to maintain in retirement. Critical Illness Insurance (CI): CI expires the 1st of May following your 75th birthday. Premi- ums tend to rise substantially in older ages. You may reduce or cancel coverage if your retire- ment is well funded and you no longer require additional financial support during a critical illness event.

Simply bringing multidisciplinary col- leagues together does not guarantee effective team communication. With potentially deperson- alized remote working environments, physicians need tools to support collaboration and enable staff to achieve a shared vision. Adapting daily huddle practices by using visual management tools during the C oVID-19 pandemic has the potential to unite primary care staff. Reflecting on practice changes in my local clinical context, huddling has improved patient safety behaviors, job satisfac - tion, and leadership perception. Contextually tar - geted huddles are vital because there is no single approach that best suits all disciplines, rosters, and teams. Ideal huddle length, timing, and content must be adaptive and are of increasing importance due to the accelerated pace of health care change. Across British Columbia, the primary care landscape continues to evolve as governments seek to establish effec- tive models for the prevention of illness in pan- demic and postpandemic environments. There is an increasing focus on using teams to sup- port complex chronic conditions and coordinate and integrate care.1 As many physicians will be aware, simply bringing professionals together in teams does not guarantee collaboration. Iterative John van Bockxmeer, MBBS A reflection on daily huddles in BC primary care teams Huddling helps focus staff and improves teamwork, patient safety, job satisfaction, and leadership. Dr van Bockxmeer is a family physician working across a number of community and hospital sites. This article has been peer reviewed.change to support collaboration is needed to enable staff to achieve their objectives.2 The literature suggests that primary care staff can increase their situational awareness, decision making, workplace satisfaction, and access to care, and reduce human errors by hud- dling regularly.2 Huddles provide a scheduled venue for asking questions in real time and verbalizing concerns with colleagues. Despite little empirical evidence in Canadian prac- tice, it is hypothesized that the introduction of huddles leads to increased staff efficiency, improved information sharing, increased ac- countability, feelings of empowerment, and a culture of collaboration.3 The Institute for Healthcare Improvement studied 10 high-performing systems and noted that regular, standardized huddles involving frontline and mid-level managers were part of an excellent health care management system. In 2017, 3412 huddles were observed to evalu- ate their effect on team problem solving and information sharing over 3 months.4 Due to increased staff accountability, more than 92% of problems identified were resolved through the huddle process.4 But has this been our ex- perience in BC? Research has shown that a whiteboard out- lining a small number of visual performance measures updated daily is a key tool in support- ing team success and strengthening a culture of patient safety.5,6 This has been translated into practice in some community health centres across the Lower Mainland. Why huddle? Huddles are short 5- to 15-minute briefings designed to give staff opportunities to plan daily tasks and roles, stay informed, review events, and share plans to ensure well-coordinated pa- tient care. The huddles can function as a venue for highlighting patient concerns, sharing in- formation, celebrating success, and reinforcing common goals.2,3,5,7,8 Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, my primary care community health centre team began a project on developing updated, rel- evant daily huddle content and capturing it on a large whiteboard in a high-traffic area. The purpose of this was to help better support mandated complex clients via brief multidis- ciplinary intervention planning. This created a psychologically safe space, improved daily visibility regarding workflow and equipment concerns, and allowed teams to keep abreast of health authority policy changes. Staff could anonymously submit kudos and \"client voices\" to celebrate examples of aspirational teamwork and patient journeys, and to connect meaning to daily work. When COVID-19 arrived in Vancouver, the team pivoted huddling in a number of ways to help improve staff well-being and patient safety. Virtual conference technology was in - stalled at the huddle board to allow provid- ers working from home to remain engaged. Nursing staff improved pharmacovigilance and opioid agonist therapy processes by seeking team input at daily huddles. When combined with pandemic prescribing, this helped prevent overdose deaths and the spread of respiratory viruses. Performance indicators evolved, and useful clinical metrics were updated to reflect shifting workflows and staffing levels. Inten- sive housing outreach intakes opened, and new teams were created. As time progressed, daily 257 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 6 | July/august 2022257van Bockxmeer J CliniC al huddles continued as a pivotal communication tool. Staff have taken ownership of the huddles and continually review their content. Other successful huddling techniques in- clude building clinical themes across a defined period. This encourages reflective practice, re- orients groups to unseen biases, and builds new strategic capabilities. One example of a theme has been a weekly focus on exploring underused electronic medical record functionality, which has led to improved group practice entering interventions such as cervical screening recalls. If staff experience uncertainty about specific, high-relevance topics, such as the use and avail- ability of personal protective equipment during COVID-19, huddling is a perfect vehicle for immediately highlighting concerns. We found that direct clinician feedback was more likely to be heard and operationalized through inter- active daily huddles than through large policy documents. This style of engagement provides local leaders with multiple touch points with staff, which fosters reliability and trust if done well. Benefits In my practice, daily visual huddles throughout the pandemic have improved care team percep- tion and understanding of the clinic's shifting priority goals. Staff connections with each other, including those in remote arrangements, have also improved. This has allowed for deeper un- derstanding and analysis of relevant issues. Staff have noted improved self-reflective practice, job satisfaction, and reduced burnout as a result of peer-led daily visual huddles. There have also been numerous care benefits for patients, including prevention of emergency department presentations, successful outreach to de-escalate social and medical crises, a reduction in missed doses of opioid agonist therapy and mental health medications, coordinated recalls of at-risk patients, and improved communica- tion with inpatient teams while community health centre patients are admitted. Challenges and areas of growth Optimizing huddle length remains a challenge, but there is no single approach that best suits all disciplines, rosters, and teams. Staff suggested that huddling twice a day would help our team remain patient focused during discussions but have found this challenging in practice. Creating effective meaning for all staff re- mains challenging because it is easy for group discussions to get derailed. Knowing how to appropriately scale and close the loop on com- plicated open action items remains difficult. By potentially minimizing opportunities to fully explore issues, there is a risk of some staff feeling unsupported or psychologically unsafe. This is best dealt with by investment in communica-tion and leadership training. Rotation of voluntary huddle lead roles helps individuals gain an understanding of how side conversations and time delays can reduce the effectiveness of huddles. We found that taking important detailed discussions offline into smaller focus groups for a few minutes immediately after huddling was an effective way to maintain flow during the formal team engagement time. Expectations With the adoption of virtual primary care en-vironments and with workforce shortages, the importance of teamwork, goal setting, and job satisfaction will increase. Facilitating digital huddles requires the provision and adoption of compliant confidential technology solutions. An even greater focus on making daily brief-ings time appropriate to produce meaning for all disciplines is needed with virtual or hybrid huddling. Keeping to time is more important than ever, and virtual breakout rooms can be useful tools for smaller discussions. However, as privacy regulations evolve, a burden may be placed on smaller fee-for-service clinics that are required to self-fund videoconferencing solu- tions.9 This may prohibit huddling and the vari- ous benefits it confers in these environments. Bottom line Primary care huddles have an increasing role to play in developing strong, purposeful teams that provide quality patient care. As busy physicians, our time with colleagues is extremely precious. It is more important than ever for us to con- nect despite barriers faced in implementing and assessing huddles. There is evidence that these brief daily professional connections provide positive communication, patient safety, and teamwork and leadership benefits. As in many aspects of clinical practice, we must remain flexible and adaptive when we huddle. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and it is up to us to support and facilitate these meaningful multidisciplinary encounters. Summary BC health authorities are investing in team-based primary care; tools to support staff collaboration are needed. Huddling is most useful when the process is peer designed and led. Visual hud-dling tools help focus staff and improve team- work, patient safety behaviors, job satisfaction, and leadership perception. Optimizing huddles requires a targeted approach using videocon- ferencing technology for remote workers and focusing on the most important topics, per- formance metrics, and themes that are directly relevant to current daily clinical practice. n Competing interests None declared. references 1.

Recent surveys demonstrate particularly high uptake among young never-smokers and a possible association with increased uptake of combustible cigarette smoking. E-cigarettes may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, includ- ing myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and elevated heart rate. However, there is a paucity of long-term clinical data to show the cardiovascular disease implica- tions of these changes. With regard to pulmonary disease, e-cigarettes appear to be strongly impli- cated in the recent outbreak of acute e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury. The Omair Arshad, MD, Carolyn M. Taylor, MD, MPH, Milan Khara, MBChB, Thomas M. Roston, MD, PhD, Jonathan Athayde, MD, Krishnan Ramanathan, MBChB Health effects of electronic cigarettes: A review E-cigarettes can be an effective smoking cessation tool for some smokers of combustible cigarettes but may be associated with potential cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity. Dr Arshad is a resident physician in internal medicine at Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NL. Drs Taylor and Ramanathan are clinical assistant professors in the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, and staff cardiologists at St. Paul's Hospital. Dr Khara is a staff physician at the Smoking Cessation Clinic at Vancouver General Hospital. Dr Roston completed his internal medicine and cardiology training at UBC and is now pursuing a postdoctoral research fellowship in cardiovascular genetics at Harvard Medical School. Dr Athayde is a resident physician in internal medicine at UBC. This article has been peer reviewed.relationship between e-cigarettes and chronic pulmonary disease is less clear, though possible associations with obstructive spirometric changes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and chronic cough have been demonstrated. None - theless, the literature suggests that e-cigarettes are likely less harmful to the cardiovascular and respiratory systems than combustible cigarettes, and emerging evidence suggests that e-cigarettes can be an effective smoking cessation aid for smok - ers who are motivated to quit. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), or vapes, are devices that use a battery-powered metal resistance coil to heat and aerosolize e-cigarette liquid (e-liquid), which is composed mainly of nico- tine, propylene glycol, and vegetable glycerin, which is then inhaled by the user. E-cigarettes have been advertised as a safer way to consume nicotine compared with traditional combus- tible cigarettes.1 However, emerging evidence is demonstrating detrimental health consequences related to e-cigarette use. This, coupled with the rapid uptake of e-cigarettes among youth,2-4 is cause for concern and warrants further re- search. Our aim is to review the epidemiol- ogy of e-cigarette use, discuss the evidence for e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid, and examine the known cardiovascular and respira - tory effects of e-cigarette use. There are four types of e-cigarettes: pods, tanks (also known as mods), vape pens, and cig-a-likes.5 The most recent trend in e-cigarette use involves the use of pods;6 they use dispos- able cartridges that contain e-liquids with nicotine benzoate salt, which have a much higher nicotine concentration than e-liquids with freebase nicotine.3 Tanks, or mods, have an e-liquid storage tank attached to the main body, which contains a battery. Vape pens are similar but are slimmer and more easily por- table. Cig-a-likes look similar to combustible cigarettes. 7 In addition to nicotine, propylene glycol, and tional of these compounds is unknown.9 The presence of diacetyl in e-liquids is a concern because it is a known pulmonary toxin and has a propensity for causing bronchiolitis obliterans, also known as \"popcorn lung.\"9 Of particular concern is the addition of vitamin E acetate in tetrahydrocannabinol-containing e-liquids pur- chased on the black market because it appears to be associated with the recent outbreak of acute e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI).10-12 Further research is necessary to better characterize the inhalational health risks of these compounds. Epidemiology E-cigarette use is a common and rapidly spread- ing phenomenon, particularly among youth. The 2017 Canadian Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (which included all ages) found that 15.4% of Canadians reported ever trying an e-cigarette, while 2.9% had used an e-cigarette in the past 30 days.2 Ever use of e-cigarettes was significantly higher among adolescents (15 to 19 years old) and young adults (20 to 24 259 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 6 | July/august 2022259Arshad O, Taylor CM, Khara M, Roston TM, Athayde J, Ramanathan K CliniC al years old) at 22.8% and 29.3%, respectively, compared with older individuals.2 Furthermore, e-cigarette use is increasing at an alarming rate among young people. Hammond and colleagues found that in their longitudinal study sample, ever use of e-cigarettes among Canadian ado- lescents (16 to 19 years old) increased from 29.3% in 2017 to 37.0% in 2018.3 Similarly, the 2018-19 Canadian Student Tobacco, Al- cohol and Drugs Survey (CSTADS), which included only students, found that past 30-day e-cigarette use among Canadian grade 7 to 12 students doubled (20% versus 10%) compared with the 2016-17 CSTADS results.4 Data from the US are similar: past 30-day e-cigarette use among US high school students increased from 11.7% in 2017 to 27.5% in 2019,13,14 which is the largest recorded increase in the use of any substance among US adolescents. Multiple studies have demonstrated that e-cigarettes may be a risk factor leading people toward combustible cigarette use. A meta-analysis showed that among adolescent and young adult never-smokers, e-cigarette use was associated with increased odds of initiation of combustible cigarette smoking (odds ratio [OR] 3.50, 95% CI, 2.38-5.16, P = 0.03).15 Another study showed similar results (adjusted OR [aOR] 6.8, 95% CI, 1.65-28.25).16 This as- sociation was further supported by Azagba and colleagues,17 who used data from the 2016-17 CSTADS to demonstrate that Canadian stu- dents who used an e-cigarette for more than 21 of the past 30 days had increased odds of both trying combustible cigarettes (aOR 4.83, 95% CI, 3.33-7.01) and 2.16-5.34). These data collec - tively suggest that e-cigarette use may be as- sociated with higher rates of both occasional and regular use of combustible cigarettes. This is of special concern because 42% of Canadian student e-cigarette users have never smoked a combustible cigarette. 4 However, there are two important counter- arguments to the proposition that e-cigarette use is a gateway to combustible cigarette use. First, there is a common liability of use between combustible and e-cigarettes, meaning that there are common factors that drive people to use both combustible and e-cigarettes, but the two are not necessarily causally related. Second, if increased e-cigarette use were causally related to increased smoking initiation, one would ex - pect to see this reflected in population-level studies, but this is not the case. Hammond and colleagues found increased rates of e-cigarette use among adolescents in Canada, the US, and the UK (from 2017 to 2018) but increased rates of combustible cigarette smoking only among Canadian adolescents, which, as per the authors' conclusions, suggests that e-cigarette use may not be causally related to increased smoking uptake.3 E-cigarettes may indeed be a gateway to combustible cigarette smoking, and this is a valid concern, but there is not yet enough evi-dence to state a conclusive causal association. Smoking cessation and harm reduction E-cigarettes are widely used as a smoking ces- sation tool: 32.4% of Canadian smokers used e-cigarettes for this purpose in 2017, 2 and the UK National Health Service officially recom- mends e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid.18 Though older studies19-21 have shown that e-cigarettes are not superior to traditional nico - tine replacement therapy (NRT) for smoking cessation, more recent randomized controlled trials have shown e-cigarettes to be superior to NRT [Table 1]. A UK randomized controlled trial published in 2019 showed a 1-year smok- ing abstinence rate of 18.0% in its e-cigarette group compared with 9.9% in the NRT group (relative risk [RR] 1.83, 95% CI, 1.30-2.58, P < 0.001), with a number needed to treat of 12 (95% CI, 8-27).22 Similarly, another randomized controlled trial published in 2020 showed the superiority of e-cigarettes plus nicotine trans- dermal patches compared with patches alone for smoking cessation (RR 2.92, 95% CI, 0.91-9.33, P = 0.05).23 Though these more recent results are encouraging for smoking cessation interven- tions, one caveat is that e-cigarette users may remain nicotine dependent even after quitting combustible cigarettes. The previously men- tioned UK randomized controlled trial showed that 80% of participants in the e-cigarette group continued to use e-cigarettes after 1 year of abstinence from smoking, while only 9% of participants in the NRT group continued to use NRT after 1 year.22 For smokers of combustible cigarettes, an- other possible beneficial aspect is harm reduc- tion via partial substitution of combustible cigarettes with e-cigarettes. This is conceptually plausible because e-cigarettes deliver nicotine via a similar smoking-like behavior but with fewer apparent health risks compared with combustible cigarettes. Moreover, e-cigarettes offer the psychological and sociocultural aspects of cigarette smoking that traditional NRT does not, which places e-cigarettes in a unique posi- tion as a more desirable combustible cigarette substitute.24 However, the limited data available thus far suggest that e-cigarettes have either no effect or a net detrimental effect on harm re- duction at the population level. In smokers who are not intending to quit, ad libitum e-cigarette use while continuing ad libitum combustible cigarette use is not associated with reduced combustible cigarette use.25,26 Another study found that e-cigarette use was associated with a net effect of increased combustible cigarette use; only 13.2% of ever e-cigarette users were able to successfully quit combustible cigarette smok- ing, while 22.2% of e-cigarette users started or restarted smoking combustible cigarettes.27 Nonetheless, e-cigarettes may provide a viable harm reduction strategy at the individual level for smokers who are able to successfully tran-sition partially or exclusively to e-cigarettes. 24 However, this is likely most effective if reviewed on a case-by-case basis rather than as a general recommendation for smokers not intending to quit because the data do not currently support the use of e-cigarettes as a population-level harm reduction intervention.Our aim is to review the epidemiology of e-cigarette use, discuss the evidence for e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid, and examine the known cardiovascular and respiratory effects of e-cigarette use.260 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 6 | July/August 2022260CliniC al Health effects of electronic cigarettes: A review Cardiovascular effects Combustible cigarette smoking is one of the strongest preventable risk factors for cardiovas - cular disease.28 Though the association between e-cigarette use and cardiovascular outcomes is largely unclear at this point, new data suggest that e-cigarettes are associated with cardiovas- cular morbidity [Table 2], though it is likely less than that of combustible cigarette smoking.29 This section highlights the potential associa - tions between e-cigarette use and cardiovascular disease, hypertension, endothelial health, and myocardial function. Of greatest concern is the emerging poten- tial relationship between e-cigarette use and cardiovascular disease. Observational studies have noted associations between e-cigarette use and higher incidence of coronary artery disease (OR 1.4, 95% CI, 1.35-1.46),30 stroke (OR 1.71, 95% CI, 1.64-1.80),30 and myocardial infarction (OR 1.59-2.25, P < 0.001).30,31 One of these studies compared the myocardial infarction risk of combustible versus e-cigarette use and found that, as expected, combustible cigarette smoking was more strongly associated with myocardial infarction (OR 2.72 versus 1.79).31 Collectively, these observational associations warrant further study because a causal relationship between e-cigarettes and cardiovascular disease has not yet been established. Early evidence suggests an association be- tween e-cigarette use and the development of hypertension and elevated resting heart rate. This is important because these hemodynamic changes are thought to precede the development of cardiovascular disease. A recent meta-analysis found that chronic e-cigarette use (compared with no use) was associated with increased heart rate (mean difference [MD] 2.27, 95% CI, 1.64-2.89, P < 0.0001), increased systolic blood pressure (MD 2.02, 95% CI, 0.07-3.97, P = 0.042), and increased diastolic blood sure (MD 2.01, 95% CI, 0.62-3.39, P = 0.004).32 The cardiovascular disease implications of these small but statistically significant hemodynamic changes remain unclear. These shifts appear to be at least partially associated with nicotine, as one randomized controlled study found that systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pres- sure, and heart rate were significantly higher when participants used nicotine-containing e-cigarettes (compared with nicotine-free e-cigarettes).33 An encouraging finding from this meta-analysis is that positive hemodynamic changes were seen in association with switching from combustible to e-cigarette use, includ- ing a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (MD 7.00, 95% CI, 9.63 to 4.37, P < 0.0001) and diastolic blood pressure (MD 3.65, 95% CI, 5.71 to 1.59, P = 0.001), but Article Study type Population research question Statistical result Conclusion Hartmann- Boyce et al.19Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysisVarious Effectiveness of e-cigarettes (vs NRT) as a smoking cessation aidRR 1.26(95% CI, 0.68-2.34)E-cigarettes are no more effective than NRT for smoking cessation.

Evidence for e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid.261 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 6 | July/august 2022261Arshad O, Taylor CM, Khara M, Roston TM, Athayde J, Ramanathan K CliniC al no difference in heart rate (MD 0.03, 95% CI, 2.57 to +2.52, P = 0.983).32 This suggests an improved cardiovascular risk profile for smok- ers of combustible cigarettes who switch com- pletely to e-cigarettes. Another key aspect of cardiovascular health is myocardial function. This is estimated by the myocardial performance index, which uses echocardiographic parameters to calculate an expression of global systolic and diastolic ven- tricular function. Smokers of combustible cigarettes have worse myocardial function pa- rameters and worse scores on the myocardial performance index after smoking a combustible cigarette.34-36 However, e-cigarette users ap- pear to have no change in myocardial func- tion parameters or myocardial performance index scores immediately after e-cigarette use.37 This suggests improved myocardial health for smokers of combustible cigarettes who switch completely to e-cigarettes, thereby providing another possible benefit of cardiovascular harm reduction. Respiratory effects Combustible cigarette smoking is strongly asso- ciated with poor respiratory health. E-cigarettes are likely less harmful to the respiratory system than combustible cigarettes,9 but new data suggest that e-cigarettes are associated with independent respiratory health risks, most notably acute EVALI. 10 Weaker associa- tions have been shown between e-cigarettes and chronic respiratory diseases, including higher incidence of chronic obstructive pul- monary disease,38 asthma,39-43 and obstruc- tive lung disease not otherwise specified.44-46 Because the data on the respiratory effects of e-cigarettes are expansive, we provide an over- view of the key points. For a more detailed review of the respiratory effects of e-cigarettes, see Gotts and colleagues.9 In the US, there was a national outbreak of EVALI, with 2807 hospitalizations and 68 deaths as of 18 February 2020.47 This illness peaked in September 2019 and is now steadily declining.48,49 In comparison, EVALI cases in Canada have been relatively sparse, with a to-tal of 19 cases, 15 hospital admissions, and no deaths reported as of 11 March 2020.50 EVALI was first reported in the US in August 2019 in a case series that included 53 patients. 51 Most of those patients presented with respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, chest pain), gastro- intestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), and constitutional symptoms (fever, chills, malaise). Many of those patients had severe acute illness: 58% required admission to the ICU, 32% required intubation and me- chanical ventilation, and 17% had acute respira - tory distress syndrome. Two patients required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and one of them died. On CT scanning of the chest, key findings included bilateral ground-glass lung opacities, sometimes with subpleural spar- ing. Most patients received glucocorticoids, which resulted in respiratory improvement. Al- though the specific etiological agent within the e-cigarette vapor is unconfirmed at this time, vi- tamin E acetate has been strongly implicated.11 Article(s) Study type Association Statistical result Conclusion Ndunda and Muutu30observational studyCoronary artery disease oR 1.4 (95% CI, 1.35-1.46) E-cigarette use is associated with higher incidence of coronary artery disease.

The exact mechanism of vitamin E acetate-mediated pulmonary toxicity is unknown, but it is thought to interfere with pulmonary surfactant function.11 One study found vitamin E acetate and tetrahydrocan- nabinol in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in other studies to 84% of EVALI patients reported using tetrahydrocannabinol-based products.10,49,51 It is important to note that vitamin E acetate is pres- ent mainly in tetrahydrocannabinol-containing e-liquids purchased on the black market, not in nicotine-containing e-liquids purchased through licensed businesses.12 Therefore, the risk of EVALI is likely low among users of commercially available nicotine-only e-liquids. There is also evidence of long-term re - spiratory risk from e-cigarette use [Table 3], though the evidence is less conclusive than that of acute EVALI. Several retrospective observa- tional studies have noted that e-cigarette users report symptoms of airway obstruction and alveolar injury. This includes increased chronic productive cough (OR 2.1, 95% CI, 1.8-2.5, P < 0.001),52 higher incidence of asthma (high - est OR 2.36, 95% CI, 1.89-2.94, P < 0.001)39-43 obstruc- tive pulmonary disease,38 and dyspnea.38 Other studies have found e-cigarette use is associated with reduced cough sensitivity54 and ciliary dys- function in cell culture models,55 which suggests that e-cigarette users may be at higher risk for pulmonary infection.9 Case reports have also described diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, exog- enous lipoid pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, Article(s) Study type Association Statistical result Conclusion Meo et al.44 Vardavas et al.45 Staudt et al.46Randomized controlled FEV1: 4.6 vs 5.2 (P = 0.007) 44 No difference before and after use45,46 FEV1/FVC:77.4 vs 83.4 (P = 0.001) 44 No difference before and after use45,46Conflicting evidence.

E-cigarette use may be associated with the development of obstructive lung physiology. To date, studies have found mixed results with re- gard to e-cigarette use and spirometric changes. One study found e-cigarette use was associ- ated with lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second ([FEV1] 4.6 versus 5.2, P = 0.007) and lower ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity ([FEV1/FVC] 77.4 versus 83.4, P = 0.001).44 Since smokers of combustible cigarettes were excluded from this study, these results suggest that e-cigarette use may be independently as- sociated with obstructive airway changes. How- ever, spirometry was performed after only 1 hour of abstinence; thus, it potentially reflected acute bronchospasm rather than lasting changes in the airways. Furthermore, this association is still unclear, as two other studies have shown no difference in spirometric measurements before and after e-cigarette use.45,46 However, one of these studies did show an increase in pulmonary airflow resistance by impulse oscillometry,45 which indicates evidence of obstructive airway changes before they can be seen on spirometry. In terms of improving obstructive lung physiol- ogy among smokers of combustible cigarettes who have switched completely to e-cigarettes, there are conflicting results: one study showed improved spirometry; 5 two others showed no changes.60,61 Overall, the data suggest that e-cigarette use is potentially associated with early obstructive pulmonary changes, but this association remains inconclusive.Summary E-cigarette use is a rapidly growing phenom- enon, especially among young people and never-smokers. There is emerging evidence that e-cigarettes can be an effective smoking cessa- tion tool for smokers of combustible cigarettes. However, they are not benign: there is evidence of potential cardiovascular and respiratory mor - bidity. Nonetheless, e-cigarettes do appear to have an improved cardiopulmonary risk pro- file compared with combustible cigarettes and therefore may provide a viable harm reduction strategy for some smokers. n Competing interests Dr Khara has received personal fees from the Pfizer Canada Inc.

Methods: A survey with qualitative and quantitative responses based on the Canadian Primary Care Patient Experience Survey was provided to patients with in-person and telemedicine appointments at a multiphysician primary care clinic in Langley, BC, between 1 November 2020 and 15 February 2021. Results: In total, 777 patients received the survey link; the survey response rate was 54.8%. There was a statistically significant difference between the telemedicine and in-person cohorts for the time between making the appointment and see - ing the physician (P = 0.03), but there were no statistically significant differences for the other Azzra Mangalji, MD, Prabhjot Chahal, MD, Abhiram Cherukupalli, MD, MHSc Evaluating patient perceptions of quality of care through telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic Patient satisfaction with primary care providers has been very positive during the pandemic and has largely been similar for telemedicine and in-person consultations. Dr Mangalji is a resident physician at the University of Toronto, Family Medicine. Dr Chahal is a family physician in the Langley Division of Family Practice. Dr Cherukupalli is a resident physician at the University of British Columbia, Otolaryngology\u2014Head and Neck Surgery. This article has been peer reviewed.parameters. o verall, 32.3% of patients had no preference between modalities, whereas 54.9% preferred in-person consultation. Conclusion: Satisfaction with in-person and tele - medicine appointments was largely similar. There - fore, physicians can triage and use telemedicine appropriately to manage workflow, reduce wait times, and expand health care to rural/remote regions of the country postpandemic with no sig- nificant change in patients' experience of health care interactions. Background Telemedicine can be broadly defined as the use of electronic information and telecommu- nications technologies to facilitate health care services, with a common form being virtual care.1,2 Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, tele- medicine was used primarily to bridge the gap for rural or remote locations where there is lack of transport, mobility, or funding.3,4 While there has been increasing patient demand for telemedicine, many barriers existed with regard to governance of compensation mechanisms, li - censure restrictions, and technology infrastruc - ture across health care platforms and facilities.5 At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of telemedicine was expanded due to the necessity to limit vectors of disease spread. Primary care has been significantly impact- ed by this change. In-person visits have been limited to those deemed necessary, and tele- medicine has been widely used as a tool to provide patient care while maintaining social distancing. Throughout this rapid period of change, there has been limited literature on patient perceptions of their quality of care with the widespread use of telemedicine. In this study, we aimed to identify the pro- portion of patients who received telemedicine versus in-person appointments during the pan- demic, and the number who required in-person follow-up after a phone consultation. In addi-tion, we aimed to identify patient perceptions of their health care experience via telemedi - cine versus an in-person appointment. With this information, in conjunction with current technological capabilities of health care deliv- ery, we aim to inform the projected need for telemedicine and identify potential areas of im- provement during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. From a policy and technology per- spective, we believe this information could help improve the delivery of health care, both locally and remotely, thereby improving access to pri-mary care across Canada. Methods We conducted a single-centre prospective study of patients who presented to a multiphysician primary care office in Langley, BC, from 1 No - vember 2020 to 15 February 2021. Approval for this study was granted by the University of 266 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 6 | July/August 2022266CliniC al Evaluating patient perceptions of quality of care through telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic British Columbia's Behavioural Research Eth- ics Board (H20-02844). A comprehensive list of all patients who presented to the clinic was collected and eligible individuals received an encrypted survey link sent by an independent medical office assistant. Patients were included if they were 18 years of age or older, had booked a telemedicine or in-person appointment, or were asked to follow up in person after a tele- medicine consultation. Appointment type was determined together with the patient, with the option for in-person follow-up after a telephone appointment if it was required (i.e., for a physi- cal exam). Patients were not included if they required an in-person visit for routine newborn and/or cancer screens, needed an in-person COVID-19 swab, or were asked to proceed directly to the emergency department follow-ing a telemedicine appointment. The survey was voluntary and was anony- mized and distributed using the Qualtrics sur- vey tool. Questions were based on the Primary Care Patient Experience Survey developed by Health Quality Ontario, which was pilot tested in 2015. The survey was built upon and adapted to a digital survey format.6 Descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests were used to analyze the data. Satisfac- tion parameters were averaged and subjected to Wilcoxon signed-rank testing between the telemedicine and in-person cohorts ( = 0.05). A Likert rating scale from poor (correspond-ing value of 1) to excellent (5) was used in the survey. Additionally, common themes between the telemedicine and in-person cohorts were analyzed based on open text responses within the survey. Results Patient demographics In total, 777 individuals were contacted to par- ticipate in the study; 426 completed the sur- vey (54.8%). The mean age of respondents was 61.4 years (\u00b1 SD 16.5), and most were female (65.4%). Most patients (49.1%) self-reported their overall health as good. Over the previous year, 2.8% had not seen their doctor, 25.5% had seen their doctor twice, and 23.1% had seen their doctor five or more times. In terms of appointments, 49.8% were telemedicine, 45.5% were in-person, and 4.7% were telemedicine followed by in-person assessment. Because only 20 individuals (4.7%) were asked to re- turn for an in-person appointment following a telemedicine consultation, data on this group were not analyzed because they were considered negligible. Patient satisfaction Most individuals (48.4%) felt they had excel- lent Internet/cellular connection throughout the call; 2.8% had a poor connection. Many rated their comfort when interacting on the call as excellent (44.2%) or very good (35.3%). In addition, 60.9% rated their health informa- tion being treated with the level of privacy they expected as excellent. Most respondents rated their in-person ex- perience as excellent regarding the length of time they waited in the waiting room (57.1%) and the length of time they spent in the exami- nation room prior to seeing the health care pro- vider (42.9%). In terms of their experience with the reception staff, 52.8% rated their experience as excellent, and 31.1% rated it as very good. Most respondents with in-person visits rated the length of time between making their appointment and their visit as excellent (31.0%) or very good (30.5%); those with telemedi - cine appointments rated this factor as excellent (28.2%) or very good (50.2%). These results were statistically different based on a two-tailed t test (P = 0.03). Most respondents felt they had an excellent experience with the last ap- pointment they had: in-person (58.5%) and via telemedicine (56.3%). These results were not statistically different ( P = 0.49). In terms of the practitioner spending enough time with the patient (P = 0.12) and knowing their medi- cal history (P = 0.84), most respondents rated their experience as excellent, and there was no statistical difference between the groups. Overall, 32.3% of individuals had no prefer- ence between in-person in-person and 12.8% preferred telemedicine. Individuals commented that physical examination, empathy, two-way communication, and identification of nonverbal cues were particularly good during in-person visits. Telemedicine appointments were considered to provide efficiency, conve- nience, safety during the pandemic, and time savings for simple things such as prescription refills and follow-ups. Suggestions for telemedi- cine improvement included providing a video option as opposed to audio only and striving to stick to the original appointment time. Discussion It was difficult to predict how physicians and patients would respond to the new virtual plat - form of telemedicine given its rapid introduc- tion during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study demonstrated that the quality of care and satisfaction of patients across both platforms are similar. Historically, telemedicine was used pri- marily for rural medicine. More recently, it has been implemented in specialty services ranging from cardiology7 to psychiatry.8 It has also been used in disaster response3 and even surgery (telesurgery).9 Prior to the pandemic, studies demonstrated that telemedicine was equivalent to in-person care across multiple domains. Shigekawa and colleagues found that telemental health and teledermatology were equivalent to in-person care, telerehabilitation was equivalent to or better than in-person care, and teleconsultation was considered a potential alternative to in-person care due to the large scope of care.10 Furthermore, a systematic re- view by Kruse and colleagues noted the benefits of telemedicine, such as ease of use, tendency to improve outcomes and communication, and low cost.11 In addition, telehealth was shown to provide increased access to care, empower- ment for patients managing chronic condi- tions, and improved medication adherence, and led to reduced readmissions.11 Our study cor- roborates these findings by highlighting high levels of patient satisfaction with telemedicine for a variety of parameters, including logis- tics, quality of care, and respectful treatment of This study demonstrated that the quality of care and satisfaction of patients across both platforms [in-person and telemedicine] are similar.267 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 6 | July/august 2022267Mangalji A, Chahal P , Cherukupalli A CliniC al patients. Most of the challenges that prevented implementation of telemedicine prior to the pandemic were related to infrastructure, reim- bursement, and policy.5,11 These barriers were rapidly addressed at the start of the pandemic in order to accommodate a rapidly changing landscape with international social-distancing measures. As more evidence emerges regarding the impact and benefit of telemedicine during the pandemic, these limitations to its use will continue to diminish. We identified a statistically significant dif- ference between the telemedicine and in-person groups in terms of the time between making an appointment and attending it. Although tele- medicine appointments are limited in power, they have demonstrable benefits. Telemedi- cine can be performed from anywhere, which provides more opportunities for appointments that do not require travel to a clinic. This allows certain types of appointments, such as review of lab and radiology results, follow-up, and issues that do not require a physical exam, to occur in a time-sensitive manner.12-14 Currently, many physicians are limiting in-person visits in order to reduce zones of infection, which is adding to the delay experienced in the in-person cohort. As the pandemic settles, these restrictions and regulations may ease. However, if this new type of patient flow works well, many patients and physicians may prefer to continue to use tele- medicine for most of their clinic appointments. In this case, there is a risk that patients who must be seen in person will experience longer wait times, and those who are uncomfortable with or do not have the means to use telemedi- cine may be underserved. Therefore, it is impor- tant to address potential disparities for those with limited digital access, digital literacy, and English language proficiency, among others. 15 While many patients in our study preferred in-person visits (54.9%), 32.3% had no prefer- ence, and patients rated telemedicine appoint - ments as being equivalent to in-person visits for most of their care. Thus, telemedicine should no longer be a temporary measure that is used during the pandemic; a mixed model should be considered as a permanent solution that can be improved upon to better serve patients. Improving access to marginalized communi - ties should be addressed in conjunction with improving convenience and privacy for patients and developing billing, workflow integration, and electronic health record interoperability for physicians.16 There are many possibilities for furthering such care with at-home monitoring devices and the advent of wearable technology. As access to digital services continues to expand, it is imperative that physicians and medical learners are trained early on so they feel com-fortable and proficient using these innovative technologies. Study limitations Our study was limited by our recruitment and data collection methods. Because participation was voluntary, there is a risk of selection bias\u2014 in particular, volunteer bias and nonresponse bias. Given that patients likely have variable risk tolerance during the pandemic and can often choose whether they prefer a telemedi- cine appointment over an in-person consul- tation, there is a risk of bias that those who opt for telemedicine start at a place of greater satisfaction. Those patients are very likely to be the same ones who are comfortable with using digital technologies. Conclusion At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, tele- medicine was rapidly introduced into primary care to reduce the risk of infectious disease spread. It was unknown how patients would respond to this and whether care would be ef- fective via telemedicine. Our study suggests that patients' satisfaction with their primary care provider has been very positive during the pandemic, and that telemedicine and in-person consultations are equivalent for most patient care needs. Moving forward beyond the pan-demic, we suggest that a hybrid model of care based on both in-person and telemedicine con- sultation continue to be used. n Competing interests None declared. references 1.

Neglecting this crucial component of health can lead to health inequities and poorer health outcomes. This became even more evi- dent during the COVID-19 pandemic when the health of many\u2014specifically immigrant, racialized, and Indigenous communities\u2014was more negatively impacted when compared with Caucasian communities. COVID-19 high- lighted the racialized inequities in health care in British Columbia. Unfortunately, this con- tinues to go under-recognized due to the in- ability to accurately collect and report data on these disparities. Other Western countries have had mecha- nisms set up to collect data based on both eth- nicity and religion. For example, in the United Kingdom, the Office for National Statistics has continually reported on this. Between 10 January 2022 and 16 February 2022 (when Omicron was the main variant), rates of deaths involving COVID-19 were higher for many ethnic minority groups, such as the Bangladeshi and Pakistani populations, compared with the White British population. 1 It is a necessity of living in an antiracist society to identify racialized disparities, un- derstand the factors driving them, and inform policy to minimize the disparities. In summer 2020, South Asians in Surrey, British Colum- bia, experienced a disproportionate impact from COVID-19 restrictions. Mandates were Culturally effective care to improve racialized health inequities This article is the opinion of the authors and not necessarily the Council on Health Promotion or Doctors of BC.

However, ac- cording to census data, 52% of workers in Sur- rey are doing labor jobs that don't allow them the luxury to work from home. After English, Punjabi is the most spoken language in Surrey. One-third of residents do not speak English at home. Many also live in multigenerational homes where if one person gets COVID-19 often the entire household gets it. The privilege required to abide by public health restrictions went under-recognized in provincial mandates. While information was being provided about COVID-19 from health authorities and the government, it was not effectively reaching this community. Daily COVID-19 briefings were held in English, with no translations ini-tially provided. It became evident that cultur- ally effective health promotion was lacking. Culturally effective care involves the delivery of care through knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of cultural beliefs and values in order to optimize health outcomes. It also helps to improve health communication and health literacy. Thus, many public health professionals, medical students, residents, and physicians from the South Asian community created grassroots campaigns and organizations to deliver cul- turally effective care to South Asians across BC. One initiative involved bringing together stakeholders such as medical professionals, gurdwaras, and health authorities to deliver information about COVID-19 in a culturally effective way. Gurdwaras are known as commu- nity hubs for Sikhs in particular. Patrons were provided lessons in Punjabi at gurdwaras on proper hand hygiene, the importance of wearing masks, and the meaning of physical distancing. Information was made easily accessible, and the guidelines were contextualized in a way that allowed individuals to understand how to protect themselves and their loved ones. The Government of British Columbia re- cently announced the Anti-Racism Data Act.2 The goal of this Act is to identify gaps in ser- vice delivery that contribute to systemic racism. While it is an important milestone in celebrat- ing diversity and formalizing our government's commitment to minimizing the impacts of co- lonialism, we have a long way to go. Advancing culturally effective care has many benefits to reducing health inequities, particu- larly in racialized communities. Some of these benefits include improved communication, trust, and satisfaction; improved team-based care; improved patient-centred care; improved patient participation and care coordination; and overall improved health outcomes. It is about time. n \u2014Sukhmeet Singh Sachal, MPH Member, Council on Health Promotion \u2014Birinder Narang, MBBS Member, Council on Health Promotion references 1. Office for National Statistics.
