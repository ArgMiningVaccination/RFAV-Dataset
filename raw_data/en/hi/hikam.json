Unlike the more traditional and commonly known Aromatouch or Young Living Raindrop Technique, these extremely powerful and effective Essential Oil application techniques were developed by Boyd Truman on the basis of over 20 years of practice. In his book 'Symphony of the Cells', he describes each protocol which focuses\"on the specific system of the body and targeting the symptoms and underlying causes of many ailments and illnesses.\" When applied correctly, therapeutic-grade essential oil healing applications can promote wellness and help to re-establish a state of homeostasis in the body and within the specific body systems they are effecting. Additionally, High Quality Essential Oil healing applications have the potential to advance a person's wellness and re-balancing quickly and profoundly. All of our applications utilize therapeutic grade essential oils but we do not sell them in our practice. Each Essential Oil healing application takes 10 to 15 minutes and allows for aromatic application, topical application via therapist hands, and may involve carrier oils such as coconut oil, rose hip seed oil or argan oil to dilute certain oils. Shoulder and Neck application, spine and back application, and foot application are common across all choices. The \"Forgiveness Protocol\" has additional application to the heart and liver topically. Infra-Red Heating Pad may be applied at the end of your application to intensify the effects of the oils on certain protocols. For the most profound support in restoring wellness and balance we recommend two applications a week for two weeks. This is especially true for stubborn or chronic infection, illness, or imbalances. Substitutions for oils or blends and brands may be used due to seasonality or availability of the plants. We currently offer all fifteen separate Essential Oil Healing Applications but have a few of our favorites listed below: [Click here to schedule your Essential Oil Session!](https://www.schedulicity.com/Scheduling/LL6N83?cid=1) Cellular Essential Oil Protocol Application of therapeutic-grade essential oils to feet, spine & back to stimulate and balance the Immune, Nervous system, Cardiovascular, Circulatory, and Endocrine systems.
