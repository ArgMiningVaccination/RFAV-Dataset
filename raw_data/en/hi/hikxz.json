Are the painkillers and home remedies not doing the trick? It may be time to try something different. Headaches can be caused by many things, from stress to dehydration or even an underlying medical condition. But one thing is for sure: no matter what's causing your headache, finding relief is the top priority. Fortunately, there are natural ways to reduce your headache pain without resorting to medication or other invasive treatments. You may want to consider a technique known as pressure point therapy. Pressure point therapy is a type of massage that targets specific areas of your body to reduce stress, promote [relaxation](https://betterme.world/articles/essential-oil-blends-for-sleep/) and relieve pain. In particular, it can be used to help ease the symptoms of headaches by targeting certain pressure points found in the head, neck, or shoulders ( [11](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23415783/)). Let's explore where these pressure points are located, the correct way to stimulate them, and how to use them to reduce your headache pain. How Do Pressure Points Work for Headaches? Pressure points for headaches, or any type of [pain relief](https://betterme.world/articles/myofascial-release-creams-and-oils/), work on the principles of reflexology. Reflexology is a holistic healing technique that has been used in [traditional medical practices](https://betterme.world/articles/sound-therapy/) for centuries. It is based on the principle of applying pressure to specific areas of the feet, hands and ears that are believed to correspond to specific organs and systems in the body ( [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4624523/)). When pressure is applied to these reflex points, it is thought to stimulate the body's natural [healing](https://betterme.world/articles/sound-meditation/) process and improve overall well-being. Reflexology can be used as a treatment for various conditions such as headaches, stress, insomnia and even digestive issues. It is a non-invasive method of treatment that has no known side effects ( [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4624523/)). The origins of reflexology can be traced back to ancient Egyptian, Chinese and Indian cultures. When the technique first came to the West in the early 1900s, it was known as \"zone therapy\". It wasn't until the mid-1930s when two American physicians, Dr. William Fitzgerald and Eunice Ingham, developed the modern version of reflexology which they called \"reflex zone therapy\". Research on the efficacy of reflexology is still limited, with most studies showing mixed results. However, many people who have experienced the benefits of reflexology often report feeling relieving effects. Since reflexology is a safe and non-invasive technique, it can be used as an alternative or complementary treatment to conventional medicine.
