You had another fight, and it's the same pattern over and over again. You pour out your heart and their response is cold. They don't seem to care that you are upset or crying, instead they blame you for being too emotional and needy. You are left alone, disappointed, hurt and angry with yourself that you can't get out of this relationship. It's getting predictable. Eventually your partner will say they miss you and can't live without you - telling you everything you've wanted to hear. Promising that it will change. But do they ever really keep their promises or do they do it for just long enough until you forget about the last episode or hurtful thing they did. Part of you knows that this relationship is not ok and that you deserve better. It's not healthy, yet you've never really seen a healthy relationship before. It's so hard to be on your own and you can't imagine life without them. You always admired how independent, free thinking, and spontaneous you were prior to this relationship. What happened to the confidence and self-assurance? You are starting to recognize that the relationship isn't good for you. You can't keep going through these highs and deep lows. But you are scared of letting them go and being alone. I can help you feel that things can be okay again. I'm Leslie, a marriage and family therapist in Phoenix who helps people in toxic relationships break the cycle of never feeling good enough to find their voice and confidence. Through counseling, you will learn to set emotional boundaries and develop awareness of your needs. You no longer have to accept what is given to you or believe what is said about you. Instead you get to fall back in love with who you are, valuing yourself, heart, mind, body and soul. Whether you decide to stay or leave the relationship, counseling can help build your confidence and to trust your inner voice. My job is not to tell you what you need to do, but I will support you to get clarity and to learn to trust yourself to make the changes that are best for you. I'm easy going and supportive, yet direct and willing to challenge when needed. I create a space where my clients feel important, seen, and heard. I provide individual therapy and meet with my clients on a weekly basis.
