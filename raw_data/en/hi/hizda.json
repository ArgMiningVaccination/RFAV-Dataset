Antibiotic resistance is a major public health problem and antibiotic prescription for RTI/OM should be reduced. Anthroposophic treatment of RTI/OM includes anthroposophic medications, nonmedication therapy, and if necessary also antibiotics. This secondary analysis from an observational primary care study comprised 529 children < 18 years from Europe (AT, DE, NL and UK) or USA, whose caregivers had chosen to consult physicians offering anthroposophic (A-) or conventional (C-) treatment for RTI/OM. During the 28-day follow-up antibiotics were prescribed to 5.5 % of A-patients and 25.6 % of C-patients (p < 0.001); unadjusted odds ratio for nonprescription in A- versus C-patients 6.58 (95 %-CI 3.45-12.56); after adjustment for demographics and morbidity 6.33 (3.17-12.64). Antibiotic prescription rates in recent observational studies with similar patients in similar settings ranged from 31.0 % to 84.1 %. Compared to C-patients, A-patients also had much lower use of analgesics, somewhat quicker symptom resolution, and higher caregiver satisfaction. Adverse drug reactions were infrequent (2.3 % in both groups) and not serious. Limitation was that results apply to children of caregivers consulting A-physicians. One cannot infer to what extent antibiotics might be avoided, if children who usually receive C-treatment were offered A-treatment. [1] Cherry DK, Burt CW, Woodwell DA.
