Tonic traditional Chinese medicine is widely used in clinical practice and is categorized into four main drugs, namely, Qi-supplementing, Blood-enriching, Yin-nourishing, and Yang-tonifying. Neurotransmitters play a coordinating role in the nervous system, visceral function, and stress response. The excitation or suppression of the central nervous system is closely related to various diseases, such as insomnia, depression, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and perimenopausal syndrome. Anincreasing amount of evidence shows that Chinese tonic herb and its active ingredients can delay the occurrence and development of these diseases by modulating related neurotransmitters and their receptors, including norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), acetylcholine (ACh), and -aminobutyric acid (GABA). In the present report, studies on the treatment of these neurotransmitter related diseases in relation to the application of tonic Chinese medicine are reviewed. 1. Introduction Tonic traditional Chinese herbal medicine can help in pro- moting the healthy well-being of organisms by replenish-ing their life essence. According to modern pharmacology research, tonic medicine can enhance immune capacity,strengthen learning and memory function, and regulate theendocrine function of patients with impaired disease. Inter- estingly, there are other beneficial effects, such as antiageing [1], antioxidant [2], and antistress [3] effects. According to tonic medicine is divided into Qi-tonifying, Blood- tonifying, Yin-tonifying, and Yang-tonifying rectify the pathological deviation of the visceral-Qi deficiency [4].For example, this may include invigorating the spleen andlungs to act on spleen and lung channels. Qi-tonifyingprescription is used principally to cure representativemedicines, to nourishYin-fluid and correct the pathological deviation of Yindeficiency with such medicines as Lily,Glossy Privet Fruit ,a n d Eclipta alba. In addition, Yang-tonifying prescriptions [7] cansupplement Yang to treat all kinds of Yang deficiency diseases.These medicines can have sweet, pungent, salty, and warmproperties and mainly affect the findings indicate that tonic traditional Chi- nese herbal medicine can modulate neurotransmitters [8],improve insomnia, exert antidepressant effects, delay thedevelopment of neurodegenerative diseases, and improvethe climacteric symptoms of women.

Methods We searched PubMed using the following keywords: Related diseases (Depression/Alzheimer'sdisease/Parkinson'sdisease/Perimenopausal syndrome/Sleep disorders) ANDNeurotransmitters (5-HT, DA, NE, ACh, GABA) medicine (Representative drugs of Qi-supplementing, Blood-enriching, Yin-nourishing, and Yang-tonifying). We limit our search to studies only published inEnglish language from PubMed. We also searched CNKIfor Chinese articles with the same keywords. Time rangewe searched had no limitation (to present). In overall, wefound 155 articles in the two databases, among which 70w e r ep u b l i s h e di nE n g l i s ha n d8 5w e r ep u b l i s h e di nC h i n e s e .18 articles were excluded for repetition in the contents.According to the description of the contents such as Qi,b l o o d ,Y i n ,Y a n g ,a n dt h ee ff e c t i v ec o m p o n e n t so ft h et o n i ctraditional Chinese medicine, we finally found 33 Chineseliteratures and 44 English literatures. Based on Chinese Materia Medica and Clinical common medicines, we selected the following representative drugs oftonic traditional Chinese Radix Rehmanniae ;( 3 )Y i n - n o u r i s h i n g : Lily, Glossy privet Relationship between Qi, Blood, Yin, Yang, and Neurotransmitters Yin and Yang are two substances in the human body closely related to each other and their functional characters [9]. Yang refers to warmth, excitement, promotion, and so on, while Yin refers to nourishing, moistening, inhibiting, andso on. Yin and Yang stand against each other, can transform into each other, and rely on each other by operating in equilibrium. Working in equilibrium means that Yin andYang have a balance of growth and decline and maintaindynamic balance in the changes of growth and decline [10].If either side shall decrease or be insufficient, the other side would consequently be reduced or weakened [11]. Qi is an energetic subtle essence that forms the human body and sustains life activities [12]. Blood is a nourishing nutrient that runs in veins and circulates throughout thebody. It is one of the basic substances that comprise thehuman body and sustains life activities. Qi and blood cantransform into each other; that is, Qi can generate blood,and vice versa. Blood insufficiency will induce Qi deficiencyand can cause mental diminishment, forgetfulness, insomnia,irritability, ability disorders, and other symptoms [13]. From the properties of Yin and Yang, we can determine that Qi possesses the properties of Yang, active and warm,whereas blood possesses the properties of Yin, static andmoistening. They depend on and nourish each other tosupport and promote life activities [14].The connection among Qi, blood, Yin, and Yang is achieved through the meridians [15]. Meridians are channelsthrough which Qi and blood connect organs, body sur-faces, and body parts. It works as a controlling system ofhuman bodily functions by transporting Qi and blood to theentire body and nourishing tissues and organs. Meanwhile, meridians have similar physiological function to the nervous system. Meridian, neuroendocrine neurotransmitters, andreceptors are closely linked. It is confirmed that sympatheticnerves, mast cells, calcium, adrenergic neurotransmitters,and other substances are related to meridian regulation.According to Chang et al. [16], the basis of meridian activityis a conditioned reflex with the involvement of the cerebralc o r t e xa n ds e v e r a lr e s e a r c h e r sh a v ed i s c o v e r e dt h a tt h e r ea r eaphenomena of neurotransmitter enrichments in the meridiansensing zone. For example, in the study of meridian acupuncture points, O m u r a[ 1 7 ]d i s c o v e r e dt h a tm o s tp o i n t sh a v eh i g h l ye n r i c h e dneurotransmitters and hormones, including acetylcholine,norepinephrine, adrenocorticotropic hormone, 5-HT, and - GABA. During the study of signal conduction in acupunc- ture, Liu's research group discovered that acupuncture allows meridians to release norepinephrine, epinephrine, and othercatecholamines along the skin, and that their content wassignificantly higher than nonacupunctured meridians [18,19]. The weakness of Qi, blood, Yin, and Yang may affect neurotransmitters through meridians. 4. The Relationship between Tonic Traditional Chinese Medicine and Neurotransmitter Related Diseases 4.1. Depression. Depression is defined as a mental disorder characterized by psychomotor retardation, such as slow thinking, accompanied by decreased interest and initiative.Recent studies have demonstrated that a deficiency in thefollowing neurotransmitters is correlated with the onset Ach, and GABA [20]. Importantly,most antidepressants exert antidepressant effects by increas-ing levels of neurotransmitters located at synapses. Depression belongs to the category of \"melancholia\" in Chinese Medicine. Melancholia is a Chinese medicinesyndrome caused by emotional discomfort and Qi-stagnation[21]. Chinese medicine has extensive experience in theprevention and treatment of depression. For example, suchmedicines invigorate the liver, spleen, kidney, and heart,but also the quiet spirit too. However, the combination ofthese medicines with antidepressant activity is a widespreadconcern. The chronic mild unpredictable stress (CMUS) model is among the most common methods for studying depression[22]. It is primarily used for the screening of antidepressantsand the pathophysiology of depression. The forced swimming tests (FST) and tail suspension tests (TST) are well-established models for studying depressionin animals [23, 24]. In the frontal cortex and hippocampus,FST was observed to indicate a significant decrease in 5-HT8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine levels with a slight change in 5-HIAA levels, resulting in an elevation in the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio [25]. 4.2. Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an insidious and progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects the nervous system. It is characterized by dementiaand includes memory impairment, aphasia, and executivedysfunction. NE, DA, 5-HT, and cholinergic transmitter ACha r ei m p o r t a n tn e u r o t r a n s m i t t e r si nt h eb r a i n .A m o n gt h e m ,choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) is a key enzyme in thesynthesis of Ach [26], and AchE is a key enzyme in thedegradation of ACh. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI)therapy is a frequently used method in the treatment of AD[27]. Both ChAT and AchE activities are strongly correlatedwith ACh content in the brain. They maintain the dynamicbalance of ACh and exert important roles in maintainingnormal cognitive function. A reduction in these neuro-transmitters can lead to senile dementia. More specifically,studies show that NE modulates the cortex through axonsand has broad implications for mood, cognitive function, andm o v e m e n t[ 2 8 ] .D Ah a sb e e nf o u n dt or e d u c eo x i d a t i v es t r e s s ,increase blood flow to the brain, and coordinate with NE toregulate the body's excitability. In addition, 5-HT modulatescentral cholinergic nerve activity by regulating the release of Ach in brain tissue, which is an important neurotransmitter for mediating intelligence. The decrease of Ach content issuggested to be closely related to the severity of clinicalsymptoms of AD [29]. In recent times, modern medicine has yet to produce an effective prevention and cure for AD. By contrast, traditionalChinese medicine has unique advantages because it is charac-terized by multiple targets and pathways. It holds the opinionthat AD belongs to the category of dementia. Although thebasic pathogenesis is symptoms caused by asthenia, kidneyvacuity and marrow depletion are the basis of the disease [30].In this regard, tonic traditional Chinese medicine may help toimprove AD symptoms. Many reports from cell and animalexperiments found that -amyloid (A)i st h ek e yp r o t e i n in AD patients. The A fragment peptide 1-42 (A1-42) induced exhibits neurotoxic activities as A [33]. Therefore, A1-42 and A25-35 are commonly used as a model method. 4.3. Parkinson's Disease (PD). Parkinson's disease (PD) is another multicentral neurodegenerative disease predomi-nated by movement retardation. It is a complicated and poorly understood pathogenesis, with clinical symptomscharacterized by tremor, slowness of movement, and postural instability caused by various factors. The most significant change in the disease is the decrease in DA levels in thebrain. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for catalyzing the conversion of the amino acid L- tyrosine to L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) [34]. L-DOPA is a precursor for neurotransmitter DA. is dividedinto metabolites by oxidase(MAO) and catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT). Thefi n a lp r o d u c to fD Am e t a b o l i s mi sD O P A Ca n dH V A ,b o t hof which can be used as an indicator for the change of DAcontent in the brain [35]. Traditional Chinese medicine defines PD as belonging to a category of diseases, such as paralysis agitans, thebasic pathogenesis of which involves the liver and kidney.Therefore, the use of Chinese herbal medicine may be helpful in improving and delaying the symptoms of the disease. 4.4. Sleep Disorders. Insomnia is a sleep disorder syndrome whereby sleep quality cannot meet individual physiological needs, resulting in fatigue, lack of attention, and a lag inmental response. Long-term insomnia is harmful to humanphysical and mental health and can cause multiple organdysfunction and immune function decline related to hyper-tension, diabetes, and other mental disorders. The dysfunc-tion of neurotransmitters such as 5-HT and DA are closelylinked with insomnia. According to the theory of traditionalChinese medicine, palpitation, forgetfulness, insomnia, andtiredness are mostly deficiency syndromes. It is advisableto tonify the nerves and tranquilize the mind by tonifyingtraditional Chinese herbal medicine. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in CNS a n di se s s e n t i a lf o rm e d i a t i n gt h eo v e r a l lb a l a n c eb e t w e e nneuronal excitation and inhibition [36]. The molecular targetof medicinal plants with a sedative hypnotic activity involvesthe benzodiazepine site of the GABAA (GABAA-BZD) receptor. GABAergic neurotransmission plays a key role in sleep regulation, and the BZD binding site on the GABAAreceptor is a target for most sedative-hypnotics [37]. BZDagents, such as diazepam, can stimulate the ability of GABAto induce hyperpolarization of membranes by allowing a Cl influx. 4.5. Perimenopausal Syndrome. Perimenopausal syndrome is a series of syndromes characterized by autonomic dys- function caused by the decline of ovarian function and thedecrease of estrogen levels in women during and aroundmenopause. Ovary dysfunction, imbalance of the hypothala-mus pituitary gonadal axis, disorder of sex hormone secre-tion, and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system inperimenopausal women may affect NE, DA, and 5-HT levelsin the hypothalamus [38]. This, in turn, may lead to hotflashes, sweating, irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms.NE and DA are two neurotransmitters with extensive func-tion in the brain and can regulate functional activities ofseveral neurons and correct hyperactivity of central and peripheral sympathetic nerves. As an important neuro- transmitter in the brain, decreased 5-HT levels can reduceimpulses released by the body temperature regulating center,thereby helping to control the frequency and amplitude ofhot flashes representative of menopausal syndrome (MPS).MPS may be improved to a certain extent via the adjustmentand intervention of the above-mentioned neuroendocrinenetworks. The surgical removal of bilateral ovaries fromfemale rats is the main method used for a simulation model ofMPS. For example, studies have found that levels of DA, NE,5-HT, and 5-HIAA in the hypothalamus were significantlyincreased in ovariectomized rats compared with those rats inthe control group [39-41].Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 9 From the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, per- imenopausal syndrome is characterized by deficiencies of the kidney, although dysfunctions of the liver, spleen, andheart are also common [42]. More specifically, the theory ofsyndrome differentiation is an important aspect of traditionalChinese medicine. According to this theory, not only is the condition of the kidney important, but also the condition of the other four major organs in combination with thecondition of the five internal organs is important because thisshows the complexity of pathological change. Medicines fortonifying deficiency have been shown to be satisfactory in thetreatment of perimenopausal syndrome. 5. The Effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine on Neurotransmitters 5.1. Qi-Tonifying Drugs. The common representative oo The following herbs and active ingredients play antide- pressant roles by affecting neurotransmitters. Rhodiola rosea is of the genus Rhodiola and is a plant of the Crassulaceae family of succulent leaf plants. After 1.5, 3,and 6 g/kg treatment of Rhodiola rosea ,5 - H Tl e v e l si nm a l e Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were observed to be significantlyhigher than those of the CMUS group, whereas 5-HT levelsin the medium and high dosage group were normal. In thelow dosage group, however, 5-HT levels were observed to besignificantly higher than those of the control group [43]. Acanthopanax senticosus ( ASE) is of the genus Eleuthero- coccus and is a plant of the Araliaceae family of ivy plants. A. senticosus has been widely used in the treatment of mental disorders for many thousands of years. In terms of theFST, ASE at dosages of 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg wereadministered to male Kunming mice at a weight of 18-20 gover seven days, whereas ASE was observed to significantlyreduce immobility time compared with the control group.Furthermore, ASE was observed to increase 5-HT levels andalso significantly increased DA and NE levels in a dose-dependent manner [44]. Licorice is of the genus Glycyrrhiza and is a plant of the Leguminosae family of flowering plants. It has beenreported that an aqueous extract of G. glabra L. showed significant antidepressant-like activity in mouse immobility tests [45]. A previous study found that a flavone compound, liquiritin, isolated from G. uralensis demonstrated an antide- pressant effect on chronic stress depressed rats [46]. Inthe present study, liquiritin and another flavonoid from G. uralensis , isoliquiritin, were investigated to determine their antidepressant activities. and isoliquiritin are theactive ingredients of Licorice . Liquiritin and isoliquiritin at dosages of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg were observed to significantlydecrease the immobility time in mice during FST and TST. concentrations, liquiritin and isoliquiritin were bothfound to increase 5-HT and NE levels in the hippocampus,hypothalamus, and cortex in mice in both the FST andTST. However, liquiritin and isoliquiritin also significantlydecreased the ratio of 5-HIAA/5-HT in all measured brainregions in both the FST and TST [47]. Ginseng is of the genus Panax and is a plant of the Araliaceae family of ivy plants. Ginseng has been used for mood adjustment in traditional Chinese medicine forthousands of years. The previous study has shown that, total ginsenosides, the major pharmacologically functional ingre- dients of ginseng, possess antidepressant activity [48]. In thepresent study, they hypothesized that an intestinal metaboliteof ginseng, 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (code name S111), as apostmetabolism compound (PMC) of ingested ginsenosides,m a yb er e s p o n s i b l ef o rt h ea n t i d e p r e s s a n ta c t i v i t yo fg i n s e n g .Male Swiss mice weighing 18-22 g were administered S111 atdosages of 3.75, 7 .5, and 15 mg/kg over a treatment period of10 days. The immobility time of the mice was observed todecrease in both the FST and TST. Furthermore, male SDmice at a weight of 200-250 g that underwent an olfactorybulbectomy (OB) were observed to have lower levels of NEa n d5 - H Tt h a nt h o s em i c ew h ou n d e r w e n taF S Ta n dT S T .After treatment with S111 at 13.33 mg/kg and 6.67 mg/kg dailyf o r1 4d a y s ,t h el e v e l so fN Ea n d5 - H Tw e r es i g n i fi c a n t l yhigher than the OB model group [49]. The following herbs and active ingredients may delay the development of PD by affecting the neurotransmitter. Acanthopanax senticosus is of the genus Eleutherococcus and is a plant of the Araliaceae family of ivy plants. The extractofAcanthopanax senticosus was observed to have a neu- roprotective effect against MPTP-induced PD model mice.MPTP can selectively damage neurons in the nigrostriataldopaminergic pathway and cause PD in humans, nonhuman primates, and mice; thus, mice have become widely accepted a sam o d e lf o rP D[ 5 0 ,5 1 ] .A ft e r2 0d a y so ft r e a t m e n t ,t h eDA level of striatum in the low dose group (45.5 mg/kg) wasobserved to significantly increase [52]. Panax quinquefolius is the genus of Panax and is a plant of the family Araliaceae of ivy plants. Pseudoginsenoside-F11 is a unique component and main monomer in Panax quinquefolius [53]. It has been shown to have many beneficial effects in treating disorders of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Aftertreatment with PF11 at dosages of 3, 6, and 12 mg/kg, thelevel of striatal extracellular DA was observed in a dose-dependent manner comparedwith 6-OHDA-lesioned PD model rats. At a high dosage,extracellular DA was observed to recover to normal levels.Furthermore, a noticeable restoration of TH was observed inthe herb-treated group in a dose-dependent manner [54]. Astragalus membranaceus is of the genus Astragalus and is a plant of the Leguminosae family of flowering plants. A. membranaceus is a medicinal plant traditionally used in Chi- nese medicine for several conditions, including inflammatoryand neural diseases. Astragalus polysaccharides can reduce the adverse effects of levodopa and are used in the treatmentof PD [55]. Astragalus a td o s a g e so f1 ,2 ,o r4m g / m li sc a p a b l e of alleviating 6-OHDA-mediated dopaminergic neurodegen- erat ion in BZ555 nematodes. AchE is an indirect indicator of cholinergic system function and provides a helpful strategy for alleviating the behavioral deficit in PD progression. Afterbeing exposed to 6-OHDA, AchE activity was observed todecrease in BZ555 nematodes. This decreased AchE activity10 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine w a so b s e r v e dt ob es i g n i fi c a n t l ye l e v a t e dw h e nt r e a t e dw i t h 2 mg/ml of astragalin, indicating that Astragalus can regulate AchE activity in BZ555 nematodes [56]. The following herbs and active ingredients may improve sleep disorders by affecting neurotransmitters. Licorice is of the genus Glycyrrhiza and is a plant of the Leguminosae family of flowering plants. Glycyrrhiza glabra (GGE) is the root of Glycyrrhiza and is a frequently used natural medicine described as \"the grandfather of herbs\".GGE was observed to decrease sleep latency and increasesleep duration in a dose-dependent manner (50, 100, 250,and 500 mg/kg). Its hypnotic effect was observed to showa statistically significant difference at concentrations of 250and 500 mg/kg compared with the pentobarbital-inducedmodel group. The hypnotic effect observed in this studysuggests that GGE has the potential to exert positive allostericmodulation of GABAA-BZD receptors. The specific GABAA-BZD receptor antagonist flumazenil (FLU) was observed tosignificantly inhibit the hypnotic effects of GGE at a dosageof 500 mg/kg. This indicates that GGE induces sleep viat h eG A B A e r g i cs y s t e ma n dc a na c ta sap o s i t i v ea l l o s t e r i cmodulator on GABAA-BZD receptors to activate glabrolcompounds (50 mg/kg) [57]. Eleutherococcus senticosus is of the genus Eleutherococcus and is a plant of the Araliaceae family of ivy plants. Eleuthero-side E (EE) is a principal component of Eleutherococcus senticosus. The world health organization (WHO) prescribes the anthocyanin E as one of the indicators of Acanthopanaxquality control [58]. In addition, In China Pharmacopoeia2010, the content of anthocyanin E in the Acanthopanax extract was determined [59]. Treatment with EE at dosages of 10 and 50 mg/kg was observed to improve behavioral testsof sleep deprived model mice, such as passive avoidancetask locomotor activity and Y-maze testing. Furthermore,after 72-hour sleep deprivation and EE treatment at a dosageof 50 mg/kg, a significant increase in 5-HT concentrationwas observed. However, the EE (50 mg/kg) treatment groupsignificantly decreased DA concentrations after sleep depri-vation when compared to the control group [60]. 5.2. Blood-Tonifying Drugs. The most common representa- tive medicines of blood-tonifying drugs are peony, Fallopia multiflora, and so on. The following active ingredients play an antidepressant role by affecting neurotransmitters. Peony is of the genus Paeonia lactiflora and is a plant of the Ranunculaceae family of flowering plants. The previous stud- ies found that the total glycoside fraction of peony exertedsignificant antidepressant-like effects in multiple animalmodels of depression [61, Paeoniflorin, the main activecomponent in total glycosides of peony, has been extensivelystudied as an antioxidant, enhancer or learningimpairment-attenuating agent, and a neuroprotective agentr e l a t e dt od e p r e s s i o n .I th a sb e e no b s e r v e dt oi n c r e a s et h esucrose consumption of CMUS-model rats.

As mentioned, Peoniflorin (PF) is a major bioactive ingre- dient in the roots of Radix Paeonia Alba .P Fh a sal o wt o x i c i t y and has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects.After treatment with PF at dosages of 7 .5, 15, and 30 mg/kg, t h el e v e lo fD Aa n dH V Ai ns t r i a t u mw e r es i g n i fi c a n t l y higher than that of the MPTP-treated group, whereas ther a t i oo fH V A / D Aw a sl o w e rt h a nt h a to ft h em o d e lg r o u p .Dopaminergic transporter (DAT) plays a significant role inmediating the return of striatal dopamine. PF at dosages of7 .5, 15, and 30 mg/kg was observed to attenuate the decreaseof DAT and TH the striatum and the substantia nigra [64]. Fallopia multiflora is of the genus Fallopia and is a plant of the Polygonaceae family of knotweed plants. 2,3,5,4 - tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O- -D-glucoside (TSG) is an active extracted from this traditional Chinese herb.2,3,5,4 -Tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O- -D-glucoside (TSG) was isolated from Fallopia multiflora , a plant which is traditionally used as an antiageing drug. TSG at dosages of 20 and40 mg/kg was observed to significantly increase the level ofD A ,D O P A C ,a n dH V Ai nt h es t r i a t u m .T S Ga td o s a g e so f2 0and 40 mg/kg was also observed to attenuate the loss of TH-positive cells induced by MPTP in a dose-dependent manner.A higher dosage was more effective than a lower dosage [65]. 5.3. Yin-Tonifying Drugs. The most common representative medicines of Yin-tonifying drugs are Eclipta, Glossy privet fruit, Lilium brownii, Rhizoma anemarrhenae, and so on. The following active ingredients may delay the develop- ment of AD by affecting the neurotransmitters. Eclipta compositae is of the genus Eclipta and is a plant of the family Compositae of sunflower plants. A model of Alzheimer's disease was established with subcutaneousinjections of D-galactose and microinjection A 25-35 on the bilateral hippocampus of male and female SD rats. Ecliptaalba was observed to improve the learning and memoryfunction of rats in the AD model. Compared with the ADmodel group, however, the incubation period was observedto be prolonged in the step-through test, with error timessignificantly decreased in the high dosage group (24 g/kg).Furthermore, Eclipta alba extract at dose of 24 g/kg was observed to significantly enhance the contents of NE, DA, and5-HT in the hippocampus of AD model rats. In addition, ahigh dosage was also observed to increase ChAT activity andsignificantly decline AchE [66]. The following Yin-nourishing prescription improves symptoms of perimenopausal syndrome by affecting neuro-transmitters. ErzhiBaihe concentrated cream is used for the treatment of early stage of menopause, and consists of tonic herbs,including g/kg) were administered to the modelrats and the level of NE, DA, and 5-HT in their hypothalamuswas observed to decrease. The difference between the highdose group and the model group was also observed to bestatistically significant. These results demonstrate that theErzhi Recipe could rectify hypothalamic neurotransmitterEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 11 disorders and efficiently regulate the endocrine disturbance of model rats [39]. 5.4. Yang-Tonifying Drugs. The most common representative medicines n . The following active ingredients play an antidepressant role by affecting neurotransmitters. Psoralea corylifolia is of the genus Psoralea and is a plant of the Leguminosae family of flowering plants. The previous studies demonstrated that the total furocoumarins extractsofP. corylifolia had the potent antidepressant properties by e m p l o y i n gt h ef o r c e ds w i m m i n gt e s t( F S T )[ 6 7 ] .P s o r a l e nis a main furocoumarin isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia .M a l em i c eo ft h eI C Rs t r a i na taw e i g h to f2 3 - 2 5g were administered psoralen at dosages of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kgover a 14-day treatment period. At the end of treatment,immobility time was observed to significantly increase in theFST, with 20 and 40 mg/kg dosages significantly increasingswimming time. While psoralen treatment was not observedto affect the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio, psoralen at a dosage of 20 mg/kg significantly increased 5-HT levels in the hip- p o c a m p u sa n df r o n t a lc o r t e xo ft h em i c e[ 6 8 ] . The following herbs and active ingredients may delay the development of AD by affecting the neurotransmitter. Morinda officinal is of the genus Morinda and is a plant of the Rubiaceae family of flowering plants. Morinda officinalis mainly contains compounds and inorganic elements suchas sugar, quinone, amino acids, lipids, and organic acids[69]. Among them, the content of oligosaccharide is up to50%, the composition is complex, and the pharmacologicalaction is obvious. Bajijiasu is a oligosaccharide monomerisolated from Morinda officinalis , and it has the activity of invigorating the kidney and brain, which can obviouslyimprove the behavior of vascular dementia rats [70]. Inthe Alzheimer's disease (AD) model, male SD rats wereinjected with A 25-35 into the bilateral CA1 region of the hippocampus. Bajijiasu at dosages of 8, 24, and 48 mg/kg wasobserved to ameliorate A -induced learning and memory d y s f u n c t i o nc o m p a r e dw i t ht h eA Dm o d e lg r o u p .Th ee s c a p elatency of each BJ-treated group was significantly shorter inthe Morris water maze. After Bajijiasu was administered atdifferent concentrations, the levels of Ach, 5-HT, and DA weref o u n dt os i g n i fi c a n t l yi n c r e a s ew h i l eA c h Ed e c r e a s e d[ 7 1 ] . Cistanche tubulosa (CT) is of the genus Cistanche and is a plant of the family Orobanchaceae of parasitic plants. Alldoses of CT (100, 200 mg/kg) extract significantly increasedthe time spent in the platform-quadrant of the Morris watermaze and increased the step-through latency of the inhibitoryavoidance task compared to A 1-42-infused male SD rats. A1-42 was observed to decrease the expression of DA a n dA c hi nt h eh i p p o c a m p u s ,w h i c hc o u l db ei m p r o v e dby the aqueous extracts of CT at a dosage of 200 mg/kg.Furthermore, CT extract (200 mg/kg) was observed to reduceACHE and MAO-A cortical activity in the model group after15 days treatment [72]. The following herbs and active ingredients may delay the development of PD by affecting the neurotransmitters.Fructus Alpinia oxyphylla (AOE) is of the genus Alpinia and is a ripe fruit of the Zingiberaceae family of floweringplants. AOE was observed to increase locomotor activity in6-OHDA-treated Zebrafish . Furthermore, AOE at dosages of 6 and 12 ug/ml was observed to significantly attenuate theloss of the DA Neuron of 6-OHDA induced in Zebrafish . Furthermore, the DA neuron almost completely recovered bygiving high doses of AOE [73]. Psoralea corylifolia is of the genus Psoralea and is a plant of the Leguminosae family of flowering plants. Themonoterpenoids are dominant components in the \"volatileoils\" of plant species and 3, 2 - h y d r o x yb a k u c h i o l( B U )i sa n important monoterpene phenol compound in Psoralea coryli- 5.44, 16.32, or 48.96 mg/kg was observed to significantly inhibit the uptake of DA in striatalsynaptosomes and NE in the hippocampal synaptosomes ofmale SD rats. BU at dosages of 4, 20, or 100 mg/kg was alsoobserved to significantly inhibit the decrease of TH-positiveneuronal populations in the substantia nigra (SN) of MPTPmodel male C57BL/6J mice [75]. The following active ingredients may improve sleep dis- orders by affecting neurotransmitters. Fructus Alpinia oxyphylla is of the genus Alpinia and is a ripe fruit of the Zingiberaceae family of flowering plants.Glutamic acid (Glu) is a main excitatory neurotransmitterin the central nervous system (CNS). An increase in ther e l e a s eo fG l uc a ni n d u c ee x c i t a t o r yn e u r o t o x i c i t y .Th er a t i oof GABA/Glu plays a critical role in the balance of excitationand inhibition in neurons. Compared with the control group,the levels of Glu amino acid neurotransmitters were observedto increase, whereas GABA was significantly decreased inthe cortex and hypothalamus during rapid eye movement(REM) sleep deprivation. However, the group of volatile oilsextracted from Alpinia oxyphylla Fructus (VOA) (9, 27 g/kg) reversed the increase in Glu and decreased GABA comparedto the model group [76]. 5.5. Tonify Deficiency deficiency prescriptions contain Qi-tonifying, Blood-tonifying, Yin- tonifying, and Yang-tonifying drugs which are compatible with each other. The following prescription may delay the development of PD by affecting the neurotransmitters. Jia-Jian-Di-Huang-Yin-Zi (JJDHYZ) decoction is a the treatment of long-term neurological disorders. JJDHYZ at a high concentration of 34 g/kg was observed to improvethe variation tendency in behavioral pole tests. Furthermore,the injection of MPTP was also observed to demonstrateneurotoxic effects and induce a reduction of dopamine (DA),homovanillic (HVA), and dihydroxyphenylacetic (DOPAC)acids compared with the control group. JJDHYZ at a concen-tration of 34 g/kg significantly rescued the depletion of DA,DOPAC, and HVA in comparison with the MPTP group [77]. The following prescriptions improve symptoms of peri- menopausal syndrome by affecting neurotransmitters.12 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine A herbal recipe derived from Danggui Buxue Decoction consists of Folium Epimedii ( RRF), with a ratio of 5 : 1 : 5. The three are Yang-tonifying, Blood-enriching, and Qi-supplementing drugs, respectively. Medium concentrations (282 mg/kg/d)of RRF were observed to significantly inhibit increased hypothalamic NE in rats after they were ovariectomized, whereas high concentrations (564 mg/kg/d) of RRF wereobserved to significantly reduce the increased hypothalamicDA level in model rats. Finally, high and low concentrations(564 and 141 mg/kg/d) of RRF significantly reduced theincreased hypothalamic 5-HT level in the model How-ever, levels of 5-HIAA and the 5-HT concentrations of RRF [40]. Bushen Liaogeng Extract (BLE) is effective in the clinical treatment of perimenopausal syndrome and is prepared fromseveral p a r e dw i t ht h e model group, hypothalamic DA, NE, 5-HT, and 5-HIAA lev-els in mice from the low, medium, and high dose BLE groups(4.5, 9, and 18 g/kg) were significantly decreased. Therefore,this suggests that BLE can regulate the level of monoamineneurotransmitters in the hypothalamus of ovariectomizedmice by restoring its normal status and improving disorderedautonomic nervous function during menopause [41]. 6. Summary and Future Prospects The neurotransmitter related diseases such as depression, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, sleep disorders,and perimenopausal syndrome are complicated disorders and their pathogenesis remains unclear. These diseases are c l o s e l yc o r r e l a t e dw i t ht h ed y s r e g u l a t i o no fc e n t r a ln e u r o - transmitters. At present, there exists no clinically effective medicines available for the treatment of these diseases given their obvious side effects. The theory of traditional Chinese medicine believes that the pathogenesis of such diseases iscomplicated, involving the Yin-Yang and the Qi-blood of five internal organs. Previous studies have demonstrated that tonic Chinese medicine can improve the symptoms of diseasea n dp r o l o n gt h ed e v e l o p m e n to fd i s e a s e sb ys u p p l e m e n t i n gQi, enriching blood, nourishing Yin, and strengthening Yang. An increasing amount of studies have documented that tonic Chinese medicine plays a therapeutic role and can regulatethe secretion of central nervous system neurotransmitters, such as 5-HT, DA, and NE by multicomponent, multichannel, and multitarget therapy. In the future, the exact target, location, and mechanism of the effective ingredient andfunction of tonic Chinese medicine should be investigated.
