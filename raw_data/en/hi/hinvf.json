Anexcellent history of the Trusthas also been written jointly by Professor A.R.Hall and Dr. B.A.Bembridge to mark the Jubilee. ItisentitledPhysic and Philanthropy and describes the Trust's activities since its inception in 1936. The last two years have been exciting ones for us. Not only has the Trust attainedits fiftieth year, but the Trustees have put on the open market twenty-one per cent of theirshareholding in Wellcome pic. I would like to express my own personal tributeto the work done by the Director, his staff and everyone associated with the Trust in achieving theseimportant milestones.

Thisdevelopment was of such significance to the thatit is described in somedetailin raise the Trust'sincomefrom \u00a320 to\u00a335million and therefore many majorchangesin theprogramme, requirements of theTrust.In ordertomaketheprocessofchangelesssudden,theTrustees anticipated the growth byone yearby using a considerable proportion oftheirreserves in the first year of this biennium. Thebudgetfor the two years was in 1984/85\u00a322.75 million,and in 1985/86 \u00a330.4 million. Thetotalof \u00a353.5 million with million overtheprevious two years. Thisscaleofactivity in Britain,wheretheTrustallocates makes it the largestgeneralmedicalresearch charityinBritainand com\u00ad parablein size with the funds available to the Medical Research Council (M.R.C.) forsupportofresearch in theuniversities. While it is difficult tomeasure theactualcontribution ofvarioussections of thecommunity to medical research, the figures from the Association of Medical Research Charities (A.M.R.e.) indicatethatthecharitable contribution iscompa\u00ad theuniversities. This is a changeinbalancewhich has begun to affect the whole organisation ofmedicalresearch inBritain. While the government has failed to expanditscontribution, thecharities have grown and with it theirsignificance. Whereas previously thecharities couldbe classed as alternative sourcesof funding for university research, now they have becomeof such significance that some institutions are in the positionof receiving the majority oftheir supportfromprivatesourcesand thebalancefrom the government. Our universities and medical schools can be seen to be gearingthemselves to this newsituation andhencetheirattitudetodonorshasevolved. Areport from the Advisory fundinginthemedical fieldbut only certain circumstances and, overall, to only a limited extent.Itisclearaboveallthat the foundations wouldneed reassurance that Government wasnot lookingto them to assumeresponsibility for meetingbasicresearchneedsandwasnot seekingtoenticethe foundations 3into the formal Governmental funding mechanisms for such research. We respect the determination of thefoundations to retain their independence, flexibility and diversity.\" On theotherhand,thecentralrole of the National HealthService on the clinical side limits the opportunity for developing academic clinical re\u00ad search. The example of theSeniorRegistrar quotasysteminwhich the Department ofHealthand Social Security failed to recognise the level of input of the charities toacademic medical training, forced the A.M.R.e. to develop into a charitable company inordertosafeguard its members' interestswhich, of course,means the interestof the medical research com\u00ad munity. What is apparent isthat the long established system of negotiation between theuniversities, research councils and government, is now not enough as the government fails toprovidethe level of supportnecessary tomaintain Britainin thefront-line of medical research. This brings one toconsider the overall turmoil thathascontinued to affect the academic medical world in the past few years. In medicine, this has led for example to theamalgamation of medical schools in London, Middlesex and Uni\u00ad versity College, Charing Cross and Westminster, and theexploration of thefutureof the Clinical Research Centreand the Royal Postgraduate Medical School. The Royal College of Physicians feels the problem of academic medicine to be of such significance thatit ispreparing areporton the subject. levelsofsalary andcareerprospects. In theveterinary world this has also been a time of scrutiny and intros\u00ad pection.Thereis ageneralopinionthatfarming has become so efficient that the need for more government investment in research isnot apparent. As aconsequence, therehave been enormous cuts in the establishments of theAgriculture and Food Research Council and the veterinary schools are being examined to see how theymay be cut down in numberor amal\u00ad gamated. Overall, a scene which has not augured well forveterinary re\u00ad searchmoraleand which is possibly reflected in the difficulty in spending the funds allocated to this field by the Trustees. While the flotation of Wellcome pic and the generalpolitical scene for academic humanand animal medicine has been at the forefront of our minds during the past two years as we have sought to develop newpolicies for the use of ourextraincome, not far from the surface was the 50th anniversary of SirHenryWellcome's deathon July 25th 1936. The cele\u00ad brationof a golden jubileeis,inevitably, a time for reflection\u00b7 on the 4achievement of an organisation and so the Trustees were very pleased when Professor A.RupertHall,together with Dr. B.A. Bembridge, un\u00ad dertooktopreparea history of the Trust. This history, Physic and Phi\u00ad lanthropy: A History ofthe Wellcome Trust, was published by the Cambridge University Press on 21st November 1986and gives a very in\u00ad teresting an analysisofthe Trust's records.Itcan besummed up as the tale of how a board of Trustees disentangled the willin which Sir HenryWellcome had so interwoven the affairs of his pharmaceutical company with his philanthropic activities as to makemanagement very difficult. Their achievement has been the sep\u00ad aration ofthe charity, the Wellcome Trust,with itsInstitutes ofthe History of Medicine and Tropical Medicine, from the public pharmaceutical com\u00ad pany in which the Trustees continue to hold a 75% shareholding. Inad\u00ad dition, the history also describes some of the many medical research projects that have been supported by the Trust throughtheexpenditure of \u00a3168,000,000. (See pages 27-33.) Thecelebration of the 50th year of the Trust has led to a numberofother accounts being written aboutit. Thustherewas a very interesting remi\u00ad niscence by Lord Frankson his 17 years as chairman from 1965to 1982 (reproduced on pages 35 to 39) and a Focus reportinThe Times which concentrated on the special role of the Trust in the medical research scene. Theopportunity has also been takento publish a brochure describing the Trust and to prepareaposterexhibition. The central event of the 50th year, which is being celebrated during 1986\u00ad 87,wasa Soiree in the Wellcome Building, which HerMajesty The Queen andHRHPrince Philip The DukeofEdinburgh graciously attended. At this Soiree thereweredemonstrations of the activities of the Trust for the 450 guests. Inaddition, during the year thereare exhibitions, seminars etc., at universities and scientific societies all over the country to dem\u00ad onstratethe way in which the Wellcome Trustsupports medicalresearch (see special reporton pages 49 to 57). The result of the flotation has not only been to make more funds available, but also to make the Trustbetterknown. This inevitable raising of our profile, now compounded bythe 50th Anniversary celebrations and placed againstthe background of theshortage offunds available from government sources, has resulted in an almost overwhelming increase in the number of applications that have been submitted to the Trust. Faced with this pressure, the Trust had to expandits system for assessingapplications and increase its staff and accommodation. 5The first step was to turn the top floor of 1Park Square West into offices and to recruit staff to run the new panels of advisers that were added to those already in being. Thus, new panels were createdinBiochemistry and Cell Biology, Physiology and Pharmacology, and Clinical Medicine, and a Working Party on Vision was also started.These added to the Tropical, Veterinary, Mental-Health,and History of Medicine panels, mean that theTrustees now have a large numberof advisers to help them in the development oftheir policyfor the variousfieldsthey support.These panels areunderthechairmanship of individual Assistant Directors of theTrustresponsible for theprogrammes. TheTrustis thusorganised and ready to take on the new tasks that have evolved as a result of the increased funds that have become available. Inorderto explore the policy optionsand decide how the funds could be most suitably used to developthestrengthandpotential of British medical research, theTrustees first sought the comments of their advisory panels and held conversations with various organisations in the medical research field such as the M.R.C., University Vice-Chancellors, heads of various organisations and societies. At a meeting the Trustees and their seniorstaff then explored the various options open to them. Thiswide-ranging meeting ledtothe mainconclusion that the Trust would continue toconcentrate its resources on the interface between biomedical science and clinical medicine although it might also explore the needs of healthservices research. No new specific neglected topics were identified for special attention and the main policy themethatemerged was that the Trust could now, with itslarger and more predictable income, spend one-third ofitsoverallbudget on thelonger-term supportof individuals and createresearch units around them.Therewas special concern thatthe overall research morale of the country waslowand that the attractions of thebetter-funded opportunities of theU.S.A.andEuropewere seducing some of the country's most talentedgraduates and that part of the policy should therefore be aimed atattracting some of these individuals to returnto this country. Thisgeneralpolicy will take time to implement as the identification of suitable individuals is a slow process and creationof units takes time and negotiation. However, one unit in the Veterinary Parasitology field, to be directed by Dr. Tait in Glasgow and based on his expertise and that of Dr. Barry, anotherTrustSeniorLecturer, is an illustration of the type of 6patternthatmay beappropriate forothersubjects. While making the necessary preliminary movestowardsthislonger-term programme, theTrustdecidedtoadvertise a scheme for the provision of major items of equipment. A ceiling of \u00a31.5 million was projected, but in the event over \u00a311million was requested by 112applicants and theTrustees decided to pre-empt some of theirbudgetfrom the following year and award \u00a33 million to 32 applicants. Theprocessofscreening the many applications submitted wasmonumental and the panels and staff had to workveryhard. Inevitably, manyapplicants weredisappointed. The overall result was to show the greatneed for equipment and the lack of resources to meet the demand. (Further detailson pages 221 to 226.) Two areas of medical research havecausedtheTrustconsiderable concern during the past two years - Clinical Medicine and Clinical Tropical Med\u00ad icine. The formeris amajornational problem. Thereportof the Royal College of Physicians, which has alreadybeenmentioned, drawsattention to the damaging factors. Whatis obviously neededis a more efficient education system which selects, at an early stage,the likely candidates and ensuresthatthey receive the requisite basic science and clinical experience as quickly as possible so as to equipthemfor acareerin clinical research. These individuals must thenbefostered and given the necessary support sothat they can act asthe interface between the basicsciencesand medicine and their clinical application. Such adevelopment willnecessitate the co\u00ad operation ofuniversity and medical authorities who have been,unfortu\u00ad nately, too preoccupied withday-to-day economies to planimaginatively for thefuture.One gap thattheTrusthasattempted to bridge is that between basic science and clinical medicine, by making awards - following advertisement - insupportoftheapplication ofmolecular biologytoclinical problems. The long-standing schemes of theTrust,such as the Senior ClinicalResearch Fellowships, continue and it has been pleasing during the past two years to note thatnine more of ourfellows have gone on to chairs and otherseniorappointments. (See pages 63 to 70.) Tropical Medicine continues to be amajorprogramme of the Trust and \u00a38million has beenallocated to this field duringthe past two years. There are many sources of short-term grants.However, the stability of this field and itsfutureisaffectedby theincreasing difficulty of getting training, let alone acareerin clinical tropicalmedicine. Thisproblem has been fre\u00ad quently raised by the Trustfor years, and the Director isChairman of aCommittee ofInterested PartiesinTropical Medicine which decided to set up a working party to reportonfuturerequirements for this field. 7Aninitiative was also The Director and Sir Kenneth visited the Secretary General and with his encouragement a pro\u00ad posal was madeto theMinisters ofHealth.This led to a to the Ministers meetingin theBahamas inOctober. Theircommunique indicated that this initiative may lead to the re-establishment, inter alia, of a cadre of expe\u00ad riencedclinicaltropicalresearch is ofProfessor E.H.O.Parry as Director of theWellcome Tropical (W.T.I.). In his first year he hasbeenplanning thefutureof theInstitute based on a reappraisal of the function of its museum (formerly theWellcome Museum of Medical Sci\u00ad ence) and the development of adistance learning programme for Africa. Themethodology fortheseactivities hasneededconsiderable thought, but theW.T.I.isnow well founded andshouldsoon be showing its new aspect. TheHistoryofMedicine occupies aspecial place in the Trust'sprogramme. Thesetwo years have demonstrated its viability and progressiveness. The most significant eventhas been the purchase by theTrustof the Wellcome Building from the Wellcome Foundation Ltd. While no arrangements have yet been made for the Company tovacatethebuilding, planning has begun, nevertheless, to see how thatbuildingshouldbe used in the futureto house based on astrategic planprepared for theW.I.H.M. and suggestions of steps to encourage furtherinterestandcoverage of thesubject. Duringthe two years, two new units have beenestablished in Glasgow and Manchester, but thegroupinEdinburgh has been discontinued. Theothershave con\u00ad tinuedtheirvery full programmes. TheInstitute itself has been very active, bothacademically and inthe automation ofits library. The field nowthrives thepresentfinancial climate does not give much hopefor anyfurtherinvolvement of the universities in thesubjectsupported basedontheirown funds.

The senior scientificstaff of the Trust have also changed little except for the appointment of Dr. James Howard F.R.S.,formerly Director of Biomedical Research with the Wellcome Foundation, to take over re\u00ad sponsibilitiesforTropical Medicineand Infectious Diseasesfrom Dr. B.M. Ogilvieso as to free her to take more responsibilities as Deputy Director (Science). On the administrative side, Mr. Ian Macgregor took up his appointment as Deputy Director (Finance and Administration) on 1st January, 1985 following theretirement of Mr. K.C. Stephenson as Financial Controller and Mr.M.A.F.Barren as Chief Administrative Officer. Within a short time he became deeply involved in the plans for the flotation and during the period May 1985to February 1986,he worked extremely hard on this development. Nevertheless, hefound timeto reorganise the administrationof the Finance and Personnel departments initiate a staff grading systemforthe variousemployeesofthe Trust. Inthishe wasgreatlyhelped by Mrs. Iris Sargeant of the staff of the Wellcome Foundation Ltd. Mr. Macgregormore recently took charge of the administrative arrangements for the Soiree and chaired the Soiree Committee. As part of the reorgan\u00ad isation and to help in the management of the large buildings now owned by the Trust, Mr. D.G.Metcalfe was promoted to Chief Administrative Officerand Mrs. Linda Arterwaspromoted from Assistant Administrative Officerto Administrative Officer especially to assist with the grants pro\u00ad gramme. Mr. D.C. Richardson was appointed as Property Manager and Mr. H. Gleave joined the Trust on 1st September, 1986as Information SystemsManager to set up computerised systemsfor the Trust. MissBetty Hardy retired as Accounts Officer on 6th October, 1986. She had been the righthand of Mr. Stephenson during histenure asFinancial Controller andserved the Trust for nearly nine years withgreat devotion. The Trust's staffoverall increased from 38 to 50 during the past two years. Professor A.R.Hall retired from hispart-time post as Co-ordinator of the History of Medicine Programme, butreturned to be joint secretary of a WorkingParty on the History of Medicine. A dinner washeld inProfessor 15Hall'shonouron 30thOctober, 1986to thank him for serving the Trust in so many ways as a member, thenchairman of the History of Medicine Panel,Co-ordinator of the History of Medicine Programme andHonorary Chairman of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine. Mr. William Anderson joinedthe staff of the Trust in February 1986to take charge of the External Relations of the Trust and the History of Medicine programme. Hebroughtstimulus and energy to this new de\u00ad partment andrecruited excellent staff. When he left in October1986,his assistants, Rebecca Cheeseman and Caroline Kay helped by Mrs. Janet Campbell (recruited temporarily for the Soiree) did sterling work for the Soiree and the year-long celebrations of the Golden Jubilee of the Trust.

During the 1970sthe experience of the Nuffield Foundation and the the the Trust\u00ad ees. In the 1980sthe appointment ofa newChairman and ofa new Trustee, eachexperienced in the world of business and finance (Sir David Steel and Mr. Roger Gibbs) createdanopportunity forfurtherreconsideration of the nature of the Trust'sinvestments. At the end of 1984 the Trustees unanimously agreed thatthe time had arrived when urgent consideration should be given to ways and means for diversifying the Trust'sassets. After taking leading Counsel's opinion, Sir David Steel and Dr. Williams made an approach to the Chief Charity Commissioner. This met with a favourable response. The Trustees selectedRobertFleming &Co. Limited to act asfinancial advisers to the Trustandinstructed theTrust'ssolicitors Cameron Markby (led by Russell DenoonDuncan) to deal with the legal aspects. Followingdiscussions with the Foundation, whoseco-operation would be animportant elementin a successfulexercise, proposals for sale of part of theTrust'sholding were announced in May 1985and, in July 1985, the CharityCommissioners' Scheme was sealed. The Scheme permitted the Trustees, with the consent of the Charity Commission, to dispose of part ofitsinterestintheFoundation provided that theTrusteesretainedcontrol. In announcing the proposals Sir David Steel said: 'The Trustees have for some time been concerned about the wisdom of having all their eggsin one basket notwithstanding the excellence of that basket. They have taken professional advice and have now decided on thiscourse ofaction. This willenable the Trust to diversifyitsinvestments and increase its aid to medical research at a time when funds are badly needed. At the same time the integrity and independence of the Foun\u00ad dation will be preserved and the close links between the Trust and the Foundation willbemaintained. Those who work in the Foundation have, over the generations, built a fine and substantial business of which they are rightly proud,and I am glad to say that it is the intention of the Trustees to retain control of this enterprise. TheTrust'sprimary duty is to pursue its charitable objects,but it is also mindful of the welfare of theFoundation's employees and of the Foundation's long established traditions.' 21Theflotation wasplannedfor early 1986and was to comprise an offer for sale by the Trustees to the public of just over twenty per cent of the share capital of the Foundation and inaddition a direct issue to the public by theFoundation of afurtherfive percentof itssharecapital. The flotation Aspartofthearrangements for theflotation anewpublicholding company, Wellcome pic, was incorporated and it was the shares of this Company thatwere listed on the Stock Exchange, the Wellcome Foundation Limited continuing to be the main operating company. Afteracarefulreview by the financial advisers a price of 120 pence per share was fixed, valuing the Company at just over \u00a31 billion, the offer for sale closing on 7th February 1986. The issue, the largest ever made by a privatecompany in theUnitedKingdom, wasexceptionally well received andapplications exceeded thenumberofshareson 430,000 applications forshareswerereceived, thatnumberitself al\u00ad most arecord,totalling some \u00a34.5 billion in the sale payableto theTrustwere of the orderof \u00a3200 million and the Trusthasbeenable to diversify its investments accordingly underthemanagement of four leading financial institutions. By the end of September 1986(thenewaccounting year end) those funds wereinvestedin morethan300individual holdings in U.K.gilts, and U.K. and U.S. listed equitiesand themid-market value of these investments wasapproaching \u00a3210 million. The remaining 632 million shares in Well\u00ad comecontinue to be held and the middle marketquotation for Wellcome picsharesatthatdatewas\u00a31.92. Ifthis value was appliedto the 632million shares,theholdingwould be worth \u00a31.21 billion. Turningto the effects of the flotation of Wellcome on the Trust'sincome, the financial year 1985/86can best be described astransitional. Thepattern for timing of payments ofdividends by Wellcome pic means that the final dividend for their1985/86 year will not be paid until January1987 (the Trust's1986/87year).Thus the income received from Wellcome fell from \u00a325.3 million in the Trust's1984/85 year to \u00a312.7 million in the 1985/86 year.However, the 1985/86year income is enhanced bythe income earned andprofitsmadebytheinvestment managers inthe seven and ahalfmonths that they held the money(\u00a310.5 million). So, in spite of the change, the Trust'sincome in 1985/86shows no majormove forward compared with 22theprevious year.However. will December, theactivitiesofthe Trust. brief Physic Philanthropy:A Historyofthe Wellcome SirHenryWellcome on 25th July 1936,his solicitors, G.H.H.

AsWellcome hadexplained in some research or inlibrariesandmuseums. Thelaboratories, museums andlibrariesfounded byWellcome, however, were left to the care of his business organisation, theFoundation; it was only in 1960 thatthe first of these was takenover by theTrustees; the last was transferred tothemin 1985. Forthe first halfof its life, the Trust'saffairs were modest: by 1950 less thanaquarterof a million poundshadbeengrantedforresearch support of all kinds.

AfterSir JohnBoydsucceeded T.R.Elliottas aTrusteein 1955, and Sir John McMichael tookSirHenryDale'splace from 1960, tropical medicine and clinicalresearch attracted more of the Trustees' funds.Notably, Sir John McMichael proposed the scheme for SeniorClinicalResearch Fellows (1962). With LordPiercy at the Trustand Sir Michael Perrinat the Foun\u00ad dation,organisationally and financially the Trustbegan to move ahead rapidly.

Variousnew fellowship schemes andexchange agreements were begun. The Historical Museum and Library wereunitedandproperly established so as to be usable by the public. Thoughstillundertheshadowof the Medical Research Council - all the Scientific Trustees and theSecretaries had served the nationalbody - the Trustwasacquiring acharacter and lines of action of its own. Duringthe long Chairmanship of Lord Franks(1965-82) the Wellcome Trustattained independence andmaturity. The funds devotedto medical newpolicy from 1964onwards, theTrustees greatlyreducedtheirexpenditure on physical plantin favour of the new Fellowship andgrantprogrammes that they initiated, and a more generous response tospontaneous requests for re\u00ad searchsupport, especially inselected topics. The expansion of the work, and the more positive policy of the Trustees indetermining thenatureof research, combined torendernecessary an increase in administrative staff, and anexpertcommittee system was introduced tomonitoraward-making. As theeuphoric academic moodof impoverishment, theTrustees have endeavoured tofosterthoseindividuals and those lines of research that seemedtopromise most for the well-being of men and animals.

THOUGHTS ON THE WELLCOMETRUST 1963-82 by LORD FRANKS, OM This article by inMedicalHistoryVol. 30: No. atime of majorchange. The Old Guardamong theTrustees and theSecretariat were retiring and new faces were appearing. Above all, for the first time, the Trust'sannual income from the Wellcome Foun\u00ad dation had reached\u00a31,000,000 or more, with every prospect of an income of this size being maintained orincreased. All this indicated that the mo\u00ad ment had come to look at howthe activitiesoftheTrust should beorganised and what policies should be followed. The years from 1936, when the Trust was set up after the death of Sir Henry Wellcome, had been full of difficulties. Before the war, payment of death duties on Sir Henry'sestatehadabsorbed theattention of the Trustees and all the money that might have come to the Trust. The years of the war were necessarily an interregnum, but even after it the Trustees continued to faceproblems with the Wellcome Foundation, for which, as the owners, they had responsibilities. Threetimes the Trustees had to replace the Chairman (of theFoundation. Itwas not until 1953, when MichaelPerrinbecameChairman, thatsteadyimprovement began, but in hisearlierYErsthe capital needs of the Foundation were sogreat that the Trustees ag eed to accept less income than they could have had so that theFoundaion could finance its expansion. Itwas for these causes that onlyaboutthe time I became a Trusteehad the Trust a sizeable income to spend. Throughout thisperiod,SirHenryDale was the leading figure among the Trustees. He took the decisions, both scientificand administrative: indeed, withonlymild exaggeration itcould besaidhewastheTrust. Hissuccessors must be for ever indebted to him.Itwashe who insisted that the intentions of SirHenryWellcome on scientific medical research should be honoured, and who navigated the shipskilfullyand safelythrough the troubledwaters of the time. He served as Chairman till 1960,when he waseighty-five, and thereafter, with Lord Piercy as Chairman, sat on his right hand as Chief ScientificAdviser. Sir HenryDale was active in the office when I arrived. 36It was only in 1965 when he had the misfortune to breaka hip that he retired to Cambridge. Almost simultaneously, Sir John Boyd retired: as a Trustee,he had worked closelywith Dale on the scientific activities of the Trust. In the mid-sixties, therefore, with the chief navigators gone, the Trustees had to chart a new future. John McMichael and RobertNesbitt were already in place. RobertThompson joinedwith me in 1963.In 1965came Lord Murray of Newhaven and in 1966 HenryBarcroft. We were a new team. Early on, we appointed PeterWilliams, who had recently come to usfrom theM.R.C., to be Secretary to the Trust. and laterbyDr.Hopwood and Dr.Bembridge. PeterWilliams the Trust in 1969 with the othersas Assistant Directors. A newadministration had been created, staffed by experienced and medically qualified people. A newadministrative staff and a newteam of Trustees. I believe something has evolved from the inter-relationship andco-operation between these two groups which is novel, at least in my experience, amongcharitable trusts. They have been able to treateachotheras equals in the origination of ideas and policies while observing theirdifference of function. The final responsibilityon all applications for grants lies with the Trustees, but they have been happy to listen to and discuss possible projectsand policies put forward by the administrative staff without feeling in any way that their position was challenged, something hard to imagine in earliereras of the Trust's history. The medical trusteesare busy men and women, eminent in their profession and possessed of a wide knowledge of pre-clinical and clinical research, but their main jobs lie outside the Trust. They give a great deal of time, hard work and enthusiasm to their work for the Trust, going into applications for grants withgreat care, evaluating them, and deciding whether help should be given and, if so, how much. But their task would be impossible unless underpinned andcomplemented by that of theadministrative staff.PeterWilliams himself has beenaperpetual fountain ofnewideas aboutpolicy, and soinher time was EddaHanington, and so have been the otherand succeeding members of the administration. It is out of the interchanges between the two groups, open, vigorous, friendlyargument based upon mutual trust,thatthecharacteristic outlook of the Trust has been formed. The first result of this new state of affairs was the institution of annual 37policymeetings ofthe Trust,the first in 1966,when the Trustmeets outside Londonfor two whole days to have time to think what it should be doing, debatepriorities, and sodecide upon policiesand budgets to match, instead of simply responding to thestreamof specific requests for grants. The value ofthese annualmeetings, at theheartoftheTrust'sactivity,isproved by the fact that they have gone on now for twenty years. From the first of these policy meetings two important decisions emerged. It was decided thattheTrustshould no longer,as it had been doing, give up to half its total income in capital grants for buildings and equipment to supportmedicalresearch. Its function was not to act as a substitute for thegovernment inproviding funds for normal university building. At one blowaconsiderable sum of money was releasedfor use in otherways.The Trustees gained a new freedom of flexibility and choice. The second de\u00ad cision was equally important. TheTrustees asked themselves whether it wasadequate, as had been the practice, simply to respond to ad hoc requests, anddecidedthat it was not. They were now prepared to take a positive line and suggest subjects for research: they would finance those qualified and willing to respondtotheirsuggestions. This in its way was arevolution. Thereexisteda built-in belief that it was for scientists them\u00ad selves to think and proposeprojects, while the role of institutions such as the Wellcome Trustwas toprovidesupportfor them. This tradition was abandoned, and inthe first instancetheTrustees identified four'neglected' orunderdeveloped subjects, thatis subjects where and clinical research wasinadequate: derma\u00ad tology,neurology, mentalhealthand tropical medicine. They determined to seek out professors and university departments where research of high calibre could be successfully carriedout: they would then finance the men andequipment needed. TheTrustees did notabandon theirtraditional supportfor topics emanating fromresearchers in universities, but they addedtheirnewdimensions of policy and action. As a result the Trustees, according totheirperception of changingcircum\u00ad stances and changing needs,have been able to modify the thrust of their programmes from time to time. Therehas been over the years a stream ofnewinitiatives. I mentionbywayof illustration the setting upofResearch Fellowships in Surgery in 1972and similar action in Pathology in 1976,the offering of majorcompetitive awards in the same year for research in selectedsubjectswhichcombined interdisciplinary approaches to the prob\u00ad lems, and in 1979the institution of the Senior Lectureship Programme to strengthen themanpower andresearch capacity of medical departments inuniversities, to offset in partthesqueezeon resources for research from 38which they were suffering. I suppose that,if the relationship of the ad\u00ad ministrativestaffand medical trusteeshas formed the characteristic quality of the Wellcome Trust,then this positive approach to the identification andpromotion of research topics has been its second hallmark. Besides medical research, theTrustees all through my time had a second preoccupation, the History of Medicine. Sir Henry Wellcome in his will hadmade provisionfor the supportofresearch into the history ofmedicine and he had formed his great collections for this purpose, a Library con\u00ad taining a magnificent collection of books, manuscripts and paintings and a Museum collection which comprised far more objects, medical and nonmedical, than could ever be exhibited in one place at one time. In 1960,uncertainties between the Trust and the Wellcome Foundation were resolved and the Museum and Library became the sole responsibility of the Trustees. Through the 1960sand the 1970s, the Trustees progressively formulated their policies for the future of the History of Medicine. Therewas a con\u00ad straint upon them: they should not divert too great a proportion of the funds available to them from scientific medical research to the history of medicine, and yet the lattermust beproperly developed. They took three decisions. The first was that the quality of the collection in the Library wassohighand itsdirect relevance to the history ofmedicine so great that its needs must be given priority over those of the Museum. In the second place, the Library became the Wellcome Institute, a place for graduate studies in the history of medicine, staffed by scholars expert in the main fields of the collection. By a happy arrangement with University College and the University of London, suitable members of the academic staff of theInstituteare recognised as teachers by the University of London and cantherefore take on university responsibilities, including the supervision of students for higher degrees. The Institute has become a centre for professional historians of medicine and medical science. Third, these de\u00ad velopments limited what could be done for the Museum and its vast un\u00ad sorted collectionsof objects in the store at Enfield, Middlesex. In the end, the right course seemed to be to transferthe museum collections to the ScienceMuseum, which createdtwogreat newgalleriesinwhichthe wealth of the collections could be displayed. The Trustees continued to have ultimate responsibility for the collections but their indefinite loan to the ScienceMuseum ensured that the richness and range ofobjects could now be displayed to the public. In reaching these successful solutions of their problems in the history of medicine, the Trustees devoted time, effort, energy and skill to get things right and at the same time win public ac\u00ad ceptance for the changes. 39c.FIFTY YEARS OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUSTFIFfYYEARS to the organisation andmanagement oftheirTrustand policy, ideaswhich they accept,modify orreject.Duringthe first 24 years the administration of theTrustwas largely a matterfor the lawyers andaccountants.

SirHenryDaleran the affairs of the Trust fromvarioustemporary offices with the assistance of his able secretary Mrs.Cutts.Theactivities duringthis time are reported inPhysic and Philanthropy. (Seepages27-33) Sir JohnBoydwasappointed aTrusteeand Dr. F.H.K.Green wasrecruited to thestaffto assist Sir HenryDaleas Scientific Secretary to theTrust.Dalewas still in full vigour and he and Greenwere old colleagues. Green,with his long experience at theHeadOffice of the MedicalResearch Council, continued thenaturalliaisonbetween theTrust andthatorganisation and many of the early grantsof old associations with the M.R.C.and itsSecretary SirHaroldHim\u00ad days in the the numberofproposals toconsider were sufficiently few thatthey could be approved on the basis of the wisdom and experience ofDale,Boyd and Greenwho met regularly. Greenintroduced methods forconsidering grant applications andstimulated theproduction of the theTrust describing its first 20 years.He alsoinitiated andcarriedout the of the office of the Trustto 52QueenAnneStreet.Heproposed andstarted theTravelGrantSchemewhich he to dutiesand soClarkewas able to develop hishistorical interests. Aftertwo years of this arrangement it 42becameapparent that his real interestwas in medical history, and so the Trusteesprovided himwith afellowshipto gotoJohns HopkinsUniversity, Baltimore, to become trainedin thesubject.Clarkesubsequently became a Medical Historian at the Wellcome Institute, then Head of the first History of Medicine Unit established by the Trust at University College London, and the Director of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine from 1973- 1979. In the meanwhile, Col. HaroldBenstead, onretirement from the Public HealthLaboratory Service, had been recruited on apart-time basisto help in theTrust'soffice. When Edwin Clarke left for America, theTrustees decided to seek a successor as Assistant Scientific Secretary and following consultation with SirHaroldHimsworth, Dr.Petero.Williams was approached by Dr. Green. He had experience with the grants and tropical programmes of the MedicalResearch Council, both ofwhichwould grow to be very important for the future development of theprogramme of the Trust. At about this stage, it had become apparent that the Trust would have to develop an administration if it was to use its growing income on the basis ofsoundly based knowledge of the medical researchfield. ItsTrustees had becomeelderly and itsfunction had transferred from one \"requiring lawyers and accountants to one requiring scientific guidance. HenryDale was 85 andFrankGreenwassubjecttofrequent illnesses. SirJohn Boyd wasbusy with his personal research in the Wellcome Laboratories atEustonRoad, but very much in touch with the tropical scene. It was at this point that Henry Dale decided to retirefrom the Chairmanship of theTrust,but as he remained in his office as Chief ScientificAdviser for the next fiveyears there wasvery little evolution in the scientific policy of the Trust. SirJohn McMichael replaced him as a Trusteeandbroughtinto the Trust for the first time the clinical aspect of medical research. Gradually, thebreadth of theTrust'sactivities expanded, stimulated by the new scheme of Senior Research Fellowships in Clinical Science, but stillvery much relatedto the advice of the M.R.C.on many matters. FrankGreenhad become pro\u00ad gressively less well and finally retiredin 1963. Dale had had a fall and broken his hip and subsequently retiredto the Evelina Nursing Home in Cambridge with Lady Dale who was also very infirm. Thus a new era openedup for the administration of the Trust. Sir John Boyd moved into the office as resident Trustee. Dr. Williams, with a secretary, took charge of the administration. Around this time, Lord 43FranksjoinedtheTrustin succession to Lord Piercy and as Chairman createdthefundamental change inthe Trustwhereby Dr. Williamsbecame itsSecretary based at 52 QueenAnneStreet,and Jack Clarke, who had been the Secretary based in his office in the City, limited himself to the financial affairs as Financial Secretary. Thischange recognised thatthe phase ofestablishing the financialand legal basis of the Trustwas over and thatthecentralaim was now to dispense the growing funds available to the Trustin the most appropriate way to fulfilthe purposes of the will. For the first few years, this was undertaken with the help of Mr. M.A.F.Barren,who had also been recruited from theM.R.C., but it soon becameobvious that more supportwasneeded in the office. By this stage, although Sir John Boyd wasresident as a Trustee and available for advice and consultation, anunwritten rule had developed among the Trustees thatthey would divert any personal approaches to the secretariat of theTrustto handle so thatthey could form unbiased judge\u00ad ments. Based on this rule, it was possible to build up a relationship and confidence of mutual respect between theTrustees and scientific staff of theTrustandbetween the staff and the research community that augured wellfor the future. Itwas ataboutthis time and then Dr. B.E.C.Hopwood and Dr.B.A.Bembridge joined the Trust and took charge respectively between them of the Clinical, Veterinary, Tropical and Basic Sciences programmes. Therewas much overlap and interchange and they each had a very wide range of subjects to cover, but nevertheless they showed great enthusiasm foramigave great impetus to theprogrammes theyadministered. Especially notable was Dr. Haning\u00ad ton'scontribution in developing the Veterinary programme from its in\u00ad ception with the help ofMr. Sam Hignett(late ofthe her a greaterdebt than it may have recognised because of her modest approach to all her duties. During her last few years at the Trustshedeveloped her own research on migraine which was very successful. Itwas a sad day for the Trust when the illness of herhusband forced her early retirement. Dr. Hopwood wasalsoa great stimulus to the Tropical field. Having long experience in Africa and else\u00ad where he wasable to bring an intimateknowledge oftropical administration to the office and guide its development. Hesubsequently left the Trust to take up advisory work on medical management in developing countries, only toreturna few years laterto become the Director of the Wellcome Trust'sLaboratories in Nairobi. Dr. Bembridge especially initiated work in theophthalmology field and in connection with the European pro- 44gramme and the surgical and pathology fellowships, but his principal con\u00ad tribution was in his care for the basic sciences of medicine. His devotion to the scholarship of medical science led to many arguments aboutthe balance between the ad hocapproach to grantgiving versus the promotion of neglected subjects in which, as in all good arguments, the result was a compromise, both being continued in parallel. Nevertheless, underthe stimulusofthis group,theTrustees werepersuaded to take amore positive line than before and the competitive awards in selected subjects and the concentration onneglected subjectsprospered. Towards the end of this phase, it became apparent that more emphasis needed to be placed on the problems of university staffing and the Senior Lectureship and Lectureship schemes came into being. Dr. HaroldEd\u00ad wards, on his retirement asDeanof St. Mary's Hospital Medical School, joined the staff to take charge of the programme. This new scheme under his guidance did much to show the Trust'sidentification with the current plightofthe universities and greatly enhanced itsreputation. In developing all these new ideas therewas a need for close links between theTrustees and the scientific staff of the Trust. This was greatly assisted when, for a few years, Sir John McMichael and Professor RobertThompson took up officesin the Trust'snew premises and were available for day-to-day con\u00ad sultation. In fact, as Lord Frankshaswritten,aremarkable situation de\u00ad veloped whereby the Trustees were in the driving seat of an organisation whichwasessentially feeding them with newideas and programmes on the basis of a well-found knowledge of the research climate of the country. Through this, they could add their own experience indeciding what should besupported. Growth and the subsequent change were nevertheless bound to occur and thiscoincided with the departure of Drs.Hanington, Bembridge and Hop\u00ad woodand the retirement of SirJohnMcMichael and Professor Thompson. Itwasapparent thatthe time for the generalist wasover and that the Trust had to have a more intimateexperience of basic medical science available in the office. The new staff had to have specialist experience in a wide range of subjects and were encouraged to travel and visit the people and projectssupported by the Trust to gain personal experience and show interest in the work of grant-holders. Thisnewpolicyledtothe appointment asAssistant Directors ofDr. Bridget Ogilvie, a parasitologist from the National Institute for Medical Research at MillHill, to take charge of the tropical programme, Dr. Keith Sinclair, a veterinary surgeon from University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, to 45lookaftertheveterinary Subsequently, Dr.P.A.J.Ball,aconsultant physician from the Middlesex Hospital, and Dr.JamesHoward, animmunologist from thescientifically qualified Trustees led to astronglinkagebetween eachTrusteeandaspecialist sectionof the office, as well as theirgeneralpolicy role. Theevolution of this system is recent, to theTrusta muchwider rangeofexpertopinionthanwaspossible before. Behindthisevolution oftheScientific the office, lies the administrative developments thatmadeitpossible. Themanagement of a programme forthesupportofresearch entailsmeticulous be agement ofthegrants. This thisaboutis nomeantask and the highest praisemustgo to Mr. DerekMetcalfe who came to the Trustfrom the Medical Research Councilin 1968 to assist Mr. Barrenandwas to Metcalfe to things to set the pattern forthefuturesothattheoffice was readyto.Iaunchinto the next phase of theflotation andthe new responsibilities thatledtherefrom. This task 46wasMr. Ian Macgregor's, whojoinedthe Trust in 1985and soon grasped the mammoth task of the flotation led by Sir David Steel and Mr. Gibbs. There are many otherswho have played an important role inthe evolution of the Trust. No attempthas been made here to describe the management of the History of Medicine Programme, which Dr. Williams ran for some time before Professor RupertHalljoinedthe staff to act as Co-ordinator of the History of Medicine Programmes. Before him, Pamela Bradburne, Dr. Williams' personal assistant, had done stalwart work for this subject. This essay illustrates a patternofdevelopment thathas been appropriate at each stage of the development of theTrust,evolving from the direct Trustee action tothe gradual devolution to the staff first in general and then in more specialist supportof theTrustees. Thispatternof adminis\u00ad tration has been of great help to the scientific community who feel they can turn to the Trustforsympathetic understanding of theirproblems, as wellasforfunds, and provides awayinwhichbusy Trusteescanconcentrate to maximum effect on the problems thatnecessitate theirattention. The future quality of the Trust will dependon this strong linkage between the Trustees and the staff and on respect for each other'sroles. The or\u00ad ganisation and patternthat has been developed should stand it in good stead. 47D. 50TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS50THANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS Althoughthe50thAnniversaryoftheTrust fallsoutside theperiodofthis Report. because of its themainhallofthebuilding.

SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS IN CLINICAL SCIENCEWELLCOME SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS IN CLINICAL SCIENCE The purpose of these Senior Fellowships is to giveyoung clinicalscientists ofhighpromise the opportunity to carry out research on problems related to clinical medicine for a period of up to five years. The Trustees have been delighted with the success of Senior Clinical Fellows. Since the inception of this scheme in 1962, 73 Fellowships have been awarded. During the period of this Report,nine Fellows have obtained senior academicor consultant positions. Twoofthese have been appointed as Professors, one in the Department of Clinical Endocrinology at St. Mary's Hospital Medical School, and one in the Department of Medicine at King'sCollege Hospital Medical School. Another Fellowwillshortly be taking up the Chair in Clinical Pharmacology at the University of Bir\u00ad mingham.The Trusteesmaintain an interestinthe workofformer Fellows, and are always prepared to consider applications for funds to conduct research projects. There are currently 19Senior ClinicalFellowsin post, eight ofwhomwere appointed during the last two years.

Dr. BIOMEDICAL FELLOWSHIPSSENIOR BASICBIOMEDICAL SCIENCE FELLOWSHIPS During 1985 the Trustees became aware of the need to provide further substantive positions for young investigators in the basic sciences. Rep\u00ad resentations had been made from the universities that the number of re\u00ad search posts available had declined leading to a resultant shift to careers outside of science, or to science careersoutside the UnitedKingdom. The Trustees decided to re-introduce their previous fellowship scheme, to sup\u00ad portoutstanding young basicscientists with an established research record, whohave shown special promise in their initial studies of biomedical prob\u00ad lems. Anadvertisement callingfor applications wascirculated to duringOctober 1985. 59 applications were received: 49 from applicants already in the laboratory in which they wishedto hold the fellowship, and sixfrom abroad.Sevenfellowshipswere awarded following successful interviews and are detailedbelow. TheTrustees werepleasedby the response to their advertisement and encouraged by the quality of the fellowswhom they appointed. They were concerned, however, thatso few applications had been received from can\u00ad didates overseas wishing to returntoBritain,or fromcandidates wishing to move laboratories. They have decided to continue the scheme and to encourage applications, especially, from candidates presently working overseas or wishing to move to a new laboratory. The fellowships are tenablefor five years in the first instance, with an extension to eight years following a successfulreview. The Trust provides the fellows' salaries and substantial funds to cover the costof an associated research programme. The cost of these awards came to \u00a3900,000. The following are currentholders of these awards: 72Dr.C.D.A.Brown Dr.I.M.Crampton Dr.T.R.Hirst Dr. Lynne MayneDepartment of Medicine, University of Manchester.

TheTrustees werepleasedto learn thatDr. Michael C. Sheppard had beenappointed to the Chair of Endocrinology at Birmingham University, Dr. S. Tomlinson to the Chairof Medicine at Manchester University and Dr.C.A.Marsden promoted to apersonalChair atNottingham University. Of the 51 SeniorLecturers, eleven have clinicalresponsibilities. The sub\u00ad jects of 'research of the Senior Lecturers - by very broad categories - are as follows:- Human Physiology, with an emphasis on Neurophysiology 18 Tropical Disease and Infections 12 Molecular Biology and Immunology 11 Pharmacology 7 MentalHealth2 Epidemiology 1 Theseappointments, which are on the basis of a rolling contract which entails review every third year, should not normally be held for more than eight years by which time the fellow should eithertake up a university appointment or be eligible for consideration for one of the Trust'snew seniorappointments. A new scheme of senior research appointments is beingestablished tocreatea logicalprogression for those who have estab\u00ad lished themselves as of the calibre to be research professors. Ithas been said thatthis scheme, gency.However, the Wellcome Trustcannotin the long-term become a basic funding agency for the universities. It is therefore essential that the universities examine how they can relate the use of this scheme to their future planning. Failure to do this will eliminate this valuable type of support.

TheTrustees have recently decided to review their lectureship programme and the scheme will not be offeredin1986-87during which period, how\u00ad ever, the numberof fellowship awards will be increased. Since the intro\u00ad duction of the Wellcome Lectureship scheme in 1983,46awardshave been made at a totalcost ofabout\u00a34.6 million. The Trustees also responded positively to threeothernominations, butcandidates suitable for appoint\u00ad ment could not be found. The Lectureships which are tenable for up to five years, have been provided in the subject fields and institutions shown in the following tables: Subject Areas ofWellcome Lectureships 90Subject Area Biomedical Sciences Clinical Sciences (including Pathology) DentalScience Epidemiology, Molecular Biology, Neurosciences Veterinary SciencesNo.of Awards 19 9 2 2 5 4 5Institutional LocationofWellcome Lectureships No.of Awards Bath 1 Birmingham 1 Bristol 3 Dublin 1 East Anglia 1 Essex 1 Keele 1 Leeds 1 Leicester 2 London 12 Newcastle 1 Nottingham 1 Reading 2 Scotland: Aberdeen 2 Edinburgh 3 Dundee 1 Glasgow 2 St.Andrews 1 Strathclyde 2 Southampton 1 Sheffield 1 Sussex 1 Wales: Cardiff 3 Swansea 1 46 IftheTrust'slectureship andseniorlectureship schemes are considered together, it isapparent thatthey have provided more than 100 additional academic posts in the biomedical establishment of British universities. The Trustees are considering whetherinfuture years, these lectureship schemes should be replaced by othersproviding for longer-term research appoint\u00ad ments for individual workers at different levels of seniority. Since Trust fundedappointments are made on a fixed term basis, it seems likely that the university establishment will have to absorb,at least, some of the currentones before many new appointments could be made. 91The following are currentholdersof these awards:- 92Dr. P.I.Aaronson Dr R.

A formal course of training inepidemiology is generally a prerequisite to theresearch programme, which forms part of the fellowship award. Since the introduction of the scheme in 1979, the Trustees have provided 19awards at a total cost of\u00a31.05million. Of the nine Fellowswhoseawards haveterminated, eight have takenup academic research appointed toSeniorLectureships, andtwoto Lectureships inUnitedKingdom medical schools; two have taken up university research posts and one has been appointed to a post at the M.R.C.Laboratories in TheGambia. During the periodunderreview, the Trustees allocated \u00a3425,000for Fel\u00ad lowships in Clinical Epidemiology. Although eighteen nominations were received only seven awards were made at a cost of \u00a3335,000. 98Awards of Wellcome Research Fellowships in Clinical Epidemiology Dr.J.M.Cruickshank, Diabetic Unit, Northwick Park Hospital, Middlesex: for three years, for a study of the genetic basis of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; its validation in populations of different ethnic groups and assessment with possiblegene markers, under Dr.R.Mahler.

Ithastherefore been decided that these schemes as separate entitiesshould be discontinued. These have been replaced by fellowships for all clinical disciplines which are now awarded withoutadvertisement andapproximately quarterly. The awards are in\u00ad tendedfor medical graduates of high promise who are able to devote up tothreeyears to a projectwhich calls for a thorough understanding of a basic scientific discipline. Applications may be made at any time, but in\u00ad tending sponsors are encouraged to write to the Trustin the first instance. Training fellowships in epidemiology and infectious diseases willcontinue to beadvertised asbefore.

The Panel not only adjudicates onapplications forgrants,but also advises the Trustees on their policy in this rapidly developing area.As well as providing support forresearch projectsandprogrammes, animportant aspect of the Panel's work is in making grants for research trainingand for the academic de\u00ad velopment of departments ofpsychiatry and thecognatesciences. The Panel 1985and 1986. Research Support A largenumberofapplications forad hocprojectgrants are received, and although many of these are of high quality,during the academic year 1985 - 1986,the Panel expressed disappointment that that they were only able torecommend a few of the grantsrequested due to deficiencies in many of theapplications received. A numberoftheapplications for whichthe Panel recommended supportextended theiractivities into areas where the Trust haspreviously provided littlesupport.Forexample, anumberofinteresting proposals inchildpsychiatry have been received. The Panel agreedsupport for a study of the cognitive and behavioural abnormalities in thesyndrome of pervasive hyperactivity in girls, by a team undertheleadership of Dr. EricTaylorfrom the Department of Child Psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry. Manyofthe applications receiving supportshow the developing importance Dr.J.G.Parnavelas, oftheDepartment College London, arerelatingexpression of specific genes to defineddevelopmental changes in the brainusingin situhybridization, and Dr.JeanThomas and Dr. R.J.Thompson, of theDepartment of Bio\u00ad chemistry in Cambridge, are studying the structure of brainchromatin in relation to brain-specific genes. Research Programmes TheTrustees advertised for award in 1985a substantial programme grant, upto\u00a31,250,000over ten years, for supportofresearchintheneurosciences 111relatedtoMentalHealth.Twentyeight applications were received for this award, and afterinterview of theshort-listed groups,theTrustees made an award to Dr. JamesMcCulloch andProfessor NeilBrooks, of the University of a neuropharmacologist particu\u00ad larlyinterested infunctional studiesofneurotransmitters in the brain and Professor Brooksis best known for his work on the cognitive sequelae of headinjury.Theirprogramme combines theirexpertise in a ab\u00ad normalities inAlzheimer's longitudinal study of the disease.in the UnitedKingdom, and the award of long-term supportwill allow Dr.McCulloch andProfessor Brooksto test a number of specific hypotheses in a large cohortofpatientswith senile dementia of theAlzheimer type. As mentioned inourlastreport,the Trust is also supporting twootherlargegroupsworking on Alzheimer's disease: Dr.T.W.Robbins Experimental Psychology in Cambridge. Thesupportofthreedifferent programmes onthe\"samecondition is areflection of the high quality of scientific effortthatcan now be devotedtodefinedmentalhealthproblems. Inparticularvexperts in cognitive psychology are making detailedstudyof thedisordered thoughtprocesses found in Alzheimer's disease and many of those active in the field, .including the threegroupsmentioned above, recentlymet at,the offices.of the Trustwith the aim andcollaboration between the various groups. Anumberofapproaches.have beenmade to the Trustees aboutthe need foradditional supportforstudiesusing the new methods of non-invasive study positron emission tomography, nuclear mag\u00ad neticresonance, andmagnetoencephalography. TheTrustees advertised an award of up to threemillionpoundsfor studies using such methods. However, they were not able to select an application of sufficient merit for this award. Itishopedtooffersupportfor non-invasive brain studies at some time in the nearfuture. Research Training and Academic Development Increasing numbers ofexcellent candidates continue to apply for the Trust\u00ad ees'MentalHealthFellowships. ThePanelhave beep encouraged by the goodresponse totheirannualadvertisement for these awards, and for the increasing attention paid bysponsors of fellows to the trainingcomponent of theresearch programme. Anumberof fellows in workingin theDepartment ofNeurology atHarvard, has recently combined molecular genetic and structural methods to define the three-dimensional structure ofneuropeptide Y, allowing her to formulate hypotheses on the active sites on this molecule. Inthelast report', the Trustees commented' on thedisappointing standard of applications for lectureships andseniorlectureships in Mental Health. There has been agood response torecentadvertisements for these awards, and (in addition to a numberof basic neuroscientists) theTrustis now supporting fivepsychiatrists in the centrating on studies of cognitive therapyin thesesometimes intractable conditions. Dr. David Skuse is a Wellcome Senior Lecturer in Mental HealthattheDepartment of Child Psychiatry in theInstitute of Child Health.He isconducting alongitudinal study on the environmental con\u00ad straints upon physical and psychological development in children.

Dr. P.O. Williams has set up a Committee ofInterested Partiesto provide a focus of discussion concerning needsof thevariousU.K.bodies thisexpertise. Itis clearthatthegovernment asrepresented by the De\u00ad partment ofHealthand Social Security and the Overseas Development Administration, does not feel itself to be responsible for thestateof the subject.The Royal College of Physicians had decidedto linktropicalmed\u00ad icine and infectious diseases underajointcommittee concerned with ac\u00ad creditation in these subjects. The most positive development has come from the Commonwealth Secretariat which held a meeting ofrepresen\u00ad tatives of various countries withTrustsupportand put forward a strong recommendation to themeeting ofCommonwealth HealthMinisters in October 1986. Sir Raymond Hoffenberg, President of the Royal College of Physicians, has agreedto chair a working partyon thissubject. Government funds for research intropicalmedicine in the U.K.are pro\u00ad vided by the Tropical Medicine Research Boardof the Medical Research Council and the Trust.Whilst no formal links exist with the M.R.C., Dr. P.O. Williams and Dr.B.M.Ogilvie spoke to a meetingof theTropical Medicine Research Boardon 13th March 1986 and visited the Medical Research Council's Gambialaboratories from 15th -22ndFebruary 1985 S.J. Oppenheimer. The tively small size and coherence of thisresearch community ensuresthat links are strongbetween fundingbodiesandresearch workers. 123Units A meeting of UnitDirectors was held at 1 ParkSquare West on the 17th! 18thDecember 1984as the final phase of the triennial assessment of the work of the Units. Unidade de EstudosEspeciais da Wellcome, Belem, Brazil ThisUnit,directed byProfessor R.Lainson in close collaboration with Dr.J.J.Shaw, has continued to study the ecology of leishmaniasis in the Amazon region.Dr.L.Ryan,theentomologist to theUnit,completed his term and was replaced by amemberof the staff of the Instituto Evandro Chagas. Studies of visceral leishmaniasis (caused by Leishmania chagasi) have been a majoractivity of the Unit in the past two years. Following theidentification ofsporadic humancases in the town of Santarem, in\u00ad vestigation showed a very high level of infection in the dogs and in the suspected vectorLutzomyia longipalpis. This led the Unit to predict the occurrence of amajoroutbreak of the disease in Santarem, a prediction soon fulfilled. Studies have continued on the sandfly vector(s) of Leish\u00ad mania braziliensis todetermine ifPsychodopygus wellcomei is sole vector, and the use of a panelof monoclonal antibodies has proved in\u00ad valuable in differentiating strains of Leishmania. Itwasdecided to appoint a scientist for threeyears todevelopmonoclonal antibodies to aid in iden\u00ad tification of the many strains of Leishmania collected by the Unit. Dr. Catherine A.Hanham wasappointed to work for a year with Dr. D. McMahon-Pratt at YaleUniversity and then to work partly in the Unit andpartlyat her home base, the LondonSchool of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, developing and testing these reagents. The extensive databases ofstrains,results of blood examinations, mono\u00ad clonalantibody results and the cryobank have now been computerised, which will enablethe Unit to study the interaction of clinical and epide\u00ad miological factors, previously not feasible. Sir David and Lady Steel and Dr. and Mrs. P.O.Williams visited the Unit in September 1985. Wellcome/Mahidol University/Oxford Tropical Research Programme, Bangkok. Drs.D.A.and M.J. Warrell returned to Oxford inAugust 1986after seven 124years in Bangkok. Dr. D.A.Warrellhas been succeeded asDirector by Dr. N.J. White who rejoined the Unit in October 1985aftera year in the U.S.A. Cases of severe malaria have been much fewer in Thailand in the past two years and, in consequence, Dr.D.A.Warrell placed more em\u00ad phasis on studies of rabies and snake-bite. He also worked in Burma and SriLanka,mainly studying snake-bite. Dr. N.J. White will continue to study the management of severe malaria in man, focusing on the disease inpregnant women initially and will also work on melioidosis which is a problem in NorthEastThailand. After working in the Unit for a time, Dr. J. Karbwang was awarded a fellowshipin October1984for two and a half years to work with Professor A.Breckenridge in theDepartment ofPharmacology andTherapeutics in Liverpool. The Wellcome Trust/Kenya/St. Mary's Hospital Medical School Collaborative Research Programme Thisprogramme began in April 1980and was completed in August 1985. Dr. N.R. Poulter, who was responsible for the studies in collaboration with Professor P. Sever and Professor Sir Stanley Peart,reportsthatthis study has, for the first time, demonstrated the rapid rise in blood pressure consequent upon migration, and it has permitted theauthorstoconstruct a hypothesis of the factors responsible for the blood pressure changes and by inference for the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. Dr.Poulter also says thatthe study has provided a unique model which may form the basisforprimary intervention studies whichwouldhave majorpublichealth implications for the management ofcardiovascular problems in the third world. Wellcome Trust Unit, Kenya The Kenyan Medical Research Institute invited the Trust to set up a Unit on the coast to study health problems of thecommunities there.Following preliminary visits by Dr. P.O.Williams and Dr. B.M. Ogilvie in March 1984and Dr. B.M. Ogilvie and Dr. S.J. Oppenheimer in May 1985, Dr. Oppenheimer agreed to undertake a feasibility study based on the district hospital at Kilifi. This was begun in October 1985and successfully com\u00ad pleted in March 1986. A visiting group consisting of Dr. P.O.Williams, Professor E.R.Moxon, Dr. P.A.J.Ball and Dr. B.M. Ogilvie, went out 125in March 1986to assess the situation, but they were unable to recommend to theTrustees thattheyshouldset up a coastal Unit because they con\u00ad sideredahospital-based community study to be essential and the facilities for such a study could not be guaranteed. Dr. W.M. Watkins is in charge of theTrust'sinterests in Kenya whilst continuing hisTrust-funded studies on thebiochemistry andpharmacokinetics ofanti-malarial drugs, based in thelaboratories inNairobiatKEMRI and using facilities at Kilifi. Some of the space in the Trust'sNairobilaboratories is being used by the Well\u00ad comeTropical Institute to exhibit its educational posters. Wellcome Trust Research Unit, Vellore TheUnit,directed byProfessor V.1.Mathan, studies pathological, physiological, micro\u00ad biological and biochemical. The Unit surveys villages in the area for out\u00ad breaksofdiarrhoea, and arising from this it has been shown that the rate ofisolation ofpathogens is not significantly different between patientsand controls.

Dr.C.E.GordonSmith visited 126TraceElement Research Group,Tropical Metabolism Research Unit, Jamaica Followingthe resignation of Dr.A.A.JacksonasDirector of the Tropical Metabolism Research Unit on his appointment asProfessor ofHuman Nutrition at the University ofSouthampton, Dr.M.H.N.Goldenbecame ActingDirector of theTropical Metabolism Research Unit run his Trust-funded TraceElement Research Group(T.E.R.G). TheT.E.R.G. is testing the hypothesis that defective antioxidant defence is involved in the genesis of the signs of malnutrition. A number of components of this defence system are being examined and the most striking result to date is the demonstration that children with marasmus have a normal level of red cell glutathione, but those with oed\u00ad ematous malnutrition have areducedlevel. Because of the severe and progressively declining financial situation in the University of the West Indies,theTrust agreed tosupplement the salaries of two staff members of theT.M.R.U., Dr. S.Grantham-McGregor who studies the effect of nutritional supplementation andstimulation on the development ofmalnourished children, for urgentmaintenance andequipment for theT.M.R.U. and has agreed to help the University of the West Indies to find a new Director to be funded jointly. Dr.M.H.N. Goldenwasawarded theMurgatroyd Prize of the Royal College of Physicians in 1985.Sir David and Lady Steel and Dr. and Mrs. P.O. Williams visited JamaicainSeptember 1985, Dr. B.M. Ogilvie and Dr. M.J. Morgan in September 1984. 127AwardstoIndividuals Two University Awards were made. In October 1984Dr. R.E.Randall was funded to join the staff of the Department of Biochemistry and Mi\u00ad crobiology at the University of St. Andrews to undertake an analysis of paramyxovirus persistence and inOctober 1985Dr.c.J.Leake was awarded supportto join the staff of the Department of Medical Microbi\u00ad ology at the LondonSchool of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to study virus-vector interaction. A Senior Lectureship inInfectious Diseases was awarded in June 1985to Dr. J.Cohen,Department of Medicine, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, for five years to undertake studies on the role of endotoxin in septic shock and graft versus host disease. Dr. D. Isaacs was awarded a SeniorLectureship inInfectious Diseases for threeyearstostudy interferon and immunity to respiratory viruses in the Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford.Dr.B.G.Spratt,oftheSchoolofBiologicalSciences, University ofSussex, was awarded athreeyearResearch Leave Fellowship to allow him to investigate themolecular basis of intrinsic resistance to 13\u00ad lactamantibiotics inNeisseria gonorrhoeae. Fellowships in infectious dis\u00ad eases were awarded to Dr. K. Marsh to study the identification and Medicine in Oxford,to Dr. J.N. Weber for two years to study the pathogenesis of infection bythe Levin to spend 18 months studying paediatric infectious disease in the U.S.A.andGambiawhilst on leave from the Department ofPaediatric Nephrology at theInstitute of Child Health, London, and a one year fellowship was given to Dr. D.W.K.Acheson to studyantimicrobial properties of theG.G.strain of B.K. Mandai in Manch\u00ad ester. Despite the expressed enthusiasm of Panel members for the Advanced Training Fellowship Scheme, few applications are received and only two new awards were made in 1984/86, to enableDr.R.A.Harrison of the Department of Medical Helminthology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, to work with Professor N. Agabian at the Naval Bios\u00ad ciencesLaboratory, Oakland, California on the molecular cloningof Schis\u00ad tosomahaematobium antigens; and to Dr. M. Foley from the Department 128of Biochemistry, University of Glasgow, to enablehim to work on the molecular biologyof Plasmodium falciparum antigenswith Dr. R. Anders at Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne. Awards made previously to Dr.W.e.Gibson,Dr.H.A.Flockhart, Dr. P.C. Tai and Dr. E. De\u00ad vaney, were extended for periods of up to a year. Grants and Panel Business Recommendations for awards in tropical medicine and infectious diseases are made to the Trustees byan advisory Panel consistingof eight scientists, representing the many and diverse subjectscoveredby this section of the Trust. In addition to their essential role in the assessment of the increasing numbers of grant requests, Panelmembers are most helpful as a source of adviceon many aspects of this subjectand thisconstructive help isgreatly appreciated. Thenumberof grantrequestsinTropical Medicine remained at aconstant level over the five year period 1980- 1985, but in common with the rest of the Trust,applications increased considerably in 1985/86. Another change noted in 1985/86was a decrease in awards made for the studyofnon-infectious tropical conditions compared withthenumbermade for the study of infections. Analysis of the fate of grant applications shows that about 60% receive supportat least inpart and that 30% ofthe available support is awarded to the LondonSchool of Hygiene and Tropical Med\u00ad icine,10%to the Liverpool SchoolofTropical Medicine, 10%tothe Trust's Units and the remainder, about50%,goeselsewhere, mainly within Brit\u00ad ain. The list of projectsfunded during this two-year period shows that studies of infections using the techniques ofmolecular biology are now well es\u00ad tablished in the U.K. In making awards of this type, Panel members felt strongly that both the biological aspects and the molecular biological ap\u00ad proachoutlinedneededto be equally strong and unsuccessful applications frequently failed because one or otheraspect was weak. The unbalanced emphasis on the use of molecular biological methods to detect antigens as possiblevaccine candidates led to the decision to try to attractapplications to study the basic biochemistry and cell biology of parasites, and in 1985/ 86a Major Awardof \u00a3250,000for studies of this type was advertised. This competition was won by Dr. A.H.Fairlamb, currently working with Dr. A. Cerami in the Department of Medical Chemistry at the Rockefeller 129University of NewYork,toenablehim toreturnto theLondonSchool of Hygiene and beenawarded \u00a3120,000to set up adedicated facility for thosestudiesat theUniversity of Oxford. The high standard of both these awardswas more impressive as both concernaspects ofparasitebiochemistry thathavebeenneglected, thus fulfilling the pur\u00ad pose of this advertised competition in a most satisfactory way. Duringtheperiodunderreview,awardswere made totalling \u00a37,214,000. The diversity of subjects covered by the Panel is well illustrated by the topics of talks given at meetings: October 1984, C.B. Modell, \"Developing c.J.Leake, \"Field and Laboratory Studies on the Vector Competence of Wild and Colonised Mosquitoes forJapanese Encephalitis (JE) inSouth East Asia\".

McGuigan, Department ofPathologyandImmunology,MoredunResearch Institute, Universityof Edinburgh: forthreeyears, MEDICINE* *VETERINARY Professor J.O.Jarrett,PhD, BVMS, MRCVS (University of Glasgow) **Professor D. Lodge, BVSc, MRCVS (Royal Veterinary College, London) December 1986VETERINARY MEDICINE During the period1984-86, the Trustees allocated some \u00a32.9 million for thesupportof research in veterinary medicine. This allocation, which in\u00ad cludes provision for two Wellcome Lectureships inUnitedKingdom vet\u00ad erinary schools, brings the total supportprovided bytheTrustees veterinary medicine programmes since 1968to about\u00a310.5 million. Followingthe patternofrecentyears, some 89% of the expenditure during the biennium comprised grants and awards to universities in the United Kingdom. But, when compared to the two previous biennia (84% and 74%), there has been a furtherdecline in the proportion awarded to the Veterinary Schools (61%). This trendprobably reflects the continuing stringencies and uncertainties in the schools, but also thereis evidence of a growing awareness amongst the staff of otheruniversities and institutes of the availability of Trust funding for veterinary research. Analysis of the distribution of expenditure according to the type of supportprovided shows that,compared withearlieryearstherewas an increase in the proportion awarded as projectgrants(60%),reflecting the upward trend in the size ofindividual grants. However, therehas been a decrease inthe proportion awarded as Fellowships and Scholarships (17%),essentially due to a poor response to our Fellowship scheme and a particularly disappointing field ofcandidates for theResearch Training Scholarship awards in 1986. Itis tempting to speculate thatthedisappointing field ofcandidates for the Trust's Fellowshipsand Scholarships reflects the widelypublicisedshedding of research and academic appointments ininstitutes and universities, and the perceived deleterious effects on careeropportunities. On theother hand, the MajorAwardscheme, whichprovides more substantial research grants for up to five years, continues toattractsubstantial interest, and several good proposals were received in 1985and 1986. Competition was keen and in 1985the Trustees decided to provide a grant of up to \u00a3218,607 to enable Professor G.E.Goldspink to beappointed to a recently estab\u00ad lished Chair of Veterinary Molecular andCellularBiology at the Royal Veterinary College, London, and for a study of the molecular regulation ofgene expression in skeletalmuscle; and in 1986,a grant of upto\u00a3300,000 provided supportfor a study of the molecular pathology ofruminant len\u00ad tivirus infections underthedirection of Professor I.McConnell, Depart\u00ad ment of Veterinary Pathology, University of Edinburgh. These more substantial grants provide the much sought after longer-term supportfor research in the universities, and help in the building up of the critical mass of personnel and resources which is so essential in many fields of modern biomedical research. For research inveterinary medicine, the Trustees 147havesofar provided seven majorawardsand, for the period under review, theexpenditure amounted to some 17% of the budget. In the previous report,reference was made to a decisionof the Trustees, inrespect of research on exotic viruses only, to vary their long-standing policy, and accept projectgrant applications from members of staff of government and research council laboratories. The first award under this dispensation was made in1985with a grant of \u00a3152,448 virusto becarried out Pirbright, Surrey. 148VETERINARY ANDCOMPARATIVE MEDICINE O.T. demyeli\u00ad lentivirus infections, withDr.D.Sargan, and Dr. N.

At the time of their last report they were under\u00ad taking a criticalreviewof their supportfor this subject, and othersubjects relating to the eye. They agreed to establish a Vision Research Working Party to advise them on all aspects of their supportfor research on the eyeand visualpathways, and to consider allapplicationsfor grants relating to these structures. The Working Party'sremit includes both ophthalmol\u00ad ogyand the basicsciences relevant to vision. The Trustees particularly hope that this new Working Party willbe able to stimulate fruitful interactions between the clinicaland basicsciences.In deciding to establish this group, the Trustees looked to the example of their Mental Health Panel which, over the last ten years, has considered psychiatryin relation to the relevant basic sciences, to the mutual benefit of allthese subjects. The Vision Research Working Party, on the example ofthe MentalHealth Panel, willactivelyencourage applicationsforsupport from subjects and areas of vision research that are under-represented at present, as well as undertaking new initiatives to promote the research career development of the most able young men and women working in the field. The Trustees were particularly fortunate that Professor Fergus Campbell agreedto actasChairman ofthe WorkingParty. Professor Campbellbegan his career in clinicalophthalmology, but is, of course, best known for his contributions to the knowledgeofthe physiologyand psychologyofvision. He is Professor of Neurosensory Physiology in the University of Cam\u00ad bridge. The othermembers of the Working Party are from a wide range of clinicaland basicdisciplines. Research Career Development The Trustees have provided a number of research training fellowshipsfor youngophthalmologists, and four of these fellowswere in post at the time that the WorkingParty first met. At their first meeting, the Working Party heard a seminar from Dr. Paul Meyer, working with Mr. P.G. Watson in Cambridge. Dr. Meyer has refined anteriorsegment fluoroscein angiog\u00ad raphy and is now able to demonstrate normal vascular anatomyofthe episclera and conjunctiva, aswellasfeatures vivousingmethods previously available. His newmethods are likely to be a powerful research and diagnostic tool for many otherstudies. The Working Partyhaveagreedto establish anewscheme ofvisionresearch fellowships to ophthalmologists orneuro-ophthalmologists, extendtheir research experience. Supportwillalso be available forpost-doctoral sciencegraduates working on the eye and visual pathways. Through thesefellowships, the Trustees hope tostimulate thedevelopment of acadreof research workers whowill be able to takesenioracademic and research appointments and lead the subject forward. 160VISION ListofGrantsAwarded Over\u00a32,000 BUILDINGS Dr. G.R.

Since 1960it has had a clinically experienced Trustee- first Sir JohnMcMichael FRS and, more recently, Sir Stanley PeartFRS. In the past year, with the expansion of supportavailable fromextrafunds, ithas established aClinical PanelundertheChairmanship subjectswhich the Trustsupports with theexception of Mental HealthandInfectious Diseases which are cateredfor byother panels. Probably the most significant scheme run over the past 25 years has been the Senior Research Fellowships in Clinical Science. Thesefellowships \u00ad described elsewhere (see training andmaturation Also the Surgical and Pathology Fellowships havebeenimportant although these have now beenincluded in ageneralmedicine graduate trainingscheme (see pp. 101-105). The main use for the funds has beeninresponse toad hocrequests, and grantstotalling \u00a32,742,000 have beenmade during during the past years.Initiatives have also beentakenfrom time totime to supportlecturers andseniorlecturers and schemes which would make a bridge between the clinicaland laboratory sciences. In particular, the scheme for linkingclinical medicine and molecular biology should be noted(see pp. 179-180). TheTrustees are now considering what would be theirwisest policy for the future. They believe thatthegreatestneedis to have medical units of larger size so thatthereis sufficient time for research to beundertaken alongside clinical work, a stateof affairs which has become more difficult toattainwith theNational HealthService CentreatNorthwick Parkand the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, while adding to the strength of eachestablishment, maywellhave an adverseaffect on the clinical research strengthin the rest of the country. The Wellcome Trustistherefore ex\u00ad amining seriously the needfor more careerposts and programme type grants in clinical research ratherthantheprovision ofrelativesmallshort\u00ad term grants for limited projects. They may therefore have torestricttheir projectsupportin favour of the greatergood for fewer more expensive ventures. Full decisions have not yet beenmadeand theopinions of the research community are being canvassed both throughthepanelas well as from more casual contacts. 167CLINICAL SCIENCES ListofGrantsAwarded Over\u00a32,000 ANAESTHESIA RESEARCH ASSISTANCE ANDEXPENSES Dr. C.D.

The most notable development in theTrustees' basicscience programme has been the establishment of their advisory panels. The Bio\u00ad chemistry and Cell Biology Panel, whose members are listed on p. 170, considersall applications in Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Genetics, Molec\u00ad ular Biology, Basic Immunology, and Recombinant DNA and thus con\u00ad sidersallapplications in the molecular sciences. The Panel's initial budget during the first year of its operation was \u00a31.7 million, but this was sub\u00ad sequently increased to \u00a32.68 million. It isstilltoo early to discern any majorpatternsdevelopinginthese subject areas, but the trend appears to be for the Trust to receive an increasing number ofrequests for supportof celland molecular biology, geneticsand developmental biology. Itis clear, overall that the number of requests for support are increasing dramatically and presenttrends suggest that grant applications willbe up by over 100% in the year 1986-87compared to the year 1985-86.So far the Panelhas been able to make awardsinresponse to allapplicationsthat they judged to be worthy of receiving support. However, this situationmay not be sustainable. There is no doubt that in this division, as in the other divisionsof the Trust,demand is outstripping funds available and this condition will only be alleviated if support from central government funds is substantially increased. In its first year of operation the Panel recommended 70 awards totalling \u00a32,687,000. Molecular Biology AppliedTo ClinicalMedicine InMay1984aninformal meetingwasheld atthe WellcomeTrust to discuss whether there was a need for the Trustees to take a special interest in promoting the application of recombinant DNA techniques to human dis\u00ad ease. The participants included eminent members of University basic and clinicalscience departments whohave an interest inthe topic. Comparison was made with presentations at clinical meetings in the U.K. and the U.S.A. and there was agreement that the United Kingdom had fallen behind in the application of recombinant DNA to clinicalresearch. There wasa general welcome for the Trust taking an initiative in this area and 179arecommendation thattheTrustees shouldestablish aschemewhichwould beresponsive, in a sensitive and flexible way, to the particular needs of aninstitution and theproposed research. TheTrustees agreedtosupportsuch an bridge the betweenbasic and clinicalscience. The Trustees agreed to make \u00a3500,000 available to supportthisdevelopment in 1984\u00ad 85. The scheme was advertised in theautumnof 1984and threeawards were made to supporta variety of research programmes. Details of these awards may be found on page 193. TheTrustees wereencouraged bytheinitial success of these awards and decidedthattherewas still a needtoencourage theapplication of the new developments in celland molecular biologyto the study of human disease. They have therefore agreedthatafurthersumof\u00a31millionwillbeallocated for a second roundof this award to be made during 1986-87. 180BIOCHEMISTRY ANDCELLBIOLOGY ListofGrantsAwardedOver\u00a32,000 ANATOMY' perimental studies relatedto spinal nerve root trauma,and a study of the fate of isolatedSchwarm cellsclose to the CNS-PNS transitional zone.

Sir Henry Well\u00ad come's own interests included these subjects and Wellcome founded the first-ever physiological research laboratory within a pharmaceutical com\u00ad pany. One of his staff, Sir Henry Dale,wasone of the first Trustees and did much to promote supportof these subjects by the Wellcome Trust. The Trustees are now advised bya panel of expertphysiologistsand phar\u00ad macologistswhichwasset up in October1985.During the first year of its existence the Panel recommended grants totalling \u00a32,389,000. They are consciousthat historical precedent is aninadequate reason for continuing high levels of support, which are betterjustified by the many excellent applications received in these subjects. Theseapplications range from human physiology,for example, the studies ofDr. P.A. Robbins at the University Laboratory ofPhysiologyin Oxford, on the control of respiration in man, to molecular and biophysical ap\u00ad proachesto byProfessor AnneWarner, Foulerton Research Professor of the Royal Society at University College London. The Trustees have for some years wished to stimulate the academic de\u00ad velopment of research in toxicology, and this subject fallswithin the remit of the Physiologyand Pharmacology Panel. The Trustees have agreed to advertise a new scheme of advanced training fellowshipsin toxicology to strengthen thissubject.Oneaimofthese fellowships willbe toattractmen and women whose previous experience has not been in toxicology, but whonowwishto develop a careerinthesubjectfollowingprevioustraining in one of the relatedscientificdisciplines Department ofPharmacy, University of Nottingham: for a study of the design and evaluation of novel delivery systems for drug delivery and drug targeting.

MAJOREQUIPMENTMAJOR EQUIPMENT Early in 1985, the Trustees decided to make available \u00a31.5 million to providemajorequipment for university biomedical research. They did this because not only were University GrantCommittee fundsinadequate for the provision of new sophisticated equipment in our universities, but be\u00ad cause financial difficulties also existed in replacing worn-out apparatus. In the middle of thatyear the following announcement appeared:- The Wellcome Trustees announce the availability in 1985/86of funds to provide capital grants for the purchase of equipment for research in the basicand clinicalsciencesin universities and collegesin the United King\u00ad dom. The maximum individual award is likely to be of the orderof \u00a3150,000, but theTrustees wish to retain flexibilityin the Scheme and requests for larger grants willbe considered. Awards willbe made on the basisof the research case and part funding from othersources will not be essential. Forequipment likely to be used for more than one project,the casecan be based on no more than two different projects. The awards, which complement theTrustees' existing schemes for the support of research, are not intended to provide the basic equipment of a well-founded department, or to provide for the purchase of equipment required mainlyfor teachingpurposes. Inassessingapplications, theTrust\u00ad eeswillattach special importance to the scientificmerit and attractiveness of the research project(s) for which the equipment is to be used. In addition to a capital grant, applications may include provision for the maintenance charges for three years and the cost of technical assistance where this is required for the running of major pieces of equipment. These awards are in addition to the Trustees' existing funding schemes which may include equipment up to a maximum of about \u00a320,000 in addition to funds for assistance, consumables etc. Intending applicants should, in the first instance, submit an outline, on not more than two A4 pages, of the research programme and equipmentrequirements. The initial response wasoverwhelming and some 164initialenquiries were received and of these half were invited to submit formal applications. Thestandard ofapplications wassuch thattheTrustees decided to increase their original \u00a31.5 million to \u00a33 million and 32 awards were made to the following:- 222Professor M. Akhtar Dr. I.D.

SUMMARY OFEUROPEAN FELLOWSHIPS AWARDED 1984-1986 From To Belgium 1 Bulgaria 1 Czechoslovakia 3 Denmark 1 3 EastGermany 2 Finland 1 France 2 2 Greece 2 Hungary 12 Italy 11 Netherlands 11 Poland 12 Spain 1 Sweden 13 Switzerland 1 WestGermany 2 Yugoslavia 2 55 10 231Thereis still a great disparity between thenumberof awards made for fellowships for travel to the continent ratherthan from it. In the period of theprevious report(1982-84)five fellows visited the continent, and in theperiodof thisreportten fellows have received fellowshipsto travel to Europe. TheTrustees continue topromote collaborations by the award of fellow\u00ad ships, and especially by provision of European medical research collabo\u00ad rationgrants.Thesegrantsareintended toencourage European laboratories to poolresources by establishing closer inter-laboratory links between workersengaged inrelatedfields of research. A numberof new links were supported including those between Professor Williamson, St Mary'sHospital Medical School, and Professor Coutelle, East Germany; versity De Clercq, Belgium; Dr. K.M. Spyer, Royal'FreeHospital Medical School and Professor Trzbeski, Poland. The provision of relatively small sums of money throughthis scheme is an extremely effective means of promoting European collaboration. SpecialArrangements The speciallinks established bytheTrusteeswithanumberoforganisations throughout Europecontinue to receive support.The levelof interestshown for visits between Scandinavian countries and theUnitedKingdom used to be high but is now a cause for concern, and it isproposed toenterinto discussionswith the Trust'scorresponding organisations in the near future to see if modifications in the programme can be agreed that would en\u00ad courage the exchange of scientists betweentheUnitedKingdom and Scan\u00ad dinavia. Dr. Morgan and Dr.Ogilvie were guests of the Ministry of Healthof the Czechoslovakian Socialist Republic and visited a numberof university de\u00ad partments andresearch institutes of the Czech and Slovak Academy of Sciences in PragueandBratislava. Duringthe visit they were encouraged to seethateventhoughconditions were sometimes difficult, good quality research was still possible. Indeed,the level of scientific endeavour, in terms of the numberof scientists engaged in it, isprobably higher on a per capita basis thanin theUnitedKingdom. As a result of negotiations with the Minister ofHealth,Professor Prokopec, a draftagreement on scientific exchange was submitted to theTrustees for their approval. It is 232hoped that the formalities to implement theagreement willbecompleted in the near future. Dr. Morgan and Dr. Sinclair visited Hungary to review the exchange pro\u00ad gramme between the Trustand theHungarian International Cultural In\u00ad stitute. Theyvisiteda numberofuniversitiesandinstitutesofthe Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest andDebrecen, and also had an oppor\u00ad tunity to meet a numberof ex-fellows and review progress since their fellowshipended. Dr. Sinclair and Dr. Morgan were pleased to reportto the Trustees that most formerfellows had gone on to reach positions of eminence and influence in Hungarian medical and veterinary sciences. The special arrangement betweenthe Trust and the Mario Negri Institute, Milan,underwhich the Institute provided travel grants to enable young Italian scientists to make short working visitsto the U.K.,ceased in 1986. The Scheme with Italy had been very successfulbut it isnowfelt that Italy itself might supply this type of supportor Italian scientists should apply direct to the Trust in competition with applicants from othercountries. TheTrustees' help over the years must mean that thereare now many scientistsin Italy with experience from working in Britain which willhelp thecontinuation of the links between our countries. The Trustees consider thatthis special arrangement with the Mario Negri Institute hasbeen apowerful stimulus to develop the relationships between British and Italian medical scientists. Budget For the first time in recentyears the Trustees' budget for Europefor the year ending 1986 was inadequate to meet all requests made upon it. In part, thisreflects the lackoffunds available from otheragenciesto support suchvisitsand hence an increase indemands on Trust funds. It alsofollows from increased efforts on behalfoftheTrusteesto publicisethe availability of funds to supportEuropean research. 233EUROPEAN PROGRAMME List ofGrantsAwarded Belgium FELLOWSHIP Dr.J.P.Brion,Laboratory of Pathology and Electron Microscopy, Free Universityof Brussels: for one year, for the screening of human brain cDNA libraries with antibodies labelling the neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's and in situhybridization, underDr.RB.Anderton, Department of Immunology, St. George's Hospital Medical School, London.

Details of the New Zealand fellows who have so far received support are listed on page 249. The success of these initial fellowship awards was confirmed by the performance of the fellows at an innovative meeting and dinnerpartyheld at 1 Park SquareWest,underthe auspices of the Trust and the New ZealandM.R.C.The New ZealandHigh Commissioner, Mr. ByrceHarland, was the principal guest at an occasion where the fellows presented shortsummaries of theirresearch programmes to an audience ofTrustees andTruststaff. The evening was a conspicuous success, and the fellows gave outstanding presentations of their research programmes. TheTrustees' scheme to supportthe award of a majorprogramme of research in a New Zealand university has proved very successful, and receivesconsiderable interestin NewZealand. Awards made to date are detailedon page 250. TheTrustees in 1983 decided to set up a scheme to award two senior fellowships in medical science in Australia each year for four years in the first instance. The scheme is administered incollaboration with the Royal Australasian College of Physicianswith Dr. Bryan Hudson, whowasPres\u00ad ident of the College when the scheme was initiated, responsible for the management of the awards in Australia. The first two awards were made in 1984and to datesix fellowships have been granted. Thereis evidence of an increasing demandfor thesupportof scientific visits from many countries overseas, and in particular there has been in\u00ad creasing demandfor the provision of fellowships for Chinese scientists. TheTrustees areconsidering the wisdom of establishing furtherlinks be- 244tween British and Chinese medical and veterinary research workers, but for the present only support such visitson an ad hocbasis. The total funds made available to support otheroverseas projects (ex\u00ad cludingresearch in the tropics) amounted \u00a3576,759.

The last two years have been a period of both con\u00ad solidation and increased activity underthe leadership of SirWilliamPaton asHonorary Director. Inanticipation of theTrust'sJubilee Year the Library and most other public areas of the Institutewere extensively renovated, in large part with thegenerous assistance of the Wellcome Foundation. Public use of the Institute and its resources continued to increase; over 13,000visitswere recorded in 1984-85rising to over 16,000during 1985-86. TheLibrary The automation programme, using the servicesof an American LibraryCo-operative, OCLC,hascontinued at a satisfactory pace. In the meantime, much time and effort has been devoted to investigatingoptions forthenext phase of automation involvinga stand-alone system covering a wider range of library routines and including on-line public access to catalogues. The last two years have seen majoracquisitions to library stock. Some 30,000books and journalsweretransferred from the library of the British MedicalAssociation. What has become the most comprehensive collection of regional Medical Officer of HealthReportshas been assembled from a variety of sources, including the DHSS. In November 1985the Trustees purchased byprivate treatytheHaddadCollection for a sum just over \u00a3100,000. Earlierthe same year an important Middle English medical manuscript from the late 15th century was pur\u00ad chased for just over \u00a320,000 to which the Victoria and AlbertMuseum contributed agenerous \u00a310,000from their Purchase GrantFund. Thisgrant was a pleasing and significant tributefrom a public body to the Institute Library's quasi-national status in the history of medicine. Scholarly work on library materials produced two major published cata\u00ad logues, Dr. D. Wu jastyk'sHandlistoftheSanskritand Prakrit manuscripts, volume one (1985), and Dr. F. Keshavarz's Descriptive and analytical cat\u00ad alogueofPersianmanuscripts (1986). Exhibitions ofasteadily improving quality indesignanddisplaytechniques have been mounted on such subjects as Islamicphysicians and scientists, The Pest anatomized, Aristotelica, culminating in A visionofhistoryillus- 258trating the Institute's history,organisation, resources, and daily work, in celebration of the Wellcome Trust's50thAnniversary. The Academic Unit TheInstitute's Academic Unit has continued to maintain an impressive levelof activity. The formal teaching programme through the University ofLondon has been augmented bythe addition ofa paper,for scienceand medicalstudents, on medicine in modemsociety, and an advanced 'E' paper,for history students, on the concept of degeneration in late nine\u00ad teenth-century medicine, science and society. Twenty-one third-year med\u00ad icalstudents, including one from the University of Leicester, have elected to spend a full-time year in the Institute, pursuing the intercalated B.Sc. programme in the history of medicine. Total under-graduate enrolment for courses offered through the Unit has averaged about 200 per year. Postgraduate teaching has been strengthened by the addition of a seminar serieson the history ofmedicine to the M.Sc. inHistory ofScience,offered jointly with the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at Uni\u00ad versity College. Seventeen Ph.D.and M.D. candidates have been supervised bystaff, and threePh.D.degrees have been awarded. The presence of post-doctoral fellows and visiting academics on sabbatical furtherenrich the scholarly community. TheInstitute's programme ofsymposia, research seminars, teachinggroups and public lectures has also attracted a wide and varied audience. Twelve one- or two-day symposia have been held on a splendid array of topics, ancientand modem,rangingfrom ArabicScienceand Medicineand Plague in EarlyModemEurope,to theDevelopment of Biochemistry in Britain and the History of Clinical Trials. The lattertwo Symposia were held in co-operation withThe Biochemical Society and the ClinicalSection of the British Pharmacological Society, respectively. Otherorganisations with which members of the Institute collaborated in arranging joint meetings were the Society for the Study of Addiction and the Victorian Society. The symposium on Victorian Hospital Architecture attracted more than 150 participants and was continued with a series of week-end tours to hospitals of architectural interestin the London area. The fortnightly Re\u00ad search Seminar was concerned with the History of Medicine in London (1984-85) and the History ofHospitals (1985-86). Attendance remains grat\u00ad ifyingand the general quality of papers and discussionishigh. The seminar 259series on Arabic Medicine, Science and Technology has also attracted its own devoted specialist audience. Underthe scheme of Visiting Senior Research Fellowships, members of the Institute were enabled to spend time with distinguished scholars from abroad. These included Professor Fridolf Kudlien (Kiel), Professor GuenterRisse (Universityof California) and Professor F.L. Holmes (Yale). Each of these delivered publiclectures at theInstitute, as did Mr. Keith Thomas (Oxford). External participation in these events has reached 2,000 each year and many of the occasions have produced the more permanent legacyof pub\u00ad lication. No fewer than seven volumes, edited by academic staff, have appeared or are in press. Publication of the fruits of Wellcome activities has been consolidated through the establishment with the publishers, Croom Helm, of a Wellcome Institutefor the History of MedicineSeries.

Bynum ThisUnitis virtually amalgamated with the Academic Division of the Wellcome Institute for theHistoryof Medicine. Its presence as a sub\u00ad department of theDepartment ofAnatomy is, however, very important as aninterface tounder-graduates. It is responsible with the Institutefor anumberof courses University ofCambridge (set up 1970) Director: Dr.R.K.French The Unit continues to provide a wide range of teaching in medical history. The Wellcome Lecturer, Dr.A.R.Cunningham, hastakenon adminis\u00ad trativeresponsibility for the M.Phii. course as Director ofGraduate Stud\u00ad ies. Thebiennium has seen a change in emphasis in the Unit'sactivities and staff. In line with the Wellcome Trust'sintentions, the Unit is developing theresearch aspect of its activities. Aftermuchthought, theattemptto secure a teaching base in the History Faculty has been abandoned. The broadbase ofunder-graduate andpost-graduate teaching has been devel\u00ad oped as a channelfor ablestudents to take the subjectto research level. The M.Phii. course continues toattractgoodscholarsfrom otherdisciplines and offers afirm basisfor higher level research work (the number of Ph.D. students has grown to five). Dr. Wilson's acceptance of a Wellcome Research Fellowship has alsocon\u00ad tributedto the new emphasis on research. His teaching post has been filled on ashort-term basis by Dr. P. Williams. Continuing this post as a short\u00ad termjuniorappointment may in the future make it difficult to maintain theunder-graduate teaching at its presentlevel of quality and quantity. Similarly,the termination ofDr. Williams' part-time Fellowshiphasthrown considerable strain on the system of under-graduate college supervisions. With these changes the Unit has been unable to continue with a short course of lectures to clinical students. 264The resignation of Mrs. O. Brown, the Wellcome-supplied curatorial as\u00ad sistant inthe Whipple Museum, has material at Addenbrooke's Hospital and the Whipple Museum. The Unit isnow betterknowninternationally than in1984and the resulting exchangeswith universitiesoverseas have been inestablishing the Unit asa centreofresearch. The seriesofconferences planned bythe Unit is continuing to bearfruit. University ofOxford(set up 1971) Director: Dr. C. Webster TheDirectorandDeputyDirector(Margaret Pelling)havebeen associated with the Unit since its inception in 1972.The period 1984-1986 has been marked by consolidation, gradual expansion on most fronts and the com\u00ad pletion of some important research projects. Approximately twelve full\u00ad time research workers are associated with the Unit. At the under-graduate levelthe historical dissertation optionhas established a firm place among pre-clinicalstudents in their third year. Graduate studentnumbers remain constant at about 20, most of whom are preparing Oxford doctoral dis\u00ad sertations. Between 1984and A.RSummers and A. Wooldridge. The dissertations by Linda Bryder on tuberculosis in the twentieth century, Ruth Harris on law and societyin late 19th centuryFranceand Anne Summers on military nursing before 1914,have been accepted for publication. Among othercompleted researchprojects, already published is Dr. I.S.L.Loudon's Medical Care 1750-1850and the General Practitioner. In press are J.M. Beinart's HistoryoftheNuffieldDepartment ofAnaesthetics 1937-1987, Dr. H. andHuddersfield, Dr. C. Webs\u00ad ter'sProblems ofHealth Care, the British National Health Service before 1957, Dr. P.J. Weindling's study of Oscar Hertwig and hisGerman Med\u00ad Public collaborative ited by Dr. Weindling, The Social History ofOccupational Health,was published in 1985. A furthercollaborative volume edited by Dr. J. Aus\u00ad toker and Dr. D. Thorn on Population Policy in the Twentieth Century will be published by Cambridge University Press. 265University ofGlasgow (set up 1985) Director: Dr. D.N.H.Hamilton The Glasgow Wellcome Unit for the History of Medicine was set up in September 1985forthreeyears in the first instance. The Unit consists of the Director, two fellows (Drs S. Jacyna and Mar\u00ad gueriteDupree) and a secretary. The research interestsofthe Unit are in the history ofsurgery, particularly thenineteenth century, the impact of the rise of pathology on clinical practice, and the twentieth-century provisionandfinancingofthevoluntary hospitals. An active seminarprogramme is run, and there are close links throughprojectsandpost-graduate supervision with a number of other departments, notably Economic History, Archives, Modern History, the D.I.S.H. (Design and Implementation ofSoftwarefor History) laboratory, Political Economy and the Institutefor Law and Ethics. A short optional course of lectures in the history of medicine isoffered to medicalstudents. University ofManchester (set up 1986) Director: Dr. J.V. Pickstone This Unit has only recently been set up and in addition to the Director, there are four othermembers of staff. The primary function of the Unit willbe to investigate industrial medicine, particularly in the north of England, and modern medicine in relation to scienceand technology and to encourage the studyofthe historyofbiomed\u00ad ical sciences among under-graduate andpost-graduate medical students. 266C.

Thepotential growth of the Trust'sincome led to the reconsideration of its policy. With this in mind the views of the Unit directors were sought inwritingand at ameeting ofthe HistoryofMedicine Panel. The Wellcome Institute for the Historyof Medicine also prepared a strategic plan to the end of the century. The Trustees decidedthatwith the acquisition of the WellcomeBuildingthey would beinaposition to considerthedevelopment of theInstitute andthatthey should therefore examine their overall activ\u00ad itiesfor this field. A working partyunderthechairmanship of Sir William Paton and with the following membership wasestablished: Professor E.A. Wrigley, Dr. StephenLock, Dr. David Vaisey, Dr. RobertFox, and Dr. P.O. Williams with Marie and RupertHall asjointsecretaries. Its first meetings were held in the autumnof 1986. Medical History in the Universities is closely interwoven with the History ofScience. During this periodof financialstringency the History ofScience has suffered severely and this has put pressureon the History of Medicine Units, especiallyin Oxford,tobearsomeofthe load. In addition, ofcourse, there is no likelihood oftherebeing any increased university participation inthesupportof theHistoryof Medicine. The Trust therefore has avirtual monopoly for the supportof thissubjectapartfrom the posts held by Drs. Bynum,FrenchandWebster. Theconsequence isthatit is difficult to select panel members who are specialists in theirsubjectfield. The help of referees is therefore all the more important and they have given inva\u00ad luable advice. During the past two years 65 grants have been made in the following categories to a totalvalue of \u00a3826,000. 269HISTORY OFMEDICINE English Books\".

In responding to the requests of theCommonwealth Secretariat and of the HealthMinisters of the Commonwealth countries of East Africa, wehave startedtwomajorefforts. First, to redesign and develop the former Well\u00ad come Museum of Medical Science, now renamed the Wellcome Tropical Institute Museum, so that it is more effective in London, and in a form which can be used in overseas universities to supplement tropical medical teaching. Secondly, to develop distance learning programmes sothat med\u00ad ical officers in rural Africa can continue to learn where they are without the expense and disruption of travel overseas. Staff have been recruited and Bentley House has been developed, so that the Institute's general administration andsupportserviceshavebeen increasinglybusy throughout the year. Thereisnowaneffectiveteam ofwiderangingskillsinanefficient andattractive building. Museum The redesign of the Museum has begun, so thatit is more defined in its subject, more modernin itspresentation and more direct in reaching its target audience. The new Museum panels are accompanied bya handbook - full of facts to supportthe essential headlines on the panels - and a workbook for a studentto use in pacing and monitoring his own progress as he studies. Displays are ready for the Wellcome Laboratories in Nairobi and for the teaching hospitals in Addis Ababaand Kumasi, Ghana. Requests for sim\u00ad ilar displays are increasing. The new temporary exhibition area on the ground floor of 200 Euston Road will accommodate Malaria, the inaugural exhibition, scheduled to open in Spring 1987. Its creation has occupied much time during 1986. Each exhibition willtravel to othersitesin Britain and abroad after several months in London. Collecting, cataloguing and integrating new pictures and specimens isde\u00ad veloping, so thatthe Museum has a comprehensive collection to support its activities. 280Distance Learning TheDistance Learning Programme (DLP)aims topromote a system of continuing post-graduate education forruralmedical medical edu\u00ad cation in tropicalcountries, much of this first year of programme has beendevotedtoplanning anddevelopment. Negotiations areunderway withEthiopia, GhanaandKenya,whereit ishopedto pilot ma\u00ad terials on a particular topic) - Management, Epidemiology, Obstructed Labour,AcuteRespiratory Infections andBurns.Thesefirstmodules will bepilot-tested onstudentsatLeedsUniversity and at the Tropical Medical Schoolsin LondonandLiverpool in the first half of 1987: withauthorswho areexpertsin thesubjectsand with visiting writers from thecountries involved in the programme. Thisyear,two visiting workers fromGhanahaveprovided material for themodules and next year it is hopedtocontinue thispatternwithfurthervisiting Fellows who will also receivetrainingin medical education. Technical Resources Group The technical resources grouphasdeveloped rapidly. With new photo\u00ad graphicequipment most black and white photographs, conservation and duplication beundertaken. Duplicating 281Nigeria, was attachedto ofaBritishCouncil Fellowship and it is hopedto trainothersin this way. Opportunities have been actively sought to work with others in the same field: as a result of this policy and a wishto develop, aone daysymposium on 'Medical videodiscs and interactive video',was held in with the Medical AudioVisualLibrary- it wassponsored bySony (U.K.)Ltd. Archive InDecember established for 12months. During this periodobjectives have been defined and developed withrespect to its role within the Institute itself, and in the work of the Instituteover\u00ad seas. Theseobjectives are to build up a comprehensive collection of material documenting work in the history of tropical medicine and representing a broadspectrum ofcurrenttrendsanddevelopments in tropical medicine andhealthcare,together witheducation in these areas. Itis envisaged thatthe Archive willprovide contributing materialfor the Museumdisplays and exhibitions. The scope of the Archive will be broad.Itwill collect the personal and workingpapersof academics and practitioners in allareas of tropical med\u00ad icine.Itis alsodeveloping links with many of the non-governmental agen\u00ad cies andorganisations which are concerned with medical aid and teaching in tropical countries. Itishopedto receive, on deposit for research pur\u00ad poses, the records of these agencies, which willbe surveyed in detail. Work in progress includes, the sorting and listing of materials deposited by the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene and material al\u00ad ready collected bythe Wellcome Museum of Medical Sciencebefore 1984. Initial deposits of personal and working papers,drawing and photographic materialhave been received from the familiesofthe late Dr. S.G. Browne, Dr.F.Hawking, Dr. B. Jobling and ViceMarshall R.L. Chev\u00ad erton. 282Work has begun on the systematic listing and storage of our Museum's slidecollection, some 24,000items at present,for whicha strongroom has been converted. Library The Library was established to provide a comprehensive collection of ma\u00ad terial in tropical medicine. Itcontains primary and secondary sources re\u00ad lating to the history of tropical medicine and currentwork in the field. There has been a steady growth inthe collections and stock nowcomprises approximately 1400 monographs, 20,000pamphlets and 150 serial titles, two thirds of which are currentsubscriptions. Material has been acquired from a variety of sources to supplement the core collection received from the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine's Enfield Store. Gifts have been received from several individ\u00ad uals, most notably Professor L.J.Bruce-Chwatt, Dr.R.L.Cheverton, Dr. J.R.Bakerand the late Dr. C.A.Hoare.Asubstantial pre-1950monograph collection has been acquired on permanent loan from the Library of the London SchoolofHygiene and Tropical Medicine, and asmallercollection of serials from the British Medical Association Library. Special private collections include the monograph collection of Colonel D.G.Crawford of the Indian Medical Service, and the reprintcollections ofDrsC.M. Wenyon and C.A.Hoareofthe WellcomeMuseumofMedical Science. The Library in the D.C.L.C. automation projectat the Well\u00ad comeInstitute for the History of Medicine; to which it has contributed 2,390bibliographic records to its database. 283X MEDALS AND PRIZESMEDALS ANDPRIZES Association ofMilitary Surgeons ofthe United States ofAmerica.
