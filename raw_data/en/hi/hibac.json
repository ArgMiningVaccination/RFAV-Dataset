Eat right, feel right. The correlation can also be a disturbing one, in that it requires us as adults to question whether there should be some sort of divider in place \u2014 one to keep the hands of modern science from interfering with our nutrition and sense of well-being, when the touch is not necessary. The question is a disturbing one in that it needs to be asked: Who do you trust? For Registered Nurse Jennifer Brandolino, her first advice is simple. Trust your doctor. \"I want to enhance what doctors are already doing,\" she said. \"In regards to doctors in terms of medication and surgeries, there really is so much they can do.\" The problem is that the wonders of modern medicine and science are not without side effects. Watch any television program and eventually you'll start to hear them. Nausea, headaches, anxiety, insomnia, drowsiness, and loss of appetite, to name a few. \"If you can avoid any side effects \u2014 sometimes huge side effects \u2014 that's big,\" she said. \"When I was in nursing school I started to feel like there could be something else of help to people. Ever since I was young I have been interested in natural methods.\" Brandolino grew up in El Salvador where many ailments were primarily treated through the use of herbs and natural remedies. As she progressed through her education, she found herself drawing closer to that time when medicine wasn't necessarily coming from a factory, but first-hand from organic sources, and applied through non-invasive practices. Brandolino began studying and obtaining certifications in Southern California, along with a diploma from the Institute of Biochemic Medicine in Australia. \"A lot of people came to me convinced that there was nothing else they could do. Now they see improvement. They see hope. They might even be able to reduce their medication,\" she said. \"A lot of people don't know about these remedies in the valley.\" Under the mission of bringing clarity to a healthy way of living, Jennifer Brandolino, along with her husband Robert, opened Total Healthy Lifestyle Saturday at the Sequoia Mall in Visalia. She makes no qualms about her practice. \"I'm not a doctor,\" she said. \"I'm here to compliment what the doctor is already doing.\" She will be doing so by offering customized treatments sessions that combine the most suited homeopathics, flower essence combinations, cell salts and Jin Shin Jyutsu holds. Think of Jin Shin Jyutsu as acupuncture without the needles. Much like acupuncture, it's increasingly becoming recognized among conventional medical practices. \"It's being used in different hospitals to help people going through radiation to help them with their side effects,\" Jennifer said. In the practice, hands and fingers are placed on specific areas of the body referred to as \"safety energy locks,\" this is performed in various patterns to facilitate the flow of energy throughout the body. The sessions are accompanied by complimentary demonstrations of \"self-help holds,\" so that the practice can continue at home to extend the effectiveness of the energy flow and decrease further required visits. \"It has real-world implications,\" Robert Brandolino said. \"A student may be taking a test and there are certain holds they can use to calm themselves.\" Of course, to many, phrases like \"energy flows\" can sound more like something you'll hear coming from the mouth of a Jedi in Star Wars than a medical practitioner. Those skeptics are not alone. \"Many people say that homeopathy is just a placebo,\" Robert said. \"We treat pets, we treat animals, and the animals get better. Why wouldn't it work on humans?\" To Total Healthy Lifestyle, the results are seen in the satisfaction of their customers. \"A gentleman in his 70's came in. Hi cancer has metastasized. He was in a lot of pain and couldn't eat,\" he said. \"After several sessions in a row he started getting his appetite back.\" Of course, a healthy appetite doesn't always work wonders if the food isn't healthy. To ensure that their customers continue to eat well without having to make too many sacrifices Total Healthy Lifestyle has transformed their lobby into a fully stocked pantry containing healthy, organic versions of the most commonly requested snacks. \"We try to pick snacks people like,\" Robert said. Foods such as organic grass-fed beef jerky, gluten-free and sugar-free pastries from local vendors, fruit spreads from as far as Italy, and all organic chocolate that's made from coconut sugars rather than commonly used cane sugars. Those who think they're already eating healthy may be surprised. \"People think soy milk is healthy, but it actually is not,\" Jennifer Brandolino said. This is due to a subject matter that will result in an argument no matter which side you stand on: GMOs, or genetically modified materials. If you ask Alison Van Eenennaam, who lectured on the benefits of GMOs at this year's World Ag Expo, according to certain studies genetically modified materials have no shown ill-effects in humans or animals and allows for the potential to end hunger for hundreds of millions across the globe. If you ask organizations like Greenpeace, such studies are questionable in evaluating the long-term impact of GMOs on food, and in addition, result in pesticide resilience that could lead to agricultural devastation. Again, who do you trust? After all, Snow White had an apple a day too, and see where that landed her. \"There's a whole array of studies that never get noticed about GMO's that never get recognized,\" Robert Brandolino. \"It's the same with homeopathy.\" Homeopathy as alternative medicine has been labeled as pseudoscience, but then again, so has acupuncture and chiropractic treatments which remain no less popular. It was created in the 1780's by Samuel Hahnemann, who objected to the medical practices of the time, including bloodletting which today is only used in the rarest of instances. Just as bloodletting was retired as a practice, it's interesting to think what practices will also be abandoned as time moves forward, and which practices that have been used for thousands of years will have benefits newly recognized. Robert Brandolino understands that some practices are just too far out there. \"There's a whole segment of homeopathic treatments that are just wacky,\" he said, \"but Jennifer doesn't work with anything that isn't scientific or can't be backed up.\" Whether or not the practices are widely accepted among the scientific community, Robert and Jennifer Brandolino are passionate that the services they provide are effective when paired alongside the medical treatments that are. \"We're not about alternative forms of medicine being the only ones that count. We want this to be a marriage between western medicine and modern medicine,\" Jennifer Brandolino said. For the duo behind Total Healthy Living, any step taken towards a healthier lifestyle is a step a patient can be proud of. In allowing those steps to be there, what they are actually selling is peace of mind, a chance for those who have already exhausted their options to step beyond just the hanging apple offered by modern medicine and try something else \u2014 an apple untampered with, and of course, GMO free.
