CULTIVATED WITHIN A PROTECTED GREEN HOUSE By Amanda C. Morgan December 2017 Chair: Brian J. Pearson Cochair: Kimberly Moore Major: Horticultural Sciences Scutellaria , or s kullcap, is a genus containing approximately 350 species of flowering plants , many of which are sold and market ed for their medicinal value. Flavonoids found in Scutellaria species have demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antiviral, sedative, antithrombotic and antioxidant affects. Scutellaria spp. have potential to become valuable ornamental crops based on their visual and medicinal properties; however, commercial production protocol has not been developed for this unique plant. Given flavonoid synthesis is influenced by plant production environment, empirical research is needed for the development of commercial production p rotocol. Thus, objectives of this research were to (1) investigate the influence of nutrient application rate and soilless substrate composition on S. integrifolia growth and (2) , investigate the effect of nutrient application rate and water stress on grow th and flavonoid synthesis in S. arenicola and S. integrifolia . Results demonstrated that synthesis of baicalin occurred in both species. Fertilization rate was found to influence both baicalin concentration and plant growth in Scutellaria integrifolia . In contrast to results observed for S. integrifolia , 10 water stress and nutrient application rate did not influence plant growth or baicalin concentration S. arenicola . Results from this investigation will assist in the development of commercial production pro tocol for these species and provides the first foundational research that has reported the presence of baicalin, a high value medicinal compound, in either S. integrifolia or S. arenicola . 11 CHAPTER 1 REVIEW OF LITERATURE Medicinal Plants in Horticulture Plants have been utilized for their medicinal properties for thousands of years. Despite well -established knowledge of their value to indigenous populations, contemporary Western medicine has yet to research potential health benefits of many phytochemicals found in a wide array of plant species. Even with the development of modern pharmacop oeia, herbal remedies continue to be widely used and are historically, culturally, economically and scientifically important across the globe. Traditional Medicine is a m ulti-billion -dollar industry worldwide (WHO, 2002) . As much as 80% of Africa 's population and 40% of Asia's population still incorporates traditional medicine practices in healing (WHO, 2002) . The World Health Organization (WHO) defines traditional medicine as products that utilize portions of plants, animals, and/or minerals to improve human health (WHO, 2002) . Therapies that include ingestion or application of prepared herbal medicines , such as acupuncture, manual therapies, and spiritual therapies, are also included in the definition of traditional medicine. Traditional medicines have become increasingly popular in the United States, with 20% of the population reporting their use in 2008 (Bent, 2008) . Traditional Chinese medicine , Ayurvedic medicine, Arabic U nani medicine, and various indigenous practices are the most popular herbal medicine classifications. These medicinal systems are highly valued in their geographic region of origin for both healing and spiritual practices, and are often incorporated into daily routine. Traditional medicine systems have been scientifically valuable given their important role as foundations for modern pharmaceutical co mpounds. Western pharmaceutical compounds often include notable 12 percentages of biopharmaceuticals originally discovered through ethnobotanical research efforts. Utilization of indigenous ethnobotanical knowledge in identifying potential beneficial plant se condary compounds is 80% more effective at drug discovery than random plant sampling methods (Ghorbani et al. , 2006) . Medicinal Plant Cultivation Although cultivation of medicinal plants has become increasingly popular, the majority of medicinally valuable plants are still wild harvested (Schippmann et al. , 2002) . An extensive study by Schippman n on the global trends in medicinal plant biodiversity in 2002 estimated that there are over 50,000 plant species that are known to have been used in traditional medicine, but less than one thousand of the species are regularly cultivated. Though a conservative estimate, at least 8% of known medicinal plant species are under threat of extinction as a result of increased consumptive demand and degradation of natural plant environments (Schippman et al. , 2002) . Medicinal plant cultivation is becoming increasingly common with the rise in profitability of herbal supplements and natural medicines. However, challenges preclude widespread cultivation of many medicinal plant species. One obstacle to commercial medicinal plant production is reduced bioactive compound concentration. When medicinal plants are produced ex situ , lower concentrati ons of bioactive compounds have been recorded (Schippmann et al. , 2002) . Thus , making commercially produced medicinal plants less valuable than wild harvested specimens. A likely cause for this loss of potency is a lack of seco ndary metaboli c pathway induction due to little to no plant stress, conditions plants may not experience ex situ (Schippman et al. , 2002) . If relationships between environmental stimuli and secondary metabolic processes are understood through empirical research, production methods may be adopted to 13 enhance concentrations of medicinally active compounds and thus value of medicinal plant production. Commercial cultivation of medicinal plants is challenged by the wide diversity of plants and the bioactive compounds that make them valuable. Moreover, variability in cultivation practices may have a significant and unknown influence on quality and concentration of b ioactive compounds. The WHO has developed guidelines for medicinal plan t production. These protocols aim to promote conservation of medicinal plants in the wild and help to ensure quality control of commercial herbal products. Guidelines suggest plant material must come from a sustainable source, are properly identified, and each species grown according to protocol developed through research (WHO, 2003) . World Health Organization guidelines require medicinal plant products intended for consumption be harvested at optimal time of secondary metabolite production. Moreover, WHO guidelines require secondary metabolites be quantified to ensure they meet medicinal quality assigned to that plant. Quality control in medicinal plant production can be achieved through understanding secondary metabolite synthesis w ithin a specific plant species. A focus on triggers of biochemical pathways responsible for secondary me tabolite production is critical, cultivation protocols may be able to assist in synthesis of medicinal compounds in plants. Scutellaria spp. Plants As with many other members of the mint family, Lamiaceae, Scutellaria genus is prized for its medicinal and aesthetic value. Scutellaria comprises species of flowering biennial/perennial plants commonly known as 'skullcap'. Skullcap species grow in a wide ran ge of locations within China, Europe and North America (Shang et al. , 2010) . 14 Scutellaria baicalensis , Chinese sk ullcap, has been used for thousan ds of years as a traditional Chinese medicine and is commonly prescribed in China, Jap an and Korea as an anti -inflammatory, antiviral and antithrombotic agent (Shang et al. , 2010) . The roots of S. baicalensis are ground into a powder, encapsulated and a dministered orally to patients, often mixed with other herbs. In the U nited States , extract from Scutellaria lateriflora , American skullcap, dominates the market and is sold as an anxiolytic. S. lateriflora is a North American species ubiquitous across the continent. Although not medically prescribed, it is commonly av ailable as an herbal supplement. The aerial parts of S. lateriflora are dried and ground, the crude extract is encapsulated and sold as an herbal supplement, a liquid extract, and most frequently as an ingredient in teas. Approximately 35 Scutellaria speci es have been investigated for medical applications; however, S. baicalensis and S. lateriflora are the two -prominent species sold as medicinal herbs (Shang et al. , 2010) . When marketed as a medicinal herb, skullcap is sold on a dr y weight basis. Skullcap containing a high concentration of flavonoids may demand high market value, especially if it is certified organic (Similien et al. , 2016) . Baicalin, the main flavonoid of Scutellaria has been used as a d eterminate of medicinal Scutellaria quality within Asian countries. High quality Scutellaria roots should contain baicalin at concentrations 9% according to Chinese Pharmacop oeia (Shang et al. , 2010) . In the US, skullcap has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is at present designated as an herb of \"undefined safety\" (Awad et al. , 2003) . Skullcap byproducts have become a popular alternative anti -anxiety medicinal herb comparable to kava and valerian root (Awad et al. , 2003) . S. lateriflora has been reportedly used as a medicinal herb by indigenous Americans to treat nervous conditions (Awad et al. , 2003) . 15 Scutellaria integrifolia has a native range from Florida to Massachusetts. Its occurrence in Florida i s common; however, it has been listed as a critically imperiled species in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Oklahoma due mainly to land disturbance and use (Miller, 2002) . Conservation efforts for this species have been enacted within Connecticut to ensure five established populations remain throughout the state (Miller, 2002) . Diminishing wild populations of this plant wil l likely enhance its value as a specialty crop. Scutellaria arenicola has a smaller natural range and is found from C entral Florida to Georgia . Although common in the southeastern U.S., its status as an endangered species is unknown (Joshee et al. , 2002) . Information on horticultural production practices is lacking for both species and reported quantification of medicinal compounds is extremely limited for S. integrifolia , and absent for S. arenicola . Commercial cultivation of S. arenicola is limited to one nursery in Central Florida. Cultivation practices at this facility have been iteratively derived for this species. Flavonoids in Nature Flavonoids are a class of phytochemicals which are ubiquitous throughout the plant kingdom (Winkel, 2002) . Accumulation of red and purple flavonoids which are displayed in vegetative tissue are oftentimes produced in response to plant stress (Winkel, 2002) . Anthocyanin, a well -known flavonoid is partially responsible for display of autumn leaf coloration and is believed to protect plants from excess light and translocation of nutrients during senescence (Field et al. , 2001) . Anthocyanin is also believed to be produced b y plants to assist in attraction of pollinators and seed dispersers (Winkel, 2002) . One major function of flavonoids is UV protection. These compounds prevent photo damage in leaves through absorption of ultra violet light (Winkel, 2002) . Studies have also shown that flavonoids may inhibit auxin, a plant 16 growth hormone that assists in stress response by controlling stomatal opening (Winkel, 2002) . Flavonoids and Human Health Of the many functions of flavonoids in nature, antioxidative capabilities may be the most important. These compounds are believed to be produced by plants to protect cellular tissue from oxidative degradation (Winkel, 2002) . Antioxida nts have shown to positively impact human health through their anti -carcinogenic and anti -aging effects. Moreover, antioxidants have shown to be helpful in reducing incidence of Alzheimer's disease (Engelhart et al. , 2002) . Flavonoids are known for their free radical scavenging abilities and ability to donate hydrogen to reactive oxygen species (ROS) giving the m molecular stability. Other mechanisms of flavonoids include metal ion chelation , which support ROS formation and Baicalin, the main Scutellaria species, interacts with copper to block aggregation with amyloid beta peptide, a compound believed to be responsible for Alzheimer's Disease (Yin et al., 2011) . Cell viability through this interaction increased from 58% to 78%, thus supporting neurodegenerative disease prevention claims (Yin in medicinally active compounds produced by Scutellaria spp. While hundreds of compounds have been identified in various species of Scutellaria , past research has tended to focus on these three compounds. Recently, several other flavonoid constituents of Scutellaria have received attention in scientific resea rch such as skullcapflavone, neobaicalein, and chrysin (Bonham et al., 2005 ; Similien et al., 2016) . Multiple studies of have shown efficacy of Scutellaria baicalensis as a cancer -fighting agent, attributing this use to flavonoid 17 presence. Zhang et al. (2003) demonstrated that Scutellaria baicalensis was an effective treatment for Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) with up to 90% inhibition of cell proliferation depending on dose and timing. In a similar study, Bonham et al. (2005) found S. baicalensis prevented androgen receptor expression and cell proliferation, conditions that often lead to development of prostate cancer. Results were accredited to four flavonoid constituents found in the plants roots. When tested against development of brain tumors, extracts from S. baicalensis showed a dose - dependent inhibition of cancerous cells (Scheck et al. , 2006) . All three of these studies suggest that S. baicalensis may be a useful tool in combination, or as an alternative to current cancer therapies (Zhang et al., 2003 ; Bonham et al., 2005 ; Scheck et al. , 2006) . Baicalin has demonstrated anti -inflammatory properties due to its ability to bind to chemokines and mediate inflammation and infection (Li et al. , 2000) . Chemok ines function to transport leukocytes to sites of inflammation or infection, but often lead to greater risk of pathological inflammatory reactions (Li et al. ,2000) . Binding of baicalin to various chemokines prevents binding to whi te blood cells, thus lowering chances of inflammatory reaction (Li et al. , 2000) . Research efforts that examined phytochemistry of this herb have shown favorable results for its potential as an anxiolytic agent. Anxiolytic effect s of baicalin result from baicalin's ability to bind to the benzodiazepine site of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter (Awad et extract obtained from Scutellaria lateriflora (American Skullcap) had similar amin o acid concentration when compared to another popular anxiolytic herb, Valerian officianalis . Both plants had high concentrations of glutamine, a compound that can pass through the blood -brain barrier and be metabolized into GABA (Awad et al. , 2003) . High levels of glutamine likely allow 18 for greater synthesis and release of GABA, resulting in an inhibitory response in neurons (Awad et al. , 2003) . Inconsistencies in utilization of Scutellaria spp. are prevalen t in the medical herb market. For example, two different species of Scutellaria are marketed for treatment of differing ailments despite possessing the same three flavonoids. Additionally, differences exist in which plant parts are collected and sold for m edicinal benefit. While some medicinal Scutellaria spp. products are comprised of plant shoots, others are comprised solely of the roots. Both S. baicalensis and S. lateriflora have been reported to accumulate more flavonoids in the roots than in the shoot s of the plant (Shang et al. , 2010) . Differences in concentrations of medically active compounds may exist between various plant structural components or species; however, research is unavailable to elucidate such relationships. It is possible that the different concentration of compounds could have to do with the difference in medical application. Quantifying concentrations of flavonoids synthesized in less commonly cultivated Scutellaria species may assist in better understanding variations that exist in medical application of this unique herb . Flavonoid Synthesis Flavonoids are synthesized from the phenylpropanoid pathway in response to environmental plant stressors (Kumar and Pandey, 2013) . The first key enzyme in this pathway, phenylalanine ammonia -lyase (PAL), catalyzes phenylalanine into trans - cinnamic acid. Phenylalanine ammonia -lyase is responsible for plant functions such as mechanical support and pigmentation. It induces the phenylpropanoid pathway in response to biotic and abiotic factors such as light intensity, wounding, or pathogen presence (Xu et al. , 2010) . Cinnamate 4 -hydro xylase controls 19 carbon flux in plants when they are subject to pathogenic attack (Xu et al. , 2010) . Two other major enzymes in the flavone include 4 -coumarate its coenzyme -A ester, a precursor to flavonoid production as well as other secondary metabolites believed to be of benefit human health. Chalcone synthase is the first reaction to target the flavonoid pathway and is often detected in Scutellaria species when baicalin is present (Xu et al. , 2010) . Flavonoids are phytochemicals synthesized only by plant cells. Metabolism of flavonoids in humans depend on the structure of the flavonoid, whe ther it is a glycoside or algyco n. Baicalin is in the form of a glycoside and must be converted to algyco n form , in order to be Pandey , 2013) . Glycoside -form flavonoid metabolism is initiated in the small intestine before being tr ansported to the colon. There , bacteria hydrolyze them for absorption into to the human body. Following absorption, they are conjugated in the liver by either glucuronidation, sulfation or methylation, or they are metabolized to compounds (Kumar and Pandey , 2013) . Flavonoids are an integral part of the human diet as they are present in numerous plant species that are common food ingredients. Scientific literature regarding the efficacy of herbal medicines is largel y unavailable. Continued research on biochemical mechanisms of ethno -pharmacological plants may offer alternatives to improvement in human health while simultaneously increasing our knowledge and utilization of plants. If found to be effective in treatment of human health conditions, ethnobotanical plant production would likely contribute to profitability of the horticultural plant production industry. 20 The Carbon -nutrient Balance Hypothesis The Carbon -nutrient balance hypothesis (CNB H) was a widely accepted model for explaining variations in plant secondary metabolite concentrations (Hamilton et al. , 2001) . The hypothesis was first proposed in 1983 and postulated that development of plant secondary metabolites occurred in response to limiting conditions that sessile plants are exposed to, especially when herbivory occurred (Bryant et al. , 1983) . The hypothesis was based upon three assumptions: 1) carbon and nitrogen will be allocated foremost for plant gro wth and not in production of secondary compounds, 2) limited availability of nutrients or light would reduce growth or constrain photosynthesis, and 3) concentrations of secondary metabolites will directly correlate with concentrations of precursor molecul es in the biochemical pathway. The hypothesis assumed that when nitrogen was available in the presence of limiting light for photosynthesis to occur, a decrease in carbon -nitrogen ratios would exist and in response increase production of secondary metaboli tes as defense mechanisms against herbivory (Hamilton et al. , 2001) . Negation on the a ssumptions of the CNB H have created strong cases against the generalized approach the hypothesis takes on secondary metabolites. Tuomi et al. (1988) refuted the CNB H and argued that secondary metabolites may not only form in response to nutrient availability and lighting, but as a component of their evolutionary strategy to deter herbivory. Mechanical induction and meas urements of secondary compou nd concentrations fail to account for ecologically meaningful variation in individual compounds (Kein\u00e4nen et al. , 1999) . The hypothesis also overlooks variability of phytochemical structures and pathw ays, and that herbivory defense and plant growth are not the only functions of plant metabolism (Hamilton et al. , 2001) . Plant resources 21 may also be reallocated in cases of temperature extremes, for ultraviolet protection, repro duction, competition, and symbiosis (Hamilton et al. , 2001) . Despite its previous adoption, the CNB H is no longer widely supported by the scientific community. Rather, recent scientific literature supports the study of individ ual metabolite pathways and functioning. Understanding evolutionary principles of secondary metabolic compounds is a more likely method to understand their synthesis. Once the purpose is understood, inferences can then follow on methods to manipulate synth esis of the desired compounds. Despite the modern widespread lack of support for the CNB H, the hypothesis may help explain phenylpropanoid synthesis as these compounds are evolutionarily beneficial to plants for defense purposes when environmental stress f actors are present. Horticultural Influences on Flavonoid Accumulation Environmental influences such as heat, drought and nitrogen deficiency may impact plant flavonoid accumulation and thus, has led to the prospective theory that horticultural practices m ay affect flavonoid synthesis in plants. Nutrient deficiencies have been correlated with flavonoid accumulation in many plant species. Coronado et al. (2005) reported significantly greater concentrations of flavonoids in alfalfa when nitrogen was intentionally limited. Bongue -Bartelsman and Phillips (1995) found that anthocyanin, a popular flavonoid, concentration increased 2 -fold in tomatoes that experienced nitrogen deficiency. In related studies, flav onoid concentration was found to be influenced by water availability. A study by Ma et al. (2014) compared effects of drought on flavonoid synthesis in two different varieties of wheat. Results showed water stress significantly increa sed flavonoid concentrations in both varieties (Ma et al. , 2014) . In a study conducted by Castellarin et al. (2007) , flavonoid accumulation in ripening fruit 22 increased significantly under drought stress, and water deficits improved berry and wine quality due to the increased presence of flavonoids. The author found water deficits before onset of fruit resulted in higher flavonoid concentration than when water deficits occurred after fruit formation. Regu larly-irrigated plants had significantly low flavonoid concentrations than plants which received either water deficit treatment (Castellarin et al., 2007) . Flavonoid concentration in Scutellaria is influenced by nutrient ava ilability. Cao et al. (2012) tested fertilizer application on growth and baicalin concentration in Scutellaria baicalensis . Results showed decreased baicalin concentration in response to increased nitrogen and potassium availability. When phosphorus availability was i ncreased; however, baicalin was observed to increase (Cao et al. , 2012) . These results are consistent with findings in Shiwakoti et al. (2016) , who observed increases in both baicalin and wogonin in response to phosphorus applications of greenhouse -grown American skullcap ( S. lateriflora ). Contrary to results from Cao et al. (2012) , Shiwakoti et al. (2016) did not observ e any relationships between baicalin concentrations in response to nitrogen and potassium application. Differences in results are likely due to species and climatic variations. In contrast findings by Shiwakoti et al. (2016) , Similien et al. (2016) found increased nutrient applications negatively correlated with accumulation of flavonoids in American Skullcap. Differences are likely due to differing growth conditions and fertilizer treatment methods. In Shiwakoti et al. (2016) , plants were subject to either nitrogen, phosphorus or potassium at different rates, and grown in a greenhouse; whereas Similien et al. (2016) utilized compounded fertilize rs containing all three nutrients . Similien et al. (2016) observed flavonoid concentrations of American 23 skullcap were maximized when grown in full sun and without supplemental fertilizer as compared to those cultivated under sha ded, high -nutrient availability conditions. Availability of water may be a significant factor to flavonoid accumulation. When irrigation was applied to S. lateriflora cultivated in an open field, flavonoid concentrations increased (Similien et al. , 2016) . When cultivated under shaded conditions, however, field -grown S. lateriflora flavonoid concentrations were not significantly influenced by irrigation applications. Similar relationships between water availability and light inte nsity on flavonoid concentrations were where flavonoids in Ligustrum vulgare increased under sun conditions when sufficiently irrigated (Tattini et al. , 2004) . Tattin i et al. (2004) also reported flavonoid concentrations increased in Ligustrum leaves grown in shade and under drought stress. This contradiction to results from Similien et al. (2016) are likely due to differe nt flavonoids pres ent in the differing plant species. Results from both Similien et al. (2016) and Tattini et al. (2004) indicate that light intensity may have a bigger impact on flavonoid a ccumulation than irrigation, but stressed conditions in general seem to be impactful on the synthesis of flavonoids. In contrast to findings by Tattini et al. (2004) and Similien et al. (2016) , relationships between irrigation app lications and flavonoid synthesis were found to be negatively correlated in Faxinus ornus (Fini et al., 2005) . In the 2005 , Fini concluded that phenylpropanoid synthesis was trig gered by drought stress to protect against reactive oxygen species. Increase in flavonoid synthesis under drought stress has also been found in studies on legumes, Selaginella , and Cotinus (Chalker -Scott, 1999) . When grown on a commercial scale, it is important to consider the total dry mass yield of the plant, as having higher dry mass yields a large quantity of available product, 24 including flavonoid s. Addition of nutrients, as shown in the two studies done by Similien et al. (2016) and Shiwakoti et al. (2016) , may overall decrease flavonoid concentrations in plants, but will yield more plant matter to be harvested. A balance of nutrient application and flavonoid synthesis must be accomplished for efficient growth of skullcap. An economic analysis of skullcap cultivation practices inclusive of the market value of harvested active medicinal compounds will be necessary to assist in the determination of commercial cultivation p ractices of this unique crop. Research on relationships between Scutellaria spp. growth and secondary metabolic compound concentrations is a critical foundation for future commercial production analysis and efficacy for utilization of this unique herb. 25 CHAPTER 2 EFFECT OF FERTILIZER RATE AND SUBSTRATE ON GROWTH OF SCUTELLARIA INTEGRIFOLIA , A FLORIDA NATIVE SKULLCAP Introduction Scutellaria is a genus which comprises over 350 species of flowering herbaceous plants found around the globe. Select species o f Scutellaria are economically important as both ornamental and medicinal plants. Scutellaria baicalensis , or Baikal skullcap, is sold both as an herbal supplement as well as an ornamental for its clusters of bright purple flowers. Numerous species of Scutellaria are grown and sold as flowering ornamental plants. While focus of this genus is on its medicinal qualities, commercial cultivation practices are widely lacking. The vast number of Scutellaria species that exist gives these plants many opportunities for non -competitive plant production and sales, due to a large and diverse species range. Scutellaria integrifolia , or helmet skullcap, is native to the Southeastern United States from Texas to New York (United States Department of Agriculture, 2017) . In Florida, this plant can be found growing in various ecosystems such Pine Flatwoods, sandhills, and ruderal areas (Taylor, 2013) . While this species commonly occurs in its southern ranges, it has recently b een listed as critically imperiled in the Northeastern U.S. states of Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York (Miller, 2001) . A short -lived perennial herbaceous plant, S. integrifolia 's purple blooms develop in early spring and last throughout summer (Florida Native Plant Society, 2013) . Micropropagation and germination trials conducted at Fort Valley State University have demonstrated potential commercial production success; however, limited reporting precl udes widespread commercial adoption (Joshee et al. , 2002) . Though this species has been recognized as a good candidate for wildflower gardening and native landscapes by the Florida Native 26 Plant Society, no information has been rec orded on horticultural production of this plant. Research on growth of this species in commercial settings could aid in the introduction of this plant to the green industry as a native ornamental species. With rising popularity of incorporating native pla nts into urban landscapes, developing production methods for native species is imperative . Brzuszek and Harkess (2009) observed retail customers were more likely to purchase native plants when used by landscape architects and co ntractors in landscapes of new urban construction. Though demand for native plants is high, supply is insufficient due to limited number of wholesale nurseries (Brzuszek and Harkess , 2009) . Reasons for a lack of native plant availability include highly regionalized markets and higher cost of plant material (Norcini, 2007 ). Despite these issues, this niche market has s hown to be profitable. Florida in particular, leads the southeastern region in recognit ion, promotion, and use of native species in urban landscapes (Brzuszek and Harkess , 2009) . In a 2005 survey , Norcini (2007 ) reported that the Florida native plant industry accounted for 11% of total p lant sales, accounting for approximately $316 million. Growth in the native plant production industry is likely. Khachatryan and Hodges (2012) reported growing and/or selling of Florida -friendly species is among the most sign ificant areas for growth among plant producers, retailers, and landscapers. Aside from profitable business opportunity for growers, increased use of native plants aids conservation efforts through maintenance of native species diversity and its positive im pacts on attraction and proliferation of pollinators, shelter for native wildlife, lower water usage, and generally lower landscape management requirements (Kauth and P\u00e9rez , 2011) . Developing species -specific horticultural regimen s for native plants would likely bridge the gap between native plant suppliers, landscapers and retail customers, 27 ultimately promoting profitability for horticultural producers. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of soilless subst rate mixtures and fertilizer application rate on growth of Florida native skullcap ( S. integrifolia ) within a protected greenhouse production environment. Information collected from this investigation can be used to help commercial plant producers maximize production efficacy of this Florida native plant species. Materials and Methods Plant Collection and Cultivation Two hundred Scutellaria integrifolia seeds were collected from a native field environment within Altoona, Lake County, Florida (29.01 N -81.66 W) on 23 June 2016 and planted into 72 -cell pack propagation trays (Landmark Plastic, Akron, Ohio) filled with soilless substrate (Fafard 1P, SunGro Horticulture, Agawam, MA). Tra ys were placed within a 128 m2 greenhouse located in Apopka, Florida and subject to mist - irrigation every 9 minutes for 10 days. After 10 days, mist irrigation was discontinued and plants received irrigation utilizing a capillary system. On 28 July 2016, plants were transplanted into 72 containers (0.5 L; Landmark Plastics, Akron , Ohio) filled with one of three soilless substrate mixtures 1P, Fafard 4P, (Table 2 -1). Substrates were selected based upon their varying compositions to encompass a range of varying water and nutrient holding capacities. Fafard 1P substrate had a high pe rcentage of peat, making for a high water holding capacity substrate , while Fafard 52 contains a large percentage of bark, making it a more porous substrate. Faf ard 4P had similar proportions of bark and peat to compare against the extremities of the 1P and 52 substrates (Table 2 -1). Upon transplant, each plant received 112.5 mL of water daily , using a pressure -compensating 28 drip irrigation emitter installed within each container (Woodpecker Pressure Compensating drippers; Netafim, Fresno, CA) . On 15 August 2016, six replicates of each substrate treatment were randomly assigned one of four fertilizer treatments to include: none (0 g), low (2 g), med ium (4.6 g), or high (7 g) of Osmocote Slow Release 15-9-12 (Everris NA Inc. Dublin, OH). Application rates were chosen based upon fertilizer manufacturer recommendations. Measurements and Data Collection Beginning 1 week after transplant (WAT), plant grow th indices (PGI = height x width1 x width2) were recorded weekly and continued until termination of the experiment 5 WAT. Substrate pH and electroconductivity (EC) were measured bi - weekly between 2 and 5 WAT , using the method described by Wright (1984) (Table 2 - 2). The experiment was terminated 15 September 2016 (5 WAT) when plants began flowering. Plants were destructively harvested by cutting the plant 2.5 cm above the crown and dried at room temperatu re until 70% moisture was lost. Dry weight was measured and recorded using a laboratory balance ( Adventurer Analytical; Ohaus, Parsippany, NJ). The experiment was arranged as a complete randomized design with substrate and fertilizer application rate assigned as independent variables . Six replicates were cultivated for each treatment combination for a total of 72 experimental units. Statistical analysis of PGI and dry mass data was analyzed using mixed model ana lysis by WAT with variance within treatment combination replicates de fined as the random erro r term. Due to non -gaussian distribution for PGI data, a log transformation was imposed, and utilized for data analysis. Post-hoc mean separation analysis was performed using 29 Tukey 's honest significant diff erence test. Statistical tests were considered significant if P 0.05 . Results Mean daily greenhouse temperature ranged from 26.7 to 31 C throughout the duration of the experiment. Mean r elative humidity was 74.9% and p hotosynthetic active radiation varied 237.7 to \u00b5mol/m2s. Germination of Scutellaria integrifolia seeds was 56%. This low germination rate may be a result of the collection method, germination treatment, or typical of this native plant species. A lack of comparable research precludes germination rate comparison. Germination data presented here provides a baseline for future studies and research findings. Plant Growth Indices Plant growth indic es were generally quadratic for all treatment combinations throughout the experiment (Figure 2 -1). Significant differences existed among substrate type 1 WAT. Plants in substrate 4P had significantly higher growth index than both 1P and 52 substrate treatments with an overall average growth of 1 e-4 m3. Signif icantly higher growth was seen in plants in Fafard 52 substrate, compared to plants grown in 1P, with over double the mean growth of 1P treatment for that week. Between 2 and 3 WAT, a fertilizer and substrate interaction effect was observed . Plants cultiva ted in 4P that received low fertilizer application rates had the greatest PGI 3 WAT with a mean of 5.6 e-3m3 (Figure 2 -2). Plants cultivated in 1P that received low fertilizer rates, along with 1P and 52 non -fertilized plants , had the lowest PGI among all treatment combinations with PGI values of 6.7 e-5m3, 6.1 e-6m3, and 2.4 e-4m3, respectively (Figure 30 2-2). Plants cultivated in 4P substrate had the greatest PGI among all fertilizer treatments; wher eas non-fertilized treatments had lowest growth index . Substrate and fertilizer application rate significantly influenced PGI 4 WAT . Plants that received low fertilizer application rate s had significantly greater PGI. M edium and high -fertilized plants had similar rates of growth at 4 WAT. At termination of the experiment, 5 WAT, a substrate and fertil izer interaction effect was observed (Figure 2 - 3). Plants cultivated in 4P substrate which received a medium fertilizer rate had greatest PGI, with an average of 2.1 e-2 m3. Low-fertilized p lants in both 4P and 52 substrates closely followed the 4P, medium -fertilized plants in growth, though not significantly. Non-fertilized plants grown in 52 and 1P substrates had lowest over all PGI averaging 2.7 e-4 m3 and 9.94 e-6 m3, respectively (Figure 2 -3). Dry Mass Yields A substrate and fertil izer interaction effect was observed for plant dry weight . Plants g rown in Fafard 4P with low, medium and high fertilize r rates had significantly higher dry mass yields than all other treatment combinations (Figure 2 -4). Plants that received low fertilizer application rates cultivated in 4P substrate had the highest dry mass yields with an avera ge of 7.2 g . Following high yields observed in fertilized treatments in 4P substrate , plants cultivated in 52 that received low fertilizer application rates had the fourth largest dry m ass with an average of 5.6 g . Medium and high fertilizer treatments for plants grown in both 1P and 52 substrates all had similar dry weight averages. Similar to PGI trends, n on-fertilized plants had signifi cantly less growth than all other fertilizer rates for all three substrates (Figure 2 -4). Lowest overall plant growth and dry mass yield was seen in 1P non -fertilized treatment combination , with an average of 0.01 g dry mass. 31 Discussion Plant performance during this experiment showed promising results to develop Scutellaria integrifolia as a val uable commercial crop. While germination was slow (about one month from seeding to transplant), vegetative growth was rapid after transplant and fertilizer application, taking only five weeks to reach flowering stage. Plants exhibited poor growth and perfo rmance in the 1P substrate, likely due to its high water holding capacity, as this species is found naturally in dry, sandy soils. Despite this, high fertilizer application rates did help plants cultivated in 1P perform better. The 52 m ix, which possessed the highest porosity among substrate types, saw best results with the low -fertilized treatment for both plant growth and dry mass. Electroconductivity was similar for this treatment as the other two sub strates at this fertilizer rate. These practices could mimic the low -nutrient, high soil porosity environment that this species is commonly found in. The i nteraction effect observed for PGI 2 and 3 WAT is likely due to fertilizer release peaking during that time period as supported by EC data collected at 2 and 4 WAT (Table 2 -2). At 2 WAT , EC was highest for most treatment combinations, with a slight decrease by week 4. The interaction effect of fertilizer and substrate was again detect ed at 5 WAT. Plants that received low and mediu m fertilizer application rates and cultivated in 4P had similar growth and plant mass , with the medium fertilizer rate being significantly higher than other treatment combinations . This suggests that high fertilizer application rates are not necessary for this unique species when cultivated in this substrate or one with similar characteristics. Thus, low fertilizer costs and low chances of nutrient leaching would likely be possible with this unique, native plant species under this commercial production regi me. Plant growth and dry mass yields were extremely low in 32 non-fertilized treatments. Results are consistent with findings from Shiwakoti et al. (2016 ) with Scutellaria lateriflora , a related species of skullcap, where applica tion of nitrogen and phosphorus containing fertilizers increased plant growth and harvested dry mass. Given several Scutellaria spp. are cultivated, sold, and used as medicinal plants, Scutellaria integrifolia needs to be investigated for its medicinal va lue. Moreover, the influence of various commercial cultivation practices should be inclusive in medicinal plant research to help optimize commercial production guidelines. Additionally, comparisons of medicinally active compound concentrations, if present, to those found among in situ populations, should be performed to evaluate impacts of protected culture production. Conclusion Scutellaria integrifolia performed well in a greenhouse production setting, and would likely make a valuable greenhouse crop for native plant growers. Low input production, adaptability to differing substrates, and climatic preference to this region are lucrative assets for growers and landscapers alike. With proliferation of native plant usage by landscape architects, and increase d awareness of the benefits of implementation of native plants, this plant has high probability to be a valuable and widely sought -after ornamental. With establishment of a market for helmet skullcap, future research would be worthwhile to examine its pote ntial as a medicinal plant. Given the history of Scutellaria species to contain health benefits, it is possible that this species could be a future medicinal crop as well. 33 Table 2 -1.

In many Asian countries Scutellaria baicalensis , or Baikal skullcap is prescribed to patients as an anti -inflammatory, antiviral and antithrombotic agent (Shang et al. , 2010) . In the United States, Scutellaria lateriflora, American skullcap, dominates the market as an herbal supplement with anxiolytic properties, and has become a popular alternative to valerian root and kava kava (Awad et al. , 2003) . At least 35 other species of skullcap have been an alyzed for medicinal qualities, but S. baicalensis in Asia and S. lateriflora in the US remain at the forefront of commercial propagation and marketing despite S. lateriflo ra not being evaluated for flavonoid content (Shang et al. , 2010) . Medicinal benefits of Scutellaria spp. are attributed to flavonoids present in vegetative and root tissue , mainly baicalin, baicalein and wogonin. , quality Scutellaria root should contain baicalin concentrations of 9% or greater (Shang et al. , 2010) . In the US , skullcap has not been evaluated by the FDA, and is designated as an herb of \"undefined safety\" (Awad et al. , 2003) . Nonetheless, dried vegetative portions o f skullcap are commonly found on the market as an ingredient in tea, a s a vitamin, and as liquid extract. Scutellaria spp. are sold on a dry -weight basis. Skullcap containing a high concentration of flavonoi ds may demand high market value (Similien et al. , 2016) . In nature, flavonoids are believe d to be produced to protect plant cellular tissue, and have 37 shown to accumulate more when plants experience stress (Kumar and Pandey , 2013) . Understanding evolutionary purpose of flavonoids, can help determine how cultivation pract ices can influence their synthesis in plants. Flavonoids in Scutellaria spp. have been reported to be influenced by water and nutrient availability. Cao et al. (2012) found baicalin concentrations in S. baicalensis negatively correl ated with nitrogen fertilizer application. Similien et al. (2016) also observed negative correlation with baicalin concentration and nutrient applications in S. lateriflora. Similar results for flavonoid accumulation have been o bserved in nutrient deficient tomatoes (Bongue -Bartelsman and Phillips , 2005) . Yuan et al. (2012) observed increased flavonoid concentrations in root and leaf tissue of Scutellaria baicalensis when subject to mild water stress (12% soil water content) as compared to a control that received adequate soil water content of 1 6%. These results are in contrast with findings from Similien et al (2016) , who observed increase in baicalin concentrations in S. lateriflora when irrigation was applied to an open field. When cultivated under 40% shaded conditions, however, field -grown S. lateriflora flavonoid concentrations were not significantly influenced by irrigation applications. Similar relationships between water availability and light intensity on flavonoid concentrations were observed for Ligustrum vulgare , where flavonoids in Ligustrum vulgare increased under sun conditions when sufficiently irrigated (Tattini et al. , 2004) . Results from Tattini et al. (2004) and Similien et al. (2016) , are in favor of the Carbon - Nutrient Balance Hypothe sis (CNB H), which was a widely accepted model explaining variations i n plant secondary metabolite concentrations (Hamilton et al. , 2001) . The hypothesis assumed that when nitrogen was available in the presence of limiting light 38 for photosynthesis to occur, a decrease in carbon -nitrogen ratios wou ld exist and in response increase prod uction of secondary metabolites (Hamilton et al. , 2001) . In both Tattini et al. (2004) and Similien et al. (2016) , baicalin concentrati ons would increase when plants were experiencing high photosynthetic radiation, but would not be influenced when plants were shaded. While the CNB H is now generally disproven due to its over -generalizing of secondary metabolites, some merit of its assumptio ns still exists when looked at on a species -specific and metabolite -specific level. With rising popularity of herbal medicine, further research is warranted for discovery and efficacy of ethnobotanical herbs. This work analyzed two Florida -native species of Scutellaria, which had not previously been researched for medicinal or commercial growth. Both Scutellaria integrifolia and Scutellaria arenicola, two Florida - native species of skullcap, commonly occur in their southern ranges (United States Department of Agriculture, 2017) . Some successful propagation and seed germination trials have been conducted on S. integrifolia at Fort Valley State University, however, limited reporting precludes widespread comm ercial adoption (Joshee et al. , 2002) . S. arenicola commercial cultivation was found at one nursery in Central Florida. Cultivation practices at this facility were iteratively derived. Information on horticultural production is lacking for both species, and reported quan tification of medicin al compounds in both species is minimal, or completely absent . The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of nutrient application and irrigation frequency on growth and secondary metabolite accumulation of two Florida native skull cap species, S. integrifolia and S. arenicola , within a protected greenhouse production environment. Results from this 39 experiment can be used to develop cultivation practices for these n ative and potentially valuable medicinal plant species. Materials a nd Methods Cultivation and Preparation On 6 June 2017, 48 cuttings of Scutellaria integrifolia were taken from a single stock plant, dipped in H ormidin 1 (OHP Inc., Mainland, PA) and transplanted into 4 cm3 rockwool cubes (Grodan, Milton, ON ). Cuttings wer e placed in propagati on chambers under continuous fluorescent lighting (T5; Sunblaster, Langley, BC), kept at 25.5 \u00b0C and above 50% humidity for three weeks until rooted. On 27 June 2017, individual cutting s were transplanted into 2 L containers filled with Fafard 4P soilless substrate (Sun Gro Horticulture Canada, Ltd., Agawam, MA ) and place d on a bench in a greenhouse. Forty - eight cuttings of Scutellaria arenicola were taken on 5 July 2017 and were subject to the same propagation methods previously descri bed for S. integrifolia . Due to poor rooting of this species , only 32 cuttings of S. arenicola were transplanted on 28 July 2017. Fertilization Treatment One week after transplant (WAT) on 5 July 2017, Osmocote 15 -9-12 slow release fertilizer (Everris NA Inc., Dublin, OH) was applied to S. integrifolia replicates (n=12) one of four rates : 0 g (none) , 3.8 g (low) , 9.2 g (medium) , or 13.8 g (high) . Fertilizer application rate was selected based upon manufacturer's recommendations. Upon transplant into 2 L c ontainers, each plant received 112.5 mL of water daily using a pressure -compensating drip irrigation emitter ( Woodpecker Pressure Compensating drippers, Netafim, Fresno, CA) . This t reatment was repeated for S. arenicola on 3 August 2017, with 8 replicates per treatment, due to poor propagation success. 40 Water Frequency Treatment Three wee ks after transplant on 17 July 2017, six replicates of each fertilization treatment for Scutellaria integrifolia were chosen at random, removed from drip irrigation and pla ced on a separ ate greenhouse bench. V olumetric water content (VWC) was recorded every 60 minutes from one replicate of each fertilizer treatment using soil moisture sensors ( Em50, Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA ). Devices were set to the manufacturers calibra tion for soilless substrate and verified to read correctly through laboratory gravimetric water content determination. No irrigation would be applied until wilting began to appear, or VWC dropped below perm anent wilting point, as determined through soil mo isture release curves developed for the soilless substrate types. Due to poor rooting and growth of S. arenicola plants, irrig ation treatments were applied 4 WAT on 21 August 2017, and thus only implemented for one week before termination of the experimen t (5 WAT) . Four replicates of each fertilizer treatment were randomly chosen, removed from drip irrigation and placed on a separate bench to initiate a water stress treatment using the methods previously described for S. integrifolia . Measurements and Dat a Collection Beginning 1 (WAT), plant growth indices (PGI; height x width1 x width2) were recorded weekly and continued until termination of the experiment 5 WAT. Substrate pH and e lectroco nductivity (EC) were measured weekly using an EC Probe (Field Scou t EC 110, Spectrum Technologies, Aurora, IL) and an Oakton PC 2700 pH meter (Cole - Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL). This method was utilized for both S. integrifolia and S. arenicola . 41 Scutellaria integrifolia plants were terminated 2 August 2017 (5 WAT) when plants began flowering. Plants were destructively harvested by cutting the plant 2.5 cm above the crown and weighed using a laboratory balance (Adventurer Analytical; Ohaus, Parsippany, NJ). Plants were then dried at room temperature until 70% moisture was lost and dry mass yield (DMY) was recorded. Dried plant material from the same treatment group were combined and vacuum sealed for storage until ready for flavonoid analysis using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Scutellar ia arenicola plants were also grown for five weeks and dest ructively harvested on 1 September, 2017. No replica tes reached re productive stage. Plant DMY was recorded and all replicates of each treatment were combined, and vacuum sealed for storage until HP LC analysis. Preparation of Leaf and Stem Extracts Aliquots were prepared by randomly selecting a 0.1 g sample from the previously vacuum -sealed containers. Samples were placed in a test tube (13 x 100mm Beaded Rim, Pyrex, Corning, NY ) and chemical extra ction performed using a prepared 0.005% acetic acid in a methanol:water extraction solution (80:20) . Two mL of extraction solution was added to each test tube and homogenized (Homogenizer 850, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA ) at 21 ,000 rpm for a duration of 1 min. E xtracts were placed into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube (1.5 mL Graduated Natural, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA ) and then centrifuged (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5418, Hauppauge, NY) at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. Samples were then filtere d through a 0.2 \u00b5m filter (25mm Nylon Syringe Filter, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) and placed in 2 mL HPLC ready vials(Clear Glass Sure Stop Vial, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA ). Four extracts of each treatment combination for S. integrifolia were 42 prepared and used for analysis . Due to poor growth and lack of dried plant material, only two samples of each treatment combination were prepared for S. arenicola . HPLC Analysis Baicalin concentration analysis was performed using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC (Thermo Fishe r Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) with a C18 3 \u00b5m 3 x 150mm column (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. , Waltham , MA). Analysis was derived by th e method described by Li et al . (2015) for both S. integ rifolia and S. arenicola , with minor modifications to account for HPLC volume. Mobile phase solutions included 0.01% phosphoric acid aqueous solution (A) and acetonitrile (B) , both of HPLC grade ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). The gradient el ution was as follows: 0 -3.5 6 min, 60 -40% B, 7 -10 min, 40 -27% and returned to initial condit ions within the following 2 min for a total of 12 min runtime per sample (Li, 2015) . Column t empera ture was maintained at 30\u00b0C throughout the analysis; scan wavelength ranged from 220 -400 nm; flow rate was set at 0.8 mL/min; injection volume was set to 1 \u00b5L. The wavelength for baicalin absorption, as determined by Li et al. (2015), was 278 n m. Peak detection occurred 1.89 min after sample injection (Figure 3 - 11), rather than between 6.99 and 7.83 min, as reported by Li et al. (2015) due to variations in analytical equipment volume and sample flow rate. Peak detection was set at \u00b10.4 min of the 1.89 min peak to capture the complete detection of baicalin. Results were analyzed based on grams of baicalin present in 1 g of dry plant material. Standard Calibration Baicalin standa rd was purchased from Indofine Chemical Company (Hillsborough, NJ). Solid baicalin standard was dissolved in 100% methanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.; Waltham, MA) at a rate of 250 \u00b5g/ mL. Standard calibration was 43 achieved by doing serial injection volu mes at rates of 1, 5, 10 and 15 \u00b5L and resulted in a calibration correlation of r2=0.99 (Figure 3 -12). Statistical Analysis The experiment was arranged as a complete randomized design with irrigation and fertilizer application rate assigned as independent variables . Six replicates were cultivated for each treatment combination for a total of 48 experimental units for S. integrifolia. Four replicates were cultivated for each treatment combination for S. arenicola . Statistical an alysis of PGI, flavonoid concentration and dry mass data was analyzed using mixed model ana lysis by WAT with variance within treatment combination replicates defined as the random error term. Statistical tests were considered significant if P 0.05 . Results Mean daily greenhouse temperature r anged from 24.0 to 33.6 C throughout the duration of the experiment. Mean r elative humidity was 79.8% and p hotosynthetic active radiation varied from 59.64 to 311.6 \u00b5mol/m2s. Three weeks after transplan t, 17 July 2017, 6 replicates of each fertilizer treatment of S. integrifolia were removed from drip irrigation, and placed on a separate bench for the remainder of the experiment. Plants subjected to the water deficit treatment had a range of 1%- 18.5% VW C, with a mean of 9.9% (Figure 3 -1). Plants that receive d daily irrigation (112.5 mL water per day) ranged from 21.7% -67.4% VWC throughout the experiment, with an overall average of 56.2% VWC for all irrigated treatments (Figure 3 -2). At 4 WAT, 22 August 2017, four rep licates of each fertilizer treatment of S. arenicola were removed from drip irrigation, and placed on a separate bench for the 44 remainder of the experiment. Plants subjected to the wate r deficit treatment had a VWC range from 22.8% -42.9%, with a mean of 29.3% (Figure 3 -3). Plants that received the daily irrigation treatment (112.5 mL per day) ranged from 52.2% -70.9% VWC, with an average of 62% V WC (Figure 3 -4). Plant Growth Index Scutellaria integrifolia growth was quadratic throughout the experiment (Figure 3 - 5). No significant effects were observed among fertilizer or irrigation treatments between 1 and 4 WAT. Plant g rowth was minimal between 1 -2 WAT; however, beginning 3 WAT, growth was observed to become quadratic . Plants subject ed to the medium fertilizer application rate treatment show ed higher mean growth than other fertilizer treatments, though not statistically significant . At termination of the experiment, 5 WAT, an irriga tion effect was observed (Figure 3 -6). Overall , PGI was greater for plants that remained irrigated daily throughout the experiment. Plan ts that received medium -fertilizer application rates and remained irrigated had highest PGI among treatment combinations at termination of the ex periment, with an average of 8.1 e-3 m3. This was closely followed by low -fertilized plants which remained irrigated. All non-irrigated plants had similar PGI means by 5 WAT . Due to poor gr owth of Scutellaria arenicola , PGI shows no prominent pattern (Figure 3 -7). One week after transplant, a fertilizer effect was recorded; however, results were inconclusive, given f ertilizer application occurred d uring the same week (Figure 3 - 8). No signif icant difference in PGI was observed throughout the duration of the experiment. Plants that received the high fert ilizer rates, reg ardless of irrigation treatment, had the highest PGI at termination of the experiment, with an overall mean of 4.1 e-5 m3. Non -fertilized plants that received either irrigation treatments had the lowest 45 overall PGI, with the non -fertilized, wa ter deficit t reatment having a mean PGI of 2.0 e-5 m3 (Figure 3 -8). Plant Dry Mass No significant differences among treatment combinations were observed for Scutellaria integrifolia dry mass (Figure 3 -9). Plants that received high fertilizer application rates and received daily irrigation had highest DMY (1.3 g) , followed by plants that received high fertilizer application rates and subjected to water stress (1.1 g). Both irrigated and water stressed plants that received no fertilizer had the lowest plant dry mass among treatment combinations, wi th non -fertilized, water stressed plants averaging 0.7 g. Similar to results observed for S. integrifolia , no significant differences among treatment combinations were obs erved in Scutellaria arenicola DMY (Figure 3 -10). Plants that received high fertilizer application rates and daily irrigation had the highes t DMY (0.11 g) , followed by plants that received high fertilizer application rates and subjected to water stress (0.10 g). Both irrigated and water -stressed plant treatments that received no fertilizer had the lowest DMY with a mean of 0.9 g. Flavonoid Accumulation Baicalin concentrations in Scutellaria integrifolia were influenced by fert ilizer application rate (Table 3 -2). Plants that received a medium fertilizer application rate had a significantly higher baicalin concentration with a mean of 2.7 mg baicalin per g plant material, or approximately 4.0 mg baical in per plant based on mean DMY. Plants that received a low fertilizer application rate had the second highest baicalin concentration s with a mean of 1.8 mg per gram plant material, for a total of 1.8 mg baicalin per plant, based on mean DMY. Plants that re ceived either no fertilizer or a high fertilizer 46 application rate had significantly lower baicalin concentrations with means of 1.2 mg and 0.8 mg baicalin per g plant material, respectively. Water stress did not significantly influence baicalin concentrati on. While baicalin was detected in Scutellaria arenicola , imposed treatments had no effect on baicalin concentration. Plants that received a high fertilizer application rate and subjected to water stress had the highest baicalin concentration with a mean o f 5.8 mg per 1 g of plant material. Lowest baicalin concentrations among treatment combinations were observed for plants that received daily irrigation and high fertilizer application rates with a mean of 2.9 mg baicalin per g plant material. Field harvest ed S. integrifolia and S. arenicola had mean baicalin concentrations of 2.9 and 4.9 mg per 1 g of plant material. Commercially purchased dried plant material of Scutellaria lateriflora , a popular Scutellaria species marketed as an anti -anxiety agent in tea s, was found to have a mean of 0. 5 mg of baicalin per 1 g of plant material. Both species, S. integrifolia and S. arenicola , had overall higher baicalin concentrations than those found in commercially purchased S. lateriflora . Discussion This experiment lo oked at two species of skullcap that had not previously been examined for potential as a commercially produced medicinal crops. Plant growth of Scutellaria integrifolia which was previously reported in chapter 2, showed promising commercial crop qualities . Moreover, it possesses high market value potential due to its native plant status. Highest growth was seen in plants that received medium fertilizer application rates, and were irrigated daily. This effect carried over to flavonoid accumulation, as S. int egrifolia plants that received medium -fertilizer, regardle ss of irrigation regime , had significantly greater baicalin concentrations than all other 47 treatment combinations for this species. These results contradict findings of Shiwakoti et al. (2016) and Similien et al. (2016) , who found that addition of nitrogen fertilizers decreased baicalin concentrations in Scutellaria lateriflora , a related species of skullcap. Baicalin concentrations in the green house -produ ced plants were comparable to wild harvested plant samples (Table 3 -2). Though not significant, it is noteworthy that no n- fertilized and high -fertilized plants possessed the lowest baicalin concentrations. Results fav or the assumptions of the CNBH (Hamilton et al. , 2001) . While the theory has been challenged for being overly generalized, its underlying assumptions can and should be applied to species -spec ific scenarios. The CNB H assumes carbon and nitrogen will be allocated foremost for plant growth and secondarily for production of secondary compounds (Hamilton et al. , 2001) . Application of this hypothesis supports the observation that non -fertilized plants, which possessed low concentrations of baicalin, allocated all available resources for growth and did not possess significant quantities of carbon and nitrogen for secondary metabolite production. Plants that received both low a nd medium fertilizer application rates possessed enough carbon and nitrogen to support both primary and secondary metabolic pathways, and thus had the highest growth and baicalin concentrations. Although plants that received high fertilizer application rat es would also have sufficient nitrogen and carbon present, they had less growth and synthesized less baicalin than plants that received either low or medium fertilizer application rates. Results were likely caused by excessive soil fertility that was detrimental to growth given the evolutionary adaptation of this plant species to thrive in sandy, nutrient deficient soils. 48 Scutellaria arenicola respond ed poorly to clonal propagation, which further limited replicate numbers and gr owth throu ghout the experime nt (Figure 3 -7). Unlike integrifolia , which possessed logarithmic growth throughout the five-week study, S. arenicola had a flat, linear growth curve response. Despite poor growth , baicalin was detected in all treatment comb inations of this species, for which no prior reporting has occurred. S. arenicola had overall greater baicalin concentrations than those found in S. integrifolia , though species were not compared statistically due to limited sample number s. Baicalin concent rations found in propagated plants were similar to those found in wild harvested plants. High baicalin concentrations in this species were expected given the prominent red -purple foliage it possessed and the relationship between this visual quality and flavonoid concentrations as described by Winkel (2002) . According to the Chinese Pharmacopoei a, baicalin must be present in concentrations 9% of plant roots for Scutellaria baicalensis to be c onsidered of medicinal quality (Shang et al. , 2010) . The roots of Scutellaria baicalensis are the only medically regulated portion of the genus , and only in Asia n countries which regularly prescribe it. The FDA has no set regulations for Scutellaria species, and only Scutellaria lateriflora is found on the market as an herbal product in the United States. Baicalin concentrations in commercially purchased S. lateri flora were lower than 9%, with only 0.05% baicalin per one gram of plant material. Results from our experiments with S. integrifolia and S. arenicola found baicalin in higher concentrations than those observed in commercially purchased skullcap. Results su pport that with proper cultivation, both S. integrifolia and S. arenicola may make valuable , commercial ly-produced medicinal plant crops. 49 Conclusion Development of species -specific horticultural regimes for medicinal plants is the first step to ensure qual ity and consistency when considering commercial production of Scutellaria spp. Scutellaria integrifolia exhibited fast growth , reaching reproductive stage by five weeks, and responded well to traditional clonal propagation techniques . Medium fertilizer application rate, and daily irrigation regimes produced the highest visual quality, and greatest flavonoid concentrations. While S. arenicola did not perform well, further examination of plant growth at shorter day lengths, and different propagation technique s should be examined, as this species exhibited nearly two -fold higher concentrations of baicalin than both S. integrifolia and commercially purchased S. lateriflora. 50 Table 3 -1.

A thorough understanding of how production practices affect both is necessary when evaluating the commercial production potential of medicinal plant species. Development of spec ies-specific cultivation regimes f or medicinal plants is critical to ensure quality control and consistency of desired medicinal compounds. This is especially important for discovery of new ethnobotanical plants, or plants that have not previously been tes ted for their medicinal qualities. Two species of Scutellaria, S. integrifolia and S. arenicola , both native to the southeastern US, were analyzed under varying cultivation conditions, for plant growth and flavonoid accumulation. Limited information was a vailable on cultivation practices or flavonoid presence within these two species . Baicalin, a flavonoid present in Scutellaria spp., is considered the main attri bute for medicinal qualities associated with this genus. Both S. integrifolia and S. arenicola were tested for presence and concentrations of baicalin. Seventy -Two Scutellaria integrifolia plants were transplanted into one of three commercially available soilless substrates and provided one of four fertilizer application rates. Plants were placed wi thin an enclosed greenhouse and evaluated for growth until plants matured and flowered. Dry mass yields (DMY) and p lant growth indices (height x width1 x width2) indicated that Scutellaria integrifolia performed best in a medium - drained soilless substrate which contained appro ximately 30% (Fafard 4P; Sun Gro Horticulture Canada, Ltd., Agawam, MA). By termination of the experiment, plants grown in the medium -drained substrate, that received medium fertilizer ap plication rates, had highest mean PGI of 2.1 e-2 m3. Overall DMY, plants which were grown in the medium -drained substrate, and received either low, medium, or high fertilizer application rates, had greatest DMY with means of 7.2 g, 6.6 g, and 6.6 g, respec tively. Flexibility in fertilizer application rate demonstrates potential for Scutellaria integrifolia to be produced as a low -cost, native crop. Soilless substrate with a high water holding capacity should be avoided as plants cultivated in a high peat (~ 80%) substrate exhibited poor growth and DMY. Success ful greenhouse cultivation of S. integrifolia supported additional research on the influence of cultivation practices on growth and medicinal compound concentrations of S. integrifolia and S. arenicola . Both specie s were clonally propagated, planted in medium -drained soilless substrate, and provided various nutrient application rates and irrigation treatments. Differences in PGI were not observed for any treatment combination for S. integrifolia for the first 4 weeks of growth, but by five weeks, at termination of the experiment, a n irrigation effect was observed with plants that received daily irrigation having higher PGI than water -stressed pl ants. This species also performed best with medi um-fertilizer application rates , though not significantly. S. arenicola , which exhibited poor propagation an d growth, had no differences in PGI throughout the 5-week growth period. Neither species had significant differences in DMY among treatments. Baicalin was detec ted in both S. integrifolia and S. arenicola. The only statistically significant results were observed in S. integrifolia that received medium 59 fertilizer application rates . These plants had a mean of 2.7 m g baicalin per g plant material, or total yield of 4.0 mg baicalin, based upon mean DMY. For S. arenicola , imposed treatments had no e ffect on baicalin concentration. Plants that received a high fertilizer application rate subjected to water stress had the highest baicalin concentration with a mean of 5.8 mg per g of plant material. Although marketed for its medicinal value, commercially available S. lateriflora , possessed much lower baicalin than that observed in S. integrifolia and S. arenicola in our study. While bai calin concentrations were relatively low in our Florida native species, further research may help increase concentrations. Horticultural practices, such as light intensity, heat, and propagation method, may significantly influence baicalin synthesis. While growth was minimal in S. arenicola , further research with this species should continue as baicalin concentrations were nearly 1.5 times greater than those seen in S. integrifolia . Results presented here provide the first empirical evidence of baicalin in S. arenicola , and add to limited te sting of baicalin in S. integrifolia . Moreover, results help provide commercial plant producers with knowledge concerning how these unique plants respond to various production procedures. With rising popularity of utilizing native plants in landscapes, and the realization of the threats native species face due to their limited natural ranges, additional research on native species production is warranted . In addition to their ornamental value, Scutellaria integrifolia and Scutellaria arenicola may have signi ficant commercial potential due to the synthesis of valuable medicinal compounds. 60 LIST OF REFERENCES Awad, R., Arnason, J.
