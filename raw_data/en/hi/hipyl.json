Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is an important medicinal herb in Ayurveda, believed to have anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory properties. Previous trials suggest it could help to relieve stress, anxiety and fatigue, and to improve sleep and physical performance. In this trial we are trying to see if Ashwagandha can improve functional status, quality of life and symptoms in adults suffering from Long COVID in the UK. The trial is currently taking place across participating GP sites in the UK. Over the next year, we plan to recruit ~2500 adults (aged 18 and over) living in the UK who have been diagnosed with long COVID (as per the NHS Guidelines) by their doctor, and who find that this condition is affecting their ability to carry out their day-to-day activities. To enter the trial, individuals must be contacted by a participating GP site. This is a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Interested individuals who have a diagnosis of Long COVID (and conform to all other eligibility criteria) will be randomly allocated to take the traditional Indian herb, or placebo for 3 months (delivered at home by post). During this period, they will complete monthly questionnaires online (or by post), and monthly check-ins with their study doctor's team. Neither the participant, nor the researchers, will know who is taking the herb or the placebo tablets, to avoid bias in the study results. The APRIL trial team consists of global experts in clinical trials research and Ayurvedic medicine, from the UK and India. Rationale COVID-19 continues to take its toll on health in the UK and globally. There are concerns around the disease's long-term sequelae often referred to as \"long COVID\", with symptoms including respiratory problems (chronic cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness), cognitive dysfunction, poor mental health, extreme fatigue and muscle weakness. Symptoms can last for 1-3 months (called \"ongoing symptomatic COVID-19\"), or longer in many cases (called \"post-COVID-19 syndrome\"), and are estimated to affect around 20% of COVID-19 survivors. Long COVID is understood to be a multi-system disease, similar to some other post-viral syndromes, although its pathophysiology is still poorly understood, and there is little evidence around its effective treatment or management. 'Ashwagandha' (Withania somnifera), a traditional herb in the Indian Ayurvedic system of medicine, has been used for centuries for promoting energy and vitality, reducing stress and boosting the immune system. Recently, a number of randomised placebo-controlled trials in humans have demonstrated its efficacy for reducing anxiety and stress, improving muscle strength and VO2 max, enhancing sleep quality and cognition, and reducing symptoms of fatigue in patients treated for chronic conditions. This evidence, combined with emerging literature on its pharmacological and immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in animals, suggest Ashwagandha as a potential therapeutic candidate for alleviating the long-term symptoms of COVID-19. Aim The aim of this study is to determine whether Ashwagandha can improve functional status, quality of life and symptoms in UK adults suffering from long-term symptoms of COVID-19. Objectives Primary - to determine the effectiveness of Ashwagandha tablets (3-month course) for improving functional status (measured by the Post-COVID-19 Functional Status Scale) among people experiencing ongoing symptoms of COVID-19. Secondary - to determine the effectiveness of Ashwagandha tablets (3-month course) for improving quality of life, reported fatigue, breathlessness, pain, sleep quality, mental health, cognitive function, work status and other symptoms. Who can take part Adults (18 years or older) who have a current diagnosis of Long COVID, defined as per NICE guideline on Long COVID (NG188), meet the other clinical screening criteria (i.e., without severe psychiatric disorder, liver test abnormalities or active malignancy, not pregnant, etc), and who are willing and able to complete the study protocols (take trial medication daily for 3 months and complete monthly clinical monitoring and online or postal questionnaires). Trial design This is a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Interested individuals who have a diagnosis of Long COVID (and conform to all other eligibility criteria) will be randomised to take Ashwagandha or placebo for 3 months (delivered at home by post). Follow-up for functional status, quality of life and other self-reported outcomes will be by online or postal surveys (as per participant preference) conducted monthly. Follow-up for safety will be through clinical assessment by the study investigator's clinical team, conducted monthly. View our [recruitment pathway flowchart](/media/64476). Ayurveda, a natural system of medicine, originated in India over 5,000 years ago. The term Ayurveda is derived from the Sanskrit words ayur (life) and veda (science or knowledge). Thus, Ayurveda means knowledge of life. It is a holistic science considering the individual as a whole and seeks to re-establish harmony between all three the Mind, Body and Soul. It has two main principles; 1) prolong life and promote perfect health (by following diet and lifestyle practices including yoga and meditation to increase longevity with good physical and mental health) and 2) to eradicate the disease and dysfunction of the body. Thus, Ayurveda is a Health promotive, preventive, curative and nutritive science. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), also known as Indian ginseng or winter cherry, is an evergreen shrub that grows in India, the Middle East, and parts of Africa. Roots of ashwagandha are used for medicinal purposes in Ayurveda. Ashwagandha is believed to be an 'adaptogen' which means it helps the body respond to stress as well as promoting overall strength and wellbeing. Its pharmacological mechanisms of action are thought to be related to the anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory effects of certain metabolites found exclusively in this plant. In this trial we are trying to see if Ashwagandha can improve functional status, quality of life and alleviate symptoms in UK adults suffering from long-term symptoms of COVID-19.
