With 60% of the neurological growth happening in children within the first year of life, it is very important to have your child checked for subluxations shortly after they are born and periodically throughout their lives. As children are learning to crawl, walk, talk, run and play there are very specific neurological milestones that are necessary to ensure the healthy growth of your children, and keeping the neurological system free from interference ensures that all of the neurological milestones can be met as children grow during their first year and beyond. Chiropractic care and maintaining a strong neurological system. A study published in the Chiropractic Research Journal, compared the health and wellness of 200 children under chiropractic care and 200 children under conventional medical care. The Chiropractic group had fewer ear infections, fewer allergies, fewer causes of tonsillitis and asthma. The health of the children under Chiropractic care was demonstrably superior to the children who had not received chiropractic care.(1) Remember, children are bombarded with stresses on a daily basis and those stressors have a huge impact on how their nervous system is functioning. These stresses can cause dysfunction, and this dysfunction is called nerve interference. We as chiropractors are trained in locating, analyzing and correcting vertebral subluxations which cause nerve interference and dysfunction. When subluxations are removed the interference goes away and this allows the God-given Innate Intelligence to continually renew and heal the body. There is no reason our children should not THRIVE.
