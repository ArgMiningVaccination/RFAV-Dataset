While some scientific evidence exists regarding some CAM therapi es, for most there are key questions that are yet to be answered through well -designed scientific studies -questions such as whether these therapies are safe and whether they work for the diseases or medical conditions for which they are used. Complementar y medicine is used together with conventional medicine. Complementary medicine proposes to add to a proven medical treatment. Alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine. Alternative means the proposed method would possibly replace an a lready proven and accepted medical intervention. NCCIM classifies CAM therapies into 5 categories or domains: Whole Medical Systems . These alternative medical systems are built upon complete systems of theory and practice. These systems have evolved apart from, and earlier than, the conventional medical approach used in the U.S. Examples include: homeopathic and naturopathic medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine , Ayurveda Macrobiotics, Naprapathy and Polarity Therapy. Mind -Body Medicine . Mind -body interventions use a variety of techniques designed to enhance the mind's capacity to affect bodily functions and symptoms. Some techniques have become part of mainstream practice, such as patient support groups and cognitive -behavioral therapy. Other mind - body techniques are still considered CAM, including meditation, prayer, mental healing, hypnosis, and therapies that use creative outlets such as art, music, or dance. Biologically Based Practices . These therapies use substances found in nature , such as herbs, foods, and vitamins. Some examples include dietary supplements, herbal products, special dietary approaches and diets, and the use of other \"natural\" but as yet scientifically unproven therapies (e.g., use of bovine or shark cartilage to t reat cancer). Examples include: auto urine therapy, cellular therapy, Coley's Toxin, immunoaugmentive therapy, Kelly -Gonzales Therapy, Laetrile , Ozone therapy Manipulative and Body -Based Practices . These CAM methods are based on manipulation and/or movemen t of one or more parts of the body, such as chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation and massage. Examples include: colonic irrigation or lavage, therapy, ear reflexology and rolfing. Energy Therapies . Biofield therapies are intended to affect energy fields that purportedly surround and penetrate the human body. The existence of such fields has not yet been scientifically proven. Some forms of energy therapy manipulate biofields by applying pr essure and/or manipulating the body by placing the hands in, or through, these fields. Examples include acupressure, Qi Gong , Reiki , and Therapeutic Touch . Bioelectromagnetic -based therapies involve the unconventional use of electromagnetic fields , such as pulsed fields, magnetic fields, or alternating - or direct -current fields.

Chemical Hair Analysis : Chemical hair analysis is a test in which a person's hair is analyzed for mineral content. Hair analysis has been proposed to aid in the evaluation of a person's general state of health, mental and physical conditions (e.g. autism, cancer, hypert ension, myocardial infarction, kidney disease, osteoarthritis and diabetes mellitus), skin diseases (e.g., alopecia), detect heavy metals (e.g., lead, mercury, arsenic) and pesticides, identify nutritional/mineral deficiencies, analyze deoxyribonucleic aci d (DNA), identify the presence of illegal drugs (e.g., cocaine, marijuana) Greek Cancer Cure : Greek cancer cure also known as METBAL\u00ae , Cellbal\u00ae , and Alivizatos, consists of a blood test that allegedly diagnoses the location and extent of cancer in a per son's body. Following diagnosis, treatment consists of intravenous injections of a serum containing sugars, vitamins, amino acids, and other factors. Available scientific evidence does not support claims that the Greek Cancer Cure is effective in preventin g, detecting, or treating cancer. Iridology : Iridology sometimes referred to as iris diagnosis, is based on the belief that each area of the body is represented by a corresponding area in the iris of the eye. According to their guidelines on allergy diag nostic testing, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology and the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology stated there is \"no evidence of diagnostic validity\" of iridology (Bernstein, et al., 2008). Live Blood Cell Analysis: Live blood cell analysis by dark field microscopy is an unproven means to study the \"biologic terrain\" and offer practical, nutritional, herbal, lifestyle solutions for various medical conditions. It involves taking a drop of blood and viewing it under a micros cope using a dark field condenser, allowing the viewer to see all components of the blood and tiny particles to enable early detection of disease. There is insufficient evidence to support the accuracy and clinical utility of live blood cell analysis. Ream's Testing: Ream's Testing is promoted as a noninvasive investigation of the body's overall metabolic function, utilizing urine and saliva samples. An individual's pancreatic function, blood sugar control, pH levels, digestive function, liver function, hy dration status, mineral status, kidney and adrenal function, and systemic inflammation are reviewed with recommendations made for diet, specific pH and supplementation of other nutrients. It is used by proponents to monitor progress with various treatment regimes. There is insufficient evidence to support the accuracy and clinical utility of Ream's testing. Telomere Testing : Telomeres are sections of DNA at the end of each chromosome that serve as a cap to the genetic material. Their purpose is critical to the life of the cell in that they serve as protective buffers that keep the ends of the chromosomes from becoming attached to each other or rearranging. If cells divided without telomeres, they would lose the necessary information at the end of each chrom osome. In this way, telomeres prevent chromosomal fraying. Every time a cell replicates, its telomere will become shorter, eventually causing cell death once the telomere attrition has reached a critical length. It is estimated that human telomeres lose ab out 100 base pairs from their telomeric DNA during each mitosis (cell division). At this rate, after approximately 125 mitotic divisions, the telomeres would be completely gone, which is why normal cells will eventually die after healthy division. Shorter telomeres imply a shorter life span for a cell, essentially giving it a finite lifespan, depending on the number of cell divisions left within each telomere. Cells can maintain the length of their telomeres with an enzyme called telomerase, which adds gene tic material at the end of the DNA strand, thus lengthening the number of times it can replicate, which ultimately prolongs the life of the cell. It is not active in most cells, but is active in stem cells, germ cells, hair follicles and most cancer cells. Telomere length is determined using a ratio of the genetic material contained in a nucleated white blood cell telomere relative to the length of a single copy gene of known size to calculate an approximate telomere score. This ratio is then compared to a population of people with similar chronological age.

Policy Guidelines The list of what is considered to be complementary and alternative medicine changes continually. These treatments and practices have not gained wide acceptance in the traditional medical community Page 4 of 6 An Independent Licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association Complementary and Alternative Medicine and are not considered standard medical treatment. Therapies are commonly initiated for non -specific symptoms like fatigue, diarrhea, bloating, difficulty concen trating and similar vague symptoms, or for non-traditional diagnoses such as Intestinal Dysbiosis, Chronic Yeast Syndrome, Neurotransmitter Imbalance, and Adrenal Fatigue, which are not common ly accepted by traditional medi cine. These diagnoses are often \"established\" through extensive laboratory testing, performed by labs specializing in lab profiles for these \"diseases\". Therapeutic progress is often monitored by repeating the lab testing on a regular basis, with adjustments made to the therapies based o n these results. These lab tests, diagnoses and CAM therapies are not based on scientific literature published in traditional medical peer reviewed publications. They derive from a variety of sources: ethnic and fo lk traditions, established reli gions or semi -religious cults, philosophies or metaphysical movements, and health -and-wellness groups. Unproven services and/or medications are, by definition, those that are not consistent with prevailing medical research that has determined the services and/or medications to not be effective for treatment of the condition and/or not to have the beneficial effect on behavioral health outcomes due to insufficient and inadequate clinical evidence from well -conducted randomized controlled trials or cohort studies in the prevailing published peer -reviewed literature. The efficacy of various alternative medicine regimens is generally unproven, and some alternative therapies have been shown to be ineffective or even harmful. The published peer -reviewed literature does not support the safety and efficacy of CAM. Billing /Coding/Physician Documentation Informatio n This policy may apply to the following codes.
