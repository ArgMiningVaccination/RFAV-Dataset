Mexico (UNM) currently owns 100% of membership interest in UNM Sandoval Regional Medical Center, Inc. (SRMC) which is a University Research Park and Economic Development Act corporation. SRMC operates under its own license, its own provider numbers, medical staff, employees, and a degree of local variability relative to the broader University of New Mexico Health System (UNMHS). A degree of integration is already in place across the health system for areas such as information technology, revenue cycle, payer contracting, supply chain, and some other support services.Current State SRMC and UNMHS are planning a transaction to combine SRMC and University of New Mexico Hospital (UNMH) to create a fully integrated, multi -campus hospital under the UNMH license. This transaction maintains certain aspects of SRMC's current operations; however, it also requires changes to operations. In order to create a multi -campus hospital, at close of transaction SRMC need to meet all requirements related to becoming a provider -based location of UNMH under CMS rules. The proposed transaction will transfer all assets and liabilities of SRMC to UNM on behalf of UNMH and upon completion of the transaction the SRMC corporate entity will be dissolved.Proposed Transaction SRMC and UNMH expect positive operational and financial effects from the transaction, including: Expanded teaching and training opportunities at SRMC and potential research opportunities Improved standardization, flexibility, and continuity of care for patients by streamlining access to tertiary and quaternary services available at UNMH and through the creation of a single medical staff Financial benefits include additional revenue generation at SRMC and potential access to state appropriations as a UNMH opera tionExpected Benefits 52/131Operational Impact The transaction brings benefits across the tripartite mission Aligning SRMC and UNMH to create a multi -campus hospital further facilitates existing relationships in care delivery while expanding academic expertise in SRMC's community environment. Benefits include: Seamless transitions of care Expanded access to resources at UNMH for SRMC patients Standardization of policies, procedures, and care between campusesClinical Care By creating a single academic hospital with two campuses teaching and training opportunities at SRMC increase, providing academic -level care to SRMC's community. Benefits include: Providing ready access to a community hospital -like training environment for residents Opportunity to create focused training programs for high -demand services at SRMCTeaching Alongside expansion of teaching opportunities, a combined multi - campus hospital can leverage UNMH's existing combined EHR data and access to SRMC's patient population to pursue additional research opportunities. UNMH can bring: Experience in developing research protocols Administrative expertise to support the research mission at the SRMC campusResearch 53/131SRMC and UNMH Finance teams performed an analysis of financial impacts expected to result from the transaction to create a multi -campus hospital through a combination of UNMH and SRMC. The resulting net annual benefit to SRMC is anticipated to be $6,798,399 annually. Given the high levels of integration present between SRMC and UNMH, the outlined projected financial impacts are expected to be achieved within the first year. Current ongoing processes related to financial forecasts and regular updates expected to continue as currently laid out. Note: Potential one -time costs are not included in the analysis and remain under development; these are expected to be borne largely by UNMH.

Administrative Reports 116/131 Douglas Ziedonis, MD, MPH Executive Vice President, Health Sciences CEO, UNM Health System UNM Hospital Board of Trustees Report April 28, 2023 Good morning, Board of Trustees members and CEO Becker. Thanks for your ongoing support and feedback. CEO Becker and Drs. McLaughlin , Chicarelli and Boyd will provide important details in their administrative reports ; however, I have provided a written report for your readings and have selected a few key items related to UNM Health and Health Sciences to provide to you now. UNM Health & Health Sciences Strategic Planning Process - We appreciate the great input that so many have provided in our Strategic Planning process, including this group of Board of Trustee's for UNMH, through the online survey and IdeaScale crowd sourcing, focus group interviews, and your serving on Work Groups / focused interviews. Throughout the process, we remained anchored and aligned with UNM 2040. I am grateful for the thousands of faculty, staff, clinicians, learners , stu dents, and community leaders and public who contributed to our Strategic Planning through many different methods. Providing many opportunities to hear everyone who wanted to share their thoughts and reflections has been very important and critical as we map out how to achieve our ambitious goals. Of note, in the past month I've been able to participate in two meetings with the Secretary for the NM Department of Health, Patrick Allen, other DOH leaders, and health system leaders in the State Health Improvement Plan (SHIP) process and prioritization. The priorities of the Governor, Secretary, and the SHIP are aligned, including the SHIP focus on Access to Care, Behavioral Health, and Social Health (social determinants of health and a public health to clinical health perspective). Our UNM Health and Health Science seven Strategic Priority focus areas are (all equally important) : 1. Elevate Behavioral Health: Address Mental Health and Substance Misuse 2. Enhance Access: Quality and Safety of Clinical Care 3. Enhance Health Equity, including for Rural, Hispanic, Native American, and other Underserved Groups 4. Prioritize Workforce Development, Recruitment, Retention 5. Expand Impact Through Research . 6. Advance New Mexico's Economic Development in Biosciences and Health Care Services and Technology 7. Enrich the Student Experience, Educational Innovation, and Outcomes Our seven key Enablers contribute to support all the seven Strategic Priorities and represent the key drivers necessary for success: 1. One University 117/131 2. Leadership and Organizational Structure 3. Communications & Messaging 4. Technology, including Project ECHO 5. Community Engagement/Support & Strategic Partnerships 6. Sustainable Infrastructure (Environmental, Finance, Workforce, Safety, and Facilities) 7. Inclusive Excellence & Belonging At today's meeting I will provide a PowerPoint presentation on our current state of the strategic planning process, including our next steps related to implementation planning. A s we finalize our last thoughts about each of these areas, we are working on a communications plan to make sure the various constituents get informed, receive our gratitude, and learn about next steps. Thanks for everyone's input and engagement. Two new UNM Board of Regents and update on the Regent's Health and Health Sciences Committee: Hopefully you will all get to meet, or already know, our two new UNM Board of Regents, Paul Blanchard and Paula Tackett. We have been enthused to meet them and see their interest and support for UNM Health and Health Sciences. They were recently appointed to the Board of Regents by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. They both have a long history of service to New Mexico, and UNM is fortunate to have the benefit of their experience in this important governance role. We will be providing orientation sessions for the new Regents in the upcoming month. I'd like to share my gratitude to departing Regents Sandra Begay and Doug Brown for their dedication and support. The Regent's Health and Health Sciences Committee has three Regent members and will now have two co -chairs. I am looking forward to working c losely in the coming year with the new leadership structure of Co -Chairs (Regents Schwartz and Fortner). Regent Fortner will be leading matters related to our UNM Health system and Regent Schwartz will focus on Health Sciences matters. I want to welcome Regent Payne to this Committee. In addition, I would also like to thank Regent Ko for his time, great questions, and thoughtful attention over the past two years. His transition to serving on the UNM Hospital Board of Trustees will provide excellent engagement for us all.

We are excited to continue working with them in an effort to make New Mexico a better place to live by developing a strong workforce, providing care across the state, stimulating economic development and job growth and working with our community partners statewide. My thanks our Government Relations team, including Mike Puelle, Nathan Bush and Stevie Olson, for doing a terrific job of communicating our priorities to the legislators. Grateful Patient and Families Update - Through a strong collab oration between UNM Health and Health Sciences and the UNM Foundation, our grateful patient and family giving program continues to grow. A few examples include: Creation of the Terry & Alyce J. Richardson Endowed Professorship in Nursing Creation of the Donna M. Tomky & Robert W. Geer Endowed Professorship in Ovarian Cancer Research Creation of the Peter A. Winograd Endowed Clinical Professorship in Cancer Naming of the Cancer Center's 4 th floor reception area by Marcia Lubar in memory of her husband Larry Additionally, we have significantly expanded training for clinicians and health care staff on ways to be appropriately engaged in our Foundation's activities and the grateful patient program. This included training nearly 50 of our most senior health and health sciences leaders. This year, we will have three email & direct mail campaigns with a focus on cardiology, cancer, dermatology, and neurosurgery. We are committed to continuing work in this area and look forward to expanding the program in FY24. We also appreciate that in addition to grateful patients that we must attend to grateful communities. UNM HEALTH SYSTEM MATTER S: COVID Update - New Mexico's public health order ended March 31 and the federal public health emergency regarding COVID will expire May 11. Following guidance and recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the New Mexico Department of Health and other public health experts, the UNM Health System no longer mandates face masks in clinical settings , as of April 16, 2023. For patients and visitors, fac e masks will be optional in all settings, including hospitals, clinics, laboratories and patient lobby areas, with some exceptions. If a patient or visitor has respiratory symptoms, that individual will be asked to use a face mask. And face mask requirements may be re- instituted if community transmission rates for COVID, RSV, influenza, measles or other contagious viruses significantly increases . COVID tests will continue to be req uired for all behavioral health admissions. Face masks will be optional for health care workers; however, patients will be able to ask clinicians and staff to wear a mask. Staff who want additional protection are supported and encouraged to continue masking. Additionally, units with particularly vulnerable populations should continue universal masking. The 120/131 Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires health care workers to show proof of a COVID -19 vaccination. UNM Health will continue to follow all OSHA guidelines. UNM Hospital Listening Tour - Active, deep listening in our communities to the needs of our communit ies is one of the most important ways in which we can determine how we best serve our patients. In March , UNM Hospital CEO Kate Becker, along with the UNMH Office of Community Engagement, began a listening tour across each district of Bernalillo County. I have witnessed the importance of these meetings and found the meeting incredible and well attended with lots of great feedback and ideas. We have received important feedback about how to make the patient experience better, how we can better serve vulnerable populations and how we can grow in a way that continues to meet the needs of our diverse and ever -changing state. The feedback we receive in these sessions will be the baseline of a community assessment report that will help us make decisions on how to allocate resources. We are very grateful for the support of the community through mill levy, and know the importance of listening and engaging to hear their voices on how we are doing and what is most critical for them. In order to Deliver More, we need to listen more. The UNMH Listening Tour has a few more stops this spring and summer. Please read more about the sessions to learn how and where you can attend. The Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC), UNMH - Bernalillo County Partnership - Today we will present an update on our commitment to help the County, City, and People at the MDC through our partnership with Bernalillo County. I am grateful for so many putting the effort into making this a reality. There is a history of UNMH engagement with the MDC in the past, and this new partnership has generated lots of enthusiasm. Today's presentation will discuss the Health Care Challenges at MDC, how other Academic Health Centers have excelled in these partnerships, and the current progress of our 7 UNMH - County Working Committees (Staffing, Providers, Medical Health, Behavioral Health, IT/EMR, Pharmacy/Lab/Supply Chain, and Finance/Contracting) . Add ictions Psychiatry Fellowship - We are committed to enhancing our behavioral health programs, including clinical, research, and teaching efforts to address the crisis in substance use disorders. This is critical for all of New Mexico. A recent expansion of UNM fellows in addiction psychiatry and addiction medicine will help us expand our workforce. They are gaining needed expertise in treating substance use disorders (SUDs ). The newly refurbished hospital at 5400 Gibson SE in Albuquerque specializes in medication detoxification, social rehabilitation and intensive outpatient services. Addiction treatment in New Mexico is very limited, and one of the biggest barriers is that providers are hesitant to treat SUDs due to lack of access to training in both inpatient and outpatient settings. The fellows will gain valuable experience while treating patients with complex needs. Bellelizabeth Foster, MD, fellowship director in the UNM Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, collaborated with Snehal Bhatt, MD, chief of the Division of Addictions Psychiatry, and Valerie Carrejo, MD, who leads the Addictions Medicine Fellowship in the UNM Department of Family & Community Medicine. 121/131 HEALTH SCIENCE ACADEMIC MATTERS: College of Population Health Recruitment - The College of Population Health has made tremendous headway in growing its staff in anticipation of becoming an accredited School of Public Health. The College has hired 20 new faculty members over the past six months, including an associate dean and two assistant deans (one for education, and one for research). Two finalists are due to visit campus for the position of assistant dean for faculty affairs. Meanwhile, the College has just launched its first cohort of PhD students, with as many as seven additional students joining the PhD program in the fall. Congratulations to Dean Tracie Collins, MD, MPH, MHCDS, and her team for their terrific work. The funding for these faculty members was from the two -year funding support from our Governor and legislators. Thanks for everyone's help in getting us closer to a School of Public Health. UNM Research Award Lectures - I'd like congratulate Drs. Vojo Deretic and David Schade for their UNM Research Awards which include their providing a lecture for all of us. Dr. Deretic, chair of the Department of Molecular Genetics & Microbiology, and an internationally known expert on of autophagy, delivered the Annual Research Lecture on March 30. The lecture has been presented at UNM since 1954 and is one of the highest honor s the University bestows on its faculty member in recognition of research/creative activity. Dr. Schade, chief of the Division of Endocrinology & Metabolism in the Department of Internal Medicine, will deliver the Eighth Annual Community Engaged Research Lecture (CERL) on April 19. The CERL is bestowed upon a faculty member in recognition of exemplary community engaged research or community engaged creative works. They are both very deserving of this high honor and recognition. Cancer Center Hoops for Hope - On March 9 New Mexico lawmakers put in overtime for UNM's cancer patients and their families, but the OT didn't happen in the Roundhouse that day\u2014it happened on the basketball court. And the big winner: the UNM Comprehensive Cancer Center. This year's Hoops 4 Hopes basketball game was a nail biter that went into overtime as the Senate took on the House at Santa Fe Indian School. In the end the Senate won 33- 32, but the bragging rights go to both teams for raising more than $34,000 for the Center's patient care fund. Hoops 4 Hopes has raised more than $300,000 over the past 18 years. A big thanks to our lawmakers and everyone who made the event such a success! New Mexico Bioscience Authority - President Stokes has named Dr. David Perkins, professor in the Department of Internal Medicine and co -director of the School of Medicine's MD/PhD program, to the board of the New Mexico Bioscience Authority, where he has been nominated to serve as president. Dr. Perkins' educational and professional credentials include an undergraduate degree at the University of California, Berkley, and medical school at The Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Dr. Perkins earned a PhD at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and served 17 years as a faculty member at Harvard University and then at the University of California, San Diego. Congratulations and gratitude to Dr. Perkins for agreeing to serve in this role, which will help us in our mission to advance New Mexico's economic development through the biosciences and health care services and technology. 122/131 MDMA -Assisted Therapy for PTSD - Dr. Larry Leeman, who treats expectant mothers experiencing opioid use disorder as medical director for the UNM Milagro Program , is launching a first- of-its-kind pilot study to see whether a regimen of trauma- focused therapy coupled with doses of MDMA - popularly known to rave participants as ecstasy or molly - can help new mothers permanently overcome their drug dependency. The FDA - approved open label study will enroll 15 people with diagnoses of moderate to severe PTSD six to 12 months after they have given birth. Each participant will receive 12 weeks of intensive therapy and three medication sessions, Leeman said. The project, funded through private donations, will assess whether MDMA -assisted therapy can help the mothers overcome their addictions and improve bonding with their infants. I have high hopes about the potential of this type of treatment to break the cycle of drug dependency. Malaria Vaccine Research Grant - Congratulations to Bryce Chackerian, PhD (the Jeffrey Michael Gorvetzian Endowed Professor of Biomedical Research Excellence, Regents Professor and Vice Chair of the Department of Molecular Genetics & Microbiology ) who is the principal investigator for a new five- year, $3.1 million grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. This grant will help UNM develop a more effective vaccine against the Plasmodium falciparum parasite that causes malaria. Dr. Chackerian and his team are using virus -like particles as a vaccine platform to elicit antibodies capable of attacking a protein on the surface of the parasite that will prevent it from entering the liver and triggering a full -blown infection. Lobo Hackathon - I'm excited about the upcoming Lobo Hackathon, where teams of competitors collaborate to create or refine an idea that sets out to address a problem. With a prize pool totaling at least $25,000, there is plenty of incentive to participate. The event is scheduled for Thursday, April 13, from 6 p.m. -10 p.m. at the Lobo Rainforest Building, and open to students, faculty, staff, entrepreneurs and the community at large. The event is being organized with the help of former UNM president Bob Frank, professor and director of the Center for Innovation in Health and Education and Master of Public Health program director in the College of Population Health. He and Rob DelCampo, Rutledge Professor of Management in the Anderson School of Management are also teaching an eight- week elective course around the Hackathon that focuses on entrepreneurship. Conclusion: As always, thank you all for your leadership, service and support. I look forward to our next meeting and appreciate your feedback and questions.

Opioid Safety and Overdose Prevention On March 29, 2023 , the FDA approved naloxone (Narcan) as an OTC medication. This is an important step in reducing the number of opioid overdose deaths in the US. NM is in the top ten states nationally with a rate of death of 39/100,000 . Opioid overdose continues to be an urgent public health challe nge in the United States and New Mexico. In 2019, 74% of all overdose deaths involve opioids in New Mexico. Preventable opioid overdose deaths increased 457% since 1999 in the U .S., which lead public health officials to declare a nationwide opioid overdose epidemic. Opioids can have a dverse reactions and cause harmful and severe reactions that slow or even stop breathing. Because opioids slow or even stop breathing, opioid overdoses can be fatal. Overdose can happen when a person takes too much of the opioid medication, when a person m ixes an opioid with another substance, like alcohol or other sedatives, or when a small amount of illicit fentanyl is found in other substances. Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid/pain -relieving drug prescribed for the treatment of extreme pain. Fentanyl and fentanyl analogues are now found in many street drugs and only a small amount can cause an overdose. Illicit fentanyl is sh owing up in pills, heroin, meth and cocaine and causing overdose deaths. 128/131 129/131 CDC Structure for approaching the Opioid Crisis 130/131 Section XVI. UNM "}
