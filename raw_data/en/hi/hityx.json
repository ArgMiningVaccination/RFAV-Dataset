Sound empirical research and a concern to create better governance of iGovernment enable the authors to bring a sharply critical eye to their call for greater awareness by policy-makers, and for a strategic, reasoned and institutionalised relationship among the principles involved. These include ones that are often neglected: privacy, freedom of choice, accountability and transparency. Their recommendations are important, not only for the Netherlands\". Charles D. Raab, Professor Emeritus and Honorary Professorial Fellow, University of Edinburgh \"This book will be a valuable resource for researchers and scholars seeking to understand the possibilities, dilemmas and challenges of bringing the Internet and related technologies to centre stage in government and public services. It offers a fascinating case study of electronic government and 'information government' in the Netherlands, with examples from local, national and eu government, a wide-ranging literature review and a number of recommendations as to how iGovernment should develop\". Helen Margetts, Professor of Society and the Internet and director of the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford \"Not only does this book offer an insightful analysis of the problems that ongoing digitization poses for citizens and the government itself (such as creeping loss of data quality), it also places highly valuable markers for the decisions that must be taken on the challenging path that lies ahead for iGovernment, in providing a new model for weighing up the various fundamental interests at stake\". Alex Brenninkmeijer, National Ombudsman, The Netherlands How does the use of ict affect the relationship between government and its citizens? This book analyses the developments of networking information and concludes that in everyday practice an iGovernment has gradually come into existence, overtaking the old paradigm of the eGoverment. The iGoverment, effectively running at full speed on information flows and networks, is however seriously out of step with the self-image of the digital government, and the existing structure and division of responsibilities.

The Dutch version, entitled iOverheid , was presented to the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations, Piet Hein Donner, on 15 March 2011. In it, the ScientificCouncil for Government Policy ( Wetenschappelijke Raad voor het Regeringsbeleid - wrr ), an advisory body to the Dutch Government, makes recommendations on this important issue. The wrr 's task is to make proposals, based on broad analysis and scientific insights, for the strategic direction of Dutch policy. To this end, thewrr submits advisory reports to the government on issues which merit special attention. The current English version of the iOverheid report draws mainly on material relating to the Dutch situation and developments - in their eucontext - but the analysis and the policy perspective provided should prove valuable inother national contexts as well. After all, the Netherlands is by no means unique,neither in the high stakes involved with the success or failure of ict in govern- ment, nor in the sometimes feeble grasp that public authorities seem to have ondevelopments in this field, especially in assessing the wider societal consequencesof digitization. The central message that this book puts forward is that politicalattention needs to be shifted towards the intricacies of the web of informationflows that is taking shape, instead of the intricacies of the individual technologiesand applications that make these information flows technologically possible. Themessage that governments should see and act like an iGoverment instead of aneGovernment is a message that is worth testing in different national contexts. This book was drawn up by a project team headed by Corien Prins, a member of the Scientific Council for Government Policy ( wrr ). The project team further consisted of Broeders and Astrid Sourencontributed to the preparatory work. The book is based on a detailed analysis of the extensive Dutch and international academic literature, research commissioned by the wrr , and meetings and inter- views with external experts from varying levels of government, politics andacademia. Some of the experts work for ministries or other government bodies(the Office of the National Ombudsman, the Data Protection Authority, theNetherlands Court of Audit, the Council of State); in Parliament (members of theDutch House of Representatives and the Dutch Senate); government agencies,research institutions (the Rathenau Institute, hec ), Dutch (ecp-epn , sities abroad; European institutions (the European Commission, the EuropeanParliament and the European Data Protection Supervisor); and the Permanent9Representation of the Netherlands to the euin Brussels. A list of people inter- viewed for this report or for one of the preliminary studies is given in one of the appendices. The authors are grateful to all of these individuals for their time,expertise and suggestions, which have been invaluable. The underlying research,which was commissioned by the wrr , was published in two forms. Some of the studies were included as chapters in the background study published simultane-ously with the Dutch edition of this book entitled De staat van informatie (Broed- ers, Cuijpers & Prins 2011); the rest were published on the wrr 's website in the iOverheid series, the first appearing in the autumn of 2010. The Dutch versions of all of these publications can be downloaded from www.wrr.nl. The wrr is grate- ful to all of the authors and experts for their contribution and for attending theworking conferences organised within the context of the preliminary studies. The project group had the opportunity to discuss at length the preliminary project outcomes and recommendations with a group of international researchers during aseminar organised by the wrr and the Oxford Internet Institute ( oii) in May 2010. The wrr would like to thank all those who attended for contributing to that discussion. Special thanks are due to a number of individuals who commented onthe draft report in the final phase, or who brainstormed about the project set-up grateful for their assistance.10 igovernmentsummary The ubiquitous use of ict in government means that we can no longer label it 'eGovernment', where the focus is on providing services and on utilising technol- ogy. What has in fact evolved in everyday practice is closer to 'iGovernment',typified by information flows and data networks and focusing not only on provid-ing services but also on control and care. iGovernment is bringing about far-reach-ing changes in the relationship between the public and the authorities. Although ithas practical - and very real - implications for policy and implementation, iGov-ernment, with a few rare exceptions, has so far been flying under the political andadministrative radar. Based on this observation, this volume argues in favour ofmaking 'iGovernment self-awareness' a key objective. It provides a range of policyand institutional recommendations for making the necessary paradigm shift fromeGovernment to iGovernment as smooth as possible. The impact of ict on society and government ict has become part of the very fabric of government and it increasingly impacts on organisations, the professionals who work there, and their relationship withthe public. All of the policy plans for eGovernment - which focus on internaloperational issues, the provision of government services, and the technology itself- express massive trust in ict as an instrument for making government more effective, client-friendly and accessible, for improving the quality of government,and for preparing government for the future. Increasingly, policymakers andpoliticians are turning eagerly to ict to assist with the complex administrative work of government and to help them tackle urgent social issues such as terror-ism, security, mobility, and the provision of good and affordable care. In additionto public services, other government tasks are rapidly being digitized. Technology has very nearly become a matter of course in government, whether at the local, national or European level. Technology is 'rolled out', practices are'streamlined' and services are 'updated'. The level of 'techno-trust' among politi-cians and policymakers can be seen in the hugely ambitious plans they have madefor and with ict, not only in terms of the technology itself, but also with respect to actual policy. Currently popular policy themes - for example 'customisation'and proactive policy-making - would be unimaginable without the backdrop ofdigitization. In an effort to map out the future and anticipate what lies ahead,government is utilising and interlinking systems in such areas as security and care.For example, there is now a reference index in the Netherlands for children at risk;European immigration databases are meant to prevent more irregular migrantssettling in the Netherlands; and special investigative databases and cross-borderexchanges of passenger and bank details are helping to prevent new terroristattacks worldwide. And it is not only national government that is planning new11systems or calling for more and better information. Whole networks of interlinked systems and information processes are developing between implementing agen-cies and within local government. Globalization processes are also ensuring thatinformation policy in the Netherlands is taking shape partly within the context ofinternational as well as European applications and systems. There is also constantpressure at these levels to expand the systems' functions, to add more informationcategories, and to give a growing number of authorities access to the informationstored there. Politicians who wax lyrical about new applications as well as interlinked systems and information flows argue that these will increase security and improve effec-tiveness and efficiency. Combined with the problem-solving 'image' of ict, the arguments they offer are more or less self-evident: in each case (a system, a link),these arguments appear to weigh more heavily in the equation than such ideals astransparency, privacy, freedom of choice, or accountability. Many policymakerswho 'own' or advocate such applications tend to regard ict as an instrument, and they assume - and regularly make a point of saying so - that it will not alter the primary process of government. They do not, or only barely, acknowledge or perceive the unintended but very real impact that digitization has on the waygovernment operates, if only because the public in general has itself changed.Although the instrumental dimension of ict is important, this attitude has led to a certain paucity, in the sense that that there is a virtual absence of any effectiveform of evaluation. Credible evaluations are rare and there are no sound standards for assessing applications. The debate continues to focus on the security of thetechnology (e.g. the public transport idchip card) or the financial debacles (e.g. the various failed ict projects). The process of interlinking and sharing data runs parallel to the collapse of parti-tions between policy areas, between government organisations, and between thepublic and private sectors. Increasingly, such partitions are regarded - including bythe public - as impediments to efficient and effective public administration. Thepopularity of data-sharing within supply chains and networks - something facili-tated by unique idnumbers (the Citizen Service Number) and authenticated records - means that information can easily cross over traditional boundaries,even though the responsibility for the quality and reliability of that data have notevolved at the same pace. Information is disseminated, and it is used andprocessed by many different public authorities. Government bodies operating inwidely diverging areas and with very diff erent objectives are increasingly making use of the same 'pooled' information. But no one knows precisely who is responsi-ble for the information (or its accuracy), and so people must allow for the possibil-ity that 'their' information will come to lead a life of its own in public and privatehands. 12 igovernmentPoliticians and policymakers propagate, discuss and assess all of the trends and developments desc ribed above, using a range of different rationales, ideas and normative viewpoints. The best-known of these are efficiency, effectiveness, secu-rity, privacy, and transparency. Ultimately, the form in which a new system ornew link between information sources is cast is the outcome of a complexdynamic relationship between all of these standards. That outcome concerns notonly the technology - which is often the focus of the debate - but in particular itssocial, administrative and legal implications, which receive much less attention. Toclarify this dynamic process and to offer some guidance when it comes to weigh-ing up the various rationales at work, we have divided them into three categories:driving principles (such as security, effectiveness, and efficiency), underpinningprinciples (privacy and freedom of choice), and process-based principles (trans-parency and accountability). Driving principles are associated with government's'drive' to utilise ict in all kinds of different areas. They are closely bound up with notions of improvement and quality gains. Underpinning principles have to dowith guaranteeing rights and freedoms, charting 'silent losses' as the process ofdigitization proceeds, and protecting the autonomy of the individual. They form akind of counterbalance to the driving principles. Finally, process-based principlesprovide the procedural framework that makes a transparent and verifiable compar-ison between driving and underpinning principles possible. iGovernment as reality This volume shows that the nature of government is changing fundamentally, stepby step, decision by decision, under the influence of digitization. A de facto prac- tice has developed - virtually unnoticed - in which interrelated information flowsdominate the character of government. These information flows therefore alsodetermine the new possibilities open to the authorities and the public - as well astheir dependencies and vulnerabilities. In everyday life , however, the overall ideaof the 'information Government' - iGovernment - is virtually the last thing driv- ing the way politicians and policymakers think and work: the vast majority ofgovernment initiatives relating to digitization and the information flows theygenerate are debated, evaluated and introduced in isolation. Individual initiativesare not - or scarcely ever - assessed on the basis of their impact or potential impacton government and society as a whole. The most significant omission is the failureor near-failure to view such initiatives within the context of the fast-expandingand rapidly diversifying information flows. Politicians and policymakers are notaware of iGovernment and, given the unremitting ascendency of ict, that is certainly a problem. The accumulation of ad hoc decisions about new technologies, the lack of aware- ness that iGovernment is on the rise, and the absence of any related discussionmean that when it comes to the development of iGovernment, 'the sky's the limit' - there appear, in effect, to be no limits. No one has restricted the dispersal of indi-13 summaryvidual applications or the linking up of information flows, because no one has claimed stewardship of the whole. It no longer seems possible to set a frame ofreference for collecting or linking information. The result is that informationbecomes contaminated, it is unclear who is responsible for information flows, andindividuals, businesses and even government organisations become trapped andstifled in the tangle of government data. Questions and concerns regarding therelationships between information flows and their implications are left unad-dressed. As a result, not only people but also government itself are vulnerable. Thedebate among Dutch politicians and policymakers lacks a broader view of iGov-ernment and a meticulous and verifiable assessment of its driving pr, underpin-ning and process-based principles. Although iGovernment is still developing and growing rapidly, and although it has scarcely made any impression on politicians and policymakers, it is alreadyhaving a very real impact. At the same time, the lack of 'awareness' of the featuresof iGovernment means that this impact is scarcely taken into account in policy-making, and that politicians and policymakers do not realise sufficiently preciselywhat is developing, let alone how they can guide the development process in the right direction. If the Dutch government wants to steer the digitization process inthe right direction while leaving enough scope for ict-driven innovation, it will have to make the transition from eGovernment to iGovernment in thought, wordand deed. Government's main challenge - and in fact, the challenge facing all tiersof public administration - is to understand that it has already become iGovern- ment, with all that that implies. Meeting this challenge will require it to shiftperspective and develop an appropriate institutional framework. It must also,crucially, leave behind the narrow focus on individual applications, and turninstead to the idea of networked information management. The final requirementis that government must have an open-minded attitude toward trends and devel-opments in the information society (iSociety). iGovernment cannot be structuredin isolation. Its motto must therefore be: 'Make sure we involve the iSociety inbuilding an iGovernment that will last'. Administrative principles for iGovernment Two issues are of vital importance in making the administrative transition toiGovernment. First of all, the scrupulous development of iGovernment is impos-sible unless we assess the driving, underpinning and process-based principleswith an open mind. In addition, government must exercise particular caution,both in this assessment and in its policymaking and policy implementation,whenever the three processes of information handling noted in this book comeinto play. These processes - furnished with symbolic warning flags - are associ-ated with a) the networking of information, b) the compiling and enhancing ofinformation, and c) the pursuit of preventive policy based on information. 14 igovernmentThe three clusters of principles described in this volume - driving, underpinning and process-based - should be well balanced at all decision-making levels. This isno mean task, given that a quasi-quantitative concept such as efficiency, a morenormative concept like freedom of choice, and a process-based concept likeaccountability all clearly fall under different registers of analysis. Nevertheless, ifiGovernment is to be evenly balanced, these three clusters of principles must alsobe thoroughly and properly assessed. They must be clarified, they must be verifi-able, and publicly accountable. That does not happen nearly enough yet. Govern-ment must explain its rationale publicly at every level, from preparation and intro-duction of a specific application to the far-reaching diversification of processes andinformation flows that form the building blocks of iGovernment. It should do sonot only at the national level, but also for assessments at the international and,specifically, at the European level. Clarifying the principles and making them asverifiable as possible would raise a number of issues and open them up for discus-sion. One such issue is the fact that politicians and policymakers are often irra-tionally optimistic about the potential of ict. This is often why there impossible deadlines are set and why there are expensive ict failures. Clarification would also show that spill-over and function creep are often quietly factored into the equa-tion. Real iGovernment self-awareness requires politicians to take the expression'A government forewarned is a government forearmed' seriously in the digitaldomain as well, and to apply this expression to implicit but foreseeable ict trends. Government often anticipates the future in its policymaking, and it would be to itscredit to do the same in its political assessments, openly and above board. Secondly, the transition to iGovernment requires that government become much more aware of various features of information than is now the case. We are refer-ring here to processes of information handling and use, specifically because such processes have a huge impact on the nature and reliability of the information thatfeeds iGovernment. We have therefore tagged three interrelated processes with warning flags: when information is either part of or the result of these processes,government must pay strict attention to the quality of the information andconsider who bears responsibility for it. The three processes that we have flaggedin this way are:aT h e networking of information, i.e. shared use and management of information within a network of actors. bT h e compiling and enhancing of information, i.e. creating new information and profiles based on different sources in different contexts. c Pursuing preventive and proactive policy based on information, i.e. actively evaluating and intervening in society based on an information-driven riskcalculation. These three information processes, which are the core of iGovernment, enable itto fine-tune and customise policy, obtain a comprehensive picture of the public15 summaryand of the policy issues, and take proactive action where needed. At the same time, they are processes that themselves have an impact on information: they influenceits nature, reliability, recognisability, contextuality and traceability. It is importantto realise - much more so than is now the case - that it is precisely these threeprocesses that are having the biggest impact on (a) the quality of informationcontent and (b) the demands made on the organisational context of information flows. The quality and vulnerability of information and information processestherefore require constant, proactive vigilan ce throughout all branches of national government. We must also have a much greater degree of openness and trans-parency, so that we can help people understand what information is beingcollected on them and assist them in correcting it where necessary. Right now,people are almost powerless to correct errors in personal information within thevast iGovernment information networks - errors that sometimes have huge reper-cussions. Finally, iGovernment's 'memory' demands particular attention. Boththe importance of 'forgetting' - people should not be judged eternally on theinformation that government has stored about them - and of saving and archivingrequire a radical cultural transition and a firmly grounded strategy. Limits to the growth of iGovernment When iGovernment is not self-aware, its natural tendency will be to continueexpanding. After all, only self-awareness will induce it to set limits to its owngrowth. The scrupulous development of iGovernment also means being preparedto set limits to it. Although this book does not define such limits - in essence, thatis a political matter - it does indicate where those limits might be found. In thefirst place, the combined processes of assessing principles and being alert to warn-ing flags force us to consider the limits of iGovernment. Other reasons to setlimits may include the mixing of service, care and control, and the diffuse bound-aries between public and private information flows. What is also of huge impor-tance is the fact that the Internet has created an entirely new information environ-ment, one from which iGovernment cannot withdraw and within which it isobliged to function. The relationship to this 'world outside' also makes it veryimportant to set well-argued limits. An institutional agenda for the transition to iGovernment Prudent efforts to build iGovernment require changes not only in policy but alsoat the institutional level. A government that has taken on another guise in the digi-tal sense must also make the necessary organisational changes. When governmentis linked up in terms of its information flows, the accountability structure must fitin with this new reality and operate with the necessary efficiency. 'iGovernmentself-awareness' is not just a status to be enjoyed, but rather an ongoing challengethat must ultimately be ingrained in every tier of government. In the short term,however, central government will have to foster that self-awareness. Fleshing outthe targets for iGovernment will therefore require an institutional transformation16 igovernmentthat assigns and embeds three functions within government: aT h e strategic function , i.e. guaranteeing the well-considered, ongoing develop- ment of iGovernment. bT h e societal function , i.e. making iGovernment more transparent for citizens and improving its accountability vis-\u00e0-vis individuals who become entangledin information networks. cT h e operational function , i.e. improving the well-reasoned alignment between policy, implementation, technology, information flows and networks. Also,improving the commissioning practices of government. These three functions constitute the absolute minimum requirements for shapingiGovernment self-awareness and acting on the implications of the new reality. It isno easy matter to map out the institutions associated with these three functionsproperly, but it is important that these functions are actually entrusted to organi-sations. The institutional transformation as such is much more important than theprecise designations for the institutions proposed in this volume. At the strategiclevel, we propose a standing committee for iGovernment that investigates andassesses digitization processes in the light of iGovernment as a whole, and thatreports to Parliament. At the societal level, we propose setting up an iPlatform inorder to concentrate and increase the transparency of iGovernment vis-\u00e0-vis citi- zens. Accountability can be entrusted to an iAuthority, responsible for dealingwith any problems that citizens encounter with iGovernment (and given thepower to take binding decisions). Finally, it is of vital importance at the opera-tional level to ensure professionalism in commissioning practices and to prioritisenot technical expertise, but expertise at the interface of technology and policy. In essence, this publication is about government taking responsibility for the way it uses ict . But government naturally also has a role to play in the information society. In addition to being accountable for iGovernment, government is respon-sible to some extent for the way the iSociety functions. What aspects of the infor-mation society should government be concerned about, and when should it inter-vene (and how)? The general public and businesses move ahead, inspired by thepromise of new technologies and pro fits. When this devel opment is no t offset against underpinning principles and balanced against the outcome of process-based principles that make information flows transparent for the public - and, ifnecessary, open to criticism - then those involved iGovernment should at the veryleast ask whether the time has not come to take action. 17 summarypart i introduction and context1 digitizing the citizen and government 1.1 the existential role of digitization Digitization is a fascinating phenomenon whose impact on society can hardly be overestimated. Many key societal and economic processes have come to rely heav-ily on ict systems - systems that are essentially based on infinite series of zeros and ones. These simple digits are capable of converting analogue signals represent-ing texts, images and sounds into digital versions of the same. One noteworthyfeature of digitization is the relative ease with which users can gather, store,search, and share information, resulting in an unparalleled range of new products,services and applications. And it can all be done at breakneck speed: a mere mouseclick and information available on the Internet can be shared with others on Twitter, Facebook, blogs or other websites. Businesses, public authorities and non-profit organisations fill whole databases, online or otherwise, with data relating tothe widest possible variety of subjects, from purchasing behaviour to non-payersand from dna markers to the fingerprints of the entire population of the Nether- lands. Digital information is developing into a universal language that is makingthe world a much smaller place than it was before. The fact that information is soeasy to replicate can even produce global shockwaves, as illustrated by theWikiLeaks affair in late 2010 - described as \"the first sustained confrontationbetween the established order and the culture of the internet\" (Naughton 2010b). The effects of digitization are huge - and extremely varied. WikiLeaks embodies its disruptive power (whether one regards that power in a positive or negativelight), but its influence in more 'traditional' contexts, including government, isalso enormous. It is no wonder that the public sector is eager to reap the benefits ofict along with everyone else. An impressive array of digitization projects have been rolled out in recent years in the broad territory covered by government.These are meant to improve government's service delivery and to optimise theway public servants and public services operate - and cooperate - in government's back office. Changes in service delivery are likely to make the biggest impressionon the public. Nowadays, citizens wishing to call on public services can oftenaccess them digitally. Almost every local authority allows permit applications andrequests for copies of official records to be submitted via its website. Indeed,sometimes that is the only option available. Businesses, for example, are obliged tosubmit their tax returns electronically. The Dutch government is working hard toset up a general portal, mijn.overheid.nl (i.e. my.government.nl), where citizenscan use their personal digital identification code - the 'DigiD' - to log in and trans-act business directly with government. 21Box 1.1 Everyday ict for citizens Christine clicks 'send'. She has just applied for a permit to hold a street party that she is organising with some of her neighbours. She did so on her pc, by logging into the local government website using her DigiD number. Being able to submit her application electronically means she won't haveto make a trip to the council offices. And while she's already online and has her DigiD log-in codehandy, she decides to update the information for her housing and care allowance. She recentlystarted working more hours, and that means that her income has changed. After downloading soft-ware from the Tax and Customs Administration website, she gets down to work. Any informationalready known to Tax and Customs has already been filled in, and that makes things much easier.Once she's completed the form, she sorts through her e-mail inbox. She finds an e-mail from theEducation Executive Agency ( duo ) informing her that it has recalculated her financial situation, based on her income figures for 2009 as reported by Tax and Customs. If the information in theletter is correct, no action is required on her part and she will shortly be receiving a readjustedrepayment schedule for her student loan. There is another e-mail from sisa , a digital information network of youth care organisations. The e-mail tells her that her son Martin's name has beenreported to the sisa monitoring system by two various organisations, his school and youth social work agency. The sisa system keeps track of which organisations are monitoring children with potential development problems . Christine is worried and wond ers what's wrong with Martin. She rereads the e-mail and the attachment, an information leaflet. She then opens a search engine.She decides to google sisa and see what it all means... The influence of ict is also growing fast in other areas in which government bears responsibility, such as healthcare, security, and social insurance. For example, every individual who applies for benefit now has a Digital Client Dossier. Thevarious partners in the benefits supply chain, such as local government, the SocialInsurance Bank ( svb ) and the Social Security Agency ( uwv ), use this dossier to share information with one another, so that applicants are only obliged to providetheir details once. To prevent errors and enable immediate action in the event ofrisk, the broader care sector is working on developing an Electronic Patient Dossier(epd ), an Electronic Juvenile Dossier (ejd ), and a Reference Index for Juveniles at Risk ( vir ). Security and law enforcement officials perform body scans at Schiphol Airport and mount speed cameras along motorways. The Knowledge and Expert-ise Centre for Intelligent Data Analysis ( kecida ), a department of the Netherlands Forensic Institute, analyses all kinds of information flows (for example on theInternet) in order to assist the police in their enforcement and investigative work.At the same time, the child pornography case uncovered in Amsterdam in Decem-ber 2010 shows that cross-border data-sharing (in this case, relating to the mainsuspect's previous conviction in Germany for possession of child pornography)leaves much to be desired. The use of digital applications in public services and thecare and security sectors is intended to allow government to discharge its dutiesmore effectively and deliver its services more efficiently. It means that individuals 22 igovernmentwill have much easier access to government, but also that government will have more records and data on them. In this digital era, government often knows moreabout the average person than he or she may realise. Digitization is not limited to the visible interaction between citizens and the authorities. Government is making broad use of ict 'behind the scenes' as a tool for streamlining work processes and facilitating cooperation between organisa-tions. These changes may not be as evident to the general public as projects high-lighted by the media, for example the epd or the use of body scans at Schiphol Airport, but that does not make them less important. After all, a government thatwants to optimise its performance requires streamlined information management.For example, the rinis Foundation (Institute for the Routing of (Inter)National Information Streams) facilitates the secure and automated exchange of messagesbetween public-sector organisations. rinis serves as a digital postman; it delivers messages to the right address without knowing what the message says. rinis affiliates also have access to authentic basic records, for example the MunicipalPersonal Records Database (gba), another important component of the authori-ties' information management system. In fact, these basic records are a datasetcontaining the data that is most in demand, for example addresses, personaldetails, company names, and location information. Their purpose is to allowpublic authorities to use the same basic, reliable data in the course of their work.Another example is the Citizen Service Number ( bsn/csn), which serves as a 'key' for the exchange of personal data. The csn makes it easier to exchange personal data and makes such exchanges more reliable. In short, governmentorganisations now share data about individuals, allow one another access to infor-mation systems, and link up such systems on an everyday basis. Figure 1.1, takenfrom the Citizen Service Number website, illustrates this point. The trends described above represent only a fraction of the digitization process taking place in government. It would be virtually impossible to describe all thevarious projects and initiatives, and not only because there are so many of them,because they are taking place throughout the public sector, or because in manycases the dividing lines between public and private sector are blurred. It is alsobecause they are so dynamic and changeable. The list of projects changes almostconstantly under the influence of new technologies, the shifting aims of politi-cians and policymakers, and the changing needs and expectations of society. Anadditional factor is that such projects often do not stop at our borders, nor is theDutch government the only authority involved: europeanization and internation-alization play a prominent role here as well. But one thing is certain: digitizationhas become part of the very fabric of government and increasingly impacts onorganisations, the professionals who work there, and their relationship with thepublic. 23 digitizing the citizen and governmentFigure 1.1 Data flows between governing and other organisations facilitated by the bsn Source: www.burgerservicenummer.nl24 igovernmentNow that digital tools have become part of everyday life and are growing more ubiquitous by the day, the fundamental changes they are bringing about and theconsequences they have for society and government organisations are becomingclearer. People, businesses and government are reassessing their position in whatis rapidly turning into an information society (see Section 1.2). That society is, inessence, a network, and that means that the roles and positions of both the publicand the authorities are shifting and changing. It is becoming increasingly clear thatthese changes are affecting not only the way people and the authorities use infor-mation; they also - or should also - have a significant impact on administrativestructures and the division of responsibilities. Various authors have alreadypointed out that digitization will necessitate a transformation of public adminis-tration (Frissen 1996; ict and Government Ad Hoc Advisory Committee 2001; Bekkers, Lips & Zuurmond 2005: 746). What is more difficult, however, is todecide what direction this transformation should take. In addition to the enor-mous opportunities offered by ict, it also creates numerous new risks for citizens and government and makes them vulnerable in ways that may not always beapparent. For example, sharing information electronically may save time and money, but if that data is incorrect, it can be very difficult to remove it from all the interlinkedinformation flows - with everything that implies for the individual in question. Astudy by the City of Amsterdam some years ago revealed that no less than 7.3 percent of the addresses in its Municipal Personal Records Database ( gba) contain errors (Advisory Committee on Secure Information Flows 2007: 27). It is not clearwhether these errors are 'simply' mistakes, or whether they stem from fraud. Inthe latter event, it can be very difficult to set the record straight. Witness themuch-publicised case of Mr Ron Kowsoleea, a victim of identity fraud. When acriminal passed himself off as Mr Kowsoleea, the latter was flagged as an offenderin various police and other government databases. His house was raided, he wasarrested at Schiphol Airport, and he received numerous summonses to appear incourt. Despite desperate attempts to clear his name, he is still plagued by the iden-tity theft. Kafkaesque circumstances of this kind raise the issue of who is responsi-ble for the correctness of the data in a network of information flows. As regardsthe police files that caused Mr Kowsoleaa so much distress, it seems that no singleauthority bore overall responsibility. People generally seem quite blas\u00e9 about the fact that they now bear a new - often more negative - 'burden of proof' after switching to digital services, whether voluntarily or compulsorily. In addition, new information systems such as theElectronic Juvenile Dossier (ejd ) and the Reference Index of Juveniles at Risk (vir ) are by no means neutral digitization initiatives intended solely to improve the efficiency of existing policy or to improve the social safety net. They alsoinfluence the relationship between the public and professionals and encroach on25 digitizing the citizen and governmentprinciples such as the privacy and freedom of choice of both parties. At the very least, they cast such principles in a different light. The National ConstitutionalCommittee - which reviewed the Dutch Constitution in the light of globalizationand digitization (among other things) at the request of the Government - noted inits report that government is increasingly becoming an electronic governmentwhen executing public tasks (Staatscommissie Grondwet 2010: 67). And althoughthe Committee was divided on the need to amend the Constitution in the lightof ict, the tenor of its recommendations is unmistakable: there is every reason for constitutional reformers to get to work, given our changing digital society. TheCommittee argues that fundamental information rights play a more significantrole in the digital age - reason enough to bolster the normative basis of the Consti-tution and make it more relevant to citizen's lives (Staatscommissie Grondwet2010: 69). Digitization also affects the position of government. It comes to depend on systems, making it vulnerable to system malfunctions or even breakdowns,whether it is caused by viruses, cybercrime, faulty maintenance, contaminated orobsolete files, or even the ignorance of users. \"Without ict facilities, we are no longer capable of doing anything. That's how vulnerable and dependent we'vebecome,\" said Ivo Opstelten, Dutch Minister of Security and Justice, during theSecurity Conference held on 11 November 2010. But that dependence is alsoevident in another way: digital government relies heavily on the knowledge andinfluence of the external consultants, developers, and suppliers who design,implement and maintain the systems. In short, ict projects reveal new opportunities, new vulnerabilities, and new risks that determine how the information society is structured and which direction it will take. Such opportunities and risks are what this book is all about. If govern-ment organisations 'streamline' information flows and embrace 'chain computeri-sation' and information networks, what implications will this have for the basicorganising principles and accountability structures of public administration?What does digitization mean for the normative precepts that underpin howgovernment executes its tasks? Or, to put it differently: what can people expectfrom the deployment - often the result of technology push - of ict by govern- ment, and what does that mean for the way government interprets its duties andfor its administrative structure? To what extent is the public's growing digitalassertiveness putting pressure on the position and role of the public sector? Howshould we go about striking the right balance between such key values as effi-ciency, security and privacy? Before we can investigate and resolve these issues and determine the overall 'fate' of digitization, however, we must decide who precisely is responsible for digitiza- tion - and that is by no means easy. In fact, ict seems to be everyone's business26 igovernmentand no one's responsibility these days, whether we mean digitization within the boundaries of government or within society in general. This power vacuum is atodds with government's special position of authority and responsibility. After all,the public interest must be protected in the digital world too, and to do so requiresgovernment to take responsibility and to organise its activities accordingly. Thereis no escaping the dilemma that government faces: while its use of ict is intended to make people's lives pleasanter and safer, it must at the same time safeguard theirfundamental rights and freedoms, such as privacy and autonomy. 1.2 igovernment The quest to resolve this dilemma is the point of departure for this book. Digitiza-tion has brought about dramatic changes in both society and government, raising awhole series of vital questions. Many of these touch on the role and responsibilityof government. Digitization in government is not taking place in a vacuum; it is aprocess closely bound up with widespread changes in the information society. ict , which allows us to gather, share and utilise information in many different domains,is also altering the expectations and responsibilities of both government and citi-zens. The point is therefore to investigate how ict has influenced and changed the relationship between government and the people, and the practical and normativeimplications of that change. Some implications fall into the category 'accepting andadjusting to a new situation', but others necessitate modification at a more funda-mental level. The current digitization of society and government, and the unbal-anced debate about this process among politicians and policymakers, force us toanalyse and assess developments as they unfold. This is not the first time that therehas been a call for change, institutional or otherwise; indeed, in some instances - asin the Infodrome project - the appeal has come from a government-initiated pro-gramme: \"So what we must now do is consider how best to structure the informa-tion society\" (Infodrome 2001: 165; see also the many advisory reports discussed inRob 2003). Until now, however, government has not risen to the challenge ofdeveloping a political agenda for the information society. In this book, we conclude that the necessary transition can no longer be put off. Using extensive empirical analysis of government digitization projects (most ofthem Dutch), we have explored the reality of 'electronic government'. What wehave found is that the nature of government is changing dramatically under theinfluence of digitization. Government not only operates against the backdrop ofthe information society, it has itself become an information government - an iGovernment. A de facto practice has developed - virtually unnoticed - in which interrelated information flows dominate the character of government. Theseinformation flows therefore also determine how government and citizens operate,as well as their dependencies and vulnerabilities. In everyday life, however, theoverall idea of iGovernment is virtually the last thing driving the way politicians27 digitizing the citizen and governmentand policymakers think and work: the vast majority of government initiatives relating to digitization - the biometric passport or the Electronic Patient Dossier,for example - and the information flows they generate are debated, introduced,and evaluated in isolation. Individual initiatives are hardly ever assessed on thebasis of their impact or potential impact on government and society as a whole.There is also a failure or near-failure to view such initiatives within the context ofthe fast-expanding and rapidly diversifying information flows. iGovernment isnot yet part of the mental framework of politicians and policymakers. That isprecisely why there are no suitable accountability structures and why we lack thepolicy instruments to continue the responsible, innovative development of iGov-ernment. If government wishes to pursue digitization with confidence, it willhave to shift the perspective from eGovernment to iGovernment. In line with thischallenge, Part iii of this book proposes a policy and institutional agenda related to government's networked information management system. Although this book focuses on iGovernment and therefore deals mainly with the role and responsibilities of government when using ict in policymaking, its argu- ments must be considered within the broader setting of the information society.That setting underpins the analysis of how government utilises ict . After all, what iGovernment can and cannot do and what challenges it faces is determined, atleast in part, by the digital dynamics of society. The following section thereforebegins by considering a number of crucial trends that are influencing government,the public, their interests and the roles that each plays. 1.3 the isociety Digitization is bringing about dramatic changes in society without our being able toattribute these changes to any one particular source (Dutton 1999). The many dif-ferent factors at work are reflected in the typologies used to describe this 'new' soci-ety: e.g. the 'network society', and the 'knowledge soci-ety'. Although the emphasis varies, all of these labels refer to digitization or ict and to networks and networked relationships. The impact of ict on the relationship between government and the citizen is bound up with trends unfolding within thebroader setting of the information society (iSociety). For example, starting in thelate 1990s, the World Wide Web gradually became the first and most obvious placefor many users to search for and disseminate information, but also to create newcontent, increasingly in collaboration with others. It was precisely for this reasonthat Time magazine selected not a great politician, scientist or artist as its 'Person of the Year' in 2006, but ' you' - the group of interactive individuals who were chang- ing the shape of things through the Internet (see also Frissen 2008). Google, Facebook and Flickr are among the most influential new players that have learned to key into users' desire to search for and share information and interact28 igovernmentwith others on the Web. These forces of the new 'information economy' (Van der Laan & De Haan 2005: 13-14) have launched new, innovative digital services andare successful at converting the information collected by these services into annualprofits or, at the very least, an attractive stock market value. Thousands of systemsarchitects work behind the scenes to expand the information society, and a similararmy of consultants is helping business and government achieve their digitizationambitions. As figure 1.2 illustrates, virtually all of these targets concern the abilityto use large quantities of information in innovative ways, either in the publicinterest or for private purposes. It was already more than a decade ago that Castells(1996) described the network society as an informational capitalist economy, asopposed to the industrial capitalist economy that preceded it. These trends have naturally also affected government. The increasing capacity of ict to permit quick and easy information-sharing holds out the promise of more effective and efficient government operations. By the end of the twentiethcentury, academics and policymakers were discussing the possibility of using ict to make government more efficient, effective and client-friendly (Boersma et al.2009; Dunleavy et al. 2006; Van de Donk & Van Dael 2005). Government author-ities saw ict as the pre-eminent channel for achieving innovation. This idea quickly became known as 'electronic government' (eGovernment). It was adoptedby governments across the globe, although different countries emphasised differ-ent aspects and have arrived at different results (Lenk 2007;Dunleavy et Boersma al. 2009;Prins 2007). Figure 1.2 Information flows in iSociety Based on data provided by Cisco, Comscore, governmentIn the iSociety, digitization is used to innovate and improve processes and rela- tionships in both the public and the private sector. But the use of information andtechnology has not only intended effects, but also unintended ones. The introduc-tion of ict often has a far-reaching and unforeseen impact that has not been thought out in advance. This section considers some of the key features of theiSociety, specifically: the innovative power of ict; the social impact of ict, which changes relationships; opportunities and risks with respect to security; and thevulnerabilities inherent in digital trails. These factors taken together form much ofthe background against which iGovernment has developed and will continue todevelop. Innovating and improving: the innovative power of ict ict did not suddenly appear full blown in everyday life. Human progress has always been intimately bound up with advancement of technology. Our ability toget technology to work for us (whether we are talking about 'simple' tools orcomplex artificial intelligence) has always been a decisive factor in human devel-opment. Our wish to control the world around us, combined with our enormous trust in technology as a tool for doing so, often leads us to regard ict as the ulti- mate solution to all kinds of social and societal problems. Indeed, we expect tech- nology to be used in this way (De Haan 2004). For example, when our security isat stake, we respond with security cameras, biometric access controls, and high-tech defensive weapons. When the issue is efficiency, we migrate services to theWeb so that assistance is available 24 hours a day, and rig up databases in a waythat makes it easy to collect, combine and then share data. Businesses were the first to recognise the potential of ict (De Haan et al. 2005). Influenced by trends in the private sect or and the promise of greater effectiveness and efficiency, government too began to experiment with digitization in the 1990s. The transition to electronic government was presented as not only desir-able but also unavoidable: \"A robust society with a healthy economy requiresstrong government that uses the most advanced 'tools' available to do its work\"(Ministerie van bzk 1998: 3). Efforts to transform government into electronic government converged with two trends that came to dominate the thinking aboutgovernment and the public sector in the late 1980s (Bekkers & Zouridis 1999;Fountain 2001). To begin with, the financial strains of the rapidly expandingwelfare state led to public administration increasingly being regarded as a 'busi- ness' (Noordegraaf et al. 1995). In this 'New Public Management' approach, publicmanagers, operational tools, efficiency and service delivery all play a major role inpublic administration. Secondly, there was a shift in focus: instead of governmentbeing viewed as a coordinator, organiser and facilitator, it increasingly came to beseen as an active party (Bekkers & Homburg 2009). In the early days of eGovern-ment, the primary aim was to lower the threshold to government, improve thequality of its service delivery, and increase the efficiency of its internal processes30 igovernment(Ministerie van bzk 1998; Ministerie van Economische Zaken 1999). Very quickly, however, trendsetters - such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the United States, but also the Netherlands - took things a st ep further by investing in an integrated back office intended to support not only more efficient but also proactive servicedelivery. The title of the United Nations' eGovernment Survey 2008, From EGovernment to Connected Governance (2009), illustrates this trend. The report claims that \"[a] key element of connected governance is the ict -enabled ability to respond instantaneously with information from across several government agencies, multiplying manifold the government's ability to respond to crisis\"(United Nations 2009: 8). In other words, better service delivery initially meant more efficient service deliv- ery, in keeping with the New Public Management approach. Government was toact as a producer of services for its citizens to consume (Fountain 2001) and wouldmeasure its progress by means of quantitative targets: a specified percentage of allservices had to be provided by electronic means (Bekkers 2001). That is why in theearly days of eGovernment, policymakers and policy documents referred mainlyto services delivered by government tocitizens. But the rise of social networking and the growing significance of the iSociety are shifting the focus of governmenttoward public participation and co-creation. Citizens are not just consumers; theycan be producers, too. Online participation: the social impact of ict The Internet has become routine in the Netherlands. Statistics Netherlands reportsthat almost 12 million people (out of a population of 16.5 million) make regular useof the Internet ( cbs 2009a). The Dutch are at the top of the eurankings in both computer ownership and Internet access. In 2009, 93 per cent of the Dutch popu-lation had a home computer, and almost eight out of ten people had an Internetconnection at home ( cbs 2009a). The digital divide between users and non-users has shifted from access to skills. Skills - which can be broken down into technical,formal, strategic and information skills (Van Deursen & Van Dijk 2010) - are espe-cially relevant when consumers also become producers. The shift from consumption to production is typical of 'Web 2.0', in which indi- viduals use various Internet tools and mobile media to collaborate or 'co-create'content. People maintain social networks, share their expertise and ideas, or worktogether on projects (for example Wikipedia, the online encyclopaedia) withoutany of this being centrally organised or controlled. Because popular Web 2.0 appli-cations such as LinkedIn and interactive games do not require extra software to beinstalled (the Internet serves as their platform), the new services and applicationshave a very low threshold and are accessible for large numbers of users. It was thearrival of interactive features that made the 'social Web' possible, and online socialnetworks are growing increasingly popular - witness the fact that one in four31 digitizing the citizen and governmentpeople who surf the Internet has a Facebook account and has visited that account at some point in the past month (Facebook 2010). Right now, more than 500million people are on Facebook. The Dutch counterpart, Hyves, is also popular,with 10.2 million accounts in June 2010 (Hyves 2010). The more popular social networking sites such as Hyves and Facebook become, the more people are induced to use them. In effect, their popularity dictates thetechnology that both veterans and novices will end up using (Mulder 2006: 115).After all, it only makes sense to create a pr ofile on Hyves or Facebook if there are others there to interact with. Change has never come about simply because a newtechnology became available (Van der Laan & De Haan 2005: 13). Designers,companies and producers can create as many elegant applications as they please,but it is users who decide whether their product is useful and convenient and whowill make or break it. The popularity of the Internet is indisputable, but some subtle distinctions should be made when it comes to the 'social Web'. Not everyone who surfs the Web isactive on it to the same extent. One third of Internet users limit themselves toreading blogs, watching videos on YouTube, or visiting websites such asWikipedia (Frissen et al. 2008). About ten per cent of Internet users provide feed-back, for example by commenting on online news items or writing book reviewsfor Amazon.com. Another ten per cent share information, such as photographs onFlickr or music on MySpace. But only three per cent of Internet users actuallycreate content themselves, for example by blogging or writing Wikipedia articles(Frissen et al. 2008). There are also people who deliberately choose not to be users, either because they lack the time or inclination, do not trust the relevant applica-tion, or simply do not find it useful (Van Dijk 2007; Van den Berg 2008; Wyatt2005). Another distinction is related to the idea that the Web is an open forum which everyone can join (Zittrain 2008; Anderson & Wolff 2010). There is now a move-ment away from the open Web toward various semi-restricted platforms such asFacebook and LinkedIn. Instead of searching the entire Web, users simply gostraight to a trusted, familiar website. The rise of mobile devices such as smart-phones, iPhones and iPads has encouraged this search strategy: their use of iconsmakes it very easy to consult a specified source straightaway. The feature thatmakes these platforms so appealing to users - the ease with which they can shareinformation and interact with others - is also why the companies that foundedthem are so successful. Restricted systems are simply easier to control than unre-stricted ones, and that makes them a more reliable investment (Zittrain 2008).Information from users and about users is the raw material of their business. Theirability to collect, enhance, exploit and also sell large quantities of informationallows for personalised advertising and services (Lips et al. 2005).32 igovernmentDigital relationships: ict causes shifts in positions The rise of Web 2.0 and the associated influence of the 'crowd' are also affecting what government does (Frissen et al. 2008). Various government departments andagencies want to harness the potential of citizen engagement, sometimes referredto as e-participation. Because the Web makes communication and co-creationpossible, government can potentially do much more than merely inform its citi-zens. The Web also allows for reciprocity between mobilisation, encouragement,creativity and engagement (Bekkers & Thaens 2002; Bekkers & Meijer 2010). Forgovernment, the Web may be the key to identifying a new role appropriate to the\"fragmentation of society resulting from the ongoing process of differentiation,specialisation and professionalisation\" (Bekkers & Meijer 2010: 9). The search fornew ways to communicate with the public is one response to the 'gap thinking'that has increasingly come to dominate the discourse about legiti-macy (see and 'the citizen' - said to be indicated by a distrust of politics, lowvoter turnout figures, and dissatisfaction with politicians - raises questions aboutgovernment's legitimacy in tackling the challenges facing society. ict is regarded as an ideal means of turning the tide, with e-participation strengthening the legiti-macy of politicians and policymakers. Although the Netherlands ranks among the top five in the world when it comes to eGovernment and shares fifteenth place with France with respect to e-participa-tion (United Nations 2010), it could do more. There is room for improvement inthe way government shares information (for example by publishing policy docu-ments), consults citizens (for example about legislation), and allows them toparticipate in decision-making (United Nations 2010). Another possibility - as yet unexplored - is for government to forge a new kind of relationship with its citizens, one in which politicians and policymakers do not simply take decisionsbased on a popular mandate, but allow discerning individuals to participatedirectly in policymaking and decision-making processes. The opportunities that ict holds out for more public participation and co-creation can also be problematical for government, however. Changes in the roles and posi- tions of various parties are forcing the public authorities to consider theirresponse. The Internet makes it possible for citizens to supervise government andact as a 'countervailing power' in the public arena (Meijer 2004). For example, avanguard of Web-savvy citizens - in the Netherlands clustered into groups withnames such as The New Way of Voting, Bits of Freedom, PrivacyFirst, nln et, and Internet Society - are lobbying for transparent government. This new generationwants to harness the power of the Web, for example to check on how their electedrepresentatives vote on issues. And if government does not provide the trans-parency they are seeking, they will organise themselves into groups that will and33 digitizing the citizen and governmentset up websites such as 'watstemtmijnraad.nl',1which reveals how municipal councillors vote. Besides groups working to foster digital maturity in government, there are other organisations such as Burgerlink ('Citizen Link') that point out thenegative implications of the digital imperative. These organisations want to guar-antee the public's freedom of choice by keeping other - more traditional - channelsof communication with government open alongside the rapidly advancing digitalones. The Netherlands is not the only country in which a growing number of organisa- tions are demanding more critical reflection on the scope and implications ofdigitization for society and, in particular, for government. Indeed, a quick surveyof other countries, for example Germany or the United States, reveals much live-lier and more critical public debate of this issue. Those encouraging such debatein the Netherlands do not in fact receive much public support. That is partlybecause the Dutch trust the way their government uses ict. A survey by the Scientific Council for Government Policy (wrr ), conducted in cooperation with the ecp-epn Platform for the Information Society and Centerdata research insti- tute, reveals that the Dutch public places a great deal of trust in the way in whichthe public authorities use ict and deal with information. For example, respon- dents allow government (crime investigation services, the Tax and CustomsAdministration) much more leeway to use data than business and industry(Attema & De Nood 2010: 2). More than 60 per cent favour digital records ingeneral, and almost 80 per cent support the use of digital records in healthcare.Only ten per cent of respondents are specifically against digital records (Attema& De Nood 2010: 3). The Dutch attitude contrasts starkly with that in Germany, where citizens have gone to court over the eu obligation to retain communications traffic data and sent masses of angry e-mails to the European Ombudsman after reports surfaced of anew surveillance system, Enfopol. In the United States, private organisations (forexample epic and the Electronic Frontier Foundation) and individuals have also pressured public authorities to be more transparent. One recent example relates tothe acta negotiations, a controversial plan to combat Internet piracy. The public's concerns have not fallen on deaf ears, as illustrated by the federal Open Govern-ment 2initiative announced by President Barack Obama almost immediately after his inauguration. Open Data projects are also being launched in the United King-dom. 3In Europe, transparency is regarded as a requirement for participatory democracy in an information society an d as a prerequisite for legitimate action on the part of government (European Commission 2001). In keeping with this idea,the documents produced by the European Institutions are made available onlineand European citizens are encouraged to participate in legislative processes. Lorand Britz (2007) argue that freedom of access is vital to facilitating citizen partici-pation in a world in which information plays such a crucial role. Freedom of access34 igovernmentto information is sometimes referred to as the 'right to information', and its influ- ence can be seen in countless laws, both national and international (see Singh2007; Horsley 2007). Government in the Netherlands is also - albeit with somereluctance - allowing citizens to be more closely involved in policymaking. Thereis, for example, an initiative encouraging public consultation about legislation onthe Internet. 4 Digital trails: the paradox of security and vulnerability As people exchange and share more and more information electronically, theyleave more and longer digital trails. The fact that information flows are becomingan increasingly important factor in what businesses and the authorities do alsohas implications for the behaviour of individuals and the digital trails they leavebehind. Surveillance, data mining, and profiling are modern technical applicationsthat use digital trails to track people and trends and to investigate high-risk (orpotentially high-risk) situations or people (House of Lords 2009).

The claim that technology and information can improve the effectiveness and effi- ciency of government is not limited to the realm of service delivery. ict is also increasingly being advocated and deployed in connection with public safety andsecurity issues. The terrorist attacks in New York, Madrid and London have aggra-vated fears and spurred politicians to put national security and counter-terrorismat the top of the national and international political agenda (Lyon 2003; Edwards& Meyer 2008). Many of the key weapons of counter-terrorism have been madepossible by new technology, for example biometrics, data analysis, and informa-tion storage and sharing. New organisations have been set up to take charge ofimplementation, or existing intelligence agencies merged with respect to theirinformation resources. Whereas the United States decided on an institutionalapproach by setting up the Department of Homeland Security, Europe opted tohave its various intelligence services share as much information as possible(M\u00fcller-Wille 2008). In addition to these more systematic responses to the threatof terrorism, various incidents have led to a range of ad hoc security measures. For example, after mi 5 uncovered plans to carry out terrorist attacks with liquid bombs in 2006 and a Nigerian man (dubbed the 'underwear bomber') attemptedto blow up a plane en route from Amsterdam to Detroit on 25 December 2009,unsealed containers of liquid were banned from all carry-on luggage and totalbody scans were introduced at Schiphol Airport (Van Eeten 2011). Paradoxically,technical innovation gives both terrorists and politicians tools for action, albeitwith diametrically opposed intentions. Information is a key weapon in international security efforts, leading in the past decade to a boom in data mining, profiling and electronic databases (Lyon 2003;Advisory Committee on Secure Information Flows 2007; M\u00fcller-Wille 2008;Balzacq 2008). The clever deployment of information and technology is consid-ered a key factor in a successful security policy, not only on a global level, butcloser to home as well - indeed, even inside the home. There are a whole battery of applications - camera surveillance, face recognition software on public transport,metal detectors in clubs and bars, biometric fingerprints in passports, the Elec-tronic Juvenile Dossier, the Reference Index for Juveniles at Risk - and many ofthem have met with public approval. A report by the Netherlands Institute forSocial Research ( scp ) in 2004 showed that more than 85 per cent of Dutch people approved of the use of security cameras, and close to 100 per cent agreed that dna research should be applied more broadly to help identify criminals. A more recentstudy by the Rathenau Institute, ecp.nl and the Dutch Consumers' Association (Rathenau Institute et al. 2007) reveals that the Dutch support the use of digitalpersonal details by crime investigation agencies. More than half (56 per cent) are infavour of retaining digitized copies of passport photographs for crime investiga-36 igovernmenttion purposes (26% are against, and 18% are undecided). Even more recently, a similar survey question relating to fingerprinting produced an even higherapproval rating: 66 per cent were for, twenty per cent against and fourteen percent undecided (Van 't Hof et al. 2010: 93). But, also apart from counter-terrorism and crime control, security and safety are popular public and political issues in modern Western society, for example in suchareas as healthcare, traffic management and environmental protection. Surveysshow that safety - or more specifically, the lack of it - rank among the public's topconcerns (cbs 2009b), and that government's involvement in issues related to safety - physical safety, social safety nets and international security - has gradu-ally increased, resulting in expanding budgets, a growing regulatory burden, andmounting implementation and coordination problems ( wrr 2008b). Government increasingly sees it as its task to actively promote safety by avoiding risk andtaking action in such areas as youth care (Potters &De Vreeze 2010). Frissen (2009) observes that government's intervention in suchareas as public order and safety, youth care, child-rearing, and integration revealsan underlying ideology of the 'makeable society' (a Dutch version of social engi-neering), expressed in a unique combination of prevention and repression. Interms of its aims, scope and pretensions, policy is becoming more 'total' and all-encompassing (see also Van Gunsteren 2004). 5 Technology is used to manage and control risk and to avoid damage and injury inthe longer term. Beck (1992) has argued that the more a society can harness tech-nology to avoid risk, the less its members are willing to accept that things cansometimes go wrong - a phenomenon that he terms the 'risk society'. The need forcontrol and safety - including social safety nets - has increased in part becausehierarchical structures are giving way to network structures. That need is relatedto processes of decentralisation and privatisation in which responsibilities aredivided between numerous organisations and institutions. In an effort to manageand control risk, modern society has become enthralled by the 'safety' philosophy.Boutellier (2004: 44) refers to a 'safety utopia', the \"... unattainable pursuit of anoptimum link between vitality and safety. The risk society has produced its ownutopia, i.e. the union of two opposing needs: the need for freedom and the needfor safety.\" The desire to unite these two needs is confirmed, time and again, byunforeseen events and how the media and politicians respond to them (Van Eeten2011). Technology, and ict in particular, not only makes enforcement and control possi- ble, however - it also facilitates new types of crime and introduces entirely new vulnerabilities into society. Cybercrime, phishing, credit-card fraud, identitytheft: these are all crimes that first arose with the arrival of digitization. The uk's37 digitizing the citizen and governmentCrime Prevention 'digitization of crime' ( scp 2004: 475). Govcert (2010), the government organisation that monitors Internet security in the Netherlands, reports in its 2009 Annual Review that cybercrime is growingrapidly. One important reason is that people are now using the Internet for allkinds of everyday transactions (ordering supplies, paying bills), making cyber-crime more and more lucrative. The report Verkenning Cybercrime in Nederland 2009 (Foresight Study of Cyber Crime in the Netherlands 2009) considers five different types of cybercrime (hacking, e-fraud, cyber extortion, child pornogra-phy, and hate-mongering) and concludes that cybercrime is 'the people's crime'.Although the media, fiction and even policy documents attribute cybercrime tohigh-tech, organised criminals, a review of 665 police files reveals that, in fact,many of the crimes are 'petty' ones committed by more or less small-time suspectswho operate on their own (Leukfeldt et al. 2010). And it is not only individualswho are increasingly vulnerable to cybercrime. The aivd - the Netherlands' intel- ligence agency - warns that government itself is increasingly the victim of digitalcrime and espionage (2010a; 2010b). Some of the experts interviewed for thispublication have commented that government pays only scant attention to thisproblem and is therefore too little aware of its own vulnerability. 6 People often have themselves to blame for the new vulnerabilities. Profiles onsocial networking sites regularly provide personal details, and users are not alwaysaware of who is privy to what information (Boyd 2008). Legal and illegal software,for example spyware, can keep track of the websites a computer user visits andwhich links he or she clicks on. Private and public-sector organisations contractexperts to analyse website visitor behaviour. A great deal of the information gath-ered through the Internet is also sold, for example to facilitate personalised adver-tising and services. Users not only leave digital trails on the Internet, however.Their behaviour and actions can also be traced through their mobile phones, in-carnavigation systems, digital id cards and key cards, and even via the signals emitted by the tiny chips now found in all kinds of consumer items such as clothing(radio-frequency identification devices, rfid ) (Van Est et al. 2007; Van 't Hof et al. 2010). For example, the Netherlands' public transport chip card has been designednot only as a ticket purchase system but also to enable understanding and manage-ment of passenger flows. The card records and analyses travel data and passes thatinformation to others involved in the chip card system: the transport companies,the intermediary system Trans Link, the public authorities, and the passengersthemselves (Van 't Hof et al. 2010; Griffioen 2011). It will be clear that all of these trends and developments raise questions about privacy, safety, security and transparency. Google and Facebook regularly makeheadlines on the subject of infringements of privacy (Olsthoorn 2010). For exam-ple, the Australian police are probing Google Inc.'s Street View mapping servicefor possible breaches of data-security laws ( Trouw 2010). Facebook is under fire38 igovernmentbecause it regularly alters its privacy settings and, in doing so, automatically changes users' default settings to share more information, instead of allowingthem to manage it for themselves. Legal battles and bad press have forced theseInternet pioneers to reverse certain changes relating to privacy, but it remainsdifficult, if not impossible, for users to discover which trails they have left behindand what precisely is being done with their information. 1.4 aim Given the background of the information society described above, the aim of thisbook is to offer recommendations for a more self-aware information government(which we call iGovernment). ict and digitization in the Netherlands have cer- tainly been discussed before, but the impact of many trends identified earlier hasnow become much clearer. In 1998, for example, ict was largely \"still in its infancy\" (wrr 1998: 33). At that time, a mere eight per cent of Dutch people had a mobile phone - a percentage that was expected to increase ( wrr 1998: 20). Not only did it do so (by 2009 there were 125 mobile telephone connections per 100 inhabitants inthe Netherlands ( tno 2009)), but the enormous number of new functions and apps has fuelled the growth of mobile telephony to unanticipated levels. Today, weuse our mobile phones not just to make phone calls, but also to send and receivee-mails, to Twitter, to share files, to watch tvprogrammes, to take and share pho- tographs, to plan a journey, and to pay for parking. These earlier reports predictedfuture developments, but now young people are growing up as 'digital natives',never having experienced a world without the Web or mobile phones (Palfrey &Gasser 2008). The fact that our society is becoming progressively more digitized,and that digitization is now virtually the norm, has also affected government andchanged its situation considerably, as Part ii of this book makes clear. Anyone following the discourse about digitization today will find that two con-flicting 'moods' prevail. On the one hand, policy plans, reports and parliamentarydocuments support government's efforts and ambitions by enthusiasticallyexplaining what returns digitization can bring: a safe society in which risks aredetected in good time, and a more efficient government that delivers tailor-madeservices to its citizens and that welcomes their input. On the other hand, the debate- particularly in academic and social forums - is often quite negative. Commenta-tors worry about infringements of privacy, the millions of euros wasted on failedict projects, expectations that have not been met, new risks such as identity fraud, and insufficiently secure systems and information. Proponents and opponentsjockey for position in reports and policy documents and in national and interna-tional academic publications. Most striking is that commentators tend to size updevelopments from one particular perspective (for example: how to narrow thegap between government and citizens through interactive decision-making; howto improve safety; how to avoid the risks posed to privacy and security; and so on).39 digitizing the citizen and governmentMany of them also implicitly assume that government has a single consistent vision underpinning its digitization projects. In practice, that is not the case. Governmentdigitization projects and programmes are not the result of some 'grand design'.They are, almost by definition, an arena for public and private parties, ranging fromlocal and administrative authorities to developers, consultants, users, and the gen-eral public. Each of these influences the final result. In addition, ict applications can have unanticipated practical implications and an unexpected impact on therelationship between the various stakeholders and how they deal with responsibili-ties. In an attempt to rise above the current discourse, this book surveys the broader forces that information and technology bring to bear on the relationship betweengovernment and the citizen. The empirical analysis presented in Part ii is the result of a number of choices. Briefly, these choices mean that the book focuses on(1) information as a more important factor than technology, (2) the relationshipbetween government and the citizen, (3) an empirical analysis of the stakeholdersinvolved in information and technology, (4) the dynamics of such principles assecurity, privacy and transparency, which steer the discussion of digitization proj-ects and determine their evolution, (5) recommendations on the role and responsi-bility of government. These points are discussed briefly below, with a moredetailed explanation in Chapter 2. The first point is that this book does not concentrate on technological advances per se, but instead aims to understand information processes (Van de Donk 1997: 153). It analyses information processes whose nature, scope and impact have changed, are changing, or may change under the influence of modern technology. In otherwords, the focus is not primarily on new ict applications and technologies such as biometrics and rfid chips, but rather in the impact that they have on the processes of creating, gathering and using information. Secondly, the book focuses on the relationship between government and the citi- zen. That does not mean, however, that it ignores other relationships, for examplebetween government and developers, between businesses and consumers, orbetween various groups of citizens. These relationships are included in the analy-sis in so far as they influence and help alter the way technology and informationare used in the relationship between government and the citizen. Neither end ofthe government-citizen spectrum is uniform, of course. The labels 'citizen' and'government' are nothing more than constructs allowing us to consider how actualcitizens and actual public bodies relate to one another and to other players. In ourempirical analysis, 'government' is broken down into various government bodiesand public or semi-public organisations, and 'the citizen' assumes many differentguises (and plays many different roles): patient, insured person, juvenile, juveniledelinquent, parent, etc. 40 igovernmentThirdly, in order to fully understand how digitization processes affect the relation- ship between government and the citizen, we must first understand the dynamicrelationship between those involved in digitization. In empirical terms, thismeans looking beyond the 'paper reality' of legislation and policy documents. The'real-world' consequences of the biometric passport, the Electronic Patient Dossierand the eu 's many plans and databases are what shapes the relationship between government and the citizen. Those involved in that reality - from policymakersand politicians to consultants and developers and finally to end users - togetherset the digitization agenda and its outcome, but they are seldom themselves thesubjects of study. In the fourth place, our empirical research strategy leads us to consider how the various values vying for precedence - including, but not limited to, privacy andsecurity - are weighed up. What role do they play in development projects, andwhich parties advocate what fundamental principles, using which arguments? Anadditional factor is that new circumstances, opinions and options can alter the waypoliticians and society interpret these principles over time. Finally, this book makes recommendations for government's responsibilities with respect to the digitization of society and government itself. Technology does notdecide every issue; the authorities, developers, users, and the public also helpdetermine whether and how certain technologies come into play. The questionthen is what specific responsibilities the various parties can be expected to bear.This book focuses in particular on the role and responsibility of government in theinformation society. In the first instance, that means exploring the responsibilityof government when it makes use of ict in policy implementation. In what way does utilising ict change the responsibility of government, and how can that responsibility - in particular toward the citizen - be institutionalised? 1.5 methods and structure This book is based on a variety of sources. In addition to Dutch and internationalacademic publications, it is also based on original research, conducted along twodifferent lines. The first consisted of a long series of interviews with experts, policymakers and policy officials, all of inestimable value for the writing of thisbook. The second consisted of studies and surveys that we carried out ourselves or contracted out to others. This led to a long list of essays and empirical studiespublished in various forms (on the Web or as chapters in the edited volume De staat van informatie (The State of Information)), which provided the building blocks for this publication. The research methods applied were highly empirical, and the results of the various underlying studies are described in separate publications. This book does not report41 digitizing the citizen and governmentdirectly on these studies, but instead builds its arguments on the data they gathered and on the other sources. The empirical chapters in Part ii should therefore not be seen as case studies. Rather, they build on the material gathered in the underlyingstudies and discuss at length the insights arising from those studies. The empiricalstudies carried out especially for this book can be broken down into (a) domain stud-ies, which review trends and developments in a broader policy context, and (b)'black boxes', which concentrate on a much more specific area or a particular appli-cation. The black-box studies explore the dynamic information and technology-driven interactions between the various parties involved in developing technologi-cal applications. Many of the most crucial choices and interactions are still hiddenfrom public view and have been explored in only a few academic or other publica-tions. Mapping out the networks made up of systems developers, policymakers,institutions and users of technological applications - for example the biometricpassport, the Electronic Patient Dossier or the Reference Index for Juveniles at Risk -reveals more about the dynamic impact that such applications have on the relation-ship between government and the citizen. Because the black-box studies focused oncharting empirical trends and developments, they are relatively 'theory-lite'. Georgeand Bennet (2004: 74) would call these 'atheoretical case studies', i.e. case materialoffering sound, detailed descriptions that do not contribute to theory themselvesbut can be used as input for other meta-research or more theoretical research. In selecting the domain studies and black boxes for this book, we have attempted to cover all of the various factors and vantage points relevant to this study. We firstconsider the various roles of the citizen: passenger, patient, motorist, resident of aparticular community, etc. Government also appears in many different guises inthe empirical studies: as an initiator of new applications, a partner in public-private partnerships, a legislator and a regulator. Then there are the many differentlevels of government (international, European, national, local) and the interests,preferences and mutual relationships that operate at these levels. The applicationsand technologies explored here all play a role in generating, sharing and enhancinginformation, but from various vantage points and with different aims. ict is now part of government in every sector and at every level, and it affects many differentparties, roles and policy contexts. The preparations for this publication involved writing a number of essays on broader or more conceptual issues in the domain in question. The subjectsincluded government accountability in the information age, assessing the risksinvolved in information technology, the right to be 'forgotten' in a digitized crimi-nal law system, and system responsibility for the information society as a positivehuman rights obligation. Finally - in cooperation with the ecp-epn Platform for the Information Society and Centerdata research institute (Tilburg University) -we asked 2357 panel members to complete a questionnaire half way through 2010.Completed questionnaires were received from 1485 respondents (63%). The panel42 igovernmentis a representative sample of the Dutch population. All the underlying studies and essays were incorporated into the edited volume De staat van informatie (Broed- ers, Cuijpers & Prins 2011), published simultaneously with the Dutch version ofthis book), or on the wrr 's website. Box 1.2 gives a summary of these background studies. Box 1.2 Overview of background studies Background studies in the published volume (D. Broeders, C. Cuijpers & J.E.J. Prins available for download at www.wrr.nl/content.jsp?objectid=5657 The published volume with background studies for the report iGovernment (iOverheid ) contained pieces in three broad categories. Two studies served to elucidate key concepts of the analysis. From different angles they dealt espe- cially with the notion that government (public authority) carries a final responsibility of sorts forthe way that the information society takes shape. This responsibility cannot be taken too far,because it is both factually and normatively unwise to assign government an exceedingly dominantrole; yet at the same time it cannot be denied altogether due to the duty to protect and safeguardcertain fundamental rights, also in 'horizontal' relationships. In addition, some studies tackled themes concerning ict and government that have an overarching relevance across policy areas and sectors. These involved an essay on 'the right to be forgotten' in a digital age that seems bent on remembering, especially remembering personal facts and profiles,and an essay dealing with technological risks and the question which actors are best placed to assessand bear the consequences of these risks, bearing in mind that some risky activities are quiteworthwhile. Also included was a quantitative study on the nature of citizens' complaints aboutpublic sector ict , and the way in which organizations deal with such complaints (in terms of regis- tration and learning processes). Finally, a stud y dealt with the development of the office of cio (Chief Information Officer) across the board of Dutch national government. Lastly, there were broad studies on selected policy domains. These concerned the sometimes opaque process of digitization of the eu's borders through an (expanding) number of databases, the emergence of ict systems meant to enable preventive and proactive measures in the domain of child welfare, and finally the digitization of medical records and the shifts that it brings about inthe roles of those concerned (patients, doctors, insurers etc.). Background studies published on the web (www.wrr.nl)Studies of a more detailed and descriptive nature were published on the web. These covered a wide variety of subjects, but usually did focus on a particular ict-application. Applications covered 43 digitizing the citizen and governmentwere: the Electronic Patient Dossier (epd ), the biometric passport, the \"Safe Houses\" at municipal level, and eCall. Somewhat broader enquiries were undertaken into the way that ict affects the privacy of people travelling (road, rail), into the institutions (especially ictu ) responsible for commissioning government ict in the Netherlands, and finally (by way of a panel) into the opinion of the average citizen concerning the sharing of personal information between specified public and private bodies. This book is structured as follows. It is divided into three parts and consists of nine chapters and an afterword. Part i, Introduction and context , comprises this intro- ductory chapter and Chapter 2, which discusses various theoretical principles andconcepts that provide tools for analysing the empirical material. Part ii, Empirical analysis, devotes five chapters to charting and analysing the digitization of government in the Netherlands. The analysis mainly considers trends and devel-opments, and the roles and interactions of the most prominent parties in thedomain of digital government. Chapter 3 focuses on the political world. Chapter 4looks at the dynamic relationship between politicians and policymakers in centralgovernment and the public authorities that implement policy, both nationally andlocally. Chapter 5 shifts the perspective to the international and European arenas.Chapter 6 discusses the relationship between the public authorities and commer-cial parties, including the major new forces of the information society and thebusinesses that develop and create applications for government. Chapter 7 beginsby looking at a number of government and other institutions that supervise orcontrol the development of iGovernment in some way or another, and that play arole as a countervailing power. It then considers the public's role as a digital coun-tervailing force. Part iii, Analysis and recommendations , takes stock of the empiri- cal research. Chapter 8 advocates a paradigm shift in government's approach todigitization, arguing that the prevailing concept of eGovernment should bereplaced by that of iGovernment. Chapter 9 describes the paradigm shift in termsof policy, procedural and institutional recommendations that should make 'iGov-ernment self-awareness' inherent not only in how government acts but also inhow it is organised and how it thinks. The epilogue outlines government's broaderresponsibility in a rapidly changing iSociety. 44 igovernmentnotes 1 Which translates roughly into 'howmycouncilvotes.nl'. 2 In December 2009, the Obama Administration issued the Open Government Directive requiring federal agencies to take immediate, specific steps to support \"open government\", based on the principles of transparency, participation, andcollaboration. These steps must ensure that federal agencies always publishgovernment information (to the extent permitted by law and subject to validprivacy, confidentiality, security, or other restrictions) (www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-06.pdf). 3 The British Government has made thousands of datasets publicly available at www.data.gov.uk. Individual citizens, organisations and developers may searchthrough the datasets but also copy and recycle information. The website also has awiki for sharing information on techniques used to process the data. 4 \"The Dutch Government wishes to be transparent about the legislative process and make greater use of the public's knowledge in preparing legislation. Startingon 24 June 2009, it will therefore begin informing citizens, companies and civil-society organisations about impending legislation online.

Bart Jacobs, professor, Radboud University, June 2010.45 digitizing the citizen and government2 analytical framework: information, actors and principles Commentators have noted countless times that digitization is having an unprece- dented impact on society. The dozens of reports published on ict in recent years use adjectives such as revolutionary developments, unique opportunities, complex tensions, fundamental changes, shifting interests and obsolete social and institu- tional contexts. But why, precisely, is digitization having such an unparalleledimpact? Why should commentators refer to the related opportunities, tensions,shifts and challenges as 'fundamental', 'unique' or 'complex'? And if all that istrue, what are the consequences of digitization for the relationship betweengovernment and the citizen? If we set these qualifications to the side and examinethe features that make ict 'different' or 'new', we see that the nature of digitiza- tion is less uniform than it may at first appear. Although the term 'digitization'suggests a clear-cut, well-defined phenomenon, everyday reality teaches us that itin fact consists of a wide variety of trends and developments, technological break-throughs and specific applications. Each of these trends, breakthroughs and appli-cations is initiated and, gradually, influenced by the many different actorsinvolved, their interactions, and the foreseen and unforeseen consequences ofthose interactions. The next chapters (in Part ii) attempt to make sense of the dynamics between actors, processes and interests, with the analysis focusingspecifically on the relationship between government and citizens (individually orcollectively). Our description of empirical reality in the Netherlands will help usunderstand the impact of digitization on that relationship. Before we begin ourempirical analysis, however, this chapter offers an analytical framework. It alsodiscusses the main issues and key concepts explored in the rest of the book. As stated previously, the analysis presented in this book focuses less on individual technologies than on the role these technologies play in the relationship betweendifferent actors. In other words, it studies the 'sociotechnological complex', andexplores the interplay between technology and information from that perspective(Section 2.2). The chapter goes on to offer a descriptive and normative frameworkfor charting empirical reality. The em phasis is on practica l developments and actual shifts in the various actors' positions, authority and influence. Section 2.3defines the main actors: government, citizens and technological applications.Section 2.4 then introduces a normative framework for describing the dynamics ofempirical reality. It divides the many different, widely varying principles (e.g. effi-ciency, transparency, and freedom of choice) that turn up again and again in policyproposals and public and political debate into three clusters - driving principles,underpinning principles, and process-based principles. The dynamics betweenthese three clusters give us an important normative and analytical tool for identi-fying and explaining the empirical developments discussed in Part ii. 472.1 views on the relationship between technology and its users This book examines the impact of using ict on the relationship between govern- ment and the citizen. Anyone embarking on such an examination must first clarify precisely how the role and influence of technology are interpreted. Is technology- whether we mean a public transport chip card, biometrics, or a security camera -nothing more than a neutral tool wielded by citizens, politicians and policymak-ers? Or is it in fact an irresistible force that follows its own logic and, in doing so,also has its own separate impact? These questions touch on an academic debateabout the conceptual interpretation of technology and the factors that can beemphasised when studying technology, society, and the interaction betweenthem. Opinions expressed in the literature are by no means unanimous in thisregard. Although our analysis does not do full justice to the wide-rangingacademic debate about the nature and role of technology in society, we can basi-cally divide the views put forward in public debate and in political and administra-tive reality into three approaches. At one end of the spectrum is instrumentalism, and at the other there is technological determinism. The middle ground betweenthese two extremes consists of a dense multidisciplinary field that is moreconstructivist in its approach. Because this study focuses on the relevant actors- the citizen, government, and the 'application' - and examines the interactionbetween social and technological influences, it can immediately be identified asconstructivist. Before examining this middle ground in more detail, we will lookmore generally at the broader spectrum of viewpoints. After all, all threeapproaches are applied, more or less explicitly, in public debate. 2.1.1 from instrumentalism to technological determinism According to the principles of instrumentalism , technology is a neutral and valu- able tool that can be used in many different ways. Technological applications arethe neutral bearers of their designers' ideas and aims. Social change takes placeautonomously and drives technology forward. In this view, technology offers anexcellent solution to all kinds of problems; it is a multifunctional instrument(Kaplan 2009: xvi). As a result, politicians are quick to turn to technology to solveproblems, including societal ones (see also Van den Berg et al. 2008). That is not tosay that instrumentalists are convinced that technology will lead to good resultsevery time. If the outcome is disappointing, it is the users who are to blame, andnot the technology (Van de Donk & Depla 1993). That is because technology isregarded as value-free, a mere 'instrument' in the hands of those who can use iteither for good or evil. Although the notion of technology as a neutral instrumenthas lost popularity in academic circles in recent decades, it is often still very muchalive in government, according to recent reports by the Netherlands Court ofAudit (Netherlands Court of Audit 2007; Edge 1995; MacKenzie 1999a: 43).48 igovernmentBox 2.1 Citizen Service Number ( bsn ): neutral instrument or force that follows its own logic? During the Dutch Parliament's discussion of the bill introducing the Citizen Service Number (bsn ), the Minister responsible stressed that this unique personal number was nothing more than an information number, suggesting that its consequences and impact would be neutral. TheConfederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers ( vno-ncw ) agreed with this view unequivocally, stating: \"Our overall comment is that the bsn does not pose a risk in itself. It is a neutral number. Any data-sharing that is prohibited without the bsn will also be prohibited with the bsn \" (Position of vno-ncw in bsn discussion with the Data Protection Authority, 30 January 2006). However, various parliamentary parties in both the House of Representatives and theSenate noted that the bsn facilitated the 'increasing informational power of government' (Tweede Kamer 2005-2006c: 1). Concern was also expressed that the bsn would lead to both public and private-sector organisations changing their working methods and information requirements(Eerste Kamer 2007-2008). Since then, various cases have shown that the bsn is clearly more than just a neutral tool; it is developing into an appealing policy vehicle. Some examples: a bill is nowbeing prepared to allow the bsn to be used in the financial sector (Eerste Kamer 2009-2010f); there was a heated discussion in mid-2010 between the Data Protection Authority, the Ministry of Infra-structure and the Environment about displaying the bsn on the Civil Service Smartcard ( Rijkspas) (cbp 2010a); and the Ministry of Economic Affairs is investigating whether the bsn can be used for electronic authentication ('eRecognition') by companies and self-employed people who makeuse of digital service delivery (Leenes, Koops & Van der Wees 2010). The State Secretary at theMinistry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations stated in late August 2010 that she did not see anyreason to draft an overarching evaluation framework for the use (or wider use) of the bsn (Eerste Kamer 2009-2010f). At that point, more than two years had passed since Parliament had asked theGovernment to indicate a feasible evaluation framework (Eerste Kamer 2007-2008). Technological determinism is based on the assumption that technology plays a crucial role in shaping society. Technology is depicted as an irresistible force that follows its own logic and has a major impact on the way work, the economy, andsociety as a whole are organised (Williams & Edge 1996: 55). As far back as 1996,Frissen concluded that the instrumentalist view of technology so prevalent in themodern pursuit of control had become almost untenable considering itsautonomous power (Frissen 1996: 344). More recently, Socialist Party mp Ronald van Raak made the following comment at general parliamentary consultations onthe national database of biometric features. 49 analytical framework: information, actors and principles\"The tools will determine the morality. Imagine that such a database exists. A terrible crime is committed. The police naturally want to solve it. And if the option is available to them ... Createthe database and you create a use for it. It is obvious that the database will be used for all kinds ofother purposes in future. I'm sure the State Secretary is well aware of that\" (Tweede Kamer 2010-2011a: 15). There are various gradations of technological determinism. In the most extreme case, technology is reason enough for behaviour to change, and even for wholesocieties to be transformed (Chandler 1996). In the milder variety, technology isstill the most decisive factor, but not the only one (MacKenzie 1999b). Technologi-cal determinism, furthermore, can take both an optimistic and a pessimistic viewof technology. The optimists believe that everything technologically possible willcome to pass and will benefit society (Van den Berg 2009: 42). The pessimistsagree that everything technologically possible will come to pass, but they believethat society will be 'overwhelmed' and 'suffer a loss of autonomy and solidarity'.They fear a world driven by technological rationalism, with little regard for thehuman dimension (Ellul 1954; Ellul 1977; Anders 1980). As noted above, this book takes up a position in the middle ground between instru- mentalism and technological determinism. A wide-ranging group of researcherscan be found in this middle ground; although they represent different intellectualtraditions, they agree on the need to open 'the black box of technology' (MacKenzie& Wajcman 1985; Bijker & Law 1992; Williams & 1996: 54). Partly as a reac-tion to technological determinism and instrumentalism, a new, interactive view oftechnology emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, based on the assumption that technol-ogy and society influence each other (Fuglsang 2001). Proponents of this idea studytechnology and technological concepts in relation to social reality, and not as a sepa-rate domain (Kaplan 2009), and regard technology as both a cause and an effect ofsocietal change (Williams & Edge 1996: 55). This constructivist view focuses in par- ticular on the development process of specific technological applications and therole that the relevant actors play in that process. The main idea is that the form thata technological application ultimately takes is the result of various choices. A tech-nological artefact does not simply appear out of nowhere; it is the outcome of exist-ing social, economic and technological relationships (Bijker & Law 1992). In addi-tion to the social constructivist view of technology, the focus has also shifted to theworkings of technology itself. Once a technology has come to play an establishedrole in society, it is difficult to change it. People have invested in a certain configura- tion and use the application in a certain way, making it part of a network of practicesand institutions. In that sense, technology 'determines' social evolution (Bijker2001: 28-29), but that does not mean that 'mature' sociotechnological systems areentirely inflexible; it simply implies that it takes much more effort to change them.50 igovernment2.1.2 the sociotechnological complex as a subject of research This study is based on the idea that social relationships mould technology and that technology simultaneously influences social relationships. It takes this idea as itspoint of departure because the aim is to examine the consequences of using ict for the relationship between government and the citizen, examining ict as part of a dynamic convergence of multiple processes, interests and actors. In keeping withthe constructivist view, we will refer to this complex network of institutions andtechnological applications as the sociotechnological system. Part ii of this book looks more closely at the impact of using ict on the relationship between govern- ment and citizens by reviewing the sociotechnological systems associated withapplications such as the Reference Index for Juveniles at Risk, the biometric pass-port, eCall, and the national Electronic Patient Dossier. The empirical analysis inPart ii focuses on three points. The first of these is the role of the actors . The way in which technological applica- tions are developed and used clearly depends on the interests, ability to influence,views, knowledge and skills, expectations, values, and perceptions of the relevantactors (developers, policymakers, users and non-users), as well as on the technicalpossibilities and impossibilities (Stirling 2008). This also includes the balance ofpower. Which actors are capable of controlling the development of a technology,and which are not? The occasional battle over the way an application should bedesigned and used is not fought on a level playing field. Indeed, there are differentlevels of influence and power at play in the interactions between institutions,cultures and systems (Mansell & Silverstone 1996: 213). For example, the end usersof a technology may not have a say in its devel opment, and th e behaviour of actors that have no direct stake in the technology may still be affected by it. Chapter 3points out the gap between the policymakers who order an application to be devel-oped and implemented and the professionals in the field who actually end upworking with it but have had no say in its development. The second point in the analysis is time . Hughes (1994), for example, emphasises that organisations, groups and individuals exert a huge influence in the develop-ment phase of a technology. As time passes, however, and as an applicationbecomes embedded in society, the system's complexity increases and the technol-ogy becomes harder to control; it acquires its own momentum. Once a technologyhas been developed and delivers certain services, and once time and money havebeen spent on it, it becomes difficult to make fundamental changes (Hughes1994). In fact, technology develops in three stages. In the first, there is a great dealof 'interpretive flexibility', the application is still 'open', and various interpreta-tions and choices are still possible. Designers, clients, the authorities, consultants,researchers and the intended users all have their own ideas about how the techno-logical application ought to work. Pinch and Bijker (1984: 414) refer to 'relevant51 analytical framework: information, actors and principlessocial groups' that influence the development process, either in an organised way or ad hoc. Keymolen & Prins (2011), for example, show in their study of the Refer-ence Index for Juveniles at Risk ( vir) that early on, system developers and consultants at the local level had a fair amount of influence on the system's infor-mation design. In the next stage, when the application assumes its final form, it isat least in part a reflection of the relationships, convictions and interests of theactors involved in its design and implementation (Woolgar 1996: 87-88). In thefinal stage, the application moves into a broader social and political context andmay in its turn influence social relationships. Or, as Johnson and Wetmore put it(2009: xiii): \"Once created, sociotechnical systems can sometimes seem to take on a power of their own. They facilitate and constrain certain actions and thereby facilitate and constrain certain values. In otherwords, the intertwining of society and technology is not neutral; it is value laden.\" The final point is the level of analysis . In the first instance, we look at how a specific technology develops and who is involved in its devel opment. In addition, Part ii also takes macro-level trends - for example economic interests, interna- tional law, globalization and the demand for security - into account, not in the least because these trends and developments influence the actors, their interests,and the context in which a technology takes shape. Mapping out both theprocesses involved in a specific technology and the wider social changes affectingthese processes produces a multi-layered picture of the role ict plays in the rela- tionship between government and the citizen. 2.2 technology and information Of the dual concepts technology and information, this study focuses primarily onthe latter, and more specifically on the way in which various actors influence andchange how information is used. The 'informational' side of ict cannot be viewed separately from technology, of course. For example, the use of biometrics in pass-ports has shown that technology determines the sort of information that is or canbe collected. Technology also facilitates certain information flows or dictates whohas access to information. It is the software that allows an Electronic PatientDossier (epd ) managed by an individual care provider to be accessed by other care providers. But we can only study precisely how a certain technology allows infor-mation to be gathered, used and shared by looking at specific applications andconnections. In this book, then, the emphasis is not on biometrics or networktechnology (the technology), but on the biometric passport and the digital dossier(the application). ict then stands for all technological applications used to gather, store, process, enhance and share information. 52 igovernment2.2.1 from data to information to knowledge A close examination of the 'information' component of our pair of concepts reveals that it comes in many different guises, depending on what stage ofprocessing it is in. First, data is gathered and recorded electronically. Data as suchis meaningless. It has not yet been filtered, interpreted or processed. It does,however, represent a fact. A distinction is sometimes made between 'raw data' and'data' - in other words, data that has not been arranged in any way versus data thathas been arranged to some extent. This report uses the two terms synonymously.Data becomes information when we select only the data relevant within a certaincontext and for a certain group of users. In other words, information emergeswhen we arrange and link up data within a system and for a particular purpose,policy-related or otherwise. Or, as Liebenhau and Backhouse (1990) put it: \"Infor-mation is data arranged in a meaningful way for some perceived purpose\" (inCanhoto & Backhouse 2008: 48). It is therefore not evident that gathering moredata automatically produces more information. Indeed, an excess of data can resultin 'noise', making it difficult to distil information from it. Finally, interlinking and applying various information components gives rise to knowledge. Knowl-edge mainly becomes valuable when it is used for and gives rise to action (Van derLubbe 2002). Society today is often depicted as an information society (Castells 1996) or knowl- edge society ( wrr 2002). Traditionally, property, labour and money were the most important means of production; in recent decades, however, informationand knowledge have become the new 'capital'. ict now makes it possible to collect, store, process and share data on an unprecedented scale (Mayer-Sch\u00f6n-berger 2009). It is important, however, to remember that information has alwayshad economic and social value. No society can survive without ensuring, in oneway or another, that information - and knowledge - are shared and passed on(Porter 1995: 45). Whether in the form of oral tradition, symbols, printing, film orict, mankind has filtered, retained and handed down information throughout history. Information gathering has always been a key factor in statehood, forexample. It also had an emancipatory function. By giving every citoyen an identity, Napoleon allowed the masses to free themselves from aristocratic hegemony. Itwas, however, the rise of the bureaucratic state that also led, inevitably, to thecollection, classification and storage of information on citizens. Scott (1998)observes that a state attempts to make society 'legible' by gathering information.Individual citizens are registered as taxpayers, conscripts, employees and so on(see also Caplan & Torpey 2001: 1). That information and 'legibility' are crucial tothe state's power to govern society. Authors such as Weber and Foucault regardedbureaucracy as a highly rational system of information gathering and administra-tive control. Torpey (1998) also pointed out that the state's ability to 'penetrate'social processes depends on its capacity to 'embrace' society: \"As states grow53 analytical framework: information, actors and principleslarger and more administratively adept they can only penetrate society effectively if they embrace society first. Individuals who remain beyond the embrace of thestate necessarily represent a limit on its penetration\" (Torpey 1998: 244). Thetendency of governments to gather as much data as possible - Sheptycki (2007)refers to their 'compulsive data demand' - is strong and does not appear to beweakening in today's information society. 2.2.2 it's all about access, control and knowledge The importance of information as such is not, however, what makes our currentinformation and knowledge society what it is. Rather, the interplay between tech-nology and information has two notable features, which are highlighted in thisstudy: (1) the way in which information is or is not made accessible, and (2) theway in which information is selected and converted into knowledge. To begin with, it appears that the extent to which and the way in which informa- tion is or is not made accessible is becoming a defining factor. Indeed, ict is a powerful tool both because it provides access to new or existing information andbecause it can manage and control such access (Dutton 1999: 11-12). The impor-tance of access and, consequently, of information-sharing becomes clear in thecase of the Reference Index for Juveniles at Risk ( vir ). The primary aim of this project, which is intended to prevent the tragedies of child abuse and neglect, is toimprove information-sharing between youth care organisations, in particularthose that do not usually communicate with one another. Whereas informationused to be shared only among friends and acquaintances, ict now also makes it possible for people who do not know each other to communicate and interact -and in fact it is used particularly for such communication (Porter 1995: 46). Impor-tant factors in this regard are (1) linked data, (2) the ability to quickly and easilycopy data, and (3) the persistence of data (Van den Berg & Leenes 2010). Individuals and organisations are disclosing and sharing more and more informa- tion about themselves and others, and the digitization of that information makes itmuch easier to disseminate and interlink it in both the public and private domains.Information also migrates easily from one context to another, blurring the distinc-tion between the public and private realms. For example, information generatedby the public transport chip card can be accessed by several dozens of parties inboth the public and private sectors. One vital issue related to accessibility is control. Who controls access to informa- tion? Control and access cannot be considered separately from the technologicalapplication or the medium that carries the information. For example, the Internetmakes it possible to disseminate and share information with an infinite number ofpeople without this being subject to much centralised control. This differs from54 igovernmentthe databases and systems of the Netherlands' Tax and Customs Administration or General Intelligence and Security Service, to which access is strictly controlled.Fleck (1993) distinguishes between technologies set up as 'systems' and those thatconstitute 'configurations'. A system is a restricted network in which coordinationbetween the components is strictly defined, making centralised monitoring andcontrol possible. Systems retain their form and meaning in varying contexts. Aconfiguration, on the other hand, is an open network consisting of variousbranches and applications, making centralised monitoring and control more prob-lematic. Users play a much larger role in defining how a configuration functionsthan they do in a system. No single actor can be said to manage information flowsin society. Some argue that mass access to pc s and the Internet is giving users more control over their own information (Gilder 1994; Dutton 1999; Frissen 2008;Leadbeater 2007); others claim that ict advances are creating a new elite of 'cyber- crats' or 'numerati' (Ronfeldt 1992; Baker 2008). And experience teaches us thatinformation is not always available, or available to everyone - as illustrated by agovernment initiative to 'blacklist' certain Web pages in cooperation with Internetservice providers. The blacklisted pages are blocked and therefore cannot beaccessed by the public. 1 But there is more at stake than access to information and access control . The great- est challenge today is not to collect more data - that happens 'automatically', as itwere - but to use the masses of data to glean relevant information and, ultimately, knowledge with a particular purpose aim in mind (Hildebrandt & Gutwirth 2008: 1). In addition to access and control, the second significant feature of theinformation and knowledge society is the way in which information is convertedinto knowledge. That challenge applies equally to deciding which data will or will not be converted into information . In short, the issue is not information as such or how much of it we have, but its relevance and our ability to distil knowledge fromit. In order to cope with the overwhelming amount of data available, we continueto optimise our information selection processes, and that often involves digitiza-tion. The best-known example of this is the search engine Google, which uses analgorithm to classify websites according to the user's search terms and then quicklyopens a link to the Web page with the 'right' answer. The use of algorithms tosearch for notable patterns or correlations in data is known as data mining (Custers2004). Data mining produces correlations that indicate a relationship between different data without necessarily divulging the causality of that relationship(Hildebrandt 2008: 18). Another well-known data-mining application is the serviceoffered by the online bookstore Amazon.com: \"Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought ...\" Data mining leads to profiles (a collection of correlated data)- a process known as profiling (see Canhoto & Backhouse 2008). Information onconsumers' online purchases, the behaviour of young people, or the spendingpatterns of benefits recipients can be categorised and used statistically to predicttheir future behaviour. Profiling also takes place along two axes: the individual'spast behaviour (purchasing history, pattern of illness, etc.) and past mass behav-55 analytical framework: information, actors and principlesiour. The correlations represent the likelihood that past patterns will repeat them- selves in the future (Hildebrandt 2008: 18; Raab 2009). Profiles are not only usedin the commercial sector; government also uses profiling in various policy areas(taxes, social insurance, youth healthcare, surveillance and enforcement). 'Citizenprofiles' make it possible for government to take a more individual approach, tofocus on target groups, and to reduce the administrative burden imposed on citi-zens or eliminate the need to 'bother' them (Van der Hof et al. 2009). Box 2.2 Risk profiles One example of a fully automated risk analysis based on risk profiles can be found in the new approach to monitoring legal entities (Tweede Kamer 2008-2009f). The current system of preventive monitoring is to be replaced by permanently automated monitoring based on riskanalyses. The new system will also make use of data on individuals, for example the children andgrandchildren of company directors. The risk analysis is based on risk profiles and risk indicatorsestablished at regular intervals by the Ministry of Justice. Each risk profile consists of a set of riskindicators (indicating the risk of abuse) or characteristics that, when taken together, may indicatea form of abuse. The involvement of family members (children and grandchildren) in the legalentity is an example of a risk indicator. The data included in the analysis is taken from the Tax andCustoms Administration, the Land Registry, the Trade Register, the Municipal Personal RecordsDatabase, police files, and the records of organisations responsible for implementing employees'insurance schemes. The greater the number of risk indicators that are flagged in a particular case,the higher the legal entity's risk score. Every change in the legal entity's 'life course' is subject toautomatic analysis based on the risk profiles. According to the explanatory notes to the bill, such'life course changes' run to several hundred thousand a year. Monitoring of a legal entity may bestepped up depending on its risk score. The risk reports are distributed entirely automatically tovarious enforcement officials designated as such by an Order in Council. It is not necessary toinform individuals that their data is being used in a risk report. The Government's wish to be proactive is boosting the popularity of profiling in the public sector, but it sometimes goes further than merely identifying and cate-gorising people. It aims to use the knowledge thus generated to anticipate futuredevelopments. Profiling technologies not only help predict the obligations, rightsand requirements of specific individuals at the earliest possible stage, but also helpto manage, guide and regulate them in good time. For example, the police nowwork with Prokid, a tool for tracking under-twelves who have been connected insome way or another with a criminal offence (including those who have onlywitnessed a crime). Prokid assesses risk based on two sources of information. Firstof all, it uses behavioural indicators thought or known to lead to criminal activity.Secondly, it considers data on other people in the under-twelve's household andassesses whether they indicate a higher risk of criminal or problem behaviour inthe juvenile. Based on these two data sources (the child and his or her living envi-56 igovernmentronment), Prokid then assigns the child to a risk category. The tool makes early detection of the risk of criminal or problem behaviour in children possible(Keymolen & Prins 2011). Box 2.3 False positive and false negative risks at the airport There are two types of error that can arise when using risk profiles or new technologies such as biometrics; each with very different repercussions. A case in point is the biometric passportsrecently introduced in the Netherlands. At passport control, an airline passenger's fingerprint willbe compared with the fingerprint stored in the passport to determine whether they match. Besides correct findings (e.g. the passenger's fingerprint is the same as the fingerprint in the pass- port), the comparison can also produce a false negative outcome (the passenger's fingerprint does not match the fingerprint in the passport, although it is in fact the same person) or a false positive outcome (the passenger's fingerprint matches the fingerprint in the passport, although it is not the same person). The first error leads to frustration for the traveller, extra checks into his or heridentity, and - in many cases - a missed flight. The second allows people to enter the country whoshould never have been admitted. The ultimate fear is that irregular migrants, criminals, or eventerrorists will be allowed in. The technology used at airports, however (such as biometric access systems), allows the officials responsible to simply 'set' the margin of error, and that is precisely what they do. Fingerprintrecognition can, for example, be set at 99 per cent certainty, or at 80 per cent. The first meansstricter surveillance and long lines at passport control, but it reduces the risk of a false negativeoutcome (admitting people who do not match their biometric passport) to almost zero. The secondkeeps lines moving at the airport but increases that risk. The security services will usually argue infavour of the first option, whereas commercial and economic interests - including the state - favourthe second. Trade-offs between the two are possible . In that sense, false positive and false negative errors are communicating vessels to some extent. Growing awareness that the challenge is not simply to gather large quantities of information but to trace relevant information and generate new knowledge has led to another item being placed on the agenda: information about information, i.e.metadata. Because technology makes it possible to collect and interlink more andmore data, there is a rising demand for technology to help trace data, make itpermanently accessible, and structure it. Metadata (data that says something abouta specific set of documents or a chunk of information) plays a key role both inmaking data permanently accessible and in structuring it. Many of today's techno-logical applications are designed to automatically generate data about their activi-ties or products. A fax machine automatically adds the date to incoming andoutgoing faxes; a digital camera 'remembers' when a photograph was snapped; acamera with gps records where a photograph or film was made; and some cars57 analytical framework: information, actors and principles'remember' their speed at a particular time. Such data on the relevant item (fax, photograph, film or car) makes it easier to organise and retrieve information.Metadata is also playing an increasingly important role in the relationship betweengovernment and the citizen in that it influences the power relationships of theactors involved. One significant development when it comes to searching for and finding relevant in- formation is that indexes and search functions are now being integrated into a singleinterface, allowing all the various information levels to be displayed at once. In otherwords, the old-fashioned distinction between searching in folders (card files) andsearching in files (the actual content) is becoming blurred (Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger2009: 77). At the same time, new tools are making it possible to use metadata toregulate access. For example, it is now possible to use the metadata for a file (a book,article, film, piece of music, etc.) to define who has access to the relevant informa-tion and to what extent (read-only or editable). There have now been calls to regulate the ownership and use of metadata, based on the growing awareness that\"metadata, concentrating the sea of data to make it comprehensible, also can act asa bottleneck on information access and is an instrument of market power\" (Cukier2010: 10). 2.3 focus on the actors The previous two sections outline the overall approach of this study. Basing theanalysis on the sociotechnological system means that it will focus on the interplaybetween the various actors involved. It is this interplay that ultimately shapes thedynamics between information and technology. The actors were identified bymeans of empirical research into specific applications and a study of the literature,which took the form of domain studies focusing on the broader policy area. Theempirical research, the literature study, and interviews conducted with profes-sionals working in the field of ' ict and government' constitute the building blocks for the strategic agenda set out in this book. The aim is to identify general patternsand insights by analysing various applications. The most prominent actors consid-ered here are the citizen, government and the application. They are naturally notthe only categories that influence the development, implementation and impact ofict. Business, industry and interest groups often play an important role as well, but this study considers them only when they affect the interactions between thethree main actors, which are introduced in more detail below. 2.3.1 the actors The labels 'citizen' and 'government' are useful abstractions. They are constructsthat allow us to consider how actual citizens or actual public authorities relate toone another and to others. In fact, the 'citizen' consists of many different citizens58 igovernmentand 'government' of many different public authorities whose interests and prefer- ences may in fact conflict - although 'government' (i.e. the state) does function asa single entity in its legal and political relationship with citizens. A different levelof abstraction is needed to regard 'applications' as an actor, as one cannot ascribefree will to an application. Technology can, however, influence human behaviourthrough the design and function of an application. 2.3.2 'applications' Technology, and more specifically the technological application, is the odd man outin our trio of actors. The term 'actor' is associated with 'action', and action is oftentaken with a certain conviction or intention. The fact that applications are regardedas actors in this analysis does not mean that intention or autonomy have beenascribed to them. The main reason for regarding an application as an actor is that itspresence 'does something' in interactions. An actor is something or someone whomakes a difference in a relationship (Latour 2005). In other words, technological applications such as the epd and the biometric passport to an extent shape the relationship between citizens and government. Their presence or absence makes adifference. In order to understand why actions take place and how citizens and public authorities interact, our analysis should also consider the items that makethese actions possible. We have already noted that technological applications influence the behaviour of citizens and public authorities. Applications that areembedded in society tend to take on a life of their own, making change difficult andimpeding or stimulating certain human behaviour. Technological applications alsohave both intended and unintended consequences that influence the interactionbetween actors and their modus operandi. For example, when mobile phones firstappeared in the market, text messaging was nothing more than an amusing extrafeature. It unexpectedly became so popular that it has not only become a significantcommunication channel (certainly for young people), but has also had an impact inall kinds of other areas, for example the evolution of language. It is clear from the way people deal with computers, televisions, telephones and other technology that applications also possess agency - the capacity to act - ineveryday life. Psychologists have found that people apply the same rules in theirinteractions with computers and tvs that they apply in interpersonal interactions (Reeves & Nass 1996). This is sometimes referred to as the casa paradigm, for Computers Are Social Actors (Nass et al. 1994; Nass et al. 1995). It is, once again,not necessary to ascribe intention or autonomy to computers. Computers do nothave emotions, but they can evoke an emotional response in their users, leadingthem in turn to believe that their interactions with technological applicationsinvolve an emotional investment (Nusselder 2007: 9). The fact that people treatcomputers like social actors encourages designers to add features such as speechtechnology and feedback information to some applications in an attempt to live up59 analytical framework: information, actors and principlesto these expectations (Klein 2003). They also deliberately design expert systems to take over the user's capacity to act. Examples are the automatic pilot function inaircraft, which takes over various controls from the human pilot, and the auto-matic car brake system, activated when the car ahead abruptly reduces speed. ict can also structure and even control the relationship between government and citi-zens. Bovens and Zouridis (2002) have noted that the 'street-level bureaucrat' isbecoming a 'screen-level bureaucrat'. Professionals are witnessing the decline oftheir discretionary power owing to the menus and decision matrices programmedinto the software they use (see also Meijer 2009; Lyon 2009). It is the applicationthat now decides what information is relevant and correct, and it is the managersor bureaucratic officials who decide what application is to be used. In this 'infoc-racy' (Zuurmond 1994), what professionals do - and what they perceive - increas-ingly depends on the applications they work with. Some local reference indexesfor juveniles at risk are designed to \"include young people 'automatically' if theintake flags them as requiring assistance based on certain criteria\" (Holla et al.2008: 13). In short, it is no longer the doctor, youth social worker or other profes-sional who decides whether the system is marking a child as at risk. It is also not always possible for users to check the accuracy of an application's output. The computer produces ready-made figures, statistics and alerts, and theuser simply has to trust the information it delivers. Van den Hoven (1998)describes these applications as 'artificial authorities'. Users depend, for the mostpart unilaterally, on the information that they produce. Neither users nor profes-sionals are mere hapless victims of ict, however. They seek out workable solutions within or outside the system, thereby guaranteeing that humans remain in control(Van den Akker & Kuiper 2008). 2.3.3 'citizens' It should come as no surprise that the definition of 'citizen' can be broken downinto many different individuals or groups of individuals. Within the context ofthis book and its subject, this breakdown takes place along two axes: the relation-ship between citizens and information technology and the relationship betweengovernment and citizens. People differ considerably from one another when it comes to their relationship with information technology. They have different levels of knowledge, differentskills, different attitudes, and different needs and requirements. Although ict has become an indispensable part of everyday life, Dutch people have taken it onboard at different speeds, and not everyone has plunged into digital life with thesame abandon. Alongside those who have embraced ict with enthusiasm, there are others who deliberately refuse to join in (Wyatt 2003; Van Dijk 2007; Van denBerg 2009) or who cannot keep up with the lightning-fast changes, especially the60 igovernmentelderly, people with limited education, low-income groups, and some ethnic minorities ( cbs 2009a; Van Dijk 2007). It is often impossible to predict what will and will not prove popular - a process known as the 'domestication of technology'(Frissen 2004). That process - described by Silverstone and Hirsch (1992) as \"ataming of the wild and a cultivation of the tame\" (quoted in Oudshoorn & Pinch2003: 14) - changes both the user and the technology. ict can also have a major impact on the roles that citizens play and may fulfil various needs and require-ments. The political activist, the patient suffering a rare illness, the expat whowants to stay in touch with family back home, or someone who simply wants tobe part of a social network are all living increasingly digital lives. The public authorities and citizens are also increasingly interacting in digital envi- ronments, the latter in the role of client, taxpayer, patient, campaigner for publicorder and safety, and voter. The positions and interests involved in these roles mayconflict: a patient wants good healthcare and in that role probably supports theepd , but the same patient may have also joined a support group website that lobbies for policy reform. As a politically engaged citizen, he or she may also bequite concerned about the privacy issues related to the epd . Different people may have conflicting interests, certainly when it comes to the meta-role that technol-ogy plays in everyday life and government policy. Some are not worried about theinformation that the authorities gather about them, whereas others are fanatical intheir support or opposition. Still others simply do not give it a second thought.Recent research shows that public opinion is becoming increasingly divided aboutthe use of information. Respondents to the survey carried out by wrr, ecp-epn and Centerdata have very specific ideas about who should be permitted to usewhat digital data and for what purpose (Attema & De Nood 2010: 2). They alsowant something in return for supporting such initiatives: more opportunity toinspect and correct data. For example, more than 80 per cent believe that profes-sionals in the youth social work and healthcare sectors should be allowed toreview digital data, but 70 per cent also think that parents or patients should beable to consult and review such data, and be told who else has access to or receivedthe information (Attema & De Nood 2010: 2). In terms of the information itself, the information society gives people both more and less leeway to present themselves in different guises. Sites devoted to socialnetworking (Facebook) and professional networking (LinkedIn) enable membersto present themselves to the world - or, in any event, to a smaller digital circle ofacquaintances - as they wish to be seen. At the same time, the individual who putsthat information on the Internet rapidly loses control of it (Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger2009). Information can turn up in contexts entirely different from what wasintended, with everything that implies, and because the Internet is a network, thatinformation is disseminated rapidly. How an individual is perceived and whatinformation becomes available about him or her therefore depends only partly on61 analytical framework: information, actors and principlesthat person's own behaviour. Both businesses and the public authorities take a profound interest in the public in its many guises, both individually and collec-tively (Baker 2008; Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger 2009). Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger (2009: 104)reports that there are usproviders of marketing information that offer more than a thousand individual data points for each of the millions of Americans in theirdatabases. Increasingly, public authorities and businesses are approaching 'citi-zens' and 'clients' on the basis of their digital personas, as stored in various data-bases (Baker 2008). Special software makes it possible to search for patterns in themasses of stored data, allowing for profiling and data mining, the two best-knownexamples. According to Clarke (1988), surveillance is therefore increasingly turn-ing into 'dataveillance': businesses and the authorities no longer monitor peopleby observing them directly, but by collecting and analysing existing informationon them and their behaviour. Haggerty and Ericson (2000: 613) refers to 'data-doubles', or electronic profiles - often compiled from a combination of data frag-ments about a particular person - which are eventually used independently andcome to lead a life of their own. Clarke (1994) refers to the 'digital persona' andSolove (2004) to 'digital persons'. This particular data strategy has significantimplications for people: their digital identity increasingly consists of decontextu-alized information that is virtually impossible to erase from the digital memory of'the Net' and the data gatherers who make use of it (Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger 2009;Prins 2009; Buruma 2011). Box 2.4 Citizens do not object to being 'traceable' on the Internet The police do more than just walk the beat; they also patrol the Internet. They investigate social networking sites like Facebook for clues that they can use in their investigations. The tax authori-ties also search the Internet for relevant data on taxpayers. Dutch citizens who took part in theecp-epn/wrr survey gave both the police and the Tax and Customs Administration a lot of leeway to use 'public' data on the Internet (i.e. data that can be accessed without a password orsome other security code). Eighty per cent of the respondents felt that the police should be able totrace data on the Internet. Almost 60 per cent believed that Tax and Customs should be allowed tosearch for public data on the Internet. Fifty per cent thought that the police should also be givenaccess to secure or restricted data for investigation purposes. Almost 40 per cent said that Tax andCustoms should be permitted access to Internet data that is restricted or secured (Attema & DeNood 2010). 2.3.4 'government' Government can also be broken down into many different subdivisions. Although 'government' is basically a single entity (nicely summarised in the Dutch Consti-tution, which defines the Netherlands as a decentralised unitary state), in every-day life it plays many different roles. It is active in different areas (politics, policy,62 igovernmentmanagement and implementation) and operates through many different organisa- tions (Tax and Customs, the police, and so on). It also breaks down into differententities in its relationship with the citizen. That is not really surprising: anyonewho has dealings with the police sees a different side of government than in theirtransactions with Tax and Customs or their local council. And yet all of theserepresent the 'government' side of the government-citizen relationship and helpdefine the political meaning of 'citizenship'. Like the citizen, government can bedefined along two axes: the relationship between government and ict, and the relationship between government and citizens. ict is also changing government, or rather, the various public authorities. Govern- ment information, communication and service delivery are rapidly being digitized, changing not only the public face of government but also many of its internalprocesses. In the same way that the ' ict revolution' has affected the public, it has also influenced and continues to influence the public authorities in different waysand at different speeds. It has caused dramatic changes in information manage-ment and work processes (Dunleavy et al. 2006), but it is doing more than merelyspeeding up and streamlining Weberian bureaucracy. It is also transforming theway the authorities interact with other actors, both within and outside govern-ment. The interaction between government and citizens changes when a desk oran office becomes an Internet page, or when a passport becomes a fingerprint scan.What starts out as an updated version of the same - the way the first cars resem-bled carriages, but with engines - eventually takes on a life of its own. Recentdecades have already seen the nature of government evolve in a direction compati-ble with the possibilities of ict. Institutional differentiation, Europeanization, internationalization, and the liberalisation and privatisation operations of the1990s have turned the Netherlands into a 'regulatory state', say Dijstelbloem andHoltslag (2010: 15), in a reference to Majone: alongside the traditional decen-tralised layers, 'government' has spread itself out across a multiplicity of govern-ment and quasi-government institutions. It has therefore increasingly turned intoa network government, a deve lopment that is consistent with and closely tied in to the network potential of ict. The way in which government uses ict and digital networks depend largely on the nature of the relationship between the citizen and government. From thevantage point of government, that relationship can be broken down into threecategories of tasks: service, care and control. These are naturally very broad cate-gories 2that can be differentiated analytically, but tend to overlap considerably in reality. There are various reasons for this. eGovernment (as out-lined in Chapter 1)initially evolved from the drive to improve government service delivery andmake it more efficient. More recently, however, ict has also become popular in the general care sector (e.g. welfare, healthcare or youth care) and in the controland enforcement sector (e.g. the police, immigration and counter-terrorism). 63 analytical framework: information, actors and principlesBox 2.5 Conceptual confusion: chain or network? Researchers frequently refer to networks, whereas official government documents in the Nether- lands use the terms do so even when the term 'network' would seem to be more appropriate, considering the applica-tion being discussed. In supply chain management, organisations and actors work together to solve a problem or reach a certain goal. The links in the chain are not imposed from the top down by an overall authority;instead, they are driven by the needs and requirements of the various organisations for oneanother's product or information (Grijpink 2005). The supply chain is a linear process in whichorganisations work outside their own boundaries to achieve a common result (Borst 2009). Thesequence of actors in the supply chain is determined by the problem that needs to be solved or bythe product or service that must be delivered. Each actor is needed for the supply chain to workproperly. In addition to supply chains, organisations in both the public and private sectors are increasingly connected to other organisations in networks. The term 'network' refers to a relatively open associ-ation in which various 'nodes' are linked to other nodes through multiple, transverse and oftenredundant connections. Information moves from node to node along these connections (Barney2004). Unlike supply chains, networks offer various alternative paths to information-sharing.Information can move in one direction, in different directions simultaneously, in reciprocal direc-tions, and along multiple branches. Connections can also be strong or weak, single or multiple. Thedynamic, flexible and adaptive nature of a network makes it difficult to coordinate and control(Castells 1996). Although on paper every information flow in government is regulated - informa-tion does not 'flow freely' but along pre-determined routes defined by law - and the term 'supplychain' is therefore a good description, things often turn out different in everyday life, and theactual dynamics are closer to a network. By referring to supply chains instead of networks in suchcases, government is not properly acknowledging the complexity of the information flows. In addition, government is also investigating the emancipating effects of ict in the service, care and control sectors: digital service delivery must become more 'citizen-centric' (Citizen Service Card, Citizen Service Number), ict should liberate patients and allow them to live independent lives for as long as possible(Keizer 2011), and the police are calling on the public to use their mobile phones to help with their surveillance and enforcement work. The analysis in Part ii shows that innovations in digital service delivery are also providing new ways to observe and control citizens. In other words: without bureaucracy, no Big Brother - but also no welfare state. Some of these innovationsillustrate that the boundary between service, care and control is becoming increas-ingly blurred, and the Netherlands is not alone in that respect (Lips, Taylor &64 igovernmentOrgan 2009). When filing cabinets are converted overnight into digital databases that can be interlinked and allow for remote, rapidly executed searches, new formsof collaboration become possible. That is true for digital service delivery, digitalcare and digital control. According to Lyon (2007: 3), government surveillance ofcitizens always takes place somewhere on the continuum between care andcontrol. Various authors point out that bureaucratic record-keeping can be both aninstrument of control and an instrument of distributive justice (see e.g. Lyon 1994;Marx 2001; Gilliom 2001). But there are other reasons why it may be difficult tomake a sharp distinction between control, service and care. Whereas Foucault(1977) referred to the 'disciplinary society', which emphasises disciplinary institu-tions such as prison and school, his philosophical 'heirs' such as Deleuze (2002)refer to the 'society of control', in which control has become a permanent processdisassociated from physical location and, as a result, from institutions. It isprecisely this change that can lead to shifts in the boundaries between the variousroles of government in its everyday relationship with citizens (service provider,controller, carer), causing categories such as service, care and control to overlap. 2.4 three groups of principles: an analytical tool In discussions on the development of various applications - such as the ElectronicPatient Dossier, the biometric passport, and the public transport chip card - therelevant actors put forward all kinds of different evaluation criteria, includingsecurity, transparency, and freedom of choice. They do so for various reasons: tosupport a digitization proposal, to limit or extend its impact, or to promote soundprocedures for the normal use of an application. In this book, we refer to suchcriteria as 'principles' and analyse them as such. These are the principles againstwhich developments in ict are measured, both in this analysis and by actors in the field. Throughout the development process, actors advocate a range of principles.The form an application ultimately takes - not the technology alone, but also itssocial (administrative, legal) context and impact - is the outcome of a strugglebetween the ideas and normative positions brought into play, many of themconflicting ones. Our empirical analysis would get bogged down in detail andcontradictions if it examined every principle in turn. That is why this book exam-ines three clusters of principles, which are more relevant to our analysis than the individual principles themselves. This tripartite division distinguishes betweendriving, underpinning and process-based principles. It helps clarify what are oftencomplex arguments about criteria by dividing the most relevant principles intothree categories, which then provide a basis for our analysis. What everyday expe-rience has in any event made absolutely clear is that the effective use of ict in the relationship between government and citizen requires choices to be made. Afterall, it is ultimately impossible to do justice to all of the principles that come intoplay, as important as each one may be. 65 analytical framework: information, actors and principlesFigure 2.1 Diagram of tripartite division of principles Driving principles are those related to government's drive to utilise ict in all kinds of domains. The driving principles focus on improvement and quality gains. We will look in detail at two principles that are frequently raised in the course ofdiscussion: security , and the ostensibly interlinked principles of effectiveness and efficiency. Underpinning principles have to do with guaranteeing rights and free-doms, charting 'silent losses' as the process of digitization unfolds, and protectingthe autonomy of the individual. They constitute a counterbalance to the drivingprinciples and rein in their power. Privacy and freedom of choice are two impor- tant underpinning principles analysed here. In order to arrive at a well-balancedapplication or sound decision relating to the use of ict, principles need to be compared and contrasted. Process-based principles provide the procedural frame-work that makes a balanced comparison between driving and underpinning prin-ciples possible. The process of balancing these principles must be open and verifi-able. This study therefore considers the process-based principles of transparency and accountability . It is important to note that these six principles do nothing more than opera-tionalise the categories of the tripartite division. While they all play a prominentrole in the dynamics of government's use of ict, they do not offer us an exhaustive picture. They do provide a very realistic illustration, however, of how driving,underpinning, and process-based principles are compared and contrasted, makingthe analysis less abstract. There are naturally other normative concepts that play arole in the thinking about ict and government, for example accessibility, legiti- macy, legal certainty and equality. It is impossible to compile an exhaustive list ofindividual principles or to offer the ultimate description of them, if only becausethe information society is in a state of permanent evolution. 66 igovernmentCategorising principles in this way shifts the emphasis to the process of balancing different - and dissimilar - normative principles adopted by the Government and Parliament (among others) when a new technology is introduced. Each time,assorted, and often opposing principles - for example privacy, transparency, andsecurity - must be compared, contrasted, and balanced. Comparison is not basedon individual criteria, in any case. After all, an analysis that looks solely at thedriving principles - with everything boiling down to the gains that ict will or will not produce - can all too easily disregard the softer values (Nussbaum 2000) thatmay be at stake, or the process-based, democratic nature of the innovation(Shrader-Frechette 1992: 131). This study therefore focuses less on the individualprinciples themselves and much more on their normative character and how theyinfluence the debate about ict . In other words, our analysis looks at what the prin- ciples do (how they influence developments and discussions), and not at what they are (as concepts and in terms of content). Part ii analyses how these princi- ples are interpreted in practical terms, within various policy contexts. Comparingdissimilar principles requires a different approach to that used by such bodies asthe Netherlands Court of Audit, which assesses ict projects in terms of efficiency and lawfulness or the Office of the National Ombudsman, which applies variousadequacy criteria when analysing government performance. The approach takenhere also differs from the normative criteria that researchers have proposed for ict use, for example Franken's General principles for proper ict use (Franken 1993) and Bovens' Information rights (Bovens 2003). Comparing dissimilar principles is a different type of exercise to satisfying a relatively exacting list of criteria. The following sections discuss driving, underpinning and process-based princi- ples in turn. We begin by describing the nature of each of the three categories andits function. Secondly, we briefly consider specific principles in each of the threecategories, allowing us to raise various points about the process of comparing andcontrasting driving, underpinning and process-based principles before moving onto the empirical analysis in Part ii. 2.4.1 driving principles Electronic government is undeniably dynamic. ict drives government's ambition to create new opportunities for policy. At the same time, some of government'saims - to improve service delivery and security - dovetail seamlessly with the newopportunities offered by ict. And this is not happening in the Netherlands alone: many Western nations are pursuing a client-friendly, proactive, efficient eGovern-ment that uses every electronic tool available to optimise security and servicedelivery. They are meeting with little resistance in that regard. After all, who isgoing to oppose better quality and more effective government? In practical terms,driving principles are self-evident. 67 analytical framework: information, actors and principlesTechnological advances, for example in the area of security, and the promise that ict will improve effectiveness and efficiency demand that government reap the benefits of such innovations. The pressure to utilise technology is enormous, andnot without good reason. Among politicians and policymakers, the progressive,dynamic nature of ict is almost its own motivation. ict brings success within reach, and any further justification is virtually unnecessary, thanks to the promisetechnology holds out for the future and the optimistic view of it described earlier.The apparent ease with which technological solutions are accepted also means,however, that the driving principles are taken for granted in discussions and havetherefore hardly been crystallised in any real sense. Because no one evidentlyopposes more effectiveness and efficiency or improved security, very few ques-tions are raised about these principles. Their dominance in public and policydebates means that they often overshadow other interests. Driving principles aretherefore certainly not endangered in everyday life. Indeed, the biggest difficultylies in conducting a credible, broad, normative assessment that encompasses otherprinciples as well. Effectiveness and efficiency We have already said that driving principles are often left out of any normativeanalysis but in fact attract a great deal of attention in everyday practice. One goodillustration of this is how the terms 'effectiveness and efficiency' are used indiscussions about applications. Effectiveness can be defined as the ability to meetpre-determined targets. Efficiency is often defined as the attainment of a specifiedtarget using the fewest possible resources. An improvement in efficiency impliesachieving 'the same' (the pre-determined target) with 'less' (time, effort and/ormoney). Even though effectiveness and efficiency stand for two different things,they are often mentioned in the same breath when it comes to government servicedelivery. ict's ability to serve both purposes hides any contradictions, for example the fact that efficient policy can be highly ineffective. The problem with embracing effectiveness and efficiency mainly in the rhetorical sense by regarding them as an automatic and permanent feature of ict initiatives becomes apparent when such initiatives are evaluated. Because we lack a good defi-nition of what effectiveness and efficiency entail and how they are to be measured,it becomes difficult to determine whether targets have been attained. Evaluation is- or in any event should be - a vital component of the learning (high-tech) govern-ment. In policy discourse, however, effectiveness and efficiency are often put for-ward or assumed as 'knock-out arguments': merely claiming that something iseffective and efficient is seemingly enough. There is often no real validation of theclaims made within the context of eGovernment, as we will see in Part ii. Effectiveness and efficiency have always been hugely important in government,but they have come to play an increasingly important role thanks to the influence68 igovernmentof ict. This is because performance indicators, forceful action, and forms of 'management by objectives' have gained leverage in both the private and public domains. For example, the political discussion about the epd focuses on the number of patients whose lives will be saved (Pluut 2010) and the success of theReference Index for Juveniles at Risk ( vir ) is measured by the number of risk reports (Keymolen & Prins 2011). The New Public Management philosophyfocuses on such objectives as customer-friendliness, getting results, and workingefficiently, propagating the idea that government should be reformed in accor-dance with the efficiency model. Although that idea has now been qualified, effec-tiveness and efficiency are still prominent items on the public management agenda(De Groot 2010). The policy documents and reports on eGovernment that have been published in recent years show that improvements in the effectiveness and efficiency ofgovernment performance were the most important drivers behind the eGovernment (Snellen 2005: is dangerous to summarise the metamorphosis that ict has wrought in government organisations with the 'more with less' mantra because thatignores the fact that ict has also changed government itself. ict-driven govern- ment is not - or not only - more efficient government: it is fundamentally different government. Security Although it differs from effectiveness and efficiency, security is also a drivingprinciple. Security has become a dominant policy objective nowadays. Like effec-tiveness and efficiency, it is beyond question - security is, after all, one of thestate's raisons d'\u00eatre - but it is also a highly dynamic, transformative principle. Not only has the threat of international terrorism focused political attention onthe principle of security, but the nature of our 'domestic' need for security has alsochanged dramatically. Government is increasingly expected to identify andmanage risk, preferably before it develops into an actual threat (Beck 1992; Boutel-lier 2003; wrr 2008b). This pattern of expectations requires government to switch from reactive to proactive, from repressive to preventive, from criminallaw to a comprehensive 'governance of security' (Johnston & Shearing 2003;Schinkel 2009). ict is playing a huge role in this transition. We already know that there is a connection between ict and the rise of the 'society of control'. Information tech- nology has specific implications when it comes to recording the behaviour and actions of citizens: observation has become more intensive, all-encompassing andinvasive. Digitally recorded images and data are also available for a much longerperiod of time than personal observations (by police officers, social services inves-tigators, etc.). This chapter has already raised the point that digitization offers new69 analytical framework: information, actors and principlesopportunities to access, share, and enhance information. In terms of detection, public order and crime control, therefore, ict has a range of advantages. Security has been the driver behind many trends and innovations in ict and government. Although these innovations have not led to a 'Big Brother' scenario,the fact that Big Brother is referred to regularly in publications and debates showsthat policy initiatives taken in the interests of security tend to be quite expansive.That tendency to expand is also evident in other forms of control not strictlydictated by security policy. The increased priority given to law enforcement andthe assessment of lawfulness, for example with respect to the public funds spenton social insurance schemes ('checking behind your front door'), is an exponent ofthe same drive for control, a drive that has been greatly facilitated by ict. One good illustration is Automatic Number Plate Recognition ( anpr ). This camera technique is used by the police to enforce public order and investigate crime, but itis also used by the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment to monitorwaste transport, by the Transport and Water Management Inspectorate to checkon transport by taxi and whether taxi drivers are taking proper breaks, by rws (Rijkswaterstaat , the executive arm of the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Envi- ronment) to control traffic flows, and by the Tax and Customs Administration tocheck up on various taxes (Tweede Kamer 2009-2010j). The expansive nature of control manifests itself in many contexts as 'function creep'. The network-like nature of information technology makes it exceptionallytempting to add control functions to all kinds of systems that are basically intendedfor other purposes, or to link systems to other systems that have a control function.For example, during a debate in the Dutch Senate relating to a bill to introduce an'alcohol lock' in cars, questions were raised about the relationship between the sys-tem for registering drunk drivers (by the Central Office for Motor Vehicle DriverTesting and the Centre for Vehicle Technology) on the one hand and the ElectronicPatient Dossier on the other: \"Does the Government foresee an eventual link to theElectronic Patient Dossier, owing to the potential relationship between alcoholconsumption, the use of medication, and a person's ability to drive?\" (Eerste Kamer2009-2010d: 4). The technical possibilities pave the way for function creep. 2.4.2 underpinning principles Personal freedom and the limits to that freedom under a democratic system ofgovernment have long been a topic of debate in classical liberal-democratic philos-ophy. The freedom to be oneself, to be different to others, and to be so openly andin public view - within the boundaries of the law - is closely bound up with thevery concept of citizenship (Van Gunsteren 2009: 42). The collective and individ-ual core of freedom upon which government must not encroach is made up ofunderpinning principles such as freedom of expression, the freedom of the press,70 igovernmentand the right of assembly - but also freedom of choice and privacy. These under- pinning principles provide a counterbalance to the techno-optimism and, often,overwhelming influence of the driving principles that accompany the introduc-tion of technological applications in government. This book considers freedom ofchoice and privacy, precisely because the arrival of ict has made the scope of these two principles a crucial topic of discussion. As we already noted with respect to the driving principles, it is vital that govern- ment is given leeway to exploit the opportunities offered by ict. 3At the same time, however, the public must be protected against ict's undesirable implica- tions. Such protection can take different forms. For example, underpinning prin-ciples can be invoked to set absolute limits, in order to block the introduction orparticular use of an application. Government could, for example, decide that facialrecognition technology must be kept out of private hands (businesses and thepublic) because its widespread use could be socially disruptive. Underpinningprinciples can also set limits to the connections between certain systems. Thequestion raised in the Senate about a link between the epd and records on drunk drivers serves as a good illustration. In his reply, the Minister for Health said:\"A link between the two systems will not be provided for\" (Eerste Kamer 2009-2010e: 12). Although he did not say it in so many words, the Minister's reasonswere based in part on the principles of privacy law. In such situations, the underpinning principles are only discussed - if at all - in relation to specific technological applications. In everyday practice, they areapplied in specific, real-life situations. And in legal cases, principles such as free-dom of choice and privacy are often nothing more than 'weighty interests' - inter-ests that, even if genuinely at stake, may not necessarily be the deciding factor (seeDworkin 1977). Underpinning principles are generally not all-or-nothing conceptsin public and political debate; rather, they function as guideposts for discussion. Freedom of choice Anyone exploring the concept of freedom of choice (or autonomy) will concludethat this underpinning principle is omnipresent in the law - but at the same timeimpossible to pinpoint. Omnipresent because the age-old (liberal) principle that\"everything that the law does not forbid is permitted\" still serves as an importantsource of inspiration for our legal systems. And it is elusive because the conceptdoes not offer individuals watertight guidelines for their actions. Nowhere in thelaw does it state precisely what 'freedom of choice' - a concept so important topersonal development and to the democratic system of government (the 'free citi-zen') - actually consists of, or what arrangements or rules apply in more specificcases. Germany is exceptional in having a constitutional right freedomof action' ( even that clar- ion call has little meaning in practical terms. 71 analytical framework: information, actors and principlesThe definition of 'freedom of choice' changes constantly, not least owing to inno- vations in ict and technological applications. With a range of new media, soft- ware and services at their fingertips, people today are faced with a bewilderingarray of choices. Political and administrative efforts to liberalise telecommunica-tions and healthcare, for example, are predicated on freedom of choice. And thecitizen profile that fits such policies best is an emancipated individual whocontributes to the good of all by going his or her own way. He or she is a criticalconsumer, thereby stimulating competition and paving the way for optimal pricesetting. In other words, choice is a crucial civic duty (Hurenkamp & Kremer 2005).This profile fits in well with the liberating potential of ict. Freedom of choice here increasingly means freedom of information, or rather, the freedom to decide onone's own actions based on a wide variety of information and information-basedservices (Lor & Britz 2007). The question is whether people in fact really desire asmuch freedom of choice as they are given (or compelled to take). Simon (1956)and, later, Schwarz (2004), claim that many people in fact do not set much store byfreedom of choice, or are not really able to make choices. Economic theory andsocial psychology have also explored the shortcomings of the 'rational choicemodel'. Because this particular view of human behaviour ignores many funda-mental factors, \"it would be better to simply accept that the rational choice theoryis not always a suitable one for understanding the world\" (Tiemeijer 2009: 328). Inother words, freedom of choice is an important but rather elusive concept. Privacy Like all other traditional fundamental rights, privacy represents an individual'space' in which government does not interfere, but this right also safeguards theconditions necessary for individual human development. The principle of privacyis firmly grounded in European constitutions. This has led, in part, to the notionthat government must also guarantee that citizens respect one another's right toprivacy (e.g. Verhey 1992; Fredman 2008), i.e. that privacy has a 'horizontal' bear-ing as well as a 'vertical' one. There is, therefore, no way around the fact thatgovernment bears final responsibility for the protection of privacy, not even in aworld in which enormous commercial 'information monopolies' (Google,Amazon) appear to call the shots and the Internet seems to be beyond regulation.In addition, constitutional rights are frequently at odds with one another in reallife, a situation aggravated by the fact that privacy is a difficult concept to define(see Blok 2002; Solove 2008). That is because in most situations, privacy is a ques-tion of weighing the various interests involved, and in many cases, individualrights end up taking a back seat to the perceived interests of the collective. It istherefore difficult to distil the core substance of the right to privacy from case law(e.g. G\u00f3mez-Arostegui 2005). The meaning of privacy is changing constantly, if only because each successive generation views it differently. For example, the new 'generation' of digital natives72 igovernment(Palfrey & Gasser 2008) seem to have different ideas about privacy (see also Boyd 2008) to the 'pre-Internet' generation. Mutual respect for privacy is a hot topicthese days, and Internet applications such as Facebook have demonstrated thataccount holders are increasingly dependent on the providers of such services toprotect their privacy. The advent of cloud computing also shows that people arecoming to depend more and more on major commercial actors of unknownwhereabouts and identity in their interactions with others and, consequently inthe exercise of their right to privacy. \"What happens to your family's photo collec-tion if it's held in the cloud and your password goes to the grave with you? Andwhat about your documents and emails - all likewise stored in the cloud on some-one else's server?\" (Naughton 2010a). The meaning of privacy has always been shaped and adapted in response to new technologies, however, and the current era is no exception. For example, Americanprivacy law has its origins in the rising popularity of photography at the end of the19th century - or rather, it developed in response to that technology, with thetabloid journalist's camera being an important reference point. In a landmark arti-cle, Warren and Brandeis (1890) argued that an individual's right to privacy mustbe protected against the unregulated and threatening phenomenon of photogra-phy - an aim that they eventually achieved. Since then, we have increasingly cometo interpret the 'space' that privacy law is designed to protect as informational.Departing from its traditional physical function (the sanctity of the home), theconcept of privacy has evolved into a more intangible right, making it much harderto define absolute limits (Floridi 2005). At the same time, there are in fact veryclear lines that can be drawn between the older physical concept of the sanctity ofthe home and the more non-physical forms of modern informational privacy.Specifically, it is the genuine human need for a certain degree of solitude (individ-ual or collective) in order to nurture, develop, and keep one's person afloat - inother words, the need to shape one's own identity. In The Human Condition (1998, p. 71), Hannah Arendt expresses the genuineness of this need as follows: \"A lifespent entirely in public, in the presence of others, becomes ... shallow. [I]t losesthe quality of rising into sight from some darker ground which must remainhidden if it not to lose its depth in a very real, non-subjective sense.\" Furtherevidence that our understanding of privacy is adapted in response to new tech-nologies can be found in the National Constitutional Committee's recommenda-tion that privacy should be dealt with separately from personal data protection inthe Constitution. According to the Committee, it was clear that \"technologicaladvances, European trends and developments and globalization have led in recentyears to a dramatic rise in the volume of personal data that is being shared andanalysed. Creating a separate right to protection of personal data would acknowl-edge that the use of such data has become much more important and that it isdesirable to provide proper protection in today's society\" (StaatscommissieGrondwet 2010: 81-82). All of the interest shown in the protection of personal73 analytical framework: information, actors and principlesdata in private relationships sometimes overshadows the traditional concern of protecting one's privacy and personal data against government (e.g. Levin &S\u00e1nchez Abril 2009). It remains a thorny question for government, which isaccountable not only for its own use of ict, but also for the way in which digital citizens deal with one another. After all, government cannot avoid bearing finalresponsibility for the way in which the information society deals with privacy (DeHert 2011). 2.4.3 process-based principles Even if it is impossible to say in advance which set of principles - driving or under-pinning - should prevail in a particular case, we can say a great deal about the qual-ity of the conditions under which the balance is struck. The process-based princi-ples - illustrated here by the principles of transparency and accountability - providea framework for greatly improving the quality of the discussion on the develop-ment of eGovernment and the associated decision-making process. They play adecisive role in preserving a proper balance between driving and underpinningprinciples, but they are also important in the preceding process, when seeking anddiscussing that balance. They also guarantee the verifiability of the process bywhich electronic government develops. Together, transparency and accountabilityensure that the comparison - often implicit - that government is obliged to makewhen introducing applications is clear, comprehensible and open to objection. Process-based principles are valuable in that they subject the discourse of both driving and underpinning principles to a reality check at the macro level, allowingrhetoric to be separated from reality in policymaking. They are also valuable at themicro level whenever a policy outcome or a specific decision by a public bodyaffects an individual citizen. If these principles are properly interpreted and laiddown in institutional arrangements and rules, they can help correct errors andbuild in the feedback mechanisms required by a learning government. Transparency Citizens require two forms of transparency: (1) the kind that allows them to scru-tinise the political and policymaking process and offer a counterbalance whennecessary, and (2) the kind that makes it possible for them to exercise their indi-vidual rights in full. Transparency is therefore the forerunner of accountability inmany respects. The first form of transparency helps citizens understand the processes behind the policy and therefore delivers more complete and more accurate information to thepublic domain. This form has made great strides under the banner of 'active opengovernment'. The Open Government Initiative in the United States is a goodexample, but there have been several similar projects in the Netherlands as well,74 igovernmentranging from Internet consultations on legislation to the tweets of politicians and policymakers. Digital access to information has many advantages and very fewdisadvantages for citizens. Not only does it allow them to keep up with what ishappening and remain politically engaged, but it also helps them act as a counter-vailing power in the political and policy arenas. The second form of transparency relates to individuals who are seeking legal redress, offering them guidance in protecting their rights. People inadvertentlycaught in the tangle of digitized government need to understand what hashappened before they can take steps to solve the problem. Owing to the specificnature of information technology, the old adage 'what you don't know can't hurtyou' does not apply in many cases; indeed, if anything, what you don't know canindeed hurt you. So a certain degree of transparency in government's internalprocesses is necessary to reinforce the lega l position of the citizen. Websites such as mijn.overheid.nl, burgerpolis.nl and mijn.belastingdienst.nl 4show that government does in fact use ict to furnish individual citizens with transparency, albeit with some reluctance. What is important, however, is the extent to whichtransparency offers individual citizens guidelines for legal protection. For exam-ple, the worrying quality of some government information (see e.g. Grijpink2006; Choenni et al. 2011) and the growing problem of identity fraud raise thequestion of who bears the burden of proof when it comes to inaccurate informa-tion, and how that person can find out about it. Another key aspect of govern-ment's growth to ict maturity is that it has so far been very concerned making citizens transparent for government, but has devoted very little attention to thecontrary (Keymolen 2007; Prins 2007). However, the push to make citizens trans-parent (for the benefit of proactive policy, etc.) is dominated mainly by drivingforces such as security, and has little to do with the process-based principle oftransparency. Accountability The concept of accountability closely resembles the verifiability that is madepossible by transparency, but adds binding consequences to the equation. In itspolitical manifestation - for example parliamentary control and ministerialresponsibility - accountability serves as an important test of government'sperformance and the way in which it has weighed up driving and underpinningprinciples. In its legal manifestation, accountability allows citizens to challengethe outcomes of eGovernment. If accountability is sufficiently provided for, citi-zens can do more than just speak up for their individual rights; the accretion ofcitizen actions produces a critical countervailing power that may help improve thequality of the relationship between government and the citizen in the digital age. In addition to these more external (public) forms of accountability, a form has also emerged within organisations, i.e. an internal form, which can be described as75 analytical framework: information, actors and principlesmanagerial accountability. This focuses mainly on control and governance (and learning processes) within organisations. ict has changed the landscape of organi- sations dramatically in this regard. For example, expert systems now streamlineand manage the work carried out by professionals, and the potential for record-keeping has increased enormously. Computerised logs make it possible to registerand store every digital interaction. The records can be used to produce manage-ment information, which is then used for actual management purposes. One goodillustration in this connection is the response of the Association of Dutch Munici-palities to the draft bill for the Reference Index for Juveniles at Risk ( vir ): \"If, based on reports in the vir , there are indications that a situation involving a juvenile is becom- ing unacceptable and those authorised to issue reports fail to take appropriate action when called upon to do so by the coordinating body, then it must be clear who is authorised in this case to takebinding decisions on the necessary arrangements and issue instructions to social workers\" ( vng 2008: 2). The importance of accountability would be difficult to overestimate in today's society. In a time when a single, overarching governance philosophy seemsdoomed to fail given the complexity of society, a process-based principle such asaccountability offers an alternative. It requires only that a relationship of controlexist between a forum and an actor, permitting those whose interests are beingrepresented in the forum to exercise some control over the actor in question. Thisemphasis on operational control demonstrates the systemic difference between the accountability mechanism and the more traditional institution of legislation.Legislation is an attempt to pin down social relationships and behaviour inadvance, whereas the nature of the 'accountability' instrument is to monitor actualperformance, the incidents as they unfold. As a result, accountability \"now cropsup everywhere performing all manner of analytical and rhetorical tasks and carry-ing most of the major burdens of democratic 'governance' \" (Mulgan 2000: 555). 2.5 weighing up the pros and cons A balanced development of iGovernment requires each of the 'clusters' of princi-ples - driving, underpinning and process-based - to be given its due in decision-making. They must be weighed up against one another, although that does notmean that each of them should be regarded as equally important in every situa-tion. But because these clusters are generally at odds, one must also bear in mindthat each one, and each principle, is relative. Every principle is in danger of beingovervalued or undervalued. We look generally at the dangers of such 'excesses'below. In short, it is not possible to indicate in advance what a 'good' comparisonof principles involves in relation to ict, or what effect it will have. When this76 igovernmentstudy refers to a 'balance', then, it is not implying that that balance can be prescribed outside of the relevant context. There is nevertheless a great deal thatcan be said about such comparisons, for example that those carried out by politi-cians and policymakers (including Dutch ones) are often inadequate, as describedin Part ii . We will begin with the driving principles. They are self-sustaining, and in thatrespect there is little risk that efficiency, effectiveness and security will lack atten-tion. Government can never be efficient or effective enough, of course, but there isa danger of these principles becoming overly dominant, with economic rational-ism hedging in all the other concerns that people may have about the role ict plays in the relationship between government and the citizen. The same goes for theprinciple of security: in theory, society can never be safe enough (let alone toosafe), but the emphasis on security can also be too one-sided, i.e. the pursuit ofsecurity at any price. That 'price' may in fact be very high, and not only ineconomic terms: a society whose members are under constant surveillance willfind it hard to live and breathe. Private life \"increasingly resembles a glass housewith hardly any curtains\" (Kohnstamm & Dubbeld 2007). If the principle of secu-rity is underplayed, on the other hand, government could very well be accused ofboth na\u00efvet\u00e9 and of neglecting its most basic responsibility to citizens. As Part ii of this report demonstrates, the underpinning principles are often over- shadowed in political and public debate by the driving principles. Underpinning principles are not automatically taken into account in the process leading up to thedevelopment of an application. They require particular attention and powerfuladvocates. Nevertheless, what applies to the other principles also applies here:there can be too much freedom of choice or privacy (compare De Mul 2010). For example, giving people unbridled freedom to decide whether their personal datacan be used (for example by police investigators) would ultimately undermine thesafety of others. Too much choice can equally lead to 'choice fatigue', with peoplenot even taking the trouble to consider other options and simply ticking boxes atrandom. But a society can also have an excess of privacy: the free citizens of ademocratic state have duties and responsibilities as well as rights, and for thatreason it must be possible to trace and identify them. Protection of privacy has itsrisks. Undesirable scenarios can unfold behind closed doors, making privacy abreeding ground for threats and hazards, for example. \"In a democratic society, itmust be possible to call people who violate the rights of others to account. Thatmay require disclosure of an individual's identity and an investigation into his orher activities,\" according to the fourth Balkenende government (Tweede Kamer2009-2010j: 12). And many other unwelcome situations can arise in the physicalor mental seclusion of the cocoon protected by privacy law. Critics point to tradi-tional patterns of (male) dominance (Tadros 2006; Allen 2003), to concealmentthat is damaging to economic life (Posner 1984), to suppression of the expression77 analytical framework: information, actors and principlesof public opinion (Volokh 2000), and even to general intellectual poverty (Kumar 2004). It is also possible to overemphasise the process-based principles. No matter how important transparency is, it cannot be made an absolute demand. For one thing,some matters are simply too sensitive to be disclosed publicly (for privacy ornational security reasons). Transparency also has a complex relationship with thepublic's sense of trust in government. Although government can use transparencyas a tool to encourage trust (Keymolen et al. 2011; Van der Hof & Keymolen 2010),too much transparency may in fact be at the expense of such trust (Luhmann1979). Government can also use transparency as a manipulative tool (Fung,Graham & Weil 2007) if the disclosure is never verified in an appropriate forum(Meijer, Brandsma & Grimmelikhuijsen 2010). The term 'audit explosion' alone(Power 2005) indicates that a society can also go too far in terms of accountability.The price of excessive accountability may be effectiveness and efficiency, andcreativity (innovation). 2.6 in conclusion The analytical framework presented above, the theoretical background to the mainissues, and the tripartite division of principles will help to illuminate our analysisof the practical, everyday reality of eGovernment presented in Part ii. That reality reveals that the nature of government is changing dramatically under the influenceof digitization. A de facto practice has developed - virtually unnoticed - in which interrelated information flows dominate the character of government. That prac-tice has not become part of the mental framework of politicians and policymakers;in fact, the overall idea of fast-expanding and rapidly diversifying informationflows is virtually the last thing driving the way they think and work. In the mean-time, information is cascading between different organisations, between whatwere formerly separate sectors (service, care and control), and across public-private boundaries. The empirical analysis in Part ii follows the path of the infor- mation flows rather than the individual technologies and applications, and showsthat in practice, iGovernment 'emerges' without needing and policymakers.78 igovernmentnotes 1 www.bof.nl/2010/09/22/geen-openheid-over-nederlandse-blokkade- verboden-websites/ 2 They include work and income, tax and customs, education, traffic and transport, etc. 3 And also so as to not unnecessarily prevent society (the market) from exploiting those opportunities. 4 Roughly translated: my.government.nl, citizenpolicy.nl and m y.taxandcustoms.nl.79 analytical framework: information, actors and principlespart ii empirical analysis3 managing egovernment The previous chapter explains that this study focuses more on technological systems in relation to their environment than on individual technologies or tech-nology in general. Such sociotechnological systems consist of complex networksof people, technological applications, government and other organisations, andbusinesses. The motives and interests of the actors involved play an important rolein charting the course that technological development takes and in generating andutilising information. The interactions that take place within this sociotechnologi-cal system are therefore the point of departure for the empirical analysis set out inthis part of the book. That analysis zooms in on the relationships between the keyactors that shape eGovernment, revealing how they go about taking decisions onthe use of technology and information and balancing interests that are oftencontradictory, as well as the role that each actor plays. Their positions are subse-quently defined in terms of the driving, underpinning, and process-based princi-ples introduced in the previous chapter. In analysing the interactions betweenthem, this study not only looks at technological applications, but focuses in partic-ular on the information flows that arise from or are facilitated by technology. It isin such information flows that the boundaries - which are already somewhatblurred - between various policy areas, regulatory chains, sectors, and the relevantparties tend to converge. Focusing on information flows reveals the outlines of thequiet revolution in eGovernment - a revolution that will determine the future andthe character of government in the digital age. 3.1 the enthusiasm and 'techno-trust' of politicians and policymakers 3.1.1 ready and willing On 21 June 2001 - not long before the terrorist attacks in New York - the DutchHouse of Representatives discussed the Dutch Minister of the Interior's memo-randum urging the inclusion of a biometric feature in travel documents, as well asa recent visit by several mps to the passport producers, Royal Joh. Ensched\u00e9 and the state printing and publishing company sdu . The Minister and the mps were equally enthusiastic. \"After the visit to Royal Joh. Ensched\u00e9 and sdu , Mr Zijlstra (Labour Party/PvdA) showed himself to be deeply impressed by the advanced features and immense potential of biometrics. ... Mr De Swart (Liberal Party/ vvd ) was also impressed by the potential of biometrics after his visit to Royal Joh. Ensched\u00e9 and sdu . In particular, exceptional progress had already been made on the finger-83print scan and iris scan. ... The Netherlands should perhaps consider adopting a role as trail- blazer and become the first country in Europe to introduce biometric features. ... Mr Balkenende(Christian Democrats/ cda ) found the technical possibilities and advances most impressive after his visit to sdu and Royal Joh. Ensched\u00e9. The Christian Democrats believe the inclusion of biometric features ....to be urgent and pressed for quick action to be taken. ... Mr Balkenendeobserved that inclusion of a biometric feature would require amending Article 3 of the PassportAct. This was a technical improvement, not a change in principle ...\" (Tweede Kamer 2000-2001a:103). 1 These passages, taken from the minutes of the meeting, illustrate the attitude toward ict that has prevailed among politicians and policymakers in the past decade. That attitude is coloured by (a) huge enthusiasm and almost absolute trustin ict and (b) an instrumentalist view of what ict is and can do. The policy plans developed since the early 1990s all convey huge trust in ict as a tool with which government can execute its tasks more effectively, become more client-friendlyand more accessible, improve in quality, and prepare more thoroughly for thefuture (see for 2010). ict was greeted with excitement by Dutch politicians, who thought it would help governmentshoulder its heavy administrative burden and allow it to tackle urgent social issuessuch as terrorism, security, mobility, and good and affordable care. It was virtuallytaken for granted that technology would be used. Two communications about thenational Electronic Patient Dossier, sent to the House of Representatives by thethen Minister of Health Hans Hoogervorst, are revealing. \"In this memorandum, I have not discussed the necessity of introducing the Electronic Medical Dossier (emd ) and the epd . After all, everyone is convinced that both must be implemented as quickly as possible\" (Tweede Kamer 2004-2005: 8). And: \"The second conclusion is that it is beyond doubt that the introduction of a gpobservation dossier and the electronic medical dossier will improve the quality of care\" (Tweede Kamer 2006-2007: 4). Technology is 'rolled out', practices are 'streamlined' and services are 'updated'. For example, the ict applications developed by the Ministry of Security and Justice within the context of the Border Management Innovation Programme ensure that border surveillance strikes a good balance between the need for control84 igovernmentand security and the economic benefits of ensuring the efficient and customer- friendly handling of cross-border movements of people and goods.2A policy document published by the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations,Contract met de toekomst (Contract with the Future, Ministerie van bzk 2000), which looks ahead to government's electronic relationship with the citizens, alsoexpresses high hopes for the problem-solving capability of ict. \"ict is more than merely a handy tool for improving efficiency. When properly used, it can make an important contribution to achieving the policy targets that a sector has set itself. It can oil the machinery of justice, in the same way that it has greased the wheels of the Tax and CustomsAdministration. It can help compensate for the shortage of teachers and remedial teachers ineducation, vastly improve the quality of life of the elderly, and make our streets a much safer placeto be. The opportunities are there; we have only to grasp them. Understanding what ict can do for a sector requires the involvement of experts from that sector. They know enough about theprimary process to see what ict can contribute. It is therefore important to get the sectors thinking about the problem-solving potential of ict\" (Ministerie van bzk 2000: 23). 3.1.2 from service delivery to care and control At first, the appeal of new technological innovations lay primarily in their poten- tial to improve service delivery. eGovernment is \"government in which transac-tions between government and the citizen take place as much as possible throughelectronic channels, the purpose being to improve service delivery and lawenforcement and to encourage public participation and input by citizens. ... Theinterests of the citizen are the basic point of departure in this respect\" (Postma-Wallage Committee 2007: 4). It was this aim that inspired Dutch politicians toembark on a digitization campaign in the 1980s and 1990s. They sought toimprove policy - doing more with less, so to speak - and streamline transactionsbetween government and citizens by zealously digitizing administrative processesand by launching popular projects such as the Citizen Service Card and theGovernment Service Desk 2000 (Van de Donk & Meyer 1994; Huydecoper et al.2001; Bekkers et al. 2005; Van de Donk & Van Dael 2005). And yet, when theMinistry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations asked the Public AdministrationCouncil ( Raad voor het openbaar bestuur , Rob) to advise it in 1998, the Rob responded by observing that government had disregarded many opportunities to utilise ict to improve service delivery to citizens. In its opinion, the projects launched within the context of the Government Service Desk 2000 project were\"mere finger exercises for the major work that lies ahead\" (Rob 1998: 23). And indeed: a few years later, policymakers and politicians embarked on that major work in earnest. In Contract met de toekomst , the policy document cited85 managing egovernmentearlier (Ministerie van bzk 2000), the Government set out an ambitious plan to use ict to improve both its data management and service delivery to the citizen. Whereas the early days of eGovernment saw greater emphasis on advancing a vision of 'new government', the accent now shifted to translating the aims(often imposed top down) into specific programmes and agreements. One suchexample was the 2008 National Implementation Programme on Service eGovernment (Nationaal uitvoeringsprogramma betere dienstverleningen e-overheid, nup ), an agreement in which the national, provincial and local authorities undertook to improve service delivery while reducing the adminis-trative burden. \"In order to do that, the public authorities must cooperate (even)more closely, coordinate their operations and data management, and alignthem with existing and future basic facilities.\" 3In the past decade, that idea has resulted in a wide range of plans and specific initiatives: the introduction ofthe Citizen Service Number ( bsn ), the modernising of the municipal personal records database ( gba) and various other basic records, the expansion of the intermediary organisation for electronic data-sharing between governmentorganisations ( rinis ), the establishment of a single client contact centre for income-support benefits schemes, and the many online facilities for administra-tive transactions (e.g. applying for a permit, submitting a notice of objection). 4 These and countless other initiatives have changed government service deliveryin various ways (services are now continuously available, for example, and moreinteractive) and in some cases did indeed improve it. The celebrations, however,were often short-lived: improvements in service delivery are quickly perceivedas 'status quo' and not as an achievement. Moreover, the 'silent' successesattained by local authorities and many government agencies are frequently over-shadowed by more prominent, large-scale, expensive projects plagued by delaysand failures. The major work identified by the Rob was not restricted to service delivery. 'The Hague' has also increasingly turned to technology in the past decade tosolve pressing social problems. That is partly because politicians have had somuch trust in technology as a tool for tackling such problems more efficientlyand effectively, but it is also because they have become increasingly interestedin public safety, national security, and other issues in which technology plays agrowing role. The Netherlands is certainly not alone in either respect (Lyon 2007;Dunleavy et Bennett 2008;Magnet 2009). ict has become increasingly prevalent as an element of public safety policy in recent years: security cameras provide 24-hour surveillance onthe streets, the Reference Index of Juveniles at Risk (Verwijsindex Risicojon-geren, vir ) and the Electronic Child Dossier (Elektronisch Kinddossier , ekd ) are meant to alert the authorities to young people at risk at the earliest possible stage,and databases of fingerprints and dna markers make crime investigations easier. There is virtually a 'technological imperative' in place when it comes to national86 igovernmentsecurity, with security-related data-gathering reaching unprecedented propor- tions. For example, Dutch crime investigation services requested customer datafrom telecom companies and ISPs almost 3 million times (2,930,941 times) in2009 (ciot 2010a). In addition, the Final Report of the ciot 5Audit - published after a request was submitted under the Government Information (PublicAccess) Act (Wet openbaarheid van bestuur, wob ) - revealed that the staff of special crime investigation units had requested such data without first obtainingthe consent, required by law, of the public prosecutor ( ciot 2010b). It is anyone's guess, however, just how much data is gathered in other contexts. \"Everyoneknows that requests for data have increased considerably in recent years, butsubstantiating figures are only partially available\" (Advisory Committee onInformation Flows Security 2007: 66). 3.1.3 driven by ambition Politicians and policymakers are not only enthusiastic about ict and have great faith in its powers; they are also ambitious. The Netherlands Court of Audit(2007a) refers to \"an enthusiasm for ict\" among policymakers, unrealistic politi- cal deadlines, and insufficient scope for review and re-evaluation during proj-ects. In the Court's view, ict projects in national government are overly ambi- tious and too complex, the result of constant tension between the political,organisational and technical factors involved. The Coordinating cio (see also Section 6.3), Maarten Hillenaar, has also remarked on government's inclinationto embark on large-scale projects (a propensity not limited to the Netherlandsalone), with 'fantasy deadlines' - for example to get a project up and runningwithin the current Government's term in office - and the compulsion to buildthings from scratch, meaning that the mistakes of previous projects are repeatedover and over again. Politicians are also frequently inclined to make changeshalfway, influencing the scope of a project. 6In addition, the politics of large- scale projects are often 'all or nothing': the Government is loath to see such proj-ects fail, or even be delayed. For example, in response to the 330,000 objectionslodged against the epd - an unprecedented figure, and one that increased by another 100,000-plus by mid-2010 - Abraham Klink, Minister of Health, hadnothing more to say than that that number is \"in line with what he'd expected\"(Pluut 2010: 21). Nevertheless, the epd project has for now come to a halt. In April 2011, the Senate unanimously rejected the legislative act that would haveconstituted the national interchange 7- thereby ironically relegating digital medical dossiers to regional public-private initiatives, which are thriving but farmore 'unruly' in character. Such grand ambitions are apparent not only due to the scale and complexity of the projects, but also the result of policy goals specified in the plans. Charged with thetask of protecting public safety and confident that technology is just the thing to87 managing egovernmentdo the job, politicians want to map out and anticipate the future. \"The technical system must ban uncomfortable uncertainty\" (Hirsch Ballin 1992: 77). In keepingwith the idea that prevention is better than cure, ict is making it possible for government to act proactively and preventively (Schinkel 2009). The vir must prevent the abuse and death of yet another child; the epd must protect patients against medical errors; European migration databases must prevent more irregularmigrants from entering the Netherlands; and investigation databases and the sharing of Passenger Name Records 8and bank and dna data must prevent new terrorist attacks. The yearning of politicians and policymakers to anticipate thefuture is leading to fundamental paradigm shifts. For example, the aim and scopeof criminal law has shifted from response, revenge and rehabilitation to preven-tion and risk management or to the 'pre-crime refers to a'culture of control' and describes a political climate in which fighting crime nolonger means resocialising those who exhibit undesirable behaviour, but ratherprotecting people who adhere to the rules from those who do not. 3.1.4 accumulating bit by bit Driven by their enthusiasm for technology, their trust in its potential, and theirambitious aim of using ict to tackle the challenges facing society, and spurred on by such principles as security, effectiveness and efficiency, politicians are eagernot only to use separate applications but also to link and share information. If it ispossible to uncover fraud by linking the information systems run by the Tax andCustoms Administration and the Social Security Agency, there must be leewayto do so. If a child can be saved by giving as many organisations as possible accessto the Electronic Child Dossier, then that possibility must be considered. If thefingerprints of asylum-seekers recorded within the context of migration policycan also be used to investigate crime, then what objection can there possibly be?If it is possible to share dna data with the authorities in other countries by making national databases mutually accessible, then we'll sign a treaty to that effect.And, if screening Internet data traffic using deep packet inspection ( dpi ) makes it possible to stop the distribution of child pornography, it should be regarded asa serious option. The growing desire to link systems and databases demonstrates that, although technology dominates the political debate, the issue is really the information flows facilitated by the different technologies. Information is the raw material ofpreventive policy because the profiles used as a basis for risk analyses and preven-tion can only be compiled with the help of information (i.e. personal data)(Harcourt 2007; Hildebrandt & Gutwirth 2008; Buruma 2011). Information is also the primary raw material within the context of a 'service-oriented' policy onpoverty, for example when certain groups of citizens are excused from paying88 igovernmenttheir municipal or water board taxes, or are given access to supplementary benefits (Tweede Kamer 2009-2010b). Government also frequently 'shops around' inprivate databases for the information it requires. Increasingly, the public authori-ties require data gathered in the private sector for reasons of commercial servicedelivery to be made available to government - where it is for control purposesrather than for service delivery. Berkvens (1992) refers in this connection to the'New Feudal Services' in the digital domain. The past decade has seen a string ofnew laws that make this possible, including the Requisitioning of Data Powers Act(Wet bevoegdheden vorderen gegevens), telecommunicatie ), as well as European legisla- tion relating to the transfer of passenger name records ( pnr ) and bank data (swift ) to the United States. In addition to such major public-private information flows, however, legitimised by special legislation, much can also be achieved bymerging data resources from the bottom up. For example, if a municipal socialservices department wants to track down people committing benefits fraud, thePersonal Data Protection Act ( Wet bescherming persoonsgegevens , wbp ) basically permits it to link its files with those of the water supply company ( cbp 2006: 1). In all such cases, the cumulative use of information blurs the boundary betweenservice (in this case provided by the private sector) and control (public sector). Onthe other hand, the private sector is happy to hitch a ride with government. As theConfederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers ( vno-ncw ) has explained: \"The Confederation is worried about the fact that, until now, opportunities to usethe Citizen Service Number ( bsn ) in business record-keeping have been lost\" (vno-ncw 2005). And The Centre of Expertise ( hec , a public ict consultancy firm), when asked to advise on a request for funding submitted by the Immigra-tion and Naturalisation Service in connection with a computerised passportcontrol system (No- q), concluded that \"The objectives can be regarded as realistic given the firm commitment of both government and the private party, SchipholAirport.\" 9 As a rule, however, politicians do not focus on the interaction between variousapplications and information flows; instead, they concentrate on individual initia-tives and discuss them separately. For example, there have been parliamentary andother political debates on the biometric passport, the public transport chip card,the bsn , DigiD, the digital client dossier ( dkd ), the electronic learning dossier (eld ), the Electronic Patient Dossier ( epd ), the Reference Index for Juveniles at Risk ( vir ), and the Personal Internet Page ( pip). All these debates concerned a specific, relevant technological application. And depending on the dynamics ofthe debate, the focus may even narrow to a specific aspect of the application. Thedebate on the public transport chip card, for example, centred on the 'hackability'of the chip (Van Eeten 2011). When the then Minister of the Interior and KingdomRelations, Guusje ter Horst, was asked about setbacks in introducing the NationalCivil Service Smartcard, she indirectly provided evidence of this narrowing of89 managing egovernmentfocus, stating, \"We have received repeated reports that the technology may not be as safe as we had thought and hoped, and so we have repeatedly had to take extrameasures\" (Tweede Kamer 2008-2009c: 3). Only rarely does anyone involved inpublic or political debate mention the underlying web of interests and relation-ships that will arise or continue to expand. There is frequently no discussion of thereciprocal relationships, the links, and the chain computerisation that evolve inthe background of individual applications and that are moulded in everyday prac-tice, step by step. Whereas individual ap plications are often subject to parliamen- tary debate and intervention (although sometimes not until very late in theprocess, for example in the case of the epd and the vir ), that is scarcely ever the case when it comes to the links between systems (as distinct from applications).Because many of these links are assumed to be legitimate under the generic regimeof the Personal Data Protection Act ( Wet bescherming persoonsgegevens , wbp) , decisions about them are virtually never discussed openly or at the political level.The only 'assessment' is the obligation under the Act to notify the Data ProtectionAuthority ( College Bescherming Persoonsgegevens , cbp ), and even then, the Authority only scrutinises notifications in exceptional cases. A search through theAuthority's online database of notifications shows that many links have beencreated at the operational and municipal level without giving cause to any visibleattempts at scrutiny or debate. The tendency to gather more and more information while politicians frequently narrow their focus to the application and the relevant legislation means that theresulting links and information flows are growing wider and more complex all thetime. Increasingly, information gathered for service, care or control purposes isalso used, linked and processed outside those contexts. One typical example ofhow systems initially intended for service delivery are later used for surveillanceand enforcement is the Minister of Justice's programme to set up a national data-base of prostitutes based on the Municipal Personal Records Database ( gba). 10 When the Ministry requests a person's name and address for its national database,a note is appended to that individual's gba record that data was forwarded to the prostitution database. Because information cannot be removed from the gba (the system does not overwrite a record when information is amended; it simplyappends the new data), public servants in the civil records department (whose jobsmainly involve service delivery to citizens) will be able to see not only that some-one is now a prostitute, but also that that person was a prostitute at some point inthe past. Policymakers and politicians in fact seem unaware of the far-reachingconsequences of this growing accumulation of interlinked, multi-contextualapplications. And when Parliament does comment that an initiative \"has or couldhave more far-reaching consequences than initially intended when introduced\"(Eerste Kamer 2006-2007: 1), the relevant ministry generally fails to respond.90 igovernment3.1.5 a lack of criticism This is not to say, however, that Parliament's input is insignificant. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives - but the former in particular - have beencritical of the Government's ambitions. At times, the Senate has even accused theGovernment of side-lining Parliament in advance by not setting out such issues asthe assessment framework and criteria for deploying an application in the relevantAct, but rather in an Order in Council ( Algemene Maatregel van Bestuur ), as was the case of the bsn (Eerste Kamer 2006-2007: 1-2). Parlia- ment's criticisms sometimes have the backing of organised groups of citizens andngo s (see Section 7.2) campaigning for stricter democratic supervision in a grow- ing number of policy areas in which ict is deployed (Eijkman 2010; Prins 2010a). The Rathenau Institute (an advisory body to Parliament on science and technol-ogy) has also helped shape political opinion in various reports to parliament particularly receptive to input of this kind and has come to differ-ent conclusions than the House in a number of cases. For example, the DutchConsumers' Association played a major role in getting the Senate to reject a billrelating to a smart energy meter in April 2009 (Eerste Kamer 2008-2009a;Cuijpers & Koops 2009). After severe criticism by the Data Protection Authority(cbp 2007) and other organisations, the Senate cut the period in which Internet Service Providers ( isps) are obliged to retain records on their customer's data traf- fic from the 12 months approved by the House to a maximum of six months. TheHouse had itself already reduced the data retention period from the 18 monthsproposed by the Government. The epd dossier turned out to be so complex that the Senate convened a number of expert sessions to aid it in reaching an informedopinion, thereby doing justice to its sobriquet Chambre de reflection . In the end, it was the Senate that rejected the bill relating to the epd in April 2011. And finally, in May 2011 the Senate decided to hold a policy debate in the presence of theresponsible Minister about \"privacy, digital data storage and data exchange\"(Eerste Kamer 2010-2011). Nevertheless, most of the projects and proposals related to ict and information systems appear to have passed through the democratic system virtually unno- ticed, even going back many years (see for example Snellen 1992). When an appli-cation does attract attention, it is often only after the decision has already beentaken. The introduction of the biometric passport and the storage of fingerprintsin a central database drew remarkably little public or political attention until therelevant bill had been submitted to the Senate for approval (B\u00f6hre 2010; Snijder2010). Only then did a number of ngo s and scientists stir up something of a public debate. In interviews, some senators admitted that, looking back, they felt theyhad not kept a close enough eye on the issue. 11mps who had previously supported the Government's plans later also expressed concern. 91 managing egovernment\"There are genuine risks [to the storage of biometric data]: fraud, function creep and abuse ... It is and will remain a total mystery to me why we Dutch have insisted on taking the lead inthis and combining two objectives in a single law, i.e. to combat identity fraud - an objective thatI agree with entirely and that I too want to achieve - and to investigate criminal offences, usingthe database as the binding factor,\" said Liberal mp Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert (Tweede Kamer 2010-2011a: 4). In April 2011, Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations Piet-Hein Donner responded to continued criticism by Parliament by putting an end to the centralstorage of fingerprints and announcing that those fingerprints that had alreadybeen stored would be destroyed. 12Nevertheless, interviews with various mps show that scrupulous, forward-looking democratic supervision is far from easy,and difficult for many politicians to achieve. That is especially true when plans are developed at the European level, for example relating to Frontex (the eu Border Management Agency) and in the case of the proposed Entry/Exit System at the eu's external borders, according to Senator Pauline Meurs. 13Members of both the House and the Senate say that their position at the apex of Dutch publicadministration distances them from many of the systems and applications thatthey discuss and assess. The debate tends to focus on broad outlines, even though for many technological applications, the devil is in the detail. Some projects alsospan multiple terms in office, and as the composition of Parliament and coalitiongovernments changes, so do the project objectives. For example, Parliament spentmany years discussing the use of biometrics in the passport, and \"... as the years went by, there was a lot of confusion that no one really seemed able to resolve. The terms and aims of biometrics kept expanding: it had to combat everything from 'look-alike fraud'to terrorism, serve as passport verification and identify victims in disasters, and make passportssecure as well as prevent identity fraud in general. But the consequences of these high-flown termsfor implementation were never identified with any consistency\" (Snijder 2010). Scrupulous parliamentary control is difficult for other reasons as well. For exam- ple, Christian Democrat mp Pieter Omtzigt commented that it was not always easy for the House to monitor the progress of a project: \"It's hard to keep close track of major ict projects. It's also difficult to check up on progress. mps are naturally given lists of the number of care providers that have joined and other key figures, but the schedules and plans are often much too optimistic\" (Pluut 2010: 42). 92 igovernmentOmtzigt's observation confirms what the Netherlands Court of Audit previously concluded: government ministers do not inform the House sufficiently, makingit very difficult to assess ict projects before they begin, monitor their progress, and evaluate their effects (Netherlands Court of Audit 2007a). 3.1.6 response to arguments Experience shows that the arguments typically advanced in support of a newinformation system come in for very little criticism. Although individual publicservants and politicians may be sceptical about ict solutions, partly owing to past fiascos and problems of data contamination, the arguments put forward in thewider debate - security, effectiveness and efficiency - are self-sustaining, espe-cially when combined with the problem-solving 'reputation' of ict. In everyday politics, they are the 'big guns', often implicitly outweighing other values suchas transparency, privacy and, increasingly, freedom of choice. Groothuis (2010),for example, shows that recent amendments to various laws allow governmentto make the Internet the mandatory channel of communication. Citizens' freedomto choose between paper and digital interaction with government (Tweede Kamer1997-1998) - a principle firmly rooted in the early days of eGovernment - is gradu-ally being abandoned. At the same time, some government organisations take fulladvantage of their own freedom of choice when transactions on paper are more convenient for them (Groothuis 2010: 351-352). 14The creation of the anonymous public transport chip card is another sign that freedom of choice rarely takesprecedence. The 'anonymous passenger' option was only added to the plans underpressure from the Data Protection Authority (Van 't Hof et al. 2010b), but evenafter the idea had been accepted, the resulting anonymous chip card turned out tobe a less-than-appealing alternative. In addition, the debate tends to become polarised between politicians and policy- makers who prioritise driving principles and those who favour underpinningprinciples. Upon taking receipt of a report of a special committee on security andprivacy (January 2009), the then Minister of the Interior and Kingdom RelationsGuusje ter Horst said that it was important to strike a good balance, commentingthat a concern for security must not lead to \"personal data being thrown up for grabs.\" Later that same year, however, after the 'underwear bomber' incident in December 2009, her straightforward response was that \"security trumpsprivacy.\" 15Polarisation of this kind has been typical of many of the policy-related discussions relating to the utilisation of ict in recent years. The comments of former Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende (then still an mp) during the 2001 meeting between the House and the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations offer a good illustration. The meeting, cited earlier, concerned the needto include a biometric feature in travel documents. 93 managing egovernment\"Mr Balkenende hopes that privacy will not become an impediment to this necessary technical improvement. ... Mr Balkenende asks the Minister to confirm that Article 3 of the Passport Actdoes not concern privacy, but rather [that biometrics concerns] a technical feature that must beincorporated into law\" (cited in B\u00f6hre 2010: 22). It is not only security but also the driving principles of effectiveness and efficiency that spur politicians and policymakers on to develop, introduce and use evernewer, more innovative ict systems. These principles are cited most often as reasons to continue the expansion of eGovernment. The claims made about secu-rity, effectiveness and efficiency are, however, often unsubstantiated (Kearns2004). That is, in any event, the conclusion reached in a study on the digitizationof the decision-making process for zoning plans. \"Properly substantiated forecastsof the costs and benefits of digitization in the decision-making chain are difficult,if not impossible, (CapGemini Consulting & Ernst &Young 2004: 8).Various organisations have repeatedly pointed out that the causal relationshipassumed between instruments and effects in security policy were not, or notproperly, substantiated (Van der Knaap 2010: 13). In its report of May 2009, theSuyver Committee, which evaluated the Netherlands' counter-terrorism policy(Suyver Committee 2009), pointed out the need to evaluate counter-terrorismmeasures comprehensively. In response, the Government announced an evalua-tion study whose results are still pending (Tweede Kamer 2008-2009d). Theevaluation of ict has long been a complex issue (Thaens 1998; Van Hout 2005). What is most striking is that the yardstick for evaluating ict applications is often not the reality of policymaking - or the goals that have been defined - but ratherthe terms of the system itself, for example how many hits the Reference Indexfor Juveniles at Risk generates. Real evidence that the application is doing what it was actually intended to do, i.e. improve the social safety net, is almost entirelylacking (compare Waldron 2007; Robinson et al. 2010: 7). The affair of the epd is a case in point. In a response to the Senate regarding the epd bill, the Minister of Health commented: \"The epd 's added value should ... be sought in the ease and speed with which data can be reliably and securely shared\" (Eerste Kamer 2009-2010c: 6). According to Pluut (2010), the information provided in the initial policydocuments is scarcely more specific than that. \"Policymakers or ministers do not mention studies showing that data-sharing (at national level) has in fact led to these results; nor do they explain how, and under what conditions, a nationalepd will lead to improvements in the care sector. They evidently see no reason to do so because in the early years, a sort of general consensus emerged that the Netherlands needed to work toward anation-wide system of information provision in the care sector\" (Pluut 2010: 23). 94 igovernmentOnly later, as the plans and implementation process proceeded and Parliament grew increasingly critical, did official documents begin to contain more referencesto research reports demonstrating the need for an epd . In these arguments, the ultimate aim of the epd gradually shifted from financial considerations (effi- ciency) to medical safety. Box 3.1 Magic with numbers: 19,000 avoidable errors In their arguments supporting a national epd , successive ministers have referred to the harm Report (Van den Bemt 2006), based on a study that concludes that of the 41,000 or so medication- related hospital admissions every year, 19,000 are potentially avoidable. The report's most impor- tant recommendation is to approach patients who display (or are prone to) one or more risk factorsproactively by offering them extra supervision with respect to their medication. The researchersstate that better information-sharing is one way to improve such supervision - without, however,explicitly referring to electronic patient dossiers. In response to questions raised by the opposition during the plenary debate in Parliament on the epd bill, Minister of Health Ab Klink reiterated: \"The data concerning the 19,000 people admitted to hospital and, of these, the 1200 who subsequently died is taken from the harm study of 2006. What it comes down to is that 60 people are admitted daily owing to errors in their medication,and three of them die every day.\" mp Arda Gerkens (Socialist Party/ sp) responded by asking whether the Minister \"had estimated how many medical errors could be avoided by the epd , or, in other words, how many patients could be expected to improve and what was the chance of the epd itself leading to errors ...\" The Minister replied: \"Such an estimate has certainly been made. I had good reason to mention the 19,000 hospital admissions owing to errors in medication. Many of these - but I cannot really sayhow many - could have been avoided if better information had been available on the patient's medication. ... I don't think that percentages are so relevant. Even if Accident & Emergency canprovide better help in only a few cases a day, then it's already worth it\" the debate, stating: \"Nowhere in the harm study does it say that the Electronic Patient Dossier will help reduce the number of avoidable hospital admissions. ... My point is that the epd may reduce the number of avoidable errors - we do not know by how many because Ms Gerkens too was not given an answer to thatquestion - but it may also increase the number of avoidable errors. After all, the epd itself could also contain errors. ... The Minister argues that we need the epd because it will reduce the number of avoidable errors, but - if I may appeal to Klink the scientist - the same reasoning can be appliedin the opposite direction. We have no evidence.\" Minister Klink parried Ms Agema's explanationas follows: \"For once, take it on the authority of Klink the scientist that it does work and that it willlead to fewer errors\" (Tweede Kamer 2008-2009b: 3946-3947).95 managing egovernmentThe Government has now started to take the targets and indicators for assessing security policy more seriously, following a report by the Netherlands Institute forSocial Research ( scp ), Sociale Veiligheid ontsleuteld (Public Safety Decoded, scp 2008). Theoretically informed policy reports are gaining ground, but it is only inrare instances that they focus on substantiating expectations and later assessmentsof ict initiatives. Some explicitly state that the 'success' of an application cannot be measured, as occurred when questions arose as to whether camera surveillanceactually led to greater security. 16Part of the problem is that no one knows precisely what should be measured or in what units it should be expressed. The FinalReport on the Evaluation of Camera Surveillance in Public Places ( Eindrapport Evaluatie cameratoezicht op openbare plaatsen ), published in late 2009, concludes that the effects of camera surveillance on public safety are unclear (Tweede Kamer2009-2010a). 17Moreover, while the project costs can be identified, the benefits can not. And even then, the cost projections frequently prove to be too optimistic,with the technology being less durable than anticipated. For example, digitizationoperations are often budgeted as one-off operations, with no account being taken of long-term expenditure on system maintenance, security, updates, etc.(Keymolen & Prins 2011). The desire to measure the effects of ict applications sometimes leads to paradoxical consequences. When the uk's House of Commons Home Affairs Committee called on the British Government to investigatewhether various security measures, including camera surveillance ( cctv ), did in fact lead to a reduction in crime (House of Commons 2008), New Scotland Yardresponded by saying that what was first required was a national database of cctv images. 18 3.1.7 driving, underpinning and process-based principles How are the driving, underpinning and process-based principles applied in andshaped by political and administrative practice in national government? To beginwith, it appears that the interpretation of these principles is far from uniform. Thisalso shows that the task of balancing driving, underpinning and process-basedprinciples is by no means a strictly choreographed affair. Two tendencies appear toinfluence the erratic way in which these principles are dealt with in the field. Thefirst is the instrumentalist view of ict. Related to that view is a lack of awareness that ict can bring about changes in the very nature of government and how it operates. The above discussion shows that many public administrators who 'own' or advo- cate ict applications are inclined to view ict as an instrument - i.e. a vehicle for policy. They are highly ambitious in what they wish to achieve with information technology, but much less ambitious when it comes to setting aims for informa- tion technology. In the eyes of many policymakers, at least, technology holds out96 igovernmentthe promise of doing what they have been doing all along, but better - not differ- ently, merely better. We see this in many different cases, from the way officialstinker with the quality of government service delivery to their attempts to tacklegovernment's duty of care, for example by introducing medication safeguards inthe epd . Among public administrators, the more or less explicit assumption is that the 'primary process' - the actual goals and methods of public policy - will notchange. Significantly, this means that they do not, or only barely, acknowledge orperceive the unintended but very real impact that digitization has on the waygovernment operates (the 'primary process'), if only because the public in generalhas itself changed. Although the instrumental dimension of ict is important, this attitude has led to a certain paucity of judgment, made clear by the fact that appli-cations are seldom subjected to credible evaluation. There is also a shortage ofcriteria for assessing applications when the approach taken is purely instrumental.The debate therefore continues to focus on the security of the technology (thepublic transport chip card) or financial debacles (the various failed ict projects). In other words, there is a narrow focus on whether the technology has lived up toits promise to do what is already done, but to do it better (more effectively andefficiently). When the discussion is about costs, it is often limited to the staffingor financial implications. The broader implications are not included, and are there-fore also not considered in any broader balancing of interests, whether ex ante (decision-making) or ex post (evaluation). A case in point are the sections of text addressing costs/benefits in the project proposal submitted by the Immigrationand Naturalisation Service ( ind ) as part of the Government programme 'ict Projects in Social Domains'. The proposal concerned the development of a computerised passport control system (No- q) for the approximately three million eupassengers who depart from Schiphol each year. The analysis was broken down into the necessary staffing and financial investment on the one hand (costs), and a\"quantifiable reduction in lines and waiting times\", efficiency improvementswhen verifying travel documents ('reversing cost increases') and 'security optimi-sation' on the other (benefits). Both costs and benefits were exclusively subject toan instrumental assessment. 19 What policymakers also ignore is that ict can bring about a fundamental change in what are seen as government's responsibilities and duties. According to a close col-league of Neelie Kroes, European Commissioner for Digital Agenda, the idea thatinformation technology is intrinsically meaningless still prevails. 20But this tech- nology is not - or not only - a vehicle of change: it is itself a change. Its autonomous significance can even be seen in those areas where digitization has recorded themost value-free progress, specifically in rationalising internal work processes('operations'). There too, what policymakers hope to achieve with ict is not matched by any aims set forict. In this context, setting a target forict would mean genuinely integrating a new application into an organisation so that it becomesintrinsic to its staff and meets their expectations. In practice, the worlds of technol-97 managing egovernmentogy and organisation are often kept separate, and eventually it becomes clear that the systems are not really aligned with what is happening on the shop floor (onegood example being new ict system that the police force began using in 2010), and that the intended users are even - for a variety of reasons - undermining or avoidingusing the new system. Behind the primary process lies a broad spectrum of workprocesses and values (Van den Akker & Kuiper 2008: 161). The interaction betweenthe technology and those who work with it changes the way government operates,at times in an unexpected manner. Various examples show that technology canhave a powerful influence on government's goals. Current popular policy objec-tives - for example 'customisation' and proactive policy-making - would beunimaginable without the backdrop of digitization. Nevertheless, ict is depicted as something neutral, and what is therefore never considered is that such admirableaims as customisation - even when viewed within the context of service delivery -or proactive policymaking cause government itself to change too. That is becausesuch aims assume that government will narrow the gap between itself and the citi-zen, with everything that implies, be it desirable or undesirable. However, the deci-sions that lead to these changes are not subject to the sort of broad balancing ofinterests that also gives full consideration to the underpinning and process-basedprinciples. As we have already seen, for example, opinions in civil society about theepd are sharply divided - and yet there is no forum that allows all these differing opinions to be expressed at the policymaking level. 3.2 conclusion ict has been embraced enthusiastically by politicians and policymakers and has had a clear influence in many different areas of policy. Because there is a strongtendency to think of ict as an instrument and to colour the debate about digitiza- tion in this way, it is much less evident that ict also fundamentally changes the nature of government, changes how its responsibilities and duties are interpreted,and changes how it operates. There is little or no discussion on these issues andtheir impact on the relationship between government and citizens - both as indi-viduals and collectively. With regard to the driving, underpinning and process-based principles, discus- sions on the consequences of ict for the driving principles often fall prey to a rhetorical form of accountability (Robinson et al. 2010). There is thought to belittle need to argue the case for more effectiveness and more security. As for theconsequences for the underpinning principles, what is often lacking is in-depthanalysis. In everyday life, these principles are frequently reduced to a section onprivacy in the explanatory memorandum accompanying a piece of legislation.Government's very real tendency to make the use of ict mandatory in the rela- tionship between government and the citizen, and the citizen's diminishing free-dom of choice in this matter, are ignored, although it is still, theoretically, the case98 igovernmentthat 'unwilling' citizens must be allowed to transact their business through the 'paper channel'. The original proposals for the public transport chip card, forexample, did not give passengers the option of travelling anonymously, and thesolution devised later was minimalist. There is also little regard for the impact ofdigitization on the process-based principles or for the need to make appropriatearrangements if something should go wrong. The current Government underPrime Minister Mark Rutte may make it a more explicit priority to bring such prin-ciples into balance; the coalition partners (Liberals & Christian Democrats) haveagreed that \"Information security and personal data protection will be improved.Wherever possible, deadlines will be set for planned measures regarding the stor-age, linking and processing of personal data and the effectiveness of such measureswill be checked thoroughly at the preparatory stage\" (official translation ofRegeerakkoord vvd -cda 2010: 56). 21 It will only be possible to take the more comprehensive approach intrinsic to realis-tically balancing driving, underpinning and process-based principles when ict has become politicised. As will be clear from the discussion above, that is in fact gradu-ally happening, thanks to the efforts of the Senate, the House, and organised groupsof citizens. The situation is still volatile, however; it is difficult to predict whichtopics (applications) will and will not attract attention. It is clear in any event that,where a proposed application obviously represents interference in social relations,it will be introduced by means of the most rigorous instrument possible, i.e. an Actof Parliament. But even then, debate can be neutralised by exaggerated trust in ict (as an instrument), as occurred initially in the case of the biometric database. Whenthe proposed application resembles a neutral technical 'gadget', the tendency willbe to avoid any discussion of the topic. But vital social issues can be found even in'gadget-like' subjects such as the bsn . The point is to survey the wider conse- quences as comprehensively as possible and weigh up the pros and cons. The most important conclusion, however, is that, despite a tendency to view tech- nology and applications from an instrumentalist perspective, fierce debates some-times arise about them - but that such debates are virtually nonexistent when itcomes to information flows and links between applications. The many examplesgiven above show that there have been few if any attempts to assign autonomoussignificance to information flows and links or to acknowledge such significancepolitically. Accountability with respect to these issues is often even less evidentthan in the case of applications. The most elaborate justification that can be foundis something along the lines of \"We will link files xand ybecause doing so will produce potential advantage z.\" Even in such cases, the question is narrowed down to the desirability of the target (z ). The only attempt at evaluation is to ask whether ict has made it easier to achieve that target. Accountability for informa- tion flows, it seems, has not become part of the mental framework of politiciansand policymakers.99 managing egovernmentnotes 1 For more details, see B\u00f6hre 2010. 2 See, for example, the No-Q pilot launched at Schiphol Airport on 26 May 2010: http://english.justitie.nl/currenttopics/pressreleases/archives-2010/100525electronic-border-crossing-starts-today.aspx?cp=35&cs=1578. 3 nup (2008) National Implementation Programme on Service Delivery and eGov- ernment.

Inaddition to the national plans debated in the Senate and House of Representatives,a variety of local authorities and government agencies are working on their ownplans and projects, relatively independently and far removed from parliamentarycontrol. eGovernment is not only being rolled out 'on the shop floor'; it is alsobeing built there to a significant degree. There is ample scope for bottom-up initia-tives. The national systems debated in Parliament are often nothing more than aplatform for a multitude of existing local initiatives. That is the case, for example,with the epd and the Reference Index for Juveniles at Risk. Prior to the official launch of a system - either by national government, a government agency, or alocal authority - it has often been trialled extensively in the field, for example in acertified pilot project or in everyday practice, regardless of any formal decision-making. One example of the latter is the practice of Automatic Number PlateRecognition ( anpr , see Section 4.3). There is therefore every reason to examine the user side of eGovernment applications, particularly when the user and thedeveloper are one and the same. That is the case for the Tax and Customs Adminis-tration and other large-scale administrative agencies that have long led the way inpromoting the benefits of digitization. Local government officials have also beenactive in that respect, with local needs and requirements inspiring local authoritiesto develop their own, more tailor-made approach to the electronic child dossier,for example. The police are gradually extending their information toolkit; theWork and Income Chain en Inkomen, bkwi ) has grown into a crucial source of data for all the organi- sations acting under the Organisation of Employment and Income which in turn cooperate with one another on the digital client dossier ( digitaal klantdossier ,dkd ). The Tax and Customs Administration allows taxpayers to submit their returns onlinethrough a secure portal, and the Social Insurance Bank ( svb ) is working to extend the 'Citizen Policy' website (www.burgerpolis.nl), where individuals can request apersonalised statement of their social security status and share stories about theirexperience of the social security system. 4.1 implementation without boundaries 4.1.1 so many actors, so many reasons The Centre for Vehicle Technology and Information ( Rijksdienst voor het Wegver- keer, rdw ) has been hard at work in recent years making a business case for the electronic driving licence ('eLicence'). \"In conclusion, it will be possible to place a103chip on the driving licence, something that can help combat fraud and provide a valuable electronic service\" ( rdw 2008: 5). The rdw wants to use the driving licence chip, an option provided for under the third euDirective on driving licences,1for something more than simply meeting the eu's new anti-fraud requirements. It has recognised an opportunity to play a key role in eGovernmentby turning the driving licence into a generally applicable form of idthat offers electronic authentication with a high degree of security 2for all kinds of digital government services. The rdw can be ambitious in this respect largely because government has not yet come up with an authentication tool providing security atsuch a high level. Right now, it is only private actors that offer such a tool, and thepublic infrastructure provided by the DigiD system (which works with a passwordand text-message system) will be made inadequate by such plans as those offeringpatients the option of reviewing - or even amending - the data in their epd , or allowing individuals to overwrite their number plate registration number elec-tronically. At least three ministries have spied an opportunity to position them-selves as future leaders in eGovernment and have launched their own authentica-tion initiatives. In addition to the rdw 's eLicence, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has also stepped into the ring with its eRecognition programme, while theMinistry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations is introducing a new version ofDigiD and a follow-up to the earlier, unsuccessful, electronic Identity Card (e nik ). What these initiatives have in common is that most of the relevant stakeholdersconsider the involvement of commercial partners crucial to the system's success(CapGemini Consulting 2010a: 14). Public-private partnership appears to bethe prevailing motto: \"The rdw is considering making electronic authentication available to private parties as well\" ( rdw 2008: 15). There are many reasons why organisations may wish to transcend their ownboundaries at the operational level and share applications (for example an idcard) and information with others. For the rdw , the reasons lie not only in the need to combat fraud and streamline services; they are also related to its position in theeGovernment of tomorrow. Some partnerships are created out of the 'pure neces-sity' of tackling complex social problems jointly, according to the initiators.Programmes meant to improve aspects of public safety, such as the ReferenceIndex for Juveniles at Risk, are a case in point (Keymolen & Prins 2011; Holvast &Bonthuis 2010). Other partnerships are established because it would be impossibleto undertake complex policy initiatives involving multiple organisations (benefits,care allowances) in any other way and have them succeed. Sometimes the decisionto join forces is made very explicitly, for instance in the case of the ManifestoGroup, set up by eleven such agencies 3to supply the public and businesses with government-wide information and services. More generally, bottom-up initiativesoften spring from inadequate eGovernment policy at ministry level (Gatewaynup 2009). 4104 igovernmentIn short, ict is used in a wide variety of ways in the everyday work of govern- ment: projects are launched for all kinds of reasons, partnerships take many differ- ent forms, the information-sharing mechanisms vary widely, and the stakeholdersare extremely diverse. If a single, unified eGovernment exists at all, it is not at theoperational level. What is more, many of the organisations working at this levellack a well-defined structure or coherent staffing and budgeting system. \"One ofthe hallmarks of a virtual organisation is precisely the lack of a clearly definedstructure and distinct organisational boundaries. Virtual organisations are oftenorganisations in with ever-changing processes of electronic inclusionand exclusion\" (Bekkers 2000: 12). One obvious case is the rinis Foundation (Institute for the Routing of (Inter)National Information Streams), which servesas a broker between information supply and demand. Originally, it was the SocialInsurance Bank ( svb ), the National Social ( Landelijk Bureau Inning Sociale Verzekeringen ) Institute (Landelijk Instituut Sociale Verzekeringen ) that took the first services to 11 'sectors' 5and in 2009 handled more than 177 million messages ( rinis 2010: 3), almost double the number in 2008. Data is also exchanged with organisations abroad: svb and the voor Zorgverzekeringen, cvz) use their European sister organisations ( rinis 2010). Bekkers refers in this connection to 'colonisation' and the 'blurring of boundaries': \" rinis is integrating a growing list of domains that lie outside the field of social insurance. It continuesto extend its territory, and that means that the boundaries between all sorts ofpolicy domains are beginning to erode\" (Bekkers 1998: 139-140). 4.1.2 overlapping policy domains, services and motives It was more than a decade ago that Bekkers recognised the first signs of boundaryerosion due to ict . Today, dismantlement is in full swing. In many cases, one and the same application or source of information is used for service, care and control,and different applications increasingly make use of the same data. There arenumerous examples, and a glance at the list of notifications maintained by theData Protection Authority reveals many strange bedfellows. As 'partners in thechain' (in reality, as network partners), organisations such as the Social SecurityAgency ( uwv ), the Centre for Work and Income cwi ), and the Social Insurance Bank (svb ) have long shared employment and income data with the help of the Work and Income Chain Computerisation Office ( bkwi ). A few years ago, however, the Labour Inspectorate ( Arbeidsinspectie ), the Social Intelligence en Opsporingsdienst , siod ) and other similar investigation agencies also joined in. In 2010, the Data Protection Author-ity investigated siod 's practice of drawing up risk profiles based on data obtained from municipal officials, the Tax and Customs Administration, and the Public105 from policy to realityProsecutions Service, which it used not only to investigate benefit fraud but also to track individuals suspected of carrying a risk of criminal or anti-social behav-iour, or who might benefit from extra support. In the latter case, siod also used data provided by school attendance officers to create links and generate profiles(cbp 2010b). Figure 4.1 Input for the development of the Public Transport Chip Card Based on the ov2Pay program, in ecp-epn (2010: 23)106 igovernment PUBLIC TRANSPORT CHIP CARDAnother example relates by the Education Executive Agency (Dienst Uitvoering Onderwijs , duo ). duo shares data - not always anonymised - with the Municipal Personal Records Database, Municipal Social Services, the Taxand Customs Administration, the Social Insurance Bank, the Ministry of Justice,various educational institutions, and certified school and career consultants. \"Inaddition, it is possible that the Minister of Education, Culture and Science will hireStatistics Netherlands ( cbs ) or a commercial research firm to approach a specific client group.\" 6 The situation was equally complex in the case of the public transport chip card,which involved a convoluted combination of services, actors and sectors. Asfigure 4.1 shows, dozens of parties signed up while the initial plans were still onthe drawing board: various public authorities (the Ministry of Transport, PublicWorks and Water Management and 35 government authorities active in the area ofpublic transport), a wide range of transport companies, passenger organisations,the Royal Dutch Touring Club ( anwb ), and a whole range of third parties, includ- ing 'card issuers' (banks, a supermarket chain) and the suppliers of the communi-cation systems and other equipment (De Kok et al. 2001; 298). The Tax and Customs Administration has turned itself into a key exchange for fraud investigations in the social security and care sectors. Various members of theSenate have commented in interviews that data is linked selectively, however;links are created to track down fraud, but not to trace individuals entitled toallowances. 7The Tax and Customs Administration has long been authorised to request information from third parties (Zwenne 1998), but it now gathers increas-ingly large quantities of information behind the backs of taxpayers in order to\"avoid increasing the amount of red tape that the citizen is obliged to deal with.\" 8 It not only gathers information from familiar sources such as the Land Registry,Chambers of Commerce, employers or banks, but also from websites such as eBay,LinkedIn and social networking media. Cooperation is also no longer just a question of individuals deciding to share data and dossiers; domains sometimes overlap via entirely automated processes. Forexample, when the Central Fine Collection Agency ( Centraal Justitieel Incasso Bureau , cjib ) decides to collect an unpaid traffic fine, it is, officially at least, the public prosecutor who takes the decision. In practice, however, the procedure isentirely automatic and it is a computer that issues the collection order. The cjib can then \"use rinis 's computerised reference index to recover fines from income derived from employment and recurrent benefits without a writ of executionhaving to be issued\" (Bekkers 1998: 93). Service and control are opposite sides ofthe same coin, according to Steven Luitjens and Dirk Schravendeel, two of thepeople who led the introduction of the 'basic records database'. 107 from policy to reality\"Basic records databases make data transfers possible. Government can take advantage of this option to check up on citizens and keep control of them, but it can also use it to provide a betterservice to citizens ..., to involve them more in the democratic process and to clarify what datagovernment has and what it does with that data. [These are] opposite sides of the same coin\"(Schravendeel and Luitjens 2001: 362). 4.1.3 the eoperations toolkit In terms of operational procedures, of course, the practice of merging information processes and making the boundaries between policy domains fluid is not entirelynew. Various administrative agencies have long made it possible for other partnersin the public sector to consult their systems online and even alter data in them(Bekkers 1998: 135). As far back as the 1990s, researchers grew interested in theinfluence of computers on the relationship between policymaking and policyimplementation and on the traditional boundaries between policy sectors at theoperational level (Snellen 1994; Van de Donk & Frissen 1994). Authors even cameup with sleek new 'new' government: 'linked-up state' (HirschBallin (Zuurmond1994) and 'virtual state' (Frissen 1996). Since then, the job of building this 'other'government has been tackled with mounting enthusiasm. Recent policy initia-tives - the streamlining of basic records, the reference indexes, and the popularityof working in 'chains' (in fact, often networks) - have increased the speed at which operational procedures have been digitally interlinked in recent years. Thenew toolkit is also gradually changing government's administrative reality, andthat reality appears, in turn, to be increasingly shaping the way government viewssociety. The most important types of arrangement are:- Working in regulatory chains and networks;- Multiple applications, organisations and e-dossiers making use of the same data; - Creating reference indexes, 9interfaces10and national exchanges11for the neces- sary connections and the resulting the data flows within the chains andbetween the dossiers; - Streamlining this data traffic using the Citizen Service Number ( bsn ) and authentic records so that every organisation has access to a single, uniquepersonal idnumber and an authoritative source of information. \"In theory, then, it should always be clear where the information can be found andwho is responsible for it. It should also (theoretically) be clear what purpose the in-formation serves and that the information that is found can be trusted\" (Nether-lands Court of Audit 2010a: 18). Things are somewhat less reliable in practice, how-ever - as Ron Kowsoleea and other victims of identity theft can attest (Buruma 2011;Office of the National Ombudsman 2009a). Another clear indicator is the attitude ofthe Tax and Customs Administration toward the use of the Municipal Personal108 igovernmentRecords Database (gba). Because the quality of the gba is not entirely guaranteed, the Tax and Customs Administration has insisted that the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations allow it to deviate from the basic records database. If a tax-payer says that his or her gba record is incorrect, Tax and Customs bases its assess- ment on the data that the taxpayer supplies (Tweede Kamer 2009-2010i). Minister ofFinance Jan Kees de Jager had this to say at a meeting with the parliamentary financecommittee: \"The idea behind the gba is a very good one, but it's clear that one part of the supply chain that Tax and Customs cannot control nevertheless has an indirectimpact on the services it provides\" (Tweede Kamer 2010-2011b: 11-12). What are typical targets for the various tools in the eGovernment toolkit? An ict- based supply chain or network approach aims to dismantle the partitions between different organisations, making them more efficient and allowing them to work ina more problem-based or demand-driven fashion ( suwi Expert Committee on Information Provision and Service Delivery 2005; Van Duivenboden etal. 2000; Grijpink 2006a). Digital dossiers facilitate data-sharing, for example dataon indicators shared between the Social Security Agency ( the uwv Job Centre Centre ( ciz ), mee 12and local government within the context of various unemployment and reference indexes and national exchanges are instrumental in joining up a patchwork of tensof thousands of local databases and as many electronic dossiers housed in count-less public and semi-public organisations. The epd is one such national exchange. It would have allowed - had it not been rejected by the Senate - authorised indi-viduals to request information that is held by various care providers (Pluut 2010).It is therefore not a centrally stored digital dossier, but an infrastructure thatallows for information sharing. The epd and other infrastructures make use of the bsn , a unique, general and non-informational personal number that identifies individuals in their transactions with government (Tweede Kamer 2005-2006a).It is also a serial number that helps prevent duplication of data files within govern-ment and unlocks the system of basic data and authentic records. \"Although it isnot yet a policy priority to use the bsn in police and other investigations, there is little doubt that that will quickly change,\" commented a consultancy firm someyears ago ( hec 2007: 70). Authentic records and basic data can also guarantee all kinds of partnerships and supply chains within government a single, unequivocal,authoritative source of information (Tweede Kamer 2000-2001b). The main ideabehind the basic records databases is that local authorities and government agen-cies need only ask citizens and businesses for information once, and that use ofthat information is then compulsory within government. Basic records are consid-ered the key to alleviating the administrative burden, delivering public services,combating fraud, streamlining the internal machinery of government, and makingpolicy data available. They are now referred to as the system of basic records data- bases , 14indicating that the legal, informational, technical and organisational coor-109 from policy to realitydination and links between records are such that they can be used throughout government. In that sense, they are the 'backbone' of government informationmanagement. 15Basic records databases contain legally binding facts about a grow- ing number of 'objects' subject to government jurisdiction (people, cars, build-ings, streets, etc.). These facts, which constitute the basic data for a rising numberof government applications, are consequently being used by a growing number ofpublic-sector organisations. In theory, the system of basic records databases offersan excellent opportunity to strengthen the position of the citizen, for examplebecause it could be designed in a way that makes it easier for people to alter thedata, submit applications or requests, or claim certain rights. So far, however,government has not made much use of the emancipatory potential the basicrecords databases (Boschker, the eOperations toolkit consists of a burgeoning collection of technical facilities that includes databases and standardised information such as uniquenumbers. Standardisation, normalisation and the semantic interoperability 16of all these facilities are considered crucial issues (Standardisation Board & Forum2009). In order to ensure that every tool in the toolkit works seamlessly with theothers, the relevant targets, constituent parts and agreements have been set out inthe National Implementation Programme for Service Delivery and eGovernment(Nationaal Uitvoerings Programma Dienstverlening en eOverheid , nup ( Nederlandse Overheids Referen- tie Architectuur , of the Standardis- ation Forum (Bureau Forum Standaardisatie ) - consisting of experts from govern- ment and the business world - plays a coordinating and facilitating role (ForumStandaardisatie 2010). The Forum acts as a think tank for the StandardisationBoard (College Standaardisatie ), whose members are senior civil servants. It is proving to be quite a challenge to develop some of the tools in the toolkit, asevidenced by the devastating gateway review of the nup that a special review committee (chaired by Arthur Docters van Leeuwen 17) sent to the House of Representatives early in 2010 (Gateway nup 2009). 4.1.4 a changing administrative reality Government information management is changing, step by step and in fits andstarts. And it is precisely at the 'street' or operational level - where organisationswork most closely with citizens and communicate regularly with them - that wesee most clearly how the new information management is changing government'srelationship with the citizen and the position of citizens. In the late 1980s, Frissenpredicted that databases would become Ten years later, VanDuivenboden examined data-linking practices at the Municipal Social Servicesand the rdw and concluded that in both cases, these practices were shifting the110 igovernmentburden of proof from government to the citizen (Van Duivenboden 1999: 322). For example, the linking up of databases at the rdw had shifted the burden of proof \"to the vehicle owner, who will himself have to approach the gba, the Tax and Customs Administration or his insurance company. ... In that sense, there is a rela-tionship between building and expanding a virtual records database and increas-ing the citizen's responsibility for setting an erroneous record straight\" (VanDuivenboden 1999: 229). This trend has been confirmed in reports by the Office ofthe National Ombudsman stating that the rdw has compared vehicle registration records, insurance records, and the motor vehicle test records \"from the current allthe way back to January 1995\" (Office of the National Ombudsman 2008; Office ofthe National Ombudsman 2009b). A decade later, Overkleeft-Verburg found inher examination of case law that judges are indeed increasingly inclined to holdcitizens accountable when incorrect data is used (Overkleeft-Verburg 2009: 74).The same trend can be seen in the United States, with responsibilities previouslyborne by government and businesses being progressively shifted to the individualcitizen, in this case with respect to identity fraud (Whitson & Haggerty 2008).But there are also other changes afoot. Specifically, new information managementsystems also divide processes and responsibilities between different governmentbodies: the introduction of basic records databases means that the responsibilityfor taking the final decision, for example on an application or a request for a bene-fit, is now separate from the responsibility for keeping the basic records straighton which that decision is based. What that means for citizens is that they mustnow deal with two government bodies instead of one, as in the past. In addition to the shift in their respective positions, the public authorities and citizens also find themselves becoming vulnerable in new ways. For government,the new vulnerabilities include increasing system abuse (Govcert.nl 2009: 9),deficient digital archiving, and the inability to view data in its historical or othercontext or to prioritise data according to importance, vulnerability or sensitivity,or to check its accuracy. A case in point is a report by the Office of the NationalOmbudsman on a procedure used by the Tax and Customs Administatration tomonitor people setting up a business. The procedure involves comparing filesmaintained by the Tax and Customs Administration (tax rebate for self-employedpeople) and by the Social Security Agency (reported number of hours worked).Based on this comparison, the level of fraud in the relevant years (2007, 2008and 2009) was taken to be between 26 per cent and 40 per cent. Almost 3000self-employed people subsequently received demands for payment of back taxes,had sanctions imposed on them, or were even liable to prosecution. When theOffice of the National Ombudsman investigated the matter, it found that thetwo files had been compared without any consideration being given to the mean-ing of the data in its individual context. Many of those accused of fraud ultimatelyturned out to be innocent of any wrongdoing (Office of the National Ombuds-man 2010b).111 from policy to realityFor the public, many of the new vulnerabilities are related to the networked nature of information - in other words, the shared use and management of informationin a network of actors that arises through the supply chains, interfaces, referenceindexes, etc. mentioned earlier. Such 'networking' is often regarded as nothingmore than a technical exercise, but in reality its repercussions go much further. Asnoted earlier, the supply-chain approach has led to a growing number of organisa-tions becoming interwoven through their systems, with the Citizen ServiceNumber (bsn ) playing a crucial role. Technology facilities the interconnections and makes information flows between organisations possible, but the correspon-ding connections in terms of responsibilities and liabilities are frequently notforthcoming. In short, the legal semantics cannot keep pace with the technicalsemantics. The same observation was made in a recent government 'trend report'(a biennial publication) on trends in local public administration: there is a muchgreater level of cooperation than there used to be, but the common denominatorin all the partnerships is that the partners retain their autonomy in policymaking(Ministerie van bzk 2010: 36). That means that responsibility is still defined institutionally, along the lines of the traditional structures of public administra-tion. The result is that responsibility for information processes is fragmented (with dif- ferent actors responsible for different segments of the chain), or that it more or less'disappears', because the various parties are able to do nothing more than refer casesto one another if the transition to ict has simply not been interpreted in terms of re- sponsibilities. In short, the use of technology and the idea of organising policy-relat-ed information about citizens into chains conflicts with the traditional hierarchy ofgovernment. In both a technical and in a practical sense, people in fact already workwithin chains (or networks), but the decision-making, the division of responsibili-ties, the legislation and the supervision mechanisms have not yet been tailored to re-flect these new practices. What is lacking is an overall strategy for organising coordi-nation and responsibility when information is circulated in networks and chains ofgovernment organisations (Borst 2009: 262). What is also missing, according to var-ious insiders, is an organisation that takes binding decisions when problems such asidentity fraud arise, or when no one organisation is prepared to 'own' a problem andtake responsibility for errors in the chain. For example, in a study of the problemsthat the bsn has caused citizens, a consultancy firm reports: \"As far as we are aware, the Ministers involved in implementation schemes that make use of the bsn have not made any specific policy arrangements concerning vigilance in this regard, or appointed an official who has the authority to review such cases and assist the relevant citizen. We do not believe that the Data Protection Official provided for in the Citizen Service Number(General Provisions) Act has either the necessary position or the requisite powers\" ( hec 2007: 68).112 igovernment4.1.5 beyond effectiveness and efficiency Ultimately, government's stated aims and the new tools available should contribute to improving service delivery, care and control. Even at the operational level, how-ever, it is difficult to decide how to measure that contribution and what criteriashould be applied. Should effectiveness and efficiency be the yardstick, or a muchbroader set of criteria, such as those defined in the 'Citizen Service Code'? 18The State Secretary for the Interior said the following about the Code in 2007: \"It is onlyone of the instruments available to us. I have yet to decide whether and how we willuse it\" (Burger@Overheid.nl 2007: 94). The new technologies can vastly improveefficiency, and in the best-case scenario, one could say that what is efficient for gov-ernment is also efficient for the citizen. Johan Hakkenberg, director of the rdw and chairman of the Manifesto Group, pointed out the advantages for both the publicand government of the 'Message Box', a \"secure e-mail system that enables users toexchange digital messages with Dutch government agencies at national, provincialand municipal level, as well as with the water boards\" (see www.answersforbusi-ness.nl/messagebox). 19Citizens are free to decide to receive communications from the relevant agencies in their Message Box, rather than on paper. The Message Boxoffers them a facility for receiving information and for transacting business withgovernment, but it also serves as an archive. Each year, government agencies sendout 600 million letters. Cutting the number sent by post by 100 million not only cre-ates a new public service but also represents a significant cost reduction. Another op-portunity that has been taken advantage of relates to the rdw website. After con- sulting a user group, the rdw decided to organise the site by target group and from the client's perspective. It now gets 30 million hits a year. Online transactionsthrough the site's self-service facility are particularly popular; they save clientsmoney and are available 24/7. For example, now that it is possible to suspend a vehi-cle registration online, the number of suspensions has increased by 40 to 50 per cent.According to Hakkenberg, an enormous number of visitors also wish to inspecttheir own personal data. Finally, the following passage, taken from the 2008 AnnualReport of the ibGroup - the government agency that administers student grants and loans, now part of duo - can serve as an example: \"In 2008, clients logged in to My ib-Group 2.9 million times to inspect their personal data. In more than 600,000 cases, visitors amended that data digitally. In addition, 2008 was the first year that students were able to indicate on My ib-Group whether they wanted to receive digital notifications about their student grant or loan. Some 375,000 notifications were sent digitally rather than byregular post. 2008 was also the first year that proactive e-mails containing customised information were sent to My ib-Group users. For example, the ib-Group sent an e-mail alert to prospective students who had already enrolled in a higher education programme but had not yet requested astudent grant\" ( ib-Group 2009: 20).113 from policy to realityIn addition to driving principles, however, underpinning principles such as privacy are also given their due at the operational level. Although privacy is notconsidered important in every context (Zenc 2007: 77), and although both the cpb and the Office of the National Ombudsman have regularly publicised cases inwhich government agencies have violated an individual's privacy, it is certainly aprinciple etched into the consciousness of the larger agencies, in any event. A study conducted by Van Duivenboden more than a decade ago already revealed aconcern for privacy at the Municipal Social Services and the rdw (Van Duivenbo- den 1999: 234). When agencies are particularly keen to respect their clients'privacy, this is in part because they work very closely with the public and commu-nicate regularly with citizens. In some cases, privacy is also an explicit factor in the'business case' for a new e-service, precisely because the success of the initiativedepends on its being accepted by the public. Van Duivenboden's study demon-strated a relationship between an organisation's struggle to maintain autonomy onthe one hand and scrupulousness when dealing with personal data on the other:\"In addition, making explicit agreements as to which data may be inspected orreceived and vice versa also supports the Municipal Social Services' desire to oper-ate as autonomously as possible\" (Van Duivenboden 1999: 178). This observationis important, given that the desire to work in networks and chains and throughexchanges appears to be detrimental to privacy. Many of the individuals inter-viewed for this book have observed that networks and chains are linked at theinterface between the public and private sectors, but that there is no adequateregulatory arrangement to monitor the way the private sector uses the data itobtains from the public sector. Henk Tankink and Jan Willem van Dongen of thePersonal Records Database and Travel Documents Agency ( bpr Agency) comment as follows: \"The gba supplies information to pension insurers, motor vehicle inspectors, bailiffs and other parties as part of their public tasks. But these parties work in the private as well as in the public sector. Although the procedure that leads up to the supply of data is quite strict thanks to the log-insystem, once the data has been provided, monitoring is limited and there is no supervision of howit will ultimately be used.\" 20 With so many different partners in the chain, a host of practical problems have arisen relating to the quality of that data and whether it is being dealt with scrupu-lously enough. The Office of the National Ombudsman concludes: \"Chaincomputerisation can perhaps solve certain administrative problems and quickenthe pace of innovation in government, but there is little reason to rely too much onits effects\" (Office of the National Ombudsman 2009a: 28). The process-based principles of transparency and accountability appear to be under pressure at the operational level, however. We referred previously to the114 igovernmentfragmentation of responsibility, and even to its occasional 'disappearance' in cooperating networks and chains. One good example is the case mentioned earlierof the social services inspectors, who link up a large number of files in order togenerate risk profiles. The Data Protection Authority told the Social Intelligenceand Investigation Service ( siod ) that it should have informed the individuals in question; siod responded by saying that it considered that the job of the regional intervention teams. After all, argued siod , it was they who supplied the indicators showing a higher risk of benefits fraud ( cbp 2010b). Transparency - for purposes of democratic engagement and supervision - has also turned out to be difficult.Straten (1996: 254) concludes that politics had been sidelined while the gba was being developed. Based on studies relating to the ibGroup (student grants and loans) and the Central Fine Collection Agency ( cjib ), Zouridis (2000: 318) claims that the process of developing ict systems within these organisations had proved so unwieldy and complex that political involvement had been minimal. \"Does thelaw play the coordinating and regulatory role that we assume it does, given theprimacy of the legislator and of political deliberations? Or are we rather witnessingthat the law itself is becoming the product of interactions with the organisationand ict?\" (Zouridis 2000: 318). The answer to these questions is all the more urgent given Zouridis's observation that there are gaps in the way accountabilityfor systems development is organised: \"For example, how transparent is the algo-rithm in the computer system? In the case of student financial aid, the system hasbeen referred to as 'full of spots and blemishes' and difficult even for insiders tocomprehend ...\" (Zouridis 2000: 315). The case of the Reference Index for Juve-niles at Risk shows, moreover, that the statutory foundations are often providedonly after the projects have been up and running for quite some time and theirstructure and design have long been decided (what data is to be included, who is tosupply the data, who will have access to it, what other initiatives will be linked toit, etc.) (Keymolen & Prins 2011). 4.2 local struggles On 28 October 2009, the Board of Chief Commissioners adopted their strategicagenda on camera surveillance, entitled Beelden van de Samenleving (Images of Society). The foreword outlines the problems and dilemmas that the police face. \"Public and private camera surveillance has so far been insufficiently professional and coherent. In addition, public and private parties are increasingly making use of intelligent camera systems, whichcompare observations and recorded images of persons and vehicles with a variety of different data-bases. The question that we are faced with is: what are the limits? There is risk involved in pursuingdata because it is conducive to public safety and security, and in exploiting the advantages of tech-nology: the risk of gathering and interlinking vast quantities of - often unnecessary - information.This is undesirable from the vantage point of privacy\" (Board of Chief Commissioners 2009: 3). 115 from policy to realityLocal authorities and the police play a key role in how ict is used at local and regional level. What is typical of the dynamics at this level is that both parties act with relative autonomy, resulting in an extremely wide range of initiatives, prac-tices and criteria. Also typical, however, is that both struggle palpably with adilemma: on the one hand, they are keen to take advantage of the unparalleledadvantages of digitization for their work; on the other, they themselves believethere should be limits to what they are permitted to do. Many of the local adminis-trators and officials interviewed for this book said they were dissatisfied and frus-trated by the lack of guidance at the national level when faced with decisions. Theyfelt they had been abandoned by a whole host of organisations and institutions,ranging from the Association Nederlandse Gemeenten , vng ) and the Data Protection Authority to the ministries responsible. The committee that conducted the gateway review of the nup (mentioned earlier) makes the same point: \"Many respondents are specifically critical of vng 's failure to play a proactive role thus far and its reluctance to take the lead on topics that require concerted action and standardisation. The same criticism was also levelled at the Ministry of the Interior as the 'coordinating ministry'\" (Gatewaynup 2009). 4.2.1 local authorities 2.0 Local authorities have their own reasons for undertaking ict innovation (for example digital tracking systems for permit requests, new back-office data ware- housing concepts), but above all else, they play a key role in helping nationalgovernment achieve its various digitization aims. These aims initially concerneddigital service delivery, with projects ranging from e-forms, personalised webfunctions on MijnOverheid.nl (MyGovernment.nl), and linking municipal services to the DigiD system to revamping the gba, simultaneously introducing authentic records and basic personal data, and, recently, launching the Antwoord\u00a9 initiative (Answer\u00a9), which makes the local authority (i.e. the digital local authority) the key resource for citizens' faq s. 21 More recently, however, local authorities have also played an important role inrolling out ict initiatives related to control (issuing passports and, as a result, applying biometrics) and care and control (Reference Index for Juveniles at Riskand the 'Safe Houses' described above). It is clear that the boundaries are shiftingat the local level as well, especially the boundaries between differing policydomains. Care is being linked to control, as in the Reference Index for Juveniles atRisk. But the boundaries between the public, semi-public and private sectors arealso becoming blurred. The organisations participating in the National Debt Infor-mation System ( Schulden , lis) include not only local116 igovernmentauthorities (municipal social services department), but also energy companies, housing corporations, members of the Association for Debt Assistance and SocialBanking ( Nederlandse Vereniging voor Volkskrediet, nvvk ) and the Salvation Army (lis 2009). Safe Houses organise meetings open to institutions not previously involved in any direct way in caring for juveniles at risk - for example childcarecentres, playgroups, credit banks, the Salvation Army, and after-school childcarefacilities - and their participation gives them a say in issues outside their tradi-tional scope (Holvast & Bonthuis 2010: 32, 33). Increasingly, local authorities aremaking use of private camera surveillance centres to help maintain public orderand safety. A quarter (24%) of all local authorities split the cost of security cameraprojects with private companies (Schrijenberg et al. 2009), turning them akind of 'deputy (Torpey 2000; Lahav security' (Rozemond 2010; Boutellier2007). Computerised 'professionalism' One frequent aim of local authorities is to use ict tools to generate management information. That is clearly one of the ideas behind the Juveniles Reference Index:it is also used locally to monitor processes and allow social workers to superviseone another's work (Keymolen & Broeders 2010; Keymolen & Prins 2011). Profes-sionals can be instructed and processes or services evaluated according to produc-tivity criteria, based on the management information generated by various data-bases, ranging from the public transport chip card to the Reference Index forJuveniles at Risk. The extent to which public servants and professionals are freeto act (their professional autonomy) comes under pressure when the choices thatthey are expected to make relating to and on behalf of citizens, taxpayers, patientsand so on are influenced and moulded by the automatically generated profilesconstructed by government. Zuurmond has explored this trend from a sociologi-cal perspective and refers to it as 'infocracy' (Zuurmond 1994). Bovens andZouridis (2002) refer to the shift of decision-making authority from the street-level bureaucrat to the screen-level bureaucrat and, finally, to the system-levelbureaucrat. Zuurmond and Meesters (2005) suggest that in a networked environ-ment, system-level bureaucrats are in turn elbowed out by chain-level bureaucrats- individuals with broad discretionary powers to decide on the design of anetwork's information systems and processes. Lyon (2009), in speaking of identi-fication and id cards, refers to 'stretched screens', an observation that also applies to the staff of the tax office's dial-up information desk and the national govern-ment's public information service, 'Postbus 51' (Office of the National Ombuds-man 2010a). In their conversations with callers, these staff members are limited tothe information that appears on their computer screen. All this puts pressure onprofessional autonomy, freedom of choice, and the human dimension, leading tomore vulnerability 'at street level', which is precisely the level at which manypublic servants and other professionals who deal with government's ict systems117 from policy to reality(for example physicians working with the epd ) in fact do their work. The feelings of alienation that technology can create in the public apply equally to profession- als, of course. This vulnerability is not rooted in a system's technical breakdown ormalfunctioning, but rather in unpredictable 'breakdowns' within social contexts, where it has an unintended effect - dysfunctionality - or comes up against attemptsby professionals to circumvent technology in order to prevent their metier frombeing hedged in by it (Van den Akker & Kuiper 2008). For example, alongside the'official' medical dossiers that physicians are obliged to share through the nationaldata exchange, they are also allowed to keep 'shadow dossiers' with more detailednotes. The impotence of local authorities The huge number of clever plans and ambitious targets often obscures the fact thatmany local authorities are struggling with eGovernment. For example, on 1 June2010 11 per cent of local authorities had not yet joined the Municipal PersonalRecords Database (gba) system, even though use of this system had become compulsory on 1 January of the same year (Tweede Kamer 2009-2010a). In ad-dition 32 per cent of those who had joined were not yet ready to be connected tothe system, and 5 per cent of all citizens - i.e. 800,000 people - had been regis-tered incorrectly. But local authorities also come up against questions relating tothe traditional organising principles of public administration. The strong emphasison customised digital service delivery causes tension in the municipal organisa-tion because the everyday reality of client-centred working conflicts with tradi-tional values and attitudes in public administration (Hoogwout 2010). There isalso friction between digital support for client-centred services and the statutoryregimes that deal with personal data. Clie nt-centred services force local authorities to dismantle their data-management systems and develop a new organisationalmodel, the 'middle office'. The middle office is supposed to mediate between thelocal authority's client contact centre (the front office) and the various back-officesystems from which all necessary data must be retrieved. In addition to a greatdeal of financial and other misery and the ups and downs of systems development(Mom 2010), the introduction of the middle office has led, at a more fundamentallevel, to information being retrieved from the data warehouse for activities andtasks beyond those permitted by law, without any scrupulous discussion takingplace. 22Ultimately, a lack of available funding and expertise means that small and even some medium-sized local authorities are almost incapable of managing thecomplex technical and policy-related know-how needed to be transformed intoeGovernment. But even larger authorities find this difficult: in the autumn of2010, a crisis in the City of Amsterdam's ict system jeopardised the transfer of benefits by the social services. The most important reason for such problems identified in the CapGemini report Puzzelen met prioriteit (Puzzling over priority) (Van Duivenboden & Rietdijk118 igovernment2005) is that eGovernment is regarded as a technological issue that should be the responsibility of ict departments or operational management. Policymakers do not recognise the implications for society of utilising technology, and give nothought to the context. They find it difficult to explain the political discourse in away that the 'techies' understand, while the ict experts, in their turn, are inca- pable of providing technical specifications in a way that reflects the social andpolitical context. Consultants quickly move in to bridge the gap between the two,according to both the CapGemini report and those interviewed for this book. 23 They also indicate that, too often, local authorities end up having to reinvent thewheel, and that there is little guidance either from national government or theAssociation of Dutch Municipalities when it comes to good commissioning prac-tices. For example, the chairman of the Manifesto Group, Johan Hakkenberg, 24is critical of the Jorritsma Committee, which advised on public services provisionand suggested in 2005 that local authorities should be made the first point ofcontact of a reliable and authenticated portal to all of government from 2015onward. This is Answer\u00a9 concept ( Antwoord \u00a9, Jorritsma Committee 2005): \"No matter which channel private persons and businesses choose - be it the singlephone number, the municipal website, or the service counter at the town hall -they will always receive the same reliable answer to their questions, will knowthat their applications are being processed, or will be referred to another govern-ment organisation.\" 25Drawing on his professional experience, Hakkenberg comments that it is completely unrealistic to expect local authorities to build upthe huge digital knowledge database needed to provide such a service, let alonemaintain and update it and communicate its contents to citizens through a singleservice desk. No helping hand or guidance Ultimately, local limitations have cons equences for how th e broader development of eGovernment is structured and democratically monitored. Regardless of thecircumstances - be it a national digitization policy with some projects being super-vised by national government, a national sector-specific policy in which systemsplay a supporting role, or a local authority's own ambitions when it comes toinnovating and updating its information management systems - local governmentvirtually always operates in a context of overlapping policy domains involvingmany different parties. That is precisely why it is so important, particularly at thelocal level, to pay attention to the broader context in which applications arecreated, to allocate responsibilities, and to make arrangements for proper monitor-ing. In reality, however, the enormous variety of local initiatives and the manypublic and private stakeholders involved make proper supervision, monitoringand enforcement difficult. Public safety is a driving principle at the local level,often at the expense of privacy. A case in point is the enthusiasm with which aSafe House Amsterdam staff worker greeted a computer search program calledTopic View. 119 from policy to reality\" 'Topic View is unique ... Every day, it gives us all the information found in all the police files. Not only the official documents, but also Word files that the police have quickly put on the system.'Topic View also contains 'soft information'. 'Say someone drives a pricey car, but his family is indebt. In the past, we'd work on reducing the debt. Now, though, we look for the illegal source ofincome. An information specialist processes the available information and we then put out requestfor further information\" (Holvast & Bonthuis 2010: 34). There is little question of the Data Protection Authority actively supervising this and other local practices, however. The case of the Reference Index for Juveniles at Risk shows that two 'realities' are in fact emerging: the reality of the drawingboard at the national level, where a system is defined and given a statutory basis, and the reality of the 'shop floor' at the local level, where both the technicalsystem and the underlying information processes take shape. The issues considered at the national level and the concern shown about the impact on citizens scarcely play a role in the referral systems created on the shop floor. There, in particular, it is the driving principles that rule supreme (Keymolen & Prins2011). The question then is how much coordination and guidance are required from national government. The catalogue of struggles, determination to seize opportu-nities, fragmented applications and lack of democratic supervision is largely theproduct of the 'Dutch culture of public administration'. Decisions cannot simplybe imposed on local authorities; it is difficult to influence them, and they oftenrequire administrative agreement, something that involves lengthy procedures.Although the Government has now taken on board the Oosting Committee'ssuggestions for improving inter-administrative supervision, local authorities oftenchart their own course in digitization and information processes (a more compre-hensive ekd than the restricted one proposed by the Minister), or decide them- selves on the pace at which they will introduce new technology. Many localauthorities are still asking citizens to log in to their electronic services using a username and password, even though such combinations should have been replacedon 1 June 2009 by the DigiD code ( nup 2008: 21-23). And some local authorities are still not working with the gba, but using their own population records instead. The national government has attempted to guide and put pressure on local author-ities by introducing various 'acceleration agendas' and other initiatives, but theDutch system of government does not lend itself well to meeting the nationalauthorities' digitization aims. In the meantime, an entire world of interlinkedsystems and information processes is developing at the local level. For example, alllocal systems for the Reference Index for Juveniles at Risk have been linked withone another via a national 'umbrella', so that warning signs relating to youngpeople at risk can be shared throughout the country. It is therefore striking that thephenomenon of digitization scarcely figures, if at all, in the current debate about120 igovernmentthe overhaul of the public administration system. For example, the discussion paper issued by the Association of Dutch Municipalities (vng ) - which bears the meaningful title Thorbecke 2.026- does not devote even a single word to the influence of ict on the Dutch system of public administration ( vng 2010). And although the Advisory Council for Public Administration (Rob 2010b: 25) doesexamine typical features of eGovernment, for example horizontalisation and frag-mentation, it makes only one explicit reference connecting ict/computerisation and public administration: local authorities' problematic knowledge gap whensetting up their own interactive websites. 4.3 information-based policing 4.3.1 strategic orientation and practices In recent years there have been many different national programmes intended todefine the form and content of digitization throughout the police force: the use ofbiometrics to ensure more accurate personal records and profiling; smart monitor-ing of transit nodes (roads, ports, stations - known as nodal orientation 27); the use of open sources of information such as Facebook and its Dutch counterpart,Hyves, for investigation purposes; and greater use of ict to analyse and enhance information. These programmes once again show a desire for prompt, forward-looking action and, notably, prevention: \"The transition from information-driveninvestigation to information-driven policing will be continued\", according to the Board of Chief Commissioners in 2005 (2005: 17). The individual local andregional police forces play a key role in implementing plans and achieving targets.But like the local authorities, the local forces are also struggling to keep up withthe national targets and with their own autonomy as they implement projects anddevelop projects of their own. There are numerous examples. The comprehensive approach to investigating and combating identity fraud within police systems is faltering, with police forcespassing the buck when a citizen insists on having erroneous data removed (Buru-ma 2011). The notion of 'virtual moats' around cities, which made such a splash inthe media when proposed a number of years ago, has virtually ground to a haltowing to problems encountered by local forces. 28A study commissioned by the Police Academy criticises the 'nodal orientation' launched in 2005 by the Board of Chief Commissioners, concluding that 'front-line' police officers are strugglingto meet the targets imposed on them from above in their daily work (Ferwerda etal. 2010). Progress has been made on monitoring roads, waterways and railwaystations with a view to identifying large numbers of users, based on collaborationwith non-police services and making use of advanced sensor and identificationtechnologies. Nevertheless, the targets have turned out to be difficult to meet,according to the report, mainly owing to a stubborn focus on area-specific police121 from policy to realitywork and a lack of specific guidelines. In July 2010, the Minister responsible was obliged to tell the House of Representatives that some aspects of the police infor-mation management system were faulty. His conclusions were unmistakable:\"Great risks have been taken when implementing the basic facilities, endanger-ing the reliability and continuity of information provision. In that respect, therehas been no improvement in the way the Dutch police forces operate at the locallevel\" (Tweede Kamer 2009-2010c: 2). Interviewees who work for the policeindicate that local forces are too often obliged to reinvent the wheel and receivetoo little guidance or support from the national authorities when faced with dataprocessing and information quality problems. Examples range from the policeforce's participation in the Reference Index for Juveniles at Risk to its efforts tocombat identity fraud. As regards the latter, local authorities and the police havebeen at odds for many years now about how best to tackle passport fraud. Localauthorities want to provide the best possible service to citizens and replace lostpassports as quickly as possible. The police, on the other hand, focus on lawenforcement and crime investigation, and so advocate a more restrictive passportreplacement policy. A similar dispute has arisen at airports, where the borderpolice focus on control and the airlines focus on service delivery (Snijder 2010).Now that the biometric passport has been introduced, various stakeholdersconsider it vital for national government to offer more coordination and guid-ance in this area. Box 4.1 The police and social media The public's growing use of social media is also affecting how public actors such as the police and the Public Prosecutions Service operate. They are making considerable use of social networkingmedia as a communication strategy or as a forum for their investigations. The initiative usuallyarises 'from the bottom up'. When the neighbourhood policeman uses Twitter, he makes himselfvisible on a communication channel that is an important window on the world for a growingnumber of 'clients'. Increasingly, the organisational risks involved in an informal approach of thiskind are considered acceptable trade-offs for a more direct relationship with the public. Anothersocial media strategy gets even closer to the essence of police work. Increasingly, the police and thepublic prosecution are asking the public to assist them in their investigations. Initiatives such asBurgernet ('Citizen Net', www.burgernet.nl) and the Hyves page maintained by the IJssellandpolice force (www.depolitiezoekt.hyves.nl) can be regarded as 'crowdsourcing' in police work. Thedownside of such initiatives is that they can generate a flood of useless tips; sorting through themthen becomes part of the inquiry. Ed Kraszewski, a spokesperson for the National Police ServiceAgency ( Korps landelijke politiediensten, kldp ), recently said in an interview that it took a lot of time to wade through all the information generated by police announcements, and that such infor-mation had not proved very useful in tracking down escapees. 29He stated that his team sometimes got 'bogged down' in all the information. 122 igovernmentThe real information goldmine is not generated by the police force itself, however, but by unsus- pecting Web users. Almost everyone leaves a digital trail of relationships, behaviour, locations andso on behind on the Web. When the police enter the digital realm, users - i.e. suspects, but otherusers as well - end up paying the price for the 'eternal memory of the Internet', where bits andpieces of their life course can be found. Almost every police force in the Netherlands has nowjoined the Internet Investigation Network; 30which runs on stand-alone computers that the police use to track the movements and activities of people without them being aware of it. Socialnetworking sites can also be 'harvested' on a much larger scale, without there being any specificreason for doing so. This functionality is one of the objectives of the Expertise Centre for Intelli-gent Data Analysis ( kecida ), a department of the Netherlands Forensic Institute, 31which believes that the 'yield' harvested from such public sources is particularly promising. It is far from certainwhat requirements (guarantees) should be imposed on such activities: some critics say that'systematic observation' calls for the same degree of caution and restraint in the digital world as inthe physical one, 32whereas others point to the public nature of the digital trails that people leave behind (Buruma 2011), implying that no special guarantees are necessary. 4.3.2 cooperation and coordination, provided that ... The initiatives launched by the Dutch police have the same features as the projects discussed earlier:- systems and data are rapidly becoming entwined and interlinked at the techni- cal level, but there is no parallel allocation of responsibilities or move towarduniform requirements in the organisational and political-administrative sense; - the information boundaries between policy domains (service, care and control) and actors (public-private) are becoming blurred; - it is once again proving difficult to manage and coordinate along hierarchical lines. The outcome is aptly expressed by the chief commissioners in their discussionof the use of private camera surveillance centres: \"The question is whether thismethod offers sufficient guarantees of quality, integrity, democratic supervisionand management in government control\" (Board of Chief Commissioners 2009:23). The 'spontaneously' and widely used Automatic Number Plate Recognition(anpr ) system serves as a good example. The police use this camera technology to enforce public order and investigate crime, comparing files on individualsunder investigation, on stolen vehicles, and on unpaid fines with the data gath-ered through the anpr systems. But it has not taken long for anpr to be used for a whole string of other purposes as well: the police are also using it to tacklethe problem of drug runners - a strategy that does not always have the approvalof the courts 33- and of groups of cross-border 'bandits' who operate in the Netherlands. It is also being used by the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Envi-ronment, in cooperation with the police, to monitor waste transport, by the123 from policy to realityTransport and Water Management Inspectorate to check on transport by taxi and whether taxi drivers are taking legally required breaks, by rws (Rijkswater- staat , the executive arm of the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment) to control traffic flows, and by the Tax and Customs Administration to check upon various taxes (Tweede Kamer 2009-2010a; for earlier examples in othercountries, see Bennett, Raab & Regan 2003). The absence of any special form ofguidance or moderation imposed by politicians has led to enormous variety notonly in the applications and, therefore, actors, involved, but also in the length oftime that data is supposed to be retained. \"The IJsselland regional police forcestores the data for seven days, the Drenthe force for fourteen days ... The Rot-terdam-Rijnmond police force saves data for four months because anpr is also used in crime investigations, for example drugs smuggling. Some forces retaindata for even longer periods\" (Brouwer-Korf Committee 2009: 68). After thecommercial research firm Regioplan studied the value of using anpr on the A28 motorway near the city of Zwolle and concluded that the system did indeedprovide useful information for investigations, and that it also uncovered addi-tional information that would not have emerged otherwise (Tweede Kamer2010-2011f, 24-25), the Minister of Security and Justice, Ivo Opstelten,announced in December 2010 that legislation would soon be forthcoming. Theproposal provides for retention of all data collected, be it data on 'suspicious'individuals or cars or on non-suspicious ones. 34His announcement led mps Gerard Schouw and Magda Berndsen (D66, democratic liberal party) to raisenumerous questions, for example about the possibility of leaks and violations ofdrivers' privacy (Tweede Kamer 2010-2011g: 1-2). 4.3.3 forgetting Ultimately, it is precisely the ability of the police - and, by extension, the courts -to gather information from a wide range of sources that has repercussions for theconcept of 'forgetting' in the digital era and in eGovernment (Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger2009; Solove 2007; Buruma 2011). Technically speaking, the right to be forgottenand to 'start again' is virtually impossible for purported criminals who are brandedas such on the Internet (Prins 2009: 119). It is in the nature of the Internet to saveand copy, not to forget. Forgetting is also no longer technically necessary to free upstorage capacity. Although legislation does prescribe time limits for storing data,the purging of databases appears to have little operational priority (Neuman &Calland 2007; Buruma 2011). In addition, people in many organisations andcertainly those in investigation services are inclined to think that data may even-tually come in useful at some point. For example, Choenni et al. (2011) concludethat the national police ReCognition System ( HerKenningsdienst Systeem , hks ) - a database of the names of all individuals who have been reported to or bookedby the police - contains 8,000 suspects, who are in fact deceased. In addition, thenames of 2,800 individuals who have been cleared of all charges are still in the124 igovernmentsystem. Although these are only fractions of the total number of names in the database, the researchers recommend a more thorough screening of police systemsfor data contamination, especially since the police use these systems and others toconstruct risk profiles and because they are increasingly being interlinked. In anearlier study, Grijpink concluded that the computerised fingerprint system usedby the Dutch police contained more than 101,000 cases of demonstrably fraudu-lent use of fingerprints (Grijpink 2006b). Box 4.2 Ubiquitous memory: car keeps track of driving behaviour Information technology is not just revolutionary in terms of storing data; it is equally potent in generating it. Every sensor and every chip generates output. That output has a specific function, but it can also be used for new, unanticipated purposes. Memory chips in cars are a good illustra-tion. Most cars have diagnostic information systems that monitor the engine's performance.Known as On Board Diagnostics ( obd ), such systems have been compulsory in most cars in Europe since 2001, for environmental reasons. The standard obd system records the engine emis- sions, alerts the driver where necessary, and enables mechanics to trace problems. But car manufac-turers are at liberty to build smarter systems with more functions and, consequently, with morememory. For example, certain makes of cars have what is known as an Event Data Recorder, whichstores data on certain incidents, for example the speed the car was travelling before a collision.Garages find such data useful when servicing vehicles, but they have also been shown to be valu-able in other situations. For example, in 2009 the Rotterdam police used a vehicle's event datarecorder to find out the speed of a pick-up truck involved in a traffic collision in late 2009 that leftfour people dead. The recorder showed that the truck had been travelling at 147 kilometres an hourfive seconds before the accident. Based in part on that information, the driver was convicted ofreckless driving in September 2010. It took considerable technical ingenuity to read the relevantinformation, something that other police forces in the Netherlands are not yet able to do ( nrc Next , 26 April 2010). In practice, people are virtually powerless to correct an erroneous virtual profile. Apart from the fact that the police and the courts are slow to remove or overwriteinformation in systems, it is almost impossible for an individual to find outprecisely what data is being stored on him or her, or where - a dilemma touchingon the process-based principle of transparency. Requests to inspect informationnot kept in a criminal record but nevertheless stored elsewhere (logs, minutes ofinterviews with individuals who ultimately did not provide any useful informa-tion, reports on activities that did not produce results, etc.) are virtually nevergranted (Kielman 2010: 157; Buruma 2011). And although it is prescribed by law,there is no truly effective system for finding out what methods are being usedagainst an individual, or what information is being kept on him or her (Buruma2011). Another problematic issue is the right to correct data. It is not at all excep-tional for someone who turned out later to have been unjustly suspected of a125 from policy to realitycrime - for example because of an administrative error by the police or the office of the public prosecutor - to remain coded in the system in such a way that the courtsare reasonably likely to refuse him or her a Certificate of Good Conduct or acertain permit (Buruma 2011). 4.4 design and manifestation eGovernment is really put to the test at the local and operational level, i.e. bygovernment agencies and by local or regional authorities. That is where applica-tions are often built, either stand-alone or as part of a nation-wide system, andwhere systems have to prove their usefulness not only in interactions with'clients' but also to those who actually employ them in their work. The same canbe said of the underlying principles: the proof is in how they are elaborated andput into practice. Decision-making that is 'close to the people' has a certain valuein this respect. Administrative agencies offer a good setting for building specificexpertise, and local government is where local wishes and circumstances can bestbe taken into account. Nevertheless, diversity at the operational level can alsounbalance the structure of eGovernment. The situations described in the previoussections suggest that sometimes the motto seems to be 'anything goes' (as withcamera surveillance or the Topic View example given above). At the same time,voices have been raised in favour of more guidance and support. What this showsis that the variegated and sometimes chaotic picture of eGovernment that emergesat the operational and local level is often unintentional. The driving principles of security, effectiveness and efficiency also dominate at the operational and local level. These are often thought to be decisive, and indeed,they often are. Sometimes, technological imperatives should in fact hold sway.After all, government does not operate in a vacuum: ict-driven innovation offers many opportunities that cannot simply be rejected, and it has already made suchinroads into society that government simply must keep up. One clear example of atechnological and social imperative is government's duty to establish identities.That duty plays a role in the aforementioned need to achieve 'authentication at ahigher level of assurance' than provided by the tools currently available. Identitydocuments have always been an important factor in social transactions, as it is notonly government but also private individuals who require reliable identification intheir dealings with others. The need for secure digital identity guarantees is equally urgent, simply because the digital world has added another layer to publiclife. The question then is whether government is bound to produce the technologythat will solve the digital identity problems that are becoming more pressing allthe time. In that light, the entrepreneurial role that the implementing bodies aretaking - such as the rdw with its eLicence - provides a welcome impetus for tack- ling this government task. As noted before, multiple government organisationsare vying with one another in this area to put 'their' solution 'on the map'. At the126 igovernmentsame time, the entrepreneurial role that various public authorities have assumed in this area indicates that the situation has become unbalanced and rudderless. Ascountless examples illustrate, there is a plenty of leeway for public actors to pursuetheir aims, but also for private ones that want a piece of the action. Relatively fewrestrictions apply in this wide-open field. The rise of the Safe Houses is a case in point. This is a significant development and one with far-reaching implications for the citizen: they are nodes for the mostsensitive information, drawn from all kinds of different sources. Nevertheless, theSafe Houses arose spontaneously at the local level (Holvast & Bonthuis 2010) andthey continue to operate without being subject to any special rules. They are notthe only examples of developments in which a highly diverse group of actors areinvited to come together and work 'behind the scenes' in areas previously unfa-miliar to them. There is a great deal of confusion: the roles are divided on an ad hocbasis, in many cases without careful consideration, and proper frameworks arefrequently lacking. Such confusion does nothing to promote policy effectivenessand efficiency - the reason the initiative was launched in the first place. ict systems often run into serious problems: they do not, as a matter of course, fulfilwhat is often taken to be their promise, i.e. to simply make existing policy'smarter' (to do the same, but better). The instrumentalist viewpoint sometimesobscures the magnitude of some undertakings, as noted above with respect to theAnswer\u00a9 initiative, which was supposed to be the apex of customisation. It is farfrom easy to develop and maintain a system that lives up to such high expecta-tions, including those of the street-level bureaucrat. As noted several times above,communication between public administrators and system developers or betweenpolicymakers and government agencies about many eGovernment applicationsoften resembles a Tower of Babel. In addition, inherent technological risks such asmisinterpretations in data-mining or files that are unreadable in other ways havemanifested themselves, without these problems leading to a genuine review of therelevant ict systems and their interaction with users. The systems themselves can also suffer from communication problems. And they frequently do; otherwise,interoperability and semantic streamlining would not be such priorities. The wayeGovernment is developing at the local level also shows that decentralisationcomes at a cost, and that it is not always so efficient and effective to make localauthorities responsible for rolling out the entire spectrum of applications becausein many cases their organisations are too small to tackle the job properly. In addi-tion, eGovernment would be considerably more expensive if every level wasequally concerned about the quality of information. The example of the Tax andCustoms Administration - which feels obliged to maintain a parallel personalrecords database because the proposed universal system, the gba, is insufficiently accurate - speaks volumes.127 from policy to realityeGovernment projects are far less likely to be built on the underpinning and process-based principles, and there is some hesitation about openly tackling theissues that these principles should bring into view. The most notable develop-ment, discussed several times above, is the breaking down of partitions betweenpolicy areas and of government organisations at the local and operational level,including those between the public and private sectors. These partitions areincreasingly being regarded by both government and the public as impediments toeffective action, but also as a barrier to a distinct identity: a unified government,approachable through a single service desk, is not a government with strict inter-nal divisions. But as the process of 'departitioning' continues in order to promote auniform identity (the one-stop service desk) and effective action (working inchains and networks), something is lost as well. Witteveen (2010: 219) describesthe Weberian ideal type as follows: \"Bureaucracy emerges in liberal societies thatpursue freedom by separating domains from one another.\" Even with all theirdisadvantages, partitions encourage scrupulous, well-defined government action,and in doing so protect the freedom of the citizen. Citizens can developautonomously - in other words, they can nurture personal freedom of choice andprivacy - because they know that government organisations have been set up for aspecific purpose and are not permitted to undertake activities beyond theirnarrowly defined duties and powers, even if those activities might otherwise bedesirable. That demand, for a specific purpose for government action, is growingincreasingly nebulous when it comes to information (as the rise of 'virtual organi-sations' such as rinis demonstrates), and citizens must now be aware that when 'their' information falls into public hands, it may go on to lead a life of its own.Although government bodies have differing interests and objectives - the policeand local government, for example, disagree about issuing replacements for stolenpassports - they are increasingly utilising the same 'pooled' information. 4.5 conclusion All things considered, eGovernment has already overcome many barriers, but ithas not yet begun to develop any notion of the broader and more fundamentalconsequences of digitizing and de-partitioning its operations. This conceptualvoid has a particular impact on the position of citizens and the level of protectionthey enjoy. There is often a misbalance between what ict enables administrative agencies, local government and the police to do and what these same actors areundertaking to help the citizen keep up with the same process of digitization.Instead of the symmetrical empowerment of citizens, they are increasingly beingasked to remain vigilant themselves and acquire new skills in order to compensatefor the lack of transparency, and to cope with an increased burden of proof. Thegrowing tendency of government to work in chains and networks has not inspiredit to reconsider its responsibilities in the light of the citizen's position. The playingfield that then emerges is one where the public authorities come up with creative128 igovernmentsolutions and do their work with the best intentions, but where citizens are given little to go on in the longer term. The outlines of the new, ict-driven operational reality have yet to emerge in the relationship between government and the citizen(individually and as a group). The playing field changes shape daily, and ostensiblyby itself, but there is no sign yet of the institutional review that should accompanythese changes. If all efforts remain focused solely on the array of opportunities,however, and the protective frameworks are ignored, the insidious weakening ofthe citizen's position will continue. One urgent factor in this connection is that government has no overall strategic agenda or framework for 'forgetting'. If the rise of ict has made anything clear, it is that forgetting no longer happens spontaneously. The gradual realisation thatforgetting is a virtue (Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger 2009) is tied to the observation that thequality of government information is not always what it should be, and that thecitizen's right to privacy is gradually being undermined: if nothing is forgotten,then individuals can never break free of their past, and must remain wedded to theprofile that government has created of them with the help of technology andinformation. The impact of 'images from the past' has been greatly increased bytechnology, especially because there is a tendency to pin people down onpresumed identities which hinder their autonomy (freedom of choice), so tospeak, from the inside. The same holds for the 'images of the future' formed byprofiling. In short, a greater effort will need to be made to build underpinning andprocess-based frameworks for eGovernment, based on the realisation that forget-ting serves a purpose (not only for citizens, but for government itself). In the end, the lack of transparency and accountability on the operational side of eGovernment can only be rectified by government itself (and primarily by thenational authorities), because it is impossible for individual citizens to penetrateto the inner circle of government information management without additionalsupport and assistance. Assertive individuals who are aided by ict can obtain and disseminate plenty of information about policy; they can even disseminate embar- rassing policy or other government-related information (witness WikiLeaks) orgenerate it themselves (see Chapter 7). But the very same assertive citizens areoften in a much weaker position when it comes to information pertaining to themas individuals - the type of information on which the decrees and decisions of eGovernment are based. The frameworks for transparency (citizens' position withrespect to information) and accountability (citizens' access to and power to rectifyand amend information) will not develop on their own.129 from policy to realitynotes 1 Directive 2006/126/ec of the European Parliament and of the Council on driving licences, ojl[2006] 403, pp. 18-60. 2 Authentication involves demonstrating that someone is who he says he is (includ- ing by means of digital technology). 3 The Tax and Customs Administration, Statistics Netherlands ( cbs ), the Central Fine Collection Agency ( cjib ), the Health Care Group Naturalisation Service ( ind ), the Land Registry, Chambers of Commerce (KvK), rdw , the Social Insurance Bank Social Security Agency ( uwv) . 4 Interview with Prof. A.

It is therefore obvious that information flows do not stop at nationalborders. As the wrr observed in 1998, information technology undercuts the significance of territorial boundaries. Today, governments are enthusiasticallyembracing that very feature. The global security drive after 9/11 has played a majorrole in this, but so has the extent to which the euMember States have harmonised and coordinated their policies in a whole range of different areas. Information-sharing is important, after all, not only for security reasons; inside the externalborders of Europe, it is also helping to complete the internal market and streamlineadministrative cooperation in many different forms. Although the Netherlandsinitiates and makes bilateral agreements governing data exchange (for example in2010 with the United States relating to mutual access to one another's databasesfor fingerprint and dna profile matching 1), the way it uses technology and its attempts to expand information flows are influenced mainly by trends and devel-opments at the European level. There are now a growing number of European databases in which personal data is circulated 'beyond the borders', and which areused as a basis for decision-making by administrative bodies in the euMember States. The scope of these databases is expanding. Such European systems indicatea far-reaching level of integration: government at the European level is also, explic-itly, evolving into eGovernment. A further factor is that the euis also a source of legislation that sets the standard for national eGovernments. Domestic privacylaw, for example, is largely derived from European legislation on privacy. eGovernment applications and arrangements made at eulevel have similar features to those at the national level, but their institutional setting is entirely different. Below, we analyse the nature of the eu's databases by looking at the roles and positions of the actors in this setting. The latter are not limited to theformal institutions of the eu, but also include the various actors other and bodies that influence European policymaking. 5.1 european information databases and information flows \"Neither the Schengen area nor the euinternal market could function today without cross-border data exchange.\" Thus begins a Communication by the Euro-pean Commission, published in mid-July 2010. The Communication presents\"for the first time, a full overview of eu-level measures in place, under imple- mentation or consideration that regulate the collection, storage or cross-borderexchange of personal information for the purpose of law enforcement or migra-133tion management\" (European Commission 2010a: 2-3). What is notable about the Communication is that the developments it describes primarily concern informa-tion rather than technology. The policy strategy that is presented focuses oninformation and provides a basis for reflection on \"the possible need for develop-ing a European Information Exchange Model based on an evaluation of currentinformation exchange measures\" (European Commission 2010a: 3). There is nodoubt that innovations in hardware (storage capacity, computing capacity, speed,and portability), software (interactivity, Web 2.0), and other technical facilities(biometrics, rfid ) also matter in European policy, but the implications of Euro- peanization, globalization and upscaling are most in evidence in cross-borderinformation flows. The dozens of databases that have been introduced at theEuropean level in recent years link Dutch citizens and their personal data - virtu-ally - to the millions of people who live in the other Member States. The MemberStates and the us can make generous use of these databases, either directly or indirectly, thanks to a range of official rules, complemented by what is for most- including the European Parliament 2- an unknown number of vague bilateral and informal agreements. Both the text of the Commission's Communication andits annexes reveal a cross-border digital 'lucky bag' of databases, with the Nether-lands featuring, incidentally, as one of their major users (see Broeders 2009). Andyet at crucial moments, there are gaps in the exchange of data, for example asrevealed by a major vice case relating to child abuse at a day-care centre in Amster-dam in December 2010. The main suspect, an employee at the centre, turned outto have had a previous conviction in Germany for possession of child pornogra-phy, but because the European criminal records information system ( ecris ), agreed on in 2007, was still in the test phase in late 2010, his criminal record wasunknown to the Dutch authorities. Nevertheless, empirical analysis of the situa-tion in the Netherlands makes clear that data exchange generally does not stop atnational borders. Thanks to globalization, the Dutch government's informationpolicy is increasingly being dictated and organised at a higher order of scale, andindeed being implemented in international or Europe-wide applications andsystems. 5.1.1 international security as the driver The key drivers behind the internationalization of information flows are thesystems set up to tackle the problems of irregular migration, cross-border crime,and - in particular - international terrorism, a battle that the ushas been waging and championing since the attacks in New York and Washington dc in 2001. National security, and the fact that immigration and security are now regarded aslinked issues, rank as an important impetus for the new digital information flows(Lyon 2003; Zureik & Salter 2005; Boswell 2007; Guild 2009). Politicians andpolicymakers - including (and perhaps especially) those in Europe - have enor-mous trust in technology and are enthusiastic about the digital exchange of infor-134 igovernmentmation as the solution to these problems. Some years ago, a member of the Euro- pean Parliament, Carlos Coelho, warned that citizens could become the victims of\"an atmosphere of the 'impossibility of error' under all circumstances\" (Liberatore2005: 15). Box 5.1 Technology points the way: European migration databases A network of databases has been developed and introduced in Europe over the past twenty years intended to make migration 'manageable'. The new technology has proved to be enormouslytempting in this respect: not one of the systems is still limited to the purpose for which it was orig-inally set up. Indeed, the history of the migration databases shows that the design decisions takenin the first version of the application often deliberately accommodated the later expansions andadditions that have taken place. The Schengen Information System ( sis) rapidly became so popular that plans were laid to develop a sis ii system as far back as 1996. sis ii is still in the development phase, however, and over time the Member States have gradually added new items to their wish list; they wanted more informa- tion categories (biometrics, for example) and access to data maintained for new crime-fighting andcounter-terrorism organisations. The European Commission has been extremely practical asregards these wish lists: pending the outcome of political decision-making, it has ordered thedevelopment of a system that satisfies all the requirements. The system \"must be designed andprepared for biometric identification to be implemented easily at a later stage, once the legal basis,allowing for the activation of such potential functionalities, has been defined\" (European Commis-sion 2003: 16). The political decision adopted in 2007 concerning the functions of sis ii refers to fingerprints and photographs, but a research report by the uk's House of Lords has established that the system will also be suitable for iris scans and dna profiles. The technical capability is already in place; what is required is 'merely' to create the necessary legal scope (House of Lords 2007: 20, n. 43). A similar expansion in functions can be found at eurodac . Originally set up to combat 'asylum shopping', the eurodac database quickly acquired a new purpose: to identify third-coun- try nationals found illegally within the territory of an euMember State. The ability to 'check' and identify people illegally residing within euterritory is an optional function, but rapidly grew so popular that when it evaluated the system, the Commission proposed storing the data on suchindividuals as well as just checking it. Function creep is not only an issue when developing specific systems, but also when linking up different systems. The Visa Information System ( vis) has been designed for interoperability and synergy with systems that already exist or that are currently being developed. Right now, vis and sis ii are 'separate containers', but in fact they share the same database and technical lay-out andthe central databases are even at the same physical location. The technical design is entirely gearedtoward connecting the databases and allowing contact between differing information flows. For a detailed description of these systems, see Broeders (2007; 2011b).135 exchange without bordersThe European Union exerts an influence in two different ways. First of all, the Dutch government's own information policy has been shaped and - certainlywith respect to security issues - dictated by various legislative measures taken inrecent years at the European level. The Netherlands is naturally one of the negoti-ating parties in Europe, however, and that means that the eu's 'dictates' are not really imposed from above as much as Dutch politicians would sometimes like thepublic to believe. Striking examples include legislation on the use of biometrics inpassports and the retention of data traffic records (telephone and Internet). Thesecond way in which the euinfluences national government is by means of truly European applications and systems. The resulting information flows are moreEuropean than national and are therefore usually discussed and adopted at theEuropean level as well. Among the most notable examples are Since 1995, the Member States have beenworking at the European level to develop a network of databases intended tosupport various migration policy aims. Foremost among these are the SchengenInformation System ( sis) for registering and tracking irregular migrants and the use of false and missing identity papers; the eurodac system, an eu-wide finger- print database of asylum claimants to the eumeant to prevent 'asylum shopping' and ensure that asylum claims are dealt with in the country through which theasylum-seeker first entered the eu(known as the 'Dublin system'); and the Visa Information System ( vis), to be launched in a few years' time and consisting of a single, centralised personal data and fingerprint database of all those applying foran euvisa. The expansion of such European systems does not mean, however, that the countries connected to them have a single, uniform method for handling thedata that they are to supply. In the case of both the sisand Europol, it is clear that the participating countries do not all include (or exclude) the same data. 3 5.1.2 digital europe But digital Europe is taking shape in policy domains other than security, crime-fighting and crime investigation. For example, the aim of establishing an internalmarket and allowing the free movement of people, goods and services increasinglyrequires a supporting information infrastructure. A cross-border electronicsystem has been set up to implement the Services Directive. 4Known as the Inter- nal Market Information (imi ) system, it provides for the smooth exchange of data between Member States for purposes of both service provision and monitoring.5 On 3 August 2010, the European Commission released a video clip in which itproudly reported that the five thousandth organisation had been given access tothis system. The European Commission became active in eGovernment as far back as the 1980s and in particular in the 1990s (Kroon & Bekkers 1994). It began with the Delors136 igovernmentWhite Paper in 1993, which emphasised the importance and urgency of a pan- European information infrastructure for economic growth and competitiveness(Gomez-Barrosso et al. 2008). The year 1999 saw the launch of the eEuropeprogramme ( eEurope - An Information Society for all) as part of the Lisbon Agenda, which focused on making the European Union \"the most competitiveand dynamic knowledge-driven economy in the world by 2010\" (EuropeanCommission 1999). The eEurope programme's main aims are the following:\"bringing every citizen, home and school, every business and administration intothe digital age and online; creating a digitally literate Europe, supported by anentrepreneurial culture to finance and develop new ideas; ensuring the wholeprocess is socially inclusive, builds consumer trust and strengthens social cohe-sion\" (European Commission 1999: 2). In order to achieve these aims, the euwould have to work on creating a favourable legal context and on supporting newinfrastructures. The follow-up programme, eEurope 2005, interprets the aims interms of higher economic productivity as well as improved and increased access toservices for all European citizens (European Commission 2002). The i2010 eGov-ernment Action Plan promotes an open and competitive digital economy andemphasises the role of ict as a driving force for social inclusion and quality of life; in addition, it prioritises creating a European information area without bordersand encouraging innovation (Gomez-Barrosso et al. 2008). In some cases - specifi-cally with respect to services targeting citizens and companies - it is not centralgovernment or the European Commission that is taking the lead in developingintra-European data exchange infrastructures; rather, governmental or quasi-governmental organisations at the national level are organising themselves intoEurope-wide networks of similar national institutions in order to tackle the workof data exchange. Autonomous administrative authorities and agencies such as therdw and the Land Registry are active in such networks. \" 'Europe' facilitates such initiatives, but the new information flows and services are developing largely out of earshot of national and European public opinion. That means that this tangible formof European integration is, at best, evolving on the margins of public awareness. 6There is one exception to the rule that most of the changes in care and service are coming from the bottom up:the European Commission's cautious steps toward building up a European infrastructure for iden-tity management\" (Stevens et al., 2010). 5.1.3 expansionism Anyone who examines the many European digitization initiatives will note that - like the Netherlands - the European Union is under constant pressure to expandthe functions of these systems, to add more information categories to them, and toallow a growing list of authorities access to the data stored. That is true to a lesserextent for the systems used in the area of care and service (although on the website137 exchange without bordersfor the aforementioned Internal Market Information System, the European Commission states that \"the Commission is currently exploring with MemberStates in which other areas imi can be used\"), but it is certainly the case for the systems initiated in the areas of Justice and Home Affairs. For example, whereasthe first generation of databases (sis , eurodac and vis) focused mainly on 'prob- lematic' groups of migrants - asylum seekers and migrants requiring an entry visawho pose a risk of irregularity - the second generation of European informationsystems has cast its net much wider (Broeders 2011). This second generationfocuses on (1) all travellers worldwide and (2) using biometric data to check theidentity of all travellers wherever possible (Broeders 2011; Hampshire & Broeders2010). Passenger name records (pnr data) are compiled on all travellers, and the European biometric passport is being rolled out for all eucitizens who travel, although the Member States differ in the degree to which they store such datacentrally (B\u00f6hre 2010). The euis also debating a proposal for an eu-wide entry/exit system that - like the usVisit system - will register the biometric data of all people entering and leaving the territory of the European Union (Koslowski2008; Hobbing & Koslowski 2009). Although there is - as yet - absolutely no legalbasis for this proposal, it resurfaces again and again in all of the Commission's andCouncil's key documents. A series of conferences and feasibility studies in Brus-sels are preparing the groundwork for the next step in digitizing Europe's migra-tion policy. Such expansionism can be seen not only in the build-up of functions, but also in the swelling ranks of actors. It is not only Dutch policymakers and politicians whoare interested in the data gathered in th e private sector; there is also considerable interest in such cross-overs at eu level. And here too, the boundaries between the public and private sectors are becoming blurred: data is taken from the privateswift network (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication ) and airlines provide pnr data to the authorities in the United States, Canada and Australia (Mitsilegas 2009; De Hert & De Schutter 2008; Tweede Kamer 2010-2011e: 2). Work is now ongoing toward a more comprehensive euscheme for providing pnr data on passengers travelling between the Union and all non- eu countries (European Commission 2010a: 20; Tweede Kamer 2010-2011e, 2-5).In the meantime, the eu and the us have once again locked horns over the precise scope of the agreements governing the exchange of both bank and passenger data. 7 Another example of government's interest in data gathering from the privatesector is the Data Retention Directive mentioned earlier. Initiated after the terror-ist bombings in London in July 2005, the directive obliges Internet and telecom-munications companies to retain their customers' telecom traffic data records for aspecified period of time and to make them available to government. 8 One further dimension to this expansionist tendency is that national governmentsare exploiting the new European initiatives to go forward an extra step or two138 igovernmentthemselves. One example is the eu regulation on the integration of biometric features in passports, intended to combat passport fraud and forgery. The Nether- lands took advantage of this regulation, however, to set up a national biometricdatabase that will also be used for crime investigation purposes (B\u00f6hre 2010;Hermans 2010), much in the way that the rdw intends to use the Driving Licence Directive to turn the driving licence into an electronic id. The national database ran into political difficulties owing to increased public awareness of the associatedrisks, and has since been scrapped. The government stopped storing the data inJuly 2011 and is looking into the proper way to delete the records that had alreadybeen stored. Another example from several years ago is the process leading to theRequisitioning of Data Powers Act (Wet bevoegdheden vorderen gegevens). Thislegislation, which entered into force in 2006, was the result of euagreements in October 2001 intended to improve legal cooperation between the Member Statesin order to combat organised and financial crime, more specifically money-laun-dering. 9The process of adopting the protocol was speeded up after 9/11, and in the final version gives judicial authorities the power to demand the release of datafrom financial institutions. Before then, banks were able to decide for themselveswhether or not to provide such data (MacGillavry 2000). The Dutch Governmentused the new European protocol as a vehicle for adopting a large number of far-reaching proposals put forward by the Mevis Committee, which had studiedwhether the Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure ( Wetboek van Strafvordering) still offered a satisfactory legal framework for obtaining third-party information incriminal investigations, particularly in the light of ne w developme nts in ict (Mevis Committee 2001). As a result, the legislation passed in the Netherlands isnot limited to financial crime, but covers every sort of offence. It provides for a setof sweeping measures: investigating officers may also requisition all manner ofidentifying data on non-suspects in the interests of their investigation. In certainsituations, moreover, they may also requisition 'future data', meaning that datagenerated during an upcoming four-week period - including any 'real-time' data -must then be passed on the judicial authorities. 5.1.4 scant democratic supervision The European Data Protection Supervisor has warned repeatedly against thealmost innate desire to expand and accumulate, the tendency to merge issues and,in doing so, to combine security and migration policy, and the inclination to over-estimate the reliability of technology, in particular biometrics ( edps 2006). The European Parliament has also repeatedly criticised information gathering and dataexchange efforts in the area of Justice and Home Affairs, but until the LisbonTreaty entered into effect, it did not have the formal authority to exercise demo-cratic supervision. The Council of Ministers usually 'took note' of the ep's objec- tions without amending the proposals to which they pertained. 139 exchange without bordersThe national parliaments, until recently the watchdogs of European democracy in issues related to Justice and Home Affairs, have been generally ill-informed aboutthe substance of the proposals and the timing of the policymaking process in Brus-sels. For example, the Member States' parliaments have had virtually no influenceon the development of the Justice and Home Affairs databases. The internationalprocedure that led to biometric standards for passports being set by the Interna-tional Civil Aviation Organization ( icao ), the negotiations with the us, and the decision-making in the euthat preceded the Dutch legislative process all took place almost entirely beyond the reach of Dutch democratic supervision (B\u00f6hre2010; Broeders 2011), even though it was these procedures that defined the mainstandards for determining the path dependence of the Passport Act. Opinionsdiffer as to who is responsible for this absence of informed parliamentary supervi-sion. Some national mp s have expressed disappointment at the failure of their European counterparts to be more critical: former Dutch Senator Erik Jurgens(Labour Party) once mused that the problem with the European Union was thatthe European Parliament had too few members who were intrinsically vigilantabout human rights, meaning that they seldom expressed strong opinions on thematter. Jurgens feared that in those areas where the ephad become active, for example on the subject of data retention, its concern had more to do with theeconomic interests of the providers affected and less with the privacy issuesinvolved (Jurgens 2005: 98). It sometimes seems as if politicians in The Haguehave also become all too accepting of Europe's ambitions, however: \"Compared tothe critical attitude of the Dutch parliament with regard to the establishment ofsisI, the development of sis ii was discussed only marginally. On the few occa- sions when the Senate or the Second Chamber of parliament made an inquiryabout sis II, they rarely raised fundamental questions\" (Brouwer 2008: 452). The Dutch Parliament has occasionally been quite critical, for example with respect tothe retention period for telecom traffic data records. On other occasions, however,it has meekly followed the European example, for example by allowing limits to beset on legal protection related to cross-border data exchanges in vat investigations (Schenk-Geers 2007: 477). Nevertheless, there are signs that Brussels is starting to rethink the ever-expand- ing and, in particular, increasingly networked European data systems. The LisbonTreaty has 'normalised' policy in this sense: the European institutions will nowoperate in the traditional manner, meaning a stronger role for the European Parlia-ment and the European Court of Justice. The post-Lisbon ephas already flexed its muscles in its discussion of the swift agreements between the euand the us - agreements which it ultimately rejected. 10In interviews, the European Data Protection Supervisor Peter Hustinx11and the European legal expert Mitsilegas (Queen Mary, University of London)12pointed out that the new institutional framework would perhaps have a defining and qualifying influence on the policycontent. The European Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs would no longer be140 igovernmentable to take decisions behind closed doors. Just what such greater openness will result in is naturally uncertain as yet. 5.1.5 european interests are leading Digital service provision (both commercial and public) was at the top of the European agenda in the 1980s and 1990s, with euprojects aimed at facilitating Electronic Data Interchange ( edi ) succeeding one another in rapid succession (Mitrakas 1997). In the past decade, however, security has arguably been the mostimportant driver for expanding European information exchange systems and forharmonising the Member States' various measures, largely owing to the urgencyattributed to this area of policy. Few officials at the European level are askingwhether these measures have in fact improved security, and when they do, noanswer is forthcoming. That is not only because it is difficult to say how manyterrorist attacks have been prevented, but also because there is often no materialon which to base a proper evaluation. For example, Europol's reports in no wayestablish whether police cooperation and cross-border exchanges of police data areeffective counter-terrorism strategies and whether they should be expanded infuture (Fijnaut 2007: 137). But the European digital agenda is moving full steam ahead on more fronts than security. The coupled principles of effectiveness and efficiency also play a promi-nent role. For example, the European Commission concluded in January 2000 thatcertain forms of transparency and legal protection developed by some MemberStates within the context of exchanges of fiscal intelligence were incompatiblewith the growing demand for efficient information-sharing (Schenk-Geers2007: 5). Effectiveness and efficiency (in the form of cost-cutting and improvedaccess) are also the main drivers behind the growing European interest in interop-erability. Simply speaking, interoperability means the ability of systems to 'talk toone another', i.e. to communicate and exchange data while avoiding data loss. The2004 European Interoperability Framework makes policy recommendations relat-ing to the technology and the information content on the one hand and the inter-action between Member States' government information systems on the other.Initially, the priority was to arrive at a pan-European standardisation of eGovern-ment applications in the areas of service provision and care (for example by settingup pilot projects); these ranged from electronic toll charge systems and e-procure-ment to electronic signatures and digital patient dossiers (Ducastel 2008: 289).Now, however, the Union also wants the Member States to make police systemsinteroperable (Verbeek 2010: 34), and it is broadly promoting inter-sector inter-operability. 13These requirements move interoperability beyond the realm of effec- tiveness and efficiency. Discussions in the European Parliament show that thepolicy issue of interoperable national police databases is related directly to secu-rity objectives, making it a politically sensitive issue (De Hert 2006). The fact that141 exchange without bordersimportant treaties such as the Pr\u00fcm Convention ('Schengen iii') and the Hague Programme emphasise interoperability and the need for data exchange reveals the great political importance attached to information flows for security and investi-gation purposes (Broeders 2011). Still, the underpinning principles, and in particular privacy, appear to be emerging from the European shadows. In January 2010, euJustice Commissioner Viviane Reding noted the importance of data protection. She stressed the need to have asingle legal framework for data protection at eu level for both the private and the public sector, including for police and judicial cooperation. The framework shouldgive priority to transparency and ensure that individuals have control over theirown data. The role of the data protection authorities should also be strengthened(Reding 2010). Six months later, the European Commission acted on this bypublishing the above-mentioned Communication relating to informationmanagement in the European Union. In addition to presenting an overview of allexisting eu -level instruments, the Communication sets out the main principles to be taken into account when dealing with personal data for law enforcement ormigration management purposes. Alongside the familiar principles of privacy,necessity and subsidiarity, these principles include accurate risk management(risks should be based on evidence and not just on hypotheses), bottom-up policydesign (the development of new initiatives must, at the earliest possible stage,draw on the input of all relevant stakeholders, including national authoritiesresponsible for implementation, economic actors, and civil society), review andsunset clauses, and a clear allocation of responsibilities. What is striking about thelatter is that the Commission says nothing about a clear allocation of responsibili-ties in the event that a citizen becomes entangled in the digital European world,but only cites this principle with respect to budgetary excesses and delays causedby shifting aims and conditions: \"The experience of the sis ii project demon- strates that a failure to define clear and stable overarching objectives, roles andresponsibilities early on may lead to significant cost overruns and delays in imple-mentation\" (European Commission 2010a: 30). Whether the underpinning andprocess-based principles will in fact be accorded a fully-fledged role in settingEurope's digital agenda is difficult to say right now. What is certain is that thegeneral framework for data protection will be reviewed starting in 2011, and thatdecisions are expected to be taken in that regard. On 4 November 2010 , in order toprepare for this discussion, the European Commission presented its \"strategy tostrengthen eudata protection rules\", which includes proposals for updating these rules. The Commission states, for example: \"People ... should have the 'right to beforgotten' when their data is no longer needed or they want their data to bedeleted\" (European Commission 2010c: 1). 142 igovernment5.2 conclusion Connectivity does not stop at national borders. The rise of ict involves scale advantages that open up new policy options at the European level which are liter- ally beyond the reach of individual Member States. By sharing information, the eu Member States can tackle issues that would have otherwise been unmanageable.After all, a common migration policy that is truly harmonised in operationalterms (and not merely with respect to legislation) would be unaffordable withoutEuropean migration databases. Recently, the original focus on asylum seekers andirregular migrants has been widened to encompass all travellers. The fact thatinformation-sharing is now being considered for the internal market demon-strates that the information society is reaching maturity. But there is clearly nosharp distinction between the aspects of eGovernment for which the eushould be responsible and the aspects for which the Member States retain competence. 14The European Union is in any event devoting itself enthusiastically to eGovernmentand can only be expected to continue along that path. An even balance between driving, underpinning and process-based principles is also important at the European level. Migration databases are truly Europeanapplications, and the individual Member States can do little to right the balancethere. In other areas, however, such as the eu's privacy legislation or the Regula- tion 15relating to the introduction of biometrics in passports, the structure is more layered and national implementation can still tip the balance in either direction. Itis clear from the various European initiatives that the eualso has trust in technol- ogy and in the benefits of information-sharing. The basic principle, which oftenremains unspoken, is that the more data that is exchanged, the better thecombined European governments can meet the many challenges facing them. Oneof those challenges stands head and shoulders above the rest: to protect the citi-zens of Europe against the threat of terrorism. The European Parliament hasconsistently shown that it does not agree with such blanket assumptions, forexample by stepping on the brakes in discussions about data exchanges with theUnited States. Until recently, however, it often had neither the opportunity northe authority to influence the tenor of the debate, let alone the relevant proposal.There is therefore constant pressure to expand the existing European applications,with new information categories being added and new national and Europeanorganisations joining in. ict may indeed have opened up unprecedented opportunities for policymaking at the European level too, but the benefits of such policy are extremely difficult to identify. The paucity of evaluation noted in the Dutch context can also be seenwithin the eu . As a result, efficiency, effectiveness and security have become somewhat elusive concepts. As in the Netherlands, the success of an initiative inEurope is measured on the relevant system's own terms, for example how many143 exchange without bordersunwanted aliens have been flagged in the sissystem. On the other hand, citizens whose data has been entered into one of the European databases - and more and more of them are simply 'normal' citizens - are in an exceptionally weak position.They do not even know that such databases exist until a national authority turnsdown their application or takes some other negative decision based on a piece ofdigital 'European' information - and such an entry is exceedingly difficult to havereversed or deleted (see the Office of the National Ombudsman 2010c). Theresponsibility for righting errors or correcting faulty information is based on the'historical' principle: the organisation that originally recorded the information -even if located in another Member State - must make the correction. This hasresulted in an impenetrable legal protection 'system'. In the 'database state', theunderpinning and process-based principles are even more problematical at theEuropean level than at the Dutch national level. This is a worrisome development,especially with European applications growing ever-wider in scope and - viewedfrom the perspective of the average citizen - affecting everyday life more andmore. One final comment is that 'the' European government wants not only to be a user but also, very clearly, a driver of ict by encouraging not only the ict industry but the use of ict in society in general. That makes the input of commercial stakehold- ers highly important, even to the point that they are invited to help design publicapplications. The privacy settings for the eCall initiative, for example, are purelythe result of public-private cooperation. Although such cooperation may increasean application's chance of success, it does give rise to the paradoxical situation thatgovernment is sometimes merely the facilitator even of its 'core business', i.e.regulation.144 igovernmentnotes 1 The agreements were laid down in the Prevention and Combating of Serious Crime ( pcsc ) Agreement, which at the end of 2010 had yet to be submitted to Parliament for approval.

What is still uncertain, however, iswhether the European level is really the most suitable for specific initiatives. In theview of the Dutch Government, that is certainly not always the case (TweedeKamer 2010-2011c). 15 Council Regulation ( ec) No. 2252/2004 on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States, ojl385, pp. 1-6.145 exchange without borders6 market masters and mastering the market Without an ict supply market, there would be no eGovernment. On 9 September 2010, the then Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport, Ab Klink, reported to the House of Representatives on the sums spent on eGovernment, in this case on theepd , in the ict market. \"In July, the Ministry received a request under the Government Information (Public Access) Act from rtl Nederland1asking for a full accounting of 'all costs incurred and activities carried out under the auspices of the Ministry of Health in connection with the epd for which invoices have been sent or which have been paid for, other than the Ministry's regular, official costs and activi-ties'. Between 2002 and 1 July 2010, a total of eur 217.5 million was spent on activities related to the introduction of the national data exchange infrastructure in the healthcare sector (including audits,advisory studies, pilot projects, communication, it, development and management, project management and Nictiz 2institutional and project funding)\" (Tweede Kamer 2009-2010g: 10). Conversely, the ict market would never have grown to its current size if eGovern- ment had not taken off to such an extent. In order to achieve its ambitions and carry out all its plans, government leans heavily on a wide variety of parties thatoperate outside the public sector. The relationship between government and theict market has developed along three lines. The first is economic: the ict industry is an important sector, and government is a crucial partner for the companies thatoperate within it (system engineers, developers of data and information applica-tions, consultants). The second line is administrative. The ict industry functions as an extension of public administration: government implements policy bymeans of ict applications, and must therefore depend, at least in part, on the suppliers of those applications. The final line is regulatory. By regulating the ictmarket, government forces companies in the sector to conduct their commercialaffairs in a particular way. For example, it can decide to enact and enforce certainrules because a small number of market parties have acquired so dominant a posi-tion in informational terms that public interests are at risk. 6.1 egovernment as economic force 6.1.1 purchasing within egovernment ict is a dynamic and sizeable sector of both the Dutch and the international econ- omy. In 2007, the top 250 international ict firms recorded turnover of usd 3.8 trillion. The sector as a whole also drives innovation. It invests much more of itsearnings in r&d than the automobile or pharmaceutical industries, both of which are traditionally regarded as heavily dependent on new discoveries and innova-147tion. Worldwide, the ict sector invests usd 130 billion in r&d ; 25 per cent of this comes from companies based in the European Union (all figures taken from oecd 2008). In other words, the ict industry is a dynamic force - innovative, a driver of economic growth, and a source of skilled jobs. Government is therefore keen to 'nurture' this robust, valuable industry cum knowledge sector. In addition, ict also generates the necessary energy and innovation in the social arena, which iswhy the Dutch Government made a eur 54 million investment incentive avail- able in 2008 for \"sector-specific ict projects in social sectors.\" 3 The public authorities are themselves major purchasers of ict products. Many of the numerous eGovernment projects undertaken by local, national, European andinternational authorities are ultimately developed and carried out by ict firms, whether or not chosen by tender. In 2007, the Ministry of the Interior and King-dom Relations reported that between 2000 and 2013, the national government(including independent agencies) will have built up a portfolio of ict-related projects worth eur 5.8 billion, of which eur 4.1 billion will ultimately be spent directly on ict (Netherlands Court of Audit 2008a). This did not give the Nether- lands Court of Audit (2008a: 29-30) enough information to estimate annualexpenditure, however, and it in fact wondered whether the actual sum spent hadnot been higher than reported. In the uk, estimates from five years ago put spend- ing on public-sector ict at some gbp 14 billion a year (Dunleavy et al. 2006). These impressive figures indicate that the public-sector ict market is not only the result of demand-pull; technology push also plays a role. As key commercial parties, ict firms actively 'work' the market, sometimes with the support of an ict consultant. Even government is not immune to the occasional 'solution in search of a problem'in terms of a new technology or type of application. In interviews, representativesof cio Platform Nederland indicated that government - like business and industry - had been backed into a corner by a very small number of large ict providers, and had little idea of how to deal with this situation. 4According to these cio s of large corporations, there is every reason for government and other businesses that aresimilarly dependent on ict suppliers to collaborate in order to improve commis- sioning practices. One part of the public-sector ict market is to be found within the ministries and agencies themselves and relates to internal matters, for example salary systems, archiving systems, security, and keycards. Another part, however, relates eitherdirectly or indirectly to government's interaction with the citizen. Many dozens,if not hundreds, of applications have been developed in recent years in the policyareas of service, care and control. Most of these were designed and built in closecooperation with the private sector (Ministerie van ez2008). The tender specifi- cations are sometimes worded so broadly that the external party eventuallyawarded the contract is able to choose the government actors that will be invitedto help develop the application. 5In some cases, market involvement is motivated148 igovernmentby more than the specific assignment alone; the private actors have their own agenda. One example is eCall, the euproject that involves fitting cars with elec- tronics that emit an emergency signal (either manually operated or automatic) inthe event of an accident. The European Commission is counting on the eCallproject to significantly reduce the number of traffic fatalities on Europe's roads.The eCall system also gives the national road management agencies an excellenttool for optimising traffic management operations, for example to reroute trafficaround an accident site or to instruct road inspectors on the spot. The nationalauthorities are considering applications beyond traffic safety as well (for examplecrime investigation), and a variety of private actors - including the car industry,mobile telecommunication operators, private emergency services, and insurers -are encouraging the development of eCall in order to increase their earnings,develop new products, or streamline existing services (Potters & De Vreeze2010). The biggest 'growth market' for ict and other technological applications is the security market. Since 9/11, the market for databases and for biometric and other internal security systems and applications has been booming. In a study publishedin 2004, the oecd referred to the 'emerging security economy' (Stevens 2004); Hayes (2009) calls it the 'growing Homeland Security market'. However onedefines it, it is in any event clear that these are growth markets and that companiesoperating in them are actively marketing their products. The 2004 oecd study estimated that the security economy was worth about usd 100 billion (Stevens 2004). On a somewhat smaller scale, the International Biometric Group expectsthe market for biometrics to increase from usd 3.42 billion to usd 9.37 billion between 2009 and 2014. It has also predicted that, owing to the financial crisis,most of that market will consist of government contracts ( Biometric Technology Today 2009: 11). The market for biometrics has a number of notable features. Spec- tacular growth forecasts have made this an international and highly competitivemarket, but it is also a relatively new one that in many cases has yet to establishuniform standards and reliable products. Snijder (2010) shows that the interna-tional biometrics industry is sharply divided into national segments, with innova-tion being largely in the hands of the major biometrics companies (there areapproximately six such companies worldwide). \"Improvements in interoperability would not benefit the market position of these major compa- nies, which - owing to their intimate relationships with public-sector customers and the limitedinterchangeability of their products - are certainly not eager to welcome market newcomers. Andbecause innovation costs a lot of money and newcomers to the biometrics market are unlikely to beawarded big government contracts, there isn't much strategic technical innovation. The marketleaders do innovate, but within the scope of their own technology\" (Snijder 2010: 55-56). 149 market masters and mastering the marketIn late 2010, the House of Representatives grew concerned about reports that the Minister of Justice had awarded the contract to construct the national biometricsdatabase to a 'commercial French firm' following a tendering procedure. 6Several of the political parties were worried that, according to mp Pierre Heijnen (Labour Party/ pvda ), \"central storage into hands\" (Tweede Kamer 2010-2011a:3). Said mp Ronald van Raak (Socialist Party): \"I would think it is entirely logical that a Dutch passport should be produced, managed, issued and monitored by the Dutch government. However, there is little about the Dutch passport that I holdthat is still truly Dutch. Its production has been contracted out. It is produced by a commercialFrench firm. The fingerprint that it contains is entered into a database, and that database is alsomanaged by a commercial French firm. There are commercial interests involved and the intelli-gence service aivd 7has warned that this was not very clever, that contracting out databases, sensi- tive information can be dangerous. I'm sure the aivd has a good reason for issuing that warning\" (Tweede Kamer 2010-2011a: 3). In response to this discussion, the State Secretary reported that, with respect to the central database, no irreversible steps had yet been taken (Tweede Kamer2010-2011a). In addition to the technology market for developing technological applications, there is also an equally profitable information market. The gathering and proces-sing of information for sale, or the utilisation of information for targeted adver-tising, is a highly lucrative business. Google, the uncrowned king of personaldata collection, linking and enhancement for advertising purposes, reportedturnover of usd 6.77 billion in the first quarter of 2010. 8The information market is also valuable to government, not only because companies are commissionedby the public authorities to feed databases, but also because government has longbeen making eager use of the wealth of information collected in the privatesector. 6.1.2 the ict 'market' within government eGovernment is not being constructed by commercial parties alone, however.It is also being developed within government itself. One of the core tasks of theNational itInstitute for Healthcare in the Netherlands (Nictiz), for example, is \"to develop and select the specifications for the national generic healthcare infra-structure and the epd (including the standards to be upheld)\" (Pluut 2010:14). The most important de velopment agency within government is the Netherlands ict Implementation Organisation ( ictu ), set up by the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations and the Association of Dutch Municipalities ( vng ) in 2001 to develop large and small ict projects for public authorities (Van Loon 2010). Along-150 igovernmentside these and other public-sector ict developers, however, are a range of com- mercial firms that frequently work inside the walls of government on constructing eGovernment (Horrocks 2009). Large numbers of commercial developers andexternal consultants are contracted to work on many of government's ict projects and to assist large agencies such as the Tax and Customs Administration. An article published in the online magazine webwereld.nl which revealed the relative numbers of public servants and external ict professionals working for the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations - the information was requestedunder the Government Information (Public Access) Act - was given the suggestiveand meaningful title 'National government ict is a Valhalla for hirelings'. 9 Even ictu 's own workforce consists largely of external professionals. According to the ictu , this allows the organisation to expand or contract with the supply of work.10 What that often means in everyday practice is that the civil servant responsible foran ict project within a Ministry does business with an external project manager who has excellent technical credentials and can make a large team available. Inother words, the expertise on the two sides is far from evenly balanced. 6.2 the ict market as an extension of public administration 6.2.1 problematic commissioning practices Close, professional supervision of developers has turned out to be difficult inmany eGovernment projects. That is partly because government's technologicalexpertise is limited, but it is also because its ideas relating to commissioning andits commissioning practices are not always as professional as they might be. 11In late 2010, for example, the Ministry of Justice cancelled its Caijs ict project, meant to serve as a prison information system for the National Agency of CorrectionalInstitutions ( Dienst Justiti\u00eble Inrichtingen , dji). The project, which had already cost eur 12 million in 2009 and 2010, was cancelled because too many aims had been defined, making it unmanageable. 12Earlier ict projects - among them c2000, Walvis, and the Surcharges project at the Tax and Customs Administration - had also run into major problems. The former National Ombudsman, MartenOosting (now a member of the Council of State), had the following to say aboutthe Walvis project: \"In the case of Walvis, either we were all overly enthusiastic orthe legislator simply ignored any cautionary advice\" (Februari 2008: 91). Various reports by the Netherlands Court of Audit reveal considerable room for improvement with respect to the costs, scheduling and efficiency of ict develop- ment projects. 13The Court of Audit has commented that projects are often overly ambitious and complex, and that this quite often leads to excessive costs anddelays and to results that do not always live up to expectations (Netherlands Courtof Audit 2007a). The same observation can be applied both to large-scale Dutch151 market masters and mastering the Audit 2007a, 2008a; Snijders 2011; Pluut 2010) and to European projects such as sis ii or vis (Broeders 2011). In 2008, based on 350 reports of ' ict wastefulness', the Socialist Party drew attention to a wide range of problems, including tendering irregularities, conflicts of interest between govern-ment and the market, poor communication, megalomaniacal politicians, and a lackof expertise ( sp 2008). In the spring of 2010, the Advisory Board on a letter to the State Secretary for the Interior and Kingdom Relations reporting that aprojected saving of eur 500 million would not be feasible owing to the lack of structure in the deployment of ict (Actal 2010). One key factor in this problem is the visible tension between what 'street-level'agencies want from ict and the systems that are actually developed by the policy- makers at the relevant ministry. It is only rarely that the agencies - the end users -are invited to take part in the development process early on. Indeed, they are oftenleft out of the process entirely, with a turnkey system being delivered - or, to put itless politely, tossed over the fence (Van Loon 2010). There is broad agreement -within the police, the Tax and Customs Administration, the partners in the Mani-festo Group, and Logius - that agencies are too often left on the side-lines whensystems and applications are being developed, and when they are allowed to contribute, they are brought in far too late. That means that there is often a hugegap between government (usually a ministry) as commissioning body and govern-ment as end-user of the resulting ict systems and applications. 14This discrepancy between policy objectives and practical implementation can also be seen in theprocess leading to the introduction of the biometric passport. The policy is beingintroduced long before the control infrastructure is in place that will be required toactually use the biometric passport at the border (B\u00f6hre 2010). Moving up a scale to the digital borders of the European Union, we see that there is an even bigger discrepancy between the Union's policymaking on high-tech digi-tal and biometric databases and the everyday work being carried out at the externalborders of the eu . 15Opinions differ at various levels of government and politics as to when a system is 'finished'. Especially when the lines of communicationbetween the politicians and those working at the coalface are very long, thetendency is to define success or failure at the level of the system: if the system isup and running, the project is considered a success. That is often also the approachtaken in evaluations. The few evaluations of the eurodac system (designed to detect multiple requests for asylum in the eu ) analyse the information flows and 'hits' between Member States, but say nothing at all about whether or how theinformation is used in relation to the aims of the system, i.e. to assist in the trans-fer of asylum seekers between the Member States. The logic of the systemcommands all the attention and defines the 'outcome' of the evaluation (Broeders2011). 152 igovernmentPart of the problem when it comes to public-sector commissioning practices is that government does not act as a single, uniform entity when setting the require-ments for ict. Indeed, the Netherlands Court of Audit has pointed out that it is precisely the political dynamic between a minister, the House of Representativesand the civil service that often leads to failure or delays in large-scale ict projects. In a similar way, the dynamic relationship between the eu's Council of Ministers, the Commission, and - especially in the post-Lisbon era - the European Parlia-ment generates constantly changing political demands on emerging systems,combined with unrealistic deadlines (Broeders 2011). 16A further factor is that there is often a chasm between the ministries - usually the commissioning bodies- and the parties that build the systems. The Gateway Review of the nup (mentioned earlier) seriously questions the quality of the ministries' commission-ing practices: \"When it comes to enormous projects such as these, there is reasonto question whether government employees in general and those in the commis-sioning ministries in particular are well enough equipped for such tasks as projectand programme management\" (Gateway nup 2009: 2). Some interviewees believe that there is too much emphasis on managing specific projects and too littleemphasis on the overarching factors that affect the coherence of policy and imple-mentation. 17According to interviewees Peter Wijntje and Sjoerd Peereboom (Ministry of Finance/Tax and Customs Administration), factors such as the legalframework and more specifically the citizen's access to legal redress should not beleft to project managers; they are matters that should be entrusted to publicadministrators. Focusing on individual projects and managing from a narrowoperational perspective also blocks an organisation's ability to learn, they claim,and prevents it from developing a strategic agenda for the interrelationship ofmultiple initiatives. The ictu offers an apt illustration of these problems. Ministries often lack a solid understanding of the matter and are unable to define assignments precisely enough. 18In terms of the success of large-scale ict projects, it is certainly prob- lematical that the ictu is - in its own words - a genuine project organisation. Once a project has been completed, it is crossed off the ictu 's agenda (Van Loon 2010). But in many cases, the work of incorporating the project into the relevantorganisation's everyday work has yet to begin. In addition, systems are never'finished'; they will always need to be managed and require ongoing development.In 2006, a new organisation known as gbo .Overheid was set up to manage vari- ous eGovernment systems; it was later renamed Logius. 19Logius in fact takes over where ictu leaves off and manages systems on behalf of government. There is very little coordination between these organisations, however. It is only recentlythat the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations has tried to get the partiesto collaborate and coordinate their work more systematically. 20In this complex setting of commissioning, development, management, and ongoing development, who exactly is responsible for ensuring that the system is actually aligned with the153 market masters and mastering the marketrelevant policy objectives? After all, many choices are made in the course of programming, and are made repeatedly as time passes. In practical terms, it is notclear - or not sufficiently clear - who is monitoring accountability. 6.2.2 the chief information officer (cio) as problem solver Inevitably, a government that innovates and therefore takes advantage of the newopportunities offered by digitization for policy implementation is operating in anarena whose contours have not yet been defined. The path of digitization is there-fore unavoidably strewn with both project successes and project failures. There issimply no innovation without risk. It is important to learn from both the successesand the failures, but that often fails to happen. Some years ago, the NetherlandsCourt of Audit advised the Government to introduce a new job title in nationalgovernment to ensure better project management: that of Chief Information Offi-cer (cio ). One of the cio 's duties would be to furnish Parliament with accurate, complete and timely information about the progress of ict projects (Netherlands Court of Audit 2008a: 53). In the United States, where heads of government agen-cies are required to appoint cio s (at the highest levels of the civil service hierar- chy), there has been a vast improvement in project throughput times (Petri 2008).Governments in other countries, such as Austria and the United Kingdom, havealso introduced the position of cio . The Dutch Government followed up this suggestion and the Netherlands now has a Coordinating cio (Rijks-cio ), responsi- ble for coordination, as well as ministry-level cio s. Various agencies and one local authority have followed this example (Snijders 2011). The Coordinating cio is responsible for managing the work of the cio s in national government. cio s are supposed to advise senior public servants and political leaders on large-scale proj-ects, either on request or at their own discretion. It is therefore important for thecio and policymakers to have a good working relationship. One problem is the scope of the cio 's influence. Most ict projects, especially the largest ones, are implemented within autonomous administrative authorities or other agencies thatoperate at some remove from the responsible ministry (Snijders 2011). cio s also have no influence at regional or local level, even though large ict projects - for example the Reference Index for Juveniles at Risk - often involve all the variousadministrative levels. In actual fact, cio s mainly concern themselves with making ict projects manageable, and scarcely have time to function as information strate- gists or trend watchers. That means that cio s may end up bearing a heavy burden of responsibility without proper acknowledgement; at best, they exercise someauthority, but they have no real power. In its Coalition Agreement, the RutteGovernment (which took office in 2010) has in any event said that it will takesystematic action to achieve closer supervision of large-scale computerisationprojects and to solve problems with computer systems (Regeerakkoord 2010: 42).154 igovernment6.2.3 policy as system design Dunleavy et al. (2006: 61) view the Netherlands as a typical - albeit extreme - 'polder' version of the European Rhineland model when it comes to government'scooperation with ict firms. The focus in this model is on 'a good relationship' and 'consensus and mutual support', unlike the Anglo-Saxon model, which empha-sises outsourcing and financial control. When government, developers and advis-ers cooperate this closely, it is often difficult to see who is guiding the interplay ofpolicy objectives and the design of the actual system. In those areas in whicheGovernment is taking shape thanks to close interaction between government(the commissioning party) and the commercial market (developers and consult-ants), the ict market is really an extension of public administration, with impor- tant administrative and policy decisions being taken or 'preprogrammed' at multi-ple points throughout the process of system development. This tendency has beenreinforced by the recent popularity of Privacy Enhancing Technologies ( pet s), which will be examined in the next chapter (Section 7.1) (compare Article 29 DataProtection Working Party and Working Party on Police and Justice 2009: 12). Inpet s, the limits set on the technology are actually embedded into the applications. That means that government has to make clear in its instructions to systemdesigners that privacy guarantees must be incorporated into the application viapet s, making its commissioning practices all the more crucial. But government frequently has other priorities. Experience has taught system engineers such asCapGemini to design software in a way that leaves room for an as-yet only vaguelyexpressed political wish to combine - or separate - information flows. The 'parti-tions' that the engineers then construct between information sources can be easilyremoved or reinforced if this is requested later. That prevents projects fromrunning up unnecessary costs in the event of changing opinions or an alteredpolitical course. 21 The interplay between system development and policy decisions is obvious notonly at the national level. By choosing to allocate certain projects and programmesto the local level, for example youth care initiatives, government is in fact openingup avenues for system developers to control eGovernment (Keymolen & Prins2011). In central government, it is a knowledgeable organisation such as the ictu , subject to the administrative supervision of and accountable to the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations, that is constructing a nation-wide system; in local and regional government, on the other hand, the authorities are forced tocontract commercial (or semi-commercial) parties themselves when constructingthe local version, with only scant public supervision of the influence that suchparties exert on policy. Ultimately, however, these are in fact the systems thatcreate the categories that define the citizen profiles used by government. And ifwe assume that 'categories have politics', it is important to know where and howthe categories have been created. 155 market masters and mastering the market6.2.4 decision-makers \"Instead of vacating it, then, ict tends to fill the 'seat of power' - in both the literal and metaphorical senses - with even more occupants\" (Van de Donk 1997: 502). And among those occupying that seat are a growing number of 'decision-makers',i.e. organisations, foundations and agencies that take many of the crucial policydecisions in the development process - indeed some are set up specifically for thatpurpose - without, however, being subject to much direct (democratic) supervi-sion. Examples include the ekd .nlfoundation (for the Electronic Child Dossier - Keymolen & Prins 2011), Nictiz (for the Electronic Patient Dossier - Keizer 2011;Pluut 2010), and the Personal Records Database and Travel Documents Agency(bpr ), which has played a key role in designing the Dutch biometric passport and communicating abou t its deve lopment (B\u00f6hre 2010; Snijder 2010). The history of the eu Regulation relating to the biometric passport shows that the biometric standards and other important milestones were decided on in unexpected work-ing groups (in this case the Visa Working Party), that every single one of the Euro- pean Parliament's objections was ignored, and that the proposal was ultimatelyvoted through by the General Affairs and External Relations Council. In otherwords, it was not the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs who negotiated thedraft, but the Ministers of Foreign Affairs who transformed the proposal into aEuropean regulation (Broeders 2011; see Aus 2008 for a detailed description of theprocedure). Decisions on technology, standards and data exchange are frequentlytaken far out of earshot of Dutch citizens and their elected representatives - deci-sions that influence the technology ultimately used and the information sharedbetween public authorities. The decision by the icao to base the biometric pass- port on face recognition and fingerprinting and the consequent agreements werethe result of old-fashioned power politics by a few large countries within theframeworks of the G8, the informal European Group of Five, various eu working parties, and the icao itself (Aus 2008). eCall was designed by the eCall Driving Group, an ad hoc committee of 144 participating organisations, most of which areactive in the commercial sector (eCall Driving Group 2005). The EuropeanCommission is expected to base the relevant legislation on this group's results(Potters & De Vreeze 2010). 6.3 responsibility for the ict market The third and final line that defines the interaction between government and theict market relates to government's responsibility for what happens in that market. It should be noted that the ict market is much broader than the world of the system builders and developers. It also encompasses large information-basedcorporations that build their business models on the personal data of Europeancitizens, but also telecoms and isps that no longer treat all data network traffic equally, and instead discriminate (in rates, exclusiveness or transmission speed)156 igovernmentbetween certain services and applications (disregarding the principle of network neutrality). The public authorities appear to take this responsibility seriously;witness, for example, the decision by the usFederal Communications Commis- sion (fcc ) to pass a network neutrality order 22and the announcement by Commissioner Neelie Kroes that the euwould be tightening its supervision of social networking sites and the privacy settings used there, especially for minors(Kroes 2010). In the past the European Commission criticised the monopoly posi-tion of software developer Microsoft; now, it is turning its attention to informa-tion giants such as Google and Facebook. 23The gist of these interventions is that the citizen must be protected against an aggressive and competitive informationmarket. The view expressed by the Dutch Ministry of Justice on the use of biomet-rics in the private sector is a good example of the sort of discussion that has arisenrelating to government responsibility: \"In keeping with its duty to protect theinterests of the citizen and of society, government can oblige the private sector tofollow its example by forcing it to take the same factors into account that thepublic authorities consider when applying biometrics in the public sector\" (Ministerie van Justitie 2010: 33). Various interviewees commented that it isprecisely in the area of identity management that government has a role to play.These observations reflect citizens' worries about the way the private sector usesidentification tools. The survey conducted at the request of the ecp-epn and the wrr reveals that the public had deep misgivings about using the use of the bsn and biometrics in transactions (Attema & De Nood 2010: 2). One argument wasthe risk of fraud. The public are also very uncomfortable with the idea of medicalinsurers making use of the bsn . Opinions remain sharply divided when it comes to the banks using this identification number (Attema & De Nood 2010: 2). Othersurveys have also revealed the public's concerns about the risks associated withdigitization, for example financial fraud on the Internet and identity theft (VanDeursen & Van Dijk 2010: 63). Government may also intervene if the price it is itself paying is too high, for exam- ple the cost of investigating identity fraud cases. 24In addition, government is both in a position to tackle technological security breaches and responsible for doing so.It is no more able than commercial parties to make identity systems and keysentirely secure, but, unlike the market, it does have the authority to take bindingdecisions relating to security breaches. In other words, government can stipulatewho is to bear the burden of certain risks. It can apportion the costs and distributewhat Van Eeten (2011) calls the benefits of insecurity and allocate responsibilities to the relevant actors along those lines (Van Eeten 2011). Citizens then have some-where to turn when problems arise owing to security breaches in identity systems. Finally, government may need to intervene more forcefully in the ict market if the effects of using ict in the private sector spill over into the public domain. Digital identity authentication is a case in point. There are currently almost no157 market masters and mastering the marketrules or regulations governing the use and quality of digital identities in the private sector; it has even largely escaped political notice. Swimming pools, super-markets, employers and computer manufacturers are at liberty to experiment withnew types of biometric authentication. The quality of these applications, and howthat quality is guaranteed, remains unclear, however. Experience has shown thatwhen it comes to digital identities, the boundaries between the public and privatesectors are becoming blurred (Van de Hof et al. 2009). In the view of various inter-viewees, that could undermine the quality of identity authentication in the publicsector as well. 6.4 conclusion Government is an important consumer of ict products. Conversely, ict is becom- ing a key policymaking tool, turning those who develop ict products into indis- pensable designers and making government commissioning practices a pivotalissue in the evolution of eGovernment. It is in part within the context of eGovern-ment commissioning practices that the driving, underpinning and process-basedprinciples must be brought into balance. What this shows, however, is thatgovernment often does not have the differentiated knowledge and expertise todevelop applications and links itself, making it difficult to inject critical thinkinginto its expectations of ict and what it can accomplish. There also seems to be little awareness that commissioning bodies need to be realistic about the merits ofthe driving principles. Government lacks people who are able to maintain a senseof administrative responsibility when faced with a cornucopia of technical optionsand their advocates. There is too little that connects commissioning practices tothe underpinning principles, for example because no one has a clear idea of howbuilt-in technological standards (Privacy Enhancing Technologies) relate to stan-dards laid down in the law or by society. There are also gaps in the process-basedquality of government's commissioning practices, in particular a lack of profes-sionalism and the fact that end users of applications have only limited input intothe development process. In the midst of all the 'administrative bustle' of institutions that are preparing the groundwork for the ongoing development of eGovernment, the tenor of the policydiscourse relating to the ict market and the use of ict in the social arena is, notably enough, almost entirely one of facilitation. The ict industry must be facil- itated because it is an economic powerhouse, makes a major contribution to gdp and employment, and even, perhaps, because it can easily outsource its activitiesto a distant country. Government must equip itself with the best possible techni-cal facilities, which it purchases in the ict market. And the citizen must be facili- tated in order to increase his or her productivity. As important as these mattersmay be, it is also important for politicians and policymakers to pay more consis-tent attention to government's responsibility for trends and developments in the158 igovernmentict market and their impact on society - something that they have failed to do. The unregulated use of biometric identity authentication systems by private organisations illustrates this policy gap. 159 market masters and mastering the marketnotes 1 rtl Ned erland is a commercial tvand radio broadcasting organisation. 2 Nictiz is the National itInstit ute for Healthcare in the Netherlands, the national coordination point and knowledge centre for itand innovation in the healthcare sector (www.nictiz.nl/page/Home/English). 3 http://regelingen.agentschapnl.nl/content/ict-impuls. 4 Interview with H.Wesseling ( tnt Post), H.

Stam, Ministry of Justice, May 2010.161 market masters and mastering the market7 supervisors of egovernment We have already discussed many of the 'supervisors' of eGovernment in previous chapters. They are bodies charged with reviewing the ict-related aspects of the relationship between government and the citizen, forcing changes where neces-sary, and/or urging such changes. This chapter looks more closely at the responsi-bility that these organisations bear in relation to government's digitization proj-ects and programmes. Our main focus, however, will be on how they perceivetheir role and how they actually fulfil it. Various actors have been assigned, and infact play, a role as critical observers of eGovernment, making them vital to thenecessary system of checks and balances. In recent years, the Council of State, theData Protection Authority, the Office of the National Ombudsman, the Nether-lands Court of Audit, and - to a lesser extent - the judiciary have all developedinto more or less critical 'supervisors' of government's ict policy aims. They influence the design and ongoing development of eGovernment and the directionthat it takes, all within the context of their own responsibilities and with theirown set of tools. Yet another, exceptional, supervisor is 'the citizen', who moni-tors the development of eGovernment in many different ways. Technology hasalso dramatically altered the nature of such supervision in recent years. There aredefinite assumptions in eGovernment relating to the role of citizens: what theyneed to be vigilant about, how much vigilance is required, what they can object to,and how. 7.1 existing supervisory bodies 7.1.1 council of state The Council of State advises on legislation and as an advisory body, it also evalu-ates the construction of eGovernment. In addition to analysing the legal substanceof legislation proposing the use of technology or information for a particularpurpose, the Council of State also analyses the policy-related aspects and assessesthe quality of the proposed legislation on technical grounds, i.e. as a piece of legis-lation. Because the Government is not obliged to follow its advice, however, theCouncil of State must ultimately depend on those to whom it addresses its recom-mendations, the quality of their responses and - if its advice is rejected - whetherthe Government's arguments in fact hold water (Raad van State 2010: 127). TheCouncil often assesses the legal and technical quality of bills relating to ict with a view to the fundamental rights involved, the European Convention on HumanRights and the Dutch Personal Data Protection Act ( Wet bescherming persoons- gegevens , wbp ). It was within the context of such an assessment that the Council asked the Government to explain more convincingly the necessity and propor-tionality of processing certain personal data on almost three million medically163insured people as part of a bill relating to allowances for the chronically ill and disabled (Raad van State 2009: 111). Based on its policy-related analysis of aroad-pricing bill, the Council of State criticised government's 'techno-trust' inthe recording and payment system that the Government had envisaged. Underthe provisions of the bill, motorists would be unable to object to the number ofkilometres recorded by the 'electronic box'. The Council of State indicated thatit did not share the Government's confidence in technology (Raad van State 2010:159). In general, then, the Council of State has repeatedly criticised the Government's plans to introduce legislation relating to the deployment of ict. According to the Council's Annual Report for 2008 (Raad van State 2009: 97), it is not always clear at the time that the relevant bills are submitted to the Council of State forreview why the data processing proposed by the Government is necessary. Never-theless, the Council sometimes has difficulty analysing, identifying and, as aresult, assessing all the ramifications and anticipating the effects of such complexproblems. Its members have indicated in an interview that, with hindsight, theyfelt they had not been critical enough about the use of biometrics in passports. 1 The Council of State is also limited by the tools at its disposal for both its technicalassessment and policy-related analysis. It must adhere to the applicable statutoryregime that provides the framework for its assessment (in the case of many ict-related initiatives, that is the Personal Data Protection Act) and the individual policy context of the bill. That means that it is almost impossible for the Council,when evaluating the matter, to foresee and scrutinise the broader context in whichthe system is to function, for example future connections with other applicationsthat result in new information flows. 7.1.2 data protection authority The Data Protection Authority, which oversees the lawful use of personal data,has many different duties. It advises on legislation, deals with complaints,conducts official enquiries, mediates in disputes relating to data inspection andcorrection, and imposes sanctions. In accordance with the European PrivacyDirective, the Data Protection Authority cooperates with supervisory bodies inother Member States and participates in the Article 29 Working Party, whichadvises the European Commission on privacy law. The limited capacity andresources available to the Data Protection Authority force it to be selective. Rightnow, it has therefore prioritised its advisory task within the context of proposedlegislation and its enforcement task. These choices, and the fact that the Authoritycombines a variety of functions within a single organisation, have been the objectof criticism from several quarters (see Zwenne et al. 2010). It is considered oddthat organisations subject to external supervision \"... must turn for informationand advice to the same official body that may later rap them over the knuckles with164 igovernmentthe very information previously provided for advisory purposes\" (Brouwer-Korf Committee 2009). The Brouwer-Korf Committee therefore recommended thatthe supervisory body should not concern itself with advising, providing informa-tion or facilitating. The response of the Data Protection Authority was critical intone: it believes that advising on legislation can and should go hand-in-hand withsupervisory work ( cbp 2010c). Regarding the first of the two prioritised responsibilities, advising on legislation,the Authority observes that the number of advisory reports issued in recent yearshas remained more or less constant ( cbp 2010c: 57). A review of its various annual reports shows that the number varies between 38 (in both 2009 and 2010a) and 47(2008). What is striking about the various pieces of ict-related legislation is that although the Data Protection Authority became explicitly involved when the billwas being drafted, it often disappeared from view during the legislative processitself. That is odd, considering that later amendments to such bills can have a clearimpact on the way personal data is used. A case in point is the ethnicity criterionin the Reference Index for Juveniles at Risk, included after a motion requesting itwas adopted by the House of Representatives: the relevant Minister informedParliament that the Data Protection Authority did not need to be consulted on thematter (Prins 2010b). Also noteworthy is the State Secretary for the Interior'sresponse when asked by Parliament why the amended biometric passport bill hadnot been resubmitted to the Data Protection Authority. \"That is because we thought that we had taken the Authority's criticisms on board. We have provided further substantiation ... We have made our assessment of the interests involved clear.I have even provided a more detailed explanation. I think our assessment is a good one. The Senatemust judge for itself, but we have really paid serious attention to what the Authority has said. So I don't consider it necessary to resubmit the bill to the advisory body. We don't do that with the Council of State either. We write a detailed report for the Senate to judge. We agreed on this procedure because otherwise we would be spending all our time consulting advisory bodies. I don't think that's really what was intended ...\" (Eerste Kamer 2008-2009b; B\u00f6hre 2010: 81). The Data Protection Authority had previously criticised the same bill on funda- mental grounds, and had asked the Government to analyse the advantages anddisadvantages of a national travel document records system. The Government hadresponded by adding a few comments to the explanatory memorandum accompa-nying the bill, primarily by listing the advantages and disadvantages of such asystem. However, it devoted only a single page of the memorandum to theAuthority's fundamental objections (function creep, risk of abuse, improper andunanticipated use) and did not mention the other objections (relating to inherenttechnical and security risks) at all. The State Secretary did acknowledge, however,165 supervisors of egovernmentthat \"fingerprints and photographs stored in a database that are related to a stolen identity document ... could cause the true owner of that identity endless seriousproblems. Biometric data is not by definition secret and can leave a trail in its wakethat permits that data to be gathered without the owner being aware of it\" (Twee-de Kamer 2007-2008a: 23). The Data Protection Authority's second core responsibility is enforcement, and it is within that context that it recently investigated the security of hospital datasystems, storage by public transport companies of entry and exit data for studentstravelling on a public transport chip card, and the use of automatic number platerecognition ( anpr ). It is difficult to say whether enforcement by the Data Protec- tion Authority is effective, as there has been no research on the matter. What isclear, however, is that such enforcement sometimes causes the relevant Ministerto announce new legislation permitting the very activity against which theAuthority has taken action. That is what happened in early 2010 when the Author-ity concluded that storing irrelevant anpr data was contrary to law. Just days later, the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations and the Minister of Justicetogether announced plans for a statutory framework that would legitimise suchstorage (Tweede Kamer 2009-2010f). There are also other signs that effective enforcement is far from easy for the Authority. For example, it does not always appear to have a very clear idea of themany different applications being developed at local and regional level. As a result,it almost never takes action at that level, if at all, allowing local administrators topursue their aims seemingly without obstacles, instructions or supervision(Keymolen & Prins 2011). In addition, as explained above, it is precisely at theoperational level that data processes transcend boundaries between sectors, butthe Data Protection Authority still examines opportunities and risks on a sector-by-sector basis. In its self-evaluation in 2004, it commented that this approachwas compatible with the nature and function of supervision ( cbp 2004). The two roles that the Authority has prioritised - enforcement and advising on legislation -are sometimes also subject to a particular political dynamic over which theAuthority itself has no control. A case in point is the history of the ElectronicPatient Dossier. The Minister of Health made strategic use of the Authority'shighly critical report on hospital data systems. The problems that it identified inlocal systems gave the Minister an additional reason to stress the importance ofthe national epd system (Eerste Kamer 2009-2010c). Because it did not contradict the Minister's argument (or was unable to do so), it seemed as if the Authorityimplicitly supported the epd , or at least preferred a national system to a regional one. What is problematical in this case is that the Authority's findings relating tothe security of hospital data systems have not been published, making it impossi-ble to compare them to the security guarantees that the national system wassupposed to provide. 166 igovernmentThe emphasis on enforcement and advising on legislation leaves no room for tailor-made advice, and the Authority has shifted the emphasis from ex ante supervision to ex post supervision ( cbp 2010c: 36). Although people can submit complaints to www.mijnprivacy.nl (a rather static website), the Authority will not deal with individual cases. Neither can private or public-sector organisationsuse the website to request advice. The Authority does not interact with individualdata-processors or citizens, for example in the form of user or advisory boards orconsultation rounds, despite being urged to do so (Civil Service Committee onRegulatory Matters ii 2004: 15-16). By contrast, the United Kingdom's data protection authority does consult with individual parties in this way (InformationCommissioner's Office 2007). 7.1.3 office of the national ombudsman The Office of the National Ombudsman also monitors the development of eGov-ernment. It does so by assessing the appropriateness of action taken by govern-ment, either on its own initiative or in response to a complaint. According to themethod used by the National Ombudsman, appropriateness should be judgedaccording to the criteria of fundamental rights, the appropriateness of the action interms of legal substance (proportionality, equality and legal certainty), its formalappropriateness (reasons given, fair play) and the standards of due care applied(professionalism, provision of information, administrative accuracy). It is notcompulsory for an administrative body to act on the National Ombudsman'sassessment. Unlike the Data Protection Authority, the Office of the National Ombudsman will consider individual complaints by private citizens. Its various annual reports showthat it has dealt with a wide variety of complaints about cases of identity fraudoccurring in police and other government systems that have attracted widespreadmedia attention; data processing in the systems maintained by the Immigrationand Naturalisation Service; the public transport chip card for students (where itturned out that the ibGroup, which is responsible for student grants and loans, had handed over the power to resolve problems itself to the public transportcompanies); photographs posted on a police website of an individual wronglysuspected of a crime; coordination problems between the Tax and CustomsAdministration, the Social Insurance Bank, various pension funds, and the SocialSecurity Agency related to the operational tasks of the Health Care InsuranceBoard; and so forth (Office of the National Ombudsman 2009). While these prob-lems cover a very broad spectrum, they are presented in the National Ombuds-man's annual reports primarily on an organisation-by-organisation basis.Although the National Ombudsman has emphasised problems arising from thedigital supply chain approach in recent annual reports, it is almost impossible todeduce the scale, seriousness and nature of the complaints relating directly to the167 supervisors of egovernmentuse of ict . In general, it is far from easy to identity such problems in the dossiers compiled over time not only by the Office of the National Ombudsman, but also by the Data Protection Authority and, more recently, by the Identity FraudHelpdesk. Indeed, these organisations themselves do not have a very clear idea. Intheir analysis, Choenni et al. (2011) show that the records held by all these organi-sations are difficult, if not impossible, to relate to the role that ict has played in the complaints they have received. In addition, the Data Protection Authority hasclassified many obviously ict-related complaints in the very general main cate- gory of 'Other'. 7.1.4 netherlands court of audit The Netherlands Court of Audit investigates whether central government revenueand expenditure are received and spent correctly and whether central governmentpolicy is implemented as intended and has the intended effects. As noted in previ-ous chapters, this is an important task in light of the eGovernment 'drive'. Afterall, the Court of Audit checks whether the intended improvements in policy effec-tiveness and efficiency have actually been achieved. It is up to the Governmentand/or Parliament to attach consequences to the Court's conclusions and to judgethem in political terms. As already pointed out in previous chapters, the Netherlands Court of Audit has been critical - sometimes highly critical - of both government's ict projects and its approach to information management. Although it is reasonably easy to inves-tigate the revenue and expenditure involved in ict projects (the incoming and outgoings are relatively easy to quantify), that is otherwise when it comes toassessing government's information management systems. The Court has never-theless long been critical of government in this area as well. It believes thatgovernment does not pay sufficient attention to information management, andexplains this by pointing to the fact that in government, \"information manage-ment 'merely' supports the operational process, unlike in commercial enterprises\"(Netherlands Court of Audit 2009: 8). Sustainable information management,however, is \"very unlikely to develop without the ongoing attention and persever-ance of the Ministries' senior officials and political leadership\" (Netherlands Courtof Audit 2009: 8). Problems are now too often depicted as incidents and resolvedby taking ad hoc measures, until the next problem arises and has to be tackled. Inthe Court's view, government should develop a strategic agenda for dealing withthe rapid changes brought about by the digitization of information. It should, forexample, be considering how to archive digital information in the form of e-mails,text messages and tweets. When using a piece of information for the first time,government must already consider how best to archive it and make it retrievableand explore the extent to which it is important for heritage reasons (NetherlandsCourt of Audit 2010b). The Court also comments, however, that its own survey of168 igovernmentinformation management abroad has not produced any examples of good practices appropriate to the Dutch style of public administration (Netherlands Court ofAudit 2009: 21). Incidentally, the Court has repeatedly advised government todevelop a strategic agenda and framework for archiving, deleting, and storing digi-tal files (Netherlands Court of Audit 1991; Netherlands Court of Audit 1998), and itis not alone in that respect: the tone struck in two reports by other advisorybodies, one by the Archives Division of the Cultural Heritage Inspectorate (2005)and one by the Council for Culture and the Council for Public Administration(2008), is one of alarm. The Archives Division observes that government organi-sations frequently have no idea where they have stored their digital operationaland accountability information. Senior public administrators should play a muchmore active role in coordinating and organising information management(Archives Division of the Cultural Heritage Inspectorate 2005). In its variousresponses, the Government agrees with the conclusions of these reports. It recog-nises the need to define a strategic agenda, to take a comprehensive approach, andto change the internal culture of public administration (Tweede Kamer 2008-2009e). Not only has there been explosive growth in the quantity of information,but it is also being provided in a rapidly changing succession of different media.Inevitably, any strategic agenda relating to archiving and digital sustainability willlag behind. It is therefore crucial for government to get a grip on the dynamic issueof archiving and digitization. According to the Government, sustainability shouldbe considered at the 'front end' of the information chain, given the importanceof operational management, accountability and cultural heritage (Tweede Kamer2005-2006b: par. 3.2.). The President of the Netherlands Court of Audit, SaskiaStuiveling, said in an interview that there is much more involved than shifting thefocus to the front end of the information chain, however. Gradually, it is becomingclear to what extent the digital archive can be 'engineered'. Perhaps we mustsimply accept that archives tend to grow organically and focus in particular onsearch strategies. It is important to come up with new ways of retracing informa-tion that we once thought we would never need again. Government must work ona cultural transformation with respect to digitized information processes. It mustleave behind its traditional linear approach to creation, use, management, andarchiving and start regarding these as simultaneous processes in which all infor-mation, regardless of its purpose (operational process, institutional memory,cultural heritage, accountability, legal claims, evidence) is considered of equalvalue and viewed as a coherent whole. This means that the bureaucracy will haveto function more as an open system. 7.1.5 judiciary Whereas policymakers are under no official obligation to heed the advice of thebodies referred to above, they ultimately do have to adhere to rulings by thecourts. Nevertheless, the public - who approach the Office of the National169 supervisors of egovernmentOmbudsmen and even, to a more limited extent, the Data Protection Authority with complaints about government digitization - scarcely ever turn to the judicialauthorities. That is also the case in other countries (Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger 2009: 138-139). It is evidently difficult to 'kick-start' an individual to initiate court proceed-ings on a matter of information: citizens are handed decisions that areunfavourable to them but are unaware that their case can also be viewed as adispute about the underlying information. For example, various reports evaluatingthe Personal Data Protection Act have noted that judicial rulings related to the Acthave been very few in number (Zwenne et al. 2007; Winter et al. 2008). Thisobservation can be applied to other legislation governing the way personal data isdealt with, for example the Police Data Act ( Wet politiegegevens), the Municipal Database (Personal Records) Act ( Wet gba ), and so on. In short, the courts have had little opportunity to interpret and enforce rules pertaining to the digitizedprocessing of personal data. Rare exceptions include the ruling by the Court ofAppeal in Leeuwarden (June 2010), 2which concluded that there was no statutory basis for using images from motorway cameras in a criminal investigation, and theruling by the Dutch Supreme Court (March 2010) on a case in which the PublicProsecutions Service had demanded data from Trans Link Systems (Buruma 2011).The Public Prosecutions Service had requisitioned name and address details and id photographs of all passengers travelling on a public transport chip card who werepresent in certain Rotterdam metro stations at a specified time, as part of a crimi-nal investigation. The Supreme Court ruled that the idphotographs could only be requisitioned after authorisation by the delegated judge, and could only be used ina criminal investigation after such authorisation had been obtained. 3 The picture is somewhat different when people are affected financially. Examplesare the various court cases relating to errors in the systems used by the Tax andCustoms Administration, or the exchange of data with an external organisationcontracted to issue tax demands (Gribnau 2010). The latter was the subject of acourt case in 2009. A system error led to incorrect data being exchanged betweenthe municipal personal records database and Cocensus, the firm that the relevantlocal authority had contracted to issue tax demands in respect of waste material.The local authority had attempted to recover the missing amount from the publiclater on, but the court ruled that an additional demand was not possible. 4As in the case of the Data Protection Authority and anpr , however, the Government is a sore loser at times and, just days after a negative decision by the courts, mayannounce new legislation changing the situation in its favour. A case in point is theresponse of the Minister of Finance to the Supreme Court's ruling that, in theevent of an erroneous tax demand owing to an error in the design of a computersystem, an additional demand would not be possible. 5The Minister presented a bill that would make additional demands possible in the event of major errors dueto the use of ict (Tweede Kamer 2009-2010h).170 igovernmentThe judiciary in the Netherlands has little opportunity to comment on govern- ment's ict aims, especially when compared with other countries. In a memoran- dum addressed to the Senate, the Minister of Justice suggested that the Nether-lands lacked \"an organised movement that could claim to represent citizens whoare specifically attempting to protect their data\", and that the absence of such amovement influenced the number of data-related disputes submitted to the courts (Eerste Kamer 2009-2010a: 48). Potentially even more important is that theNetherlands does not, as yet, have any means of testing the constitutionality of alegislative act. Rulings handed down not only in Germany (for example the rulingof 2 March 2010 on data retention), 6but also previously in Romania (8 October 2009)7show that constitutional courts are sometimes willing to overrule legisla- tion permitting government to use personal data because they consider it a breachof fundamental principles. The international courts - and in particular the Euro-pean Court of Human Rights - have also been very consistent (De Hert 2011); theyhave been critical of government's policy objectives and, in a nutshell, have ruledthat states must exercise restraint when using technology to gather and usepersonal data (De Hert 2009). 7.1.6 new arrangements Alongside the Netherlands Court of Audit, the Council of State, the NationalOmbudsman, the Data Protection Authority and/or the judiciary, there are otheractors and government organisations that have been designated or have taken on aregulatory, supervisory and accountability role in recent years. For example, thecio s described earlier provide Parliament with timely, accurate information in order to support its supervisory powers. In the Coalition Agreement, the RutteGovernment has agreed to institute a national supervisory body for data leaks:\"The government will produce proposals for all public and private-sector infor-mation society services to have a duty to report any loss, theft or abuse of personaldata to a national supervising body, which will have powers to impose fines if anyleakage of such data is found not to have been reported\" (official translation ofRegeerakkoord 2010). The uk had a regulator specifically charged with supervising identity management issues, i.e. the Identity Commissioner. However, theCameron Government, which took office in May 2010, scrapped the IdentityCards Act of 2006 and with it the office of the Identity Commissioner. In addition to new institutions, there are also new arrangements, specifically those made between the various agencies, which have set up their own systems ofchecks and balances. This is in fact a much older development, but the use of ict has clearly been a stimulating factor. The new arrangements have their origins notonly in the tools that have emerged with the rise of technology, but also in theneed to respond to the specific complexity involved in using ict and the changes that it effects in relationships. One example relates to the client councils and171 supervisors of egovernmentcustomer panels set up by the Social Insurance Bank and the Social Security Agency to enable citizens to discuss and provide feedback on online initiatives(such as the Digital Insurance Report or on www.burgerpolis.nl). Other initiatives- for example the gateway review and it Dashboard - provide Parliament with more up-to-date reports on the progress of ict projects, in particular large-scale ones (Snijders 2011). Online complaints desks such as the Identity Fraud Helpdeskand the Citizen Service Number Helpdesk also illustrate the new supervision andcontrol arrangements. According to the National Ombudsman, Alex Bren-ninkmeijer, it is precisely the human factor that makes some of the above-mentioned arrangements a success. The quality and integrity of systems depend inlarge measure on the way human feedback and feedback loops are organised, forexample through the 'Stella teams' set up by the Tax and CustomsAdministration. 8 One increasingly popular tool consists of Privacy Enhancing Technologies ( pet s). In effect, this tool integrates supervision and enforcement of the statutory rulesfor dealing with personal data into the technology itself. Remarkably, Parliamenthad already called on the Government to apply pet s in its systems on 18 Novem- ber 1999, when it voted overwhelmingly in favour of a motion to that effectsubmitted by 1999-2000). So far, however, this request has scarcely been followed up. When the Ministry ofthe Interior and Kingdom Relations asked seven government organisations to setup trial projects in 2003, they responded that it was not an opportune time to startworking with pet s (Borking 2010). The same year, a study commissioned by the same Ministry and carried out by rand Corporation Europe listed the top five government arguments against pet s: the existing methods of protecting privacy were sufficient; privacy did not need to be protected; experiments with pet s were a threat to the reliability, quality of service, and image of the government bodyconcerned; pet s were not a mature technology; and there was not enough time, money or man-power available to introduce pet s (Borking, 2010). Three years later, the evaluation of the Personal Data Protection Act determined that that atti-tude had not really changed (Zwenne et al. 2007). Today, however, the climateseems more favourable: there are now loud calls to take pet s seriously, both at the international level (the European Commission's Article 29 Data Protection Work-ing Party and the European Data Protection Authority) and in the Netherlands(the Government, Parliament, and the Dutch Data Protection Authority). 7.2 the multifaceted citizen More broadly speaking, there are naturally also supervisory entities operatingoutside the context of government. The role of the media springs to mind, whosecoverage and criticism of eGovernment has been mentioned numerous times inthis book. A growing number of citizen initiatives and citizen and consumer172 igovernmentrepresentatives have set themselves up as irritants and regularly force government to account for its plans and aims or to modify them. In response to the actiongroup 'we don't trust voting computers' (wij vertrouwen stemcomputers niet ) the Dutch cabinet in 2007 even decided to take voting computers out of service. Insome cases, citizens mobilise and form official, professional organisations, forexample the Dutch Consumers Association; in other cases, they set up flexible, adhoc groups. The way in which such groups and organisations themselves use ict has dramatically changed the 'mobilisation of public opinion'. The lightning speedat which information can be disseminated through ict and the social networking media can nip a policy proposal in the bud, raise it for discussion (for example thevaccination for cervical cancer), or tip the political debate one way or another (asthe account below of the biometric passport will show). Citizens have a differentattitude toward government than they used to, one that appears to encourageever-greater activism when it comes to government's use of ict. Activist-citizens want to do more than simply monitor government, and they often operate verydifferently to the 'traditional' supervisory bodies. Although such grassrootscampaigns are often intended to supervise and correct, some go a step further.Aided by social networking media, dissatisfied citizens take over governmentresponsibilities themselves or take action to make government more transparent(and therefore easier to scrutinise). Nevertheless, it remains difficult for individualcitizens to 'take part' in the process and 'contribute' to digitization initiatives. Forexample, it is rare for government to set up a public consultation process whilepreparing new policy and invite the public to comment. 7.2.1 influencing policy One good example of how the citizen can influence policy is the bill introducingthe smart energy meter, which was rejected by the Senate in April 2009. After the Consumers Association had let the Senate know its objections to the bill,sharply criticising its privacy implications (Eerste Kamer 2008-2009a), and aftercitizens had campaigned against it, for example on the website www.wijvertrouwen slimmemetersniet.nl ('www.wedonottrustsmartmeter.nl'), the Minister was compelled to amend the bill. In the new version, the data generated by the energymeter could only be used with the end user's consent, the only exception beingsome basic information required for invoicing purposes (Tweede Kamer 2009-2010e). In the original bill, the end user had no say in how the data would be used. 7.2.2 taking control Citizens do not always campaign because they want to see changes in policy. Theirdissatisfaction may also lead them to take over government's traditional tasksthemselves. A well-known and controversial www.stopkindersexnu.nl ('www.stopsexwithchildrennow.nl') and its173 supervisors of egovernmentsuccessors, with each new website bein g launched when government takes steps against the existing one. The websites publish the whereabouts of convicted paedophiles who have been rehabilitated. The parents who produce, consume andact in accordance with this application in a variety of ways do indeed have everyinterest in knowing that a convicted paedophile is moving into their neighbour-hood, but the 'ad hoc justice' that it advocates undermines the principle, upheld bythe law and by government, that every offender must be allowed to reintegrateinto society. Another, more playful, attempt to undermine government enforce-ment of the law is the website www.flitsservice.nl ('www.speedcameraservice.nl'), which continuously updates the locations of stationary and mobile speedcameras (for example those built into waste disposal bins). 7.2.3 more transparency Besides campaigns aimed at changing policy or at taking over government tasks,citizens can also agitate for more government transparency. For example, organi-sations such as The New Way of Voting Foundation ( Stichting Het Nieuwe Stem- men ) and others advocate transparency and public participation via the Internet, whether they are aiming to encourage more informed voting on the part of citi-zens (www.wiekiesjij.nl; 'www.whowillyouvotefor.nl'), to boost the right of citi-zens to petition government and take the initiative themselves (www.petities.nl;'www.petitions.nl') or to lower the threshold to approaching politicians(www.maildepolitiek.nl; 'www.emailpoliticians.nl'). Another example is the Crit-ical itInfrastructure Foundation ( Stichting Kritische itInfrastructuur), which hopes to launch a fundamental discussion of the political, social and administra-tive considerations involved when the public sector selects systems, software andict suppliers. A more institutionalised countervailing power emanates from the Government Information (Public Access) Act (wob ), whose impact was recently boosted by a tool that encourages and enables ordinary citizens (as opposed tojournalists) to submit requests for information under the terms of the Act(www.woberator.nl). Although government today discloses far more informationthan it ever did in the past, its brand of transparency only produces informationproducts that have already been 'processed': reality has already been convertedinto information (for example on policy). More radical are the 'open data' initia-tives such as those in the United Kingdom, which the Netherlands is cautiouslybeginning to emulate. 9These provide raw government data, rather than govern- ment information, so that the citizen can actually study the choices that govern-ment makes based on the data available to it. Citizens can also give their creativityfree rein with such data and come up with new applications for it, such as pollu-tion maps, crime maps (which combine police bulletins with designated locations)or the bbc News map (a map showing the locations of news stories reported by the bbc ). 174 igovernmentThe influence of these various citizen initiatives is evident in the extent to which government embraces them and takes them on board. Government is increasinglysupporting and/or adopting such initiatives. For example, both the Citizen Link(Burgerlink ) programme run by the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations and the website www.digitalepioniers.nl ('www.digitalpioneers.nl') have been set up by government to endorse and support citizen initiatives. A governmentendorsement may create a difficult dilemma for the initiators, however: they mustchoose between accepting funding and thereby losing their autonomy or continu-ing independently without any financial support, fuelled only by their enthusiasm. 7.2.4 citizens and their guiding principles Citizen initiatives are becoming something more than a countervailing poweroperating in the margins. Grassroots movements collaborate with well-knowninternational human rights organisations, rapidly mobilise followers through thenew media, have access to substantial financial resources, and step into the arenawell-armed with expert advice, for example from lawyers. Resistance against thebiometric passport gained momentum in the summer of 2009, when a broadcoalition of ngo s headed by the Netherlands Committee of Jurists for Human Rights ( njcm , the Dutch section of the International Commission of Jurists) insti- tuted proceedings before the United Nations Human Rights Committee againstthe Government's plans under the new Passport Act to store all biometric pass-port data in a national database. 10The digital citizens' rights movement Bits of Freedom was subsequently revived and organisations such as the DutchConsumers Association also became involved in the privacy debate. The discus-sion was gradually taken over by professionals, with a possible entrenchment ofpositions as a result. In 2009, the Privacy First Foundation began, with the assis-tance of a law firm, to prepare a case against the Minister responsible for the Pass-port Act. The Vrijbit ('Freebit') association had already attempted to block the newlegislation by instituting emergency proceedings before the European Court ofHuman Rights. In late November 2009, another organisation (Het Nieuwe Rijk,i.e. 'The New State') distributed a leaflet designed to resemble a governmentleaflet and calling on citizens to have their Citizen Service Number tattooed ontheir arm. The relevant State Secretary announced that the Government wouldtake legal steps against this campaign. On 11 January 2010, the Public ProsecutionsService let it be known that it would not consider the State Secretary's complaint.A day later, however, the Dutch Advertising Code Authority claimed competencein the matter and judged that the 'advertisement' was contrary to the DutchAdvertising Code. 11 Although society tends to be most critical when the underpinning principle ofprivacy is at stake - as shown in numerous examples given above - there have alsobeen campaigns for the process-based principle of transparency. For example, the175 supervisors of egovernmentCritical itInfrastructure Foundation mentioned above wants ict systems to be selected for reasons other than operational considerations alone; it would like more consideration to be given to the transparency and democratic supervision ofapplications and systems and to the autonomy of government. In one sense, citi-zens who organise themselves into groups of this kind are acting as a new type ofsupervisory body, and they believe they have a role to play in organising counter-vailing forces aimed at preventing or undoing certain government ict initiatives or raising them for discussion. But the rise of such citizen movements and theirefforts at supervision and control also raise questions about the tools they use orhave available, their legal position, and the legitimacy of their efforts: To whatextent do they speak on behalf of citizens? Are the procedures that result in thedecision to take action transparent? Are the sources on which they base theirefforts sufficiently reliable, known and verifiable? 7.3 conclusion The consequences of eGovernment are becoming more apparent all the time.Judging by the growing level of activism, this increasing visibility has sparked off adebate on the desirability of eGovernment and the direction that it should take. Itis nevertheless a debate that has been defined (so far) by pure chance. In somecases, the dynamic social forces that turn a certain question into a 'hot issue' onlyerupt long after official decision-making has ended. The example of biometric datain passports shows that political decision-making and accountability may be outof touch with the perceptions and sensitivities of the public. At the same time,however, the attention focused on this particular issue was rather arbitrary: thereare numerous other issues requiring public discussion that are simply not gettingthe attention they deserve. In most cases, it seems that 'society' has left the job ofevaluating eGovernment in the hands of Parliament (and the Government) andthe 'supervisors' that are indirectly involved. These institutions face the difficulttask of deciding, one application and one connection at a time, how best to designthe digital relationship between government and the citizen. It is not easy for such'supervisors' to pinpoint and weigh up the concerns and interests that must beaddressed and then reach an opinion on them. In terms of their duties and scope ofinterest, the existing bodies that supervise eGovernment are either restricted toassessing applications without viewing (or being able to view) them in a widercontext, or limited to assessing a particul ar aspect of the de velopment of eGovern- ment. This chapter has considered not only how policy decisions are influenced by the supervisory bodies identified, but also how transparency and accountability aregenerated for individual citizens. That involves assessing the citizen's positionwith respect to information (transparency) and the citizen's access to redress(accountability) in cases in which individual interests are affected. There have176 igovernmentbeen major problems in this respect, as the National Ombudsman has been quick to point out, although - remarkably enough - neither the courts nor the DataProtection Authority have asserted themselves in such cases. Those problems canbe summarised as follows. Efforts to develop an efficient but equally client-driveneGovernment have not been accompanied by efforts to give the citizen a betterunderstanding of his or her own information position and the possibility of takingcorrective action in that respect. The chains and networks of information that aidgovernment in its tasks have not been counterbalanced by chain-like or network-like protection for citizens. It will be necessary to find that balance, becauseeGovenment engenders great vulnerabilities in the small number of cases in whichinformation processes go wrong, despite its also offering enormous advantages inthe larger number of cases in which information processes function correctly.177 supervisors of egovernmentnotes 1 Interview with van Roos- 2010. 2 ljn : bm 8100 (www.rechtspraak.nl). 3 ljn : bk 6331, Dutch Supreme Court, 08/04524 B (www.rechtspraak.nl). 4 Haarlem District Court, 11 September 2009, no. 09/902, ntfr 2009/2158. 5 Dutch Supreme Court, 14 March 2008, no. 43.301, ntfr 2008/551. 6 Bundesverfassungsgericht, 2 March 2010, case 1 BvR case no. 1.258, www.ccr.ro/decisions/ pdf/ro/2009/D1258_09.pdf, consulted on 18 November 2010. 8 Interview with A.

The aim is tomake government streamlined, digital and service-minded while at the same timesatisfying the citizen and 'client'. In addition, ict is increasingly being used in policymaking in the care sector and in the interest of public safety and interna-tional security. New systems and their interconnections are meant to make boththe community and the world a safer place for the citizen. Indeed, innovative useof the new technology is rapidly becoming a cornerstone of modern governmentpolicy in every area of service, care and control. At the same time, the dynamicnature of ict influences the 'rules of the game', whether that means the rules that apply to the interaction between government and the citizen, between differentgovernment organisations, or between government and private parties. Informa-tion is exchanged between organisations and crosses the boundaries between thepublic and private sectors without proper consideration being given to the impli-cations for the citizen and the authorities. More and more often, government basesits dealings with citizens on profiling and the information that it has gathered,leaving those same citizens powerless and empty-handed if the information isincorrect or is incorrectly interpreted. Furthermore, government is often seem-ingly unwilling or unable to set limits to its own appetite for collecting data: it ismore likely to find reasons to gather more information than to curb its owncuriosity. When it comes to new technology and, in particular, the information flows that new technology generates, government has a double responsibility. On the onehand, it must explore new tools, technological innovations and information flowsto determine whether they can improve government policy. On the other, it mustalso prevent any foreseen and unforeseen side effects of the new information toolsfrom harming citizens (Buruma 2011). The deployment of ict and the associated information flows in policymaking are never without wider consequences. Apurely instrumentalist approach to technology is therefore naive at best and harm-ful at worst. As we saw in Part ii, new information flows also create new social and policy-related realities that have repercussions for citizens and for the authoritiesthemselves. Government must therefore find a way to navigate between twocontrasting demands: using ict innovatively in policy and policy implementation, and protecting citizens against the foreseen and unforeseen effects of ict , in particular complex information flows. This chapter places the trends analysed in Part ii in a new framework and suggests a perspective on a necessary paradigm shift. It begins by recapitulating the most181important features of eGovernment, i.e. the main framework in which govern- ment now relates to ict . Starting from this framework, we then shift our focus to an entirely different perspective on ict in government, which we refer to here as iGovernment. This new perspective raises pointed and urgent questions forgovernment that have so far not received the attention due to them when viewedfrom the perspective of eGovernment and its unilateral focus on technology. Byzeroing in on the information Government, we focus on the information flows rather than the individual technologies and applications, and show that, far frombeing 'engineered' by politicians and policymakers, iGovernment is in fact 'emerg-ing' in a very real and empirical sense. This raises questions about how iGovern-ment is to evolve further and about the relationship between the citizen andgovernment within that context. 8.1 egovernment At first, government regarded ict primarily as a tool for streamlining its own (internal) organisation and processes, in particular with respect to policy imple-mentation. ict then became all-pervasive under the 'eGovernment' banner, and the emphasis shifted to the 'outside', i.e. to policy aimed at increasing the effec-tiveness and efficiency of services delivered to citizens and businesses. eGovern-ment plans and strategic agendas typically present a positive view of technology.ict is overwhelmingly regarded as a neutral tool that can be used to achieve certain aims. There is little concern for the context in which ict and eGovernment is being introduced (Bekkers & Homburg 2009: 227), or for the other foreseen andunforeseen effects of using technology (De Mul 2003). Technology is 'rolled out',work processes are 'streamlined', and services are 'updated'. 'Techno-trust' prevails. It should be noted that there is growing concern regarding the coherence and coor- dination between the different systems emerging in the back office of govern-ment, specifically with respect to service provision. That concern focuses mainlyon the technical aspects, however, such as interoperability 1and open standards, and not on how to keep networked information in check. Neither is there muchdiscussion of the dependencies and vulnerabilities created by the coherence that issought by the coordination between organisations and interoperability of infor-mation. When vulnerabilities are acknowledged, they are resolved by a new formof 'neutralisation': technology itself is put forward to neutralise the risks associ-ated with technology with the help of by design' 2and 'privacy enhancing technologies' ( pet s).3Because politicians do little more than pay lip service to these new solutions, however, they have not turned out to be the solutions thatthey might have been. A motion adopted by the House of Representatives in 1999to apply pet s in new government systems has so far been largely disregarded, despite a recent resurgence of enthusiasm in the House. In addition, the focus on182 igovernmenttechnology encourages politicians to continue viewing it as a neutral tool; the possibility that a given application involves social change and risk is glossed overin discussions by portraying it as an eminently practical innovation. The emphasis on technology also signifies a failure to properly consider what it means for therelationship between government and the citizen to be transformed into a rela-tionship between a service provider and a consumer - a key idea in the thinkingbehind eGovernment. Highlighting the service aspect of that relationship alsomakes government vulnerable: it raises expectations among citizens that government certainly cannot always live up to, especially when compared to theict-driven services provided by businesses (which are also not always ideal). Although government White Papers still demonstrate a strong belief and trust inwhat ict can achieve, real-life experience in the twenty-first century has enriched the eGovernment discourse and made it somewhat more subtle. The emphasis isstill on the opportunities that ict offers government, but there is also growing concern regarding the barriers that stand in the way of achieving eGovernment,for example the integration and coordination problems that arise when attemptingto set up a one-stop helpdesk or integrated provision of electronic services. Agrowing number of warnings can be found in the academic literature and in advi-sory reports to government. In 2007, for example, the Postma-Wallage Committeeechoed previous reports in noting a lack of coordination and major differences inspeed, but also the absence of any sense of urgency. \"Many of our interviewees see the implementation of eGovernment mainly as a 'technical opera- tion' that has no clear relationship with the substance of policy. We can attribute this to the almosttotal lack of attention among politicians and policymakers at national and local level. Far too often, the projects have remained the province of technical experts\" (Postma-Wallage Committee2007: 9). Despite such clear warnings, government's more recent ict policy documents - including its ict Agenda 2008-2011 (Ministerie van ez2008) - continue to speak in terms of 'priority topics' without addressing the associated challenges and broader implications. 8.2 from egovernment to igovernment If we look beyond the applications and layers of digitization introduced within thecontext of eGovernment, we find a hodgepodge of information flows runningwithin and between the various authorities, both inside and outside the relation-ship between the citizen and government. It is extremely rare, however, forgovernment policy to explicitly prioritise information and its management. Stepby step, decision by decision, the everyday work of government is giving rise to183 igovernment'information government' without this being based on any overall strategic agenda or awareness among political decision-makers. Paradoxically, government isconstructing iGovernment without being aware of its existence. Because politi-cians have failed to recognise that government has become iGovernment, thelatter has no 'natural' limits - a feature reinforced by the tendencies inherent tothe developments de scribed in Part ii of this book. First of all, effectiveness, efficiency and security are manifestly the most impor-tant driving forces behind the introduction of technological applications andconnections between them. Secondly, the policy domains of service, care andcontrol are becoming increasingly interwoven. Thirdly, personal information isgrowing more and more important within the various information flows. Thesetendencies are giving rise to various risks that this book aims to identify. Forexample, the fact that politicians are seemingly unaware of the rise of iGovern-ment means that government risks lo sing its grip on th is developme nt. The absence of any proper organisational and institutional framework can also lead toexternalities that will require a great deal of time, money and effort from govern-ment. Finally, if no proper frameworks are created for iGovernment, the citizencould lose confidence in government - as could government agencies in oneanother - as a reliable custodian and user of information. Without this confidence,however, iGovernment cannot innovate its primary processes and policy. 8.2.1 crossing the boundaries of egovernment Although it is not necessary to immediately discard the eGovernment paradigm assuch, iGovernment does not match the overriding image of eGovernment in a num-ber of significant ways. That is because iGovernment differs entirely in its featuresfrom eGovernment. Viewed through the lens of iGovernment, it is not individualtechnical facilities that matter as much as information and information flows. Public authorities have always had a natural inclination to gather information in order to intervene in society on the basis of that information. Torpey (1998)observes that the state first embraces society in the informational sense before taking effective action. This means gathering as much information as possible, forone thing by means of a finely meshed administrative infrastructure, and thenusing that information across the full breadth of government policy. According toa study by the Data Protection Authority, the average Dutch person is linked to250 to 500 different records, with the lower limit being associated with someonewho 'lives like a hermit', according to the Chairman of the Data ProtectionAuthority, Jacob Kohnstamm (Schermer & Wagemans 2009). The potential to'embrace society' has increased dramatically in recent years, and will indeedcontinue to do so in the foreseeable future. The sharp increase in storage andcomputing capacity and the growing level of interoperability between different184 igovernmentsystems mean that, in the infrastructural sense, the facts have overtaken eGov- ernment. That infrastructure makes a number of policy-related and organisational developments possible that have also radically changed the nature of digitalgovernment in the practical sense. To begin with, technology - as the previous chapters have shown - is no longer deployed merely to improve and streamline government service provision but also to gather and link information for care and control purposes. Increasingly, ict plays a vital role in youth policy and healthcare (care), and has become indispensa-ble in immigration policy and security policy, both to fight crime for counter-terrorism purposes and in the more everyday enforcement of the law (control).With respect to security, information is passed not only between organisations inthe Netherlands but also between the Netherlands and other countries and inter-national organisations. The infrastructure of digitization and interoperabilitymake it much easier for information to be pooled in what are essentially separatedomains of service, care and control. Thanks to technology, the boundariesbetween these domains - which were never very sharply defined in the first place- are becoming increasingly blurred. Secondly, the importance of networks of actors and, in particular, information networks continues to grow. The number of partnership and information arrange-ments between public and private actors is growing both within and outsidegovernment, giving rise to complex reciprocal information interdependencies.Private and public information flows also get blended together into thesenetworks. The authorities are growing increasingly interested in the informationgathered by private individuals and enterprises, and they make considerable use ofsuch information. In chain computerisation, information is passed from oneorganisation in the chain to another; in networks, however, information isexchanged or managed collectively without it being passed along a fixed sequenceof actors. Oddly enough, government often refers to chain computerisation ratherthan network computerisation, whereas in reality it is the latter that is increasinglystandard. The dynamic nature of information dissemination and utilisation innetworks makes it very difficult at times to decide who is responsible for specificinformation about citizens (and for safeguarding the accuracy of that information).A network is also a web in which citizens can become entangled, as, for instance,the Kowsoleea case made clear. 4In the end, even the Office of the National Ombudsman (2009) was unable to track down the complex chain of interactionsthat led to this case of identity fraud so that the record could be set straight. IneGovernment, government's main problem was how to develop the relevantsystems while avoiding the risk of major financial debacles. Today, however, thepotential repercussions of faulty information or misdirected information flowsrepresent a different and far greater risk, one that threatens both the individualcitizen and government itself. 185 igovernmentThirdly, the growing number of information sources - and in particular the poten- tial for interrelating and processing information - means that iGovernmentincreasingly makes use of digital profiling techniques, and as a result groups citi-zens into certain categories. Profiling is playing a growing role in policy and policyimplementation. Categorisation of citizens becomes a dominant theme as govern-ment applies data mining and other techniques to the information it has stored inorder to generate and combine a variety of information sources. 5To some extent that is unavoidable: the amount of information stored simply exceeds humancapacity, forcing government to turn to electronic processing and profiling. Whatthis means in everyday practice, however, is that people are linked to a variety ofprofiles and 'data doubles', in other words to images put together from varioussources of information that then take on a life of their own in the systems main-tained by government (and/or business and industry). Such profiles consist ofinformation that is first decontextualized - taken out of the context in which it was collected - and then recontextualized within the context of the new compos- ite profile. This process is naturally not an exclusively technical affair ('categorieshave politics'), nor is it without social implications. Such 'images of the future'hinder the autonomy (freedom of choice) of individuals in a way similar to the'images from the past' that linger so long due to the ict-revolution. After all, a profile amounts to a prognosis on the future identity of an individual. Govern-ment also uses such processes to anticipate the future. Profiles and informationprocesses play a growing role in 'preventive policing' or in the youth care sector,where information gathering and data linkages are regarded as indispensable forpreventing the tragedy of child abuse. Fourthly, trends in the iSociety and trends in iGovernment have an impact on one another. New information-gathering tools are invented outside the context ofgovernment. The new social networking media, the behaviour of buyers andshoppers online, and the information collected in the private sector are all generat-ing a potential goldmine of digital trails. That information can be used, within therelevant margins and statutory frameworks, to satisfy government's informationneeds. At the same time, the mere fact that such information exists only serves toencourage those information needs: there are no natural limits to informationgathering, nor are there any restrictions on the extent to which the public andprivate sectors are allowed to overlap. That too is considered on a case-by-casebasis. Citizens place considerable trust in the way government uses their privateinformation - especially when it comes to security matters - but that is no reasonnot to set limits, especially with the volume of information generated by the iSoci-ety set to grow. On the other hand, government has so far shown little interest ininteracting with citizens or even in sharing information with them. Althoughgovernment espouses transparency and although transparency is also on many acitizen's wish list, in practical terms the authorities never go much beyond goodintentions. The potential is there, including in the tools made possible by ict, but186 igovernmentpolitical will and resolve are lacking. As a result, transparency is often a one-way street: the citizen is transparent to government, but not the other way around. Theglut of information produced by the iSociety combined with the technology tomake it accessible mean that government will have to consider \"how well it wantsto know its own citizens\" but also \"how well it wants its citizens to know it\". The traditional focus, contextual frameworks and aims of eGovernment are there- fore being overtaken by day-to-day developments. The overlap between service,care and control, the circulation of personal data with in networks, the merging ofpublic and private information flows, and the tendency to use digital profiles topursue a proactive, forward-looking policy: all these things result from a series ofchoices relating to individual applications, new systems, and decisions regardingthe connections between them. At a higher level of abstraction, the de facto result is a network of information flows within the domain of government that has faroutstripped the policy and conceptual framework of eGovernment. Criticscondemn government's thirst for information and the rapid exchange of databetween government services, drawing on images such as 'Big Brother' and the'surveillance state'. Although change is indeed taking place at a considerable pace,such images are only marginally applicable to the situation that has arisen, mainlybecause they suggest an intention that is in fact absent: there is no conspiracy orintrigue involved. There is no evil genius designing the 'surveillance state'. Andat the same time, that is almost exactly where the problem lies: the development of the information Government is much too de facto; it is too much the sum of decisions taken with respect to individual applications and policies without muchthought being given to an overriding awareness of the larger whole. There is nolanguage describing that awareness, and it certainly cannot be found in thediscourse of eGovernment. Indeed, it is the eGovernment discourse that isdepoliticising, instrumentalising and neutralising de velopments, even as the developments themselves require just the opposite. 8.2.2 igovernment In order to analyse the deve lopments descr ibed in this report and provide guide- lines for a new policy, we must begin to use the designation 'iGovernment'. In thewords of Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger and Lazer iGovernment ('infor-mation Government') is a \"conceptual lens that offers a complementary perspec-tive to understand the changing nature of government and its relationship to thecitizenry\". It therefore refers not only to the factual existence of another kind of government owing to the deve lopments we have described, but also represents another way of looking at that government. In iGovernment, the emphasis is oninformation flows and only in the second place on the technology that makesthese information flows possible. This is an extremely important point, becausepolitical and public debate in the Netherlands always starts - and often ends - with187 igovernmentFigure 8.1 iGovernment depicted188 igovernmentthe technology or even the specific technological application. By emphasising information flows, the conceptual lens of iGovernment also shows that the trends and developments covered in this book are more closely interrelated in everydaylife than a discussion of individual techniques and applications suggests. Finally,viewing events through the conceptual lens of iGovernment reveals that, despite afew very modest attempts, the Dutch government is as yet unaware of the exis-tence and implications of iGovernment, and is therefore unable to review andguide events within and outside government based on such awareness. Thatawareness is needed because there are two characteristics of the de facto evolution of iGovernment that, when combined, are undesirable, namely that iGovernmentpresents a paradox of political control and that it implies that there may not be anynatural limits to the evolution of iGovernment. 8.3 the paradox of igovernment The political paradox of iGovernment is as follows: iGovernment has not beenlegitimised by explicit political decision-making, but is the result of many politicaland policy-related choices pertaining to individual technical applications andconnections between applications and/or systems. At the same time, however,these individual choices are not simply a series of coincidences; they are in factdeliberate political and policy-related decisions. 8.3.1 political choices relating to applications create igovernment iGovernment has its origins in the actors who recognise and seize the new oppor-tunities that ict offers to meet their responsibilities and achieve their aims, and who develop and use the relevant tools. In many cases, they offer up a whole list ofreasons for using ict to achieve a particular policy objective, with the driving principles of security and effectiveness/efficiency being foremost among them.'Techno-trust' and the desire to 'sell' systems politically also play a role in theirarguments. Our analysis shows that this results in a wide variety of initiatives,each of which is in fact managed and assessed in political and policy-makingterms. Each and every case, however, relates to isolated decisions relating to separate applications, ict programmes and policy objectives. Only rarely is any thought given to the information flows generated via these applications and howthese flows and their contents take shape in the larger complex of governmentinformation processes. In many instances, the decision-making process isrepeated at a later date for yet another connection or to give yet another organisa-tion access to information flows, once again on an individual-case basis. Functioncreep is a protracted but to some extent predictable process. The general publicand government itself often appear to be entirely unaware of the scale on whichinformation is linked and the impact thereof. Although there is often concernabout separate information flows within a single policy area, about the informa-189 igovernmenttion flow generated by a specific application, or about an individual connection, no one considers the significance of connecting information flows further down theline, when they pass through various policy domains and are absorbed into moreextensive information networks. 8.3.2 no political awareness of or decision in favour of igovernment Not only are senior policymakers and politicians insufficiently concerned about oraware of the changes taking place, but there is also, for that reason, no frameworkfor properly guiding such changes. It is more accurate to say that iGovernment has'evolved' than to claim that it has been 'engineered'. It is precisely the absence ofan underlying design that has allowed a complex and differentiated system offormal and informal policy, development and implementation processes to arisethat differ from one measure and policy issue to the next. An entire fabric of infor-mation flows has emerged in each ministry and for each measure and system,without any natural limits being indicated. In fact, no one has even begun toconsider what the evolution of iGovernment means for how government func-tions, how processes should be set up, and how government and the citizen relateto and view each other. The reality of iGovernment is far outstripping the politicaland administrative framework within it which it should be operating. 8.4 igovernment without limits The accumulation of ad hoc decisions and the absence of 'awareness' are permit-ting iGovernment to evolve without boundaries or limits. No one has restrictedthe dispersal of individual applications or the linking up of information flows,because no one has claimed stewardship of the whole. The tendency to specialiseand divide issues into well-established political and administrative categories, aswell as the associated financial and other interests, prevents a broader orientation.The question then is: who is responsible for evaluating and - when necessary -setting limits to iGovernment? For each of the observations below, we must there-fore ask ourselves: how far shou ld developme nts be permitted to go? Our first observation is that it is mainly driving principles such as effectiveness/efficiency and security that are propelling the introduction of technological appli-cations and the connections between them. Certainly in the wake of 9/11, govern-ment has set up many databases for security and control purposes in an effort toprevent a repeat of the disaster. The dynamic relationship between Justice andHome Affairs within eu policymaking is a good example of how the protection of personal data has, time and again, been forced to give way to security concerns,with Parliament exercising only a minimum level of supervision. But 'techno-trust' has also prevailed in recent years, pushing such popular phenomena aspredictive policing and proactive management of citizens' future behaviour to the190 igovernmentforeground. That has, in turn, put pressure on such concepts as 'innocent until proven guilty' and 'forgiving means forgetting' in the criminal law. The emphasison effectiveness/efficiency and security means that the underpinning principlesof freedom of choice and privacy have generally been side-lined. When it comes toindividual applications and connections between databases and systems, one canalways find a good reason (usually political) for letting security outweigh otherconsiderations - necessity knows no law, after all. But if no one is aware of theresult at an aggregate level, the sum total of all those individual reasons will neverbe taken into account. That is why the absence of limits is most obvious when weshift our perspective from individual applications to iGovernment as a coherententity. Although the politicians and policymakers involved do weigh up the prin-ciples underlying each new application or initiative, for example security, privacyor freedom of choice, that process does not involve their assessing these principlesat the level of aggregated information flows, i.e. at the level of iGovernment as awhole - even though the application will ultimately become part of the evolvingiGovernment. The absence of limits can also be seen in the growing overlap between the policy domains of service, care and control, with the pace of digitization in the latter twodomains having been particularly rapid. The emphasis on effectiveness/efficiencyand security makes it appealing to break down barriers between different infor-mation flows in order to increase security, expand the scope of control, or stream-line services. It also makes it easier to defend such measures politically. As Part ii illustrated, the domains of care and control (social safety nets) are being 'mixed' inthe youth care sector; control and service are crossing paths in various Internetinitiatives launched by the police; and the development of the eLicence is keyinginto new ambitions related to both service and control. Facilitated by unique id codes (including the bsn and biometrics), it has become possible to link a whole array of facts to a person and to share that data beyond the boundaries of whatused to be isolated policy contexts and a restricted institutional setting. That datacan then be combined with other facts and used in a new context. Influenced bythese trends and developments, organisations are reassessing their own role andaims. Occasionally that means that they adjust their work processes and extendtheir scope of activity by developing new products and services in areas of policywhere they had previously not been active. Viewed from the perspective of infor-mation flows and data use, the three policy domains of care, control and serviceare increasingly becoming an integrated component of public administration, eventhough they are in no way comparable or easy to integrate in terms of their admin-istrative infrastructure, accountability mechanisms, legal rules and other frame-works. As a result, tension arises regarding duties, powers and responsibilities, inparticular because former 'outsiders' (including private-sector parties) suddenlybecome involved. 191 the implications of igovernment without limits iGovernment 'without limits' poses certain risks and problems, not only directly, but also because opportunities to harness the potential of iGovernment areignored or not fully exploited. As iGovernment continues to evolve, a number ofthese risks must be addressed. 8.5.1 distorted image The first risk is that the solid basis government believes information technologywill give it in a particular policy domain may turn out to be quite the oppositewithin the overall context of technically linked information systems. In the sys-tem-by-system approach described above, new applications are assessed individu-ally and in isolated policy contexts, rather than in relation to the existing technolo-gies and applications and the information networks in which they will befunctioning. As a result, there is no clear picture of or critical reflection on the widerimplications of any specific initiative. Ultimately, the image that government hasbecomes distorted in this way. It fails to sufficiently identify, acknowledge andreview the underlying and broader interests or the problems and risks that arebound to arise when separate initiatives are combined. Being blind to the implica-tions of combining information flows may lead to unpleasant surprises. Identityfraud is one example. It is a relatively minor phenomenon at the moment, but wehave only just begun to take stock of the underlying problems. Combining, process-ing and decontextualising information are all processes that affect the quality andreliability of that information. Although the aim is to increase control, poor infor-mation quality can cloud government's view, cause its institutions and agencies tomistrust one another, leading instead to deterioration in control. There is a growinglist of unfortunate cases: mistaken identity, incorrect and obsolete records thathave material consequences, citizens who get bogged down in digital governmentnetworks. The risk is that politicians and policymakers will lose the ability toorchestrate matters; they will then have to do what they can to prevent the negativeimpact of an ad hoc iGovernment from outweighing the benefits of ict. 8.5.2 necessary organisational and institutional context is lacking The second risk is related to our observation that the current discourse concentrateson technological systems instead of organisational processes. The focus, in otherwords, is on the product, and not on the process. The political and administrativedebate is geared to an application, and sometimes even to a single aspect of an appli-cation, for example the security of the public transport chip card. As a result, thediscussion ignores the wider process and the information network to which theapplication will be added - both immediately upon its introduction and later on,when decisions are taken to create links to other systems. The debate therefore192 igovernmentoften focuses on the technical possibilities, whereas the organisational and institu- tional contexts are never considered or fade into the background. And yet it is pre-cisely this context that is of vital importance for ensuring that the system, once it isoperational, actually meets the public's quality standards - specifically the process-based principles of accountability and transparency. It will be highly problematic ifiGovernment becomes so dominant that organisations are linked in terms of infor-mation flows but not in terms of institutional arrangements. Questions relating toaccountability and transparency must be taken up on the scale of the overarchingiGovernment, both legally and organisationally, in order to prevent these princi-ples from falling through the cracks of the current organisational structure. Super-vision and control are largely tailored to eGovernment and are organised, as a matter of either policy or law, to the partitions of the individual policy areas. Thebroader view of iGovernment is at odds with the way in which ministries, Parlia-mentary committees, regulatory bodies, and legal protection and complaints pro-cedures are set up. It is vital, however, for citizens to know who is accountable; it isvital for government to know this too so that it can safeguard the quality of infor-mation and ensure the trust of citizens in iGovernment in the longer term. 8.5.3 trust and innovation The third risk is that a lack of boundaries will eventually undermine the citizen'sconfidence in government as a reliable custodian and user of information. If thereis no serious consideration of the features and requirements, and also of the newrisks, of iGovernment, then government becomes vulnerable in its belief thattechnology works perfectly, but also because digital systems have become a vitalinfrastructure (risk of system and information failure). Without such reflection,matters such as transparency, accountability and good commissioning practicesare at risk, whereas it is precisely these qualities that promote trust in government.Government must be able to ensure that information flows within its ownsystems - and to a certain extent outside those systems - do not become sounmanageable that they end up harming citizens. Although it is too soon to draw clear-cut conclusions, the public's trust in govern- ment is already showing some cracks. There are various examples: the numerousobjections to the epd ; the aggressive campaign of the grassroots movement Het Nieuwe Rijk ('The New State'), which distributed a parody of a government leaflet calling on citizens to have the bsn tattooed on their arms; and the court cases initiated by organisations such as Vrijbit ('Freebit') and Privacy First against the national fingerprint database of all Dutch passport holders. Still, the public in theNetherlands appears relatively untroubled compared with neighbouring countriessuch as Germany, where grassroots movements are very active in this area. Head-line cases such as the t-Mobile affair in Germany and the major breaches of data security in the uk can severely test the public's confidence in government. 6That193 igovernmentconfidence could also prove to be fragile in the Netherlands. The survey commis- sioned by ecp-epn and the wrr has in any event shown that public opinion on the use of personal data is closely related to the specific context of and reason forthat use (Attema & De Nood 2010: 2). These results too show that governmentmust acknowledge the importance of limitations. Trust-related risks are not only a factor in the relationship between government and the citizen, but also within government itself, in particular in the relationshipbetween policymaking and policy implementation. Both the ministries (policy-makers) and the agencies and other government bodies at the operational level(policy implementation) have expressed a strong need for clear guideposts, in partin order to make practical management possible. It is precisely the lack of iGovern-ment self-awareness among policymakers and politicians and the absence offrameworks for its ongoing development that appear to be increasing the gap between policymaking and policy implementation. It is crucial to address that gap,not only in order to guarantee government's (and therefore iGovernment's) abilityto act decisively, but also to retain the trust of the various parties within govern-ment itself. Government also needs to be trusted if it is to pursue innovation. After all, to take advantage of all the opportunities created by well-considered iGovernmentrequires the ability to use technology and information to innovate. Innovation isalways accompanied by uncertainty, and coping with that uncertainty requirestrust. \"By definition, innovation is unpredictable and innovation policy must take that into account. This inherent uncertainty means that it is impossible for effective innovation policy to identify objec-tives and means in advance. It also means acceptin g that there will be frequent failures, which are a necessary part of arriving at valuable innovations\" ( wrr 2008a: 9-10). Trust is needed to be able to accept the uncertainty that accompanies innovation and the failures inherent in the innovation process. The public must feel confidentthat the responsibility for potential failure is fairly allocated, and that no unneces-sary risks are being taken. The uncertainty and failures inherent to innovation areonly acceptable if innovative processes take place within a clearly defined frame-work. 8.6 self-aware igovernment During the course of our analysis, we have reached the following main conclusion:the use of ict and, in particular, of information/information flows is bringing about major changes in both policymaking/policy implementation and social real-194 igovernmentity, which means that, in effect, a different government is now evolving. That new government is what this book calls 'iGovernment'. It is the nature of the newiGovernment to focus on information flows and related processes. Technology isnot the leading factor here; rather, it is a facilitator. Our analysis shows that iGov-ernment is being created through the incremental accumulation of de facto initia- tives that are insufficiently acknowledged or questioned by the relevant actors.Although iGovernment is still developing and growing rapidly, and although ithas scarcely made any impression on politicians and policymakers, it is alreadyhaving a very real impact, as our empirical analysis shows. At the same time, thelack of 'awareness' means that the features of iGovernment are scarcely taken intoaccount in policymaking, and that politicians and policymakers do not sufficientlyrealise precisely what is developing, let alone how they can guide the development process in the right direction. What they require is a different perspective. All theevidence indicates that iGovernment will continue 'naturally' in the same waythat is has evolved so far: it will develop organically through the continuousamassing of applications and information flows. A shift in focus is needed to correct the failing awareness of this process and its consequences. Specifically, the focus must shift from the product - i.e. the applica-tion - to the process that it brings forth: the information flows. The many differ-ent information flows and their implications for policy and for society must betaken into account, not only in policy itself but also in the procedures and guaran-tees that have yet to be discussed. At the most basic level, that means the follow-ing: Government as a whole must realise that ict is transforming it from eGovernment into iGovernment. iGovernment makes different demands than eGovernment on how policy is used, how government institutions function, and what guarantees areextended to citizens. As argued earlier, viewing things from the perspective of iGovernment reveals a number of problems in the way eGovernment currently operates. Specifically, wehave only a vague, inadequate notion of the entire web of interdependencies, andno proper political or institutional framework for them. The following chaptertherefore describes how 'iGovernment self-awareness' can help governmentconsider how to deal more consciously and even-handedly with these problems. Itnot only suggests normative and procedural methods to encourage self-awareness,but also gives pointers for embedding iGovernment institutionally. 195 igovernmentnotes 1 Interoperability means that systems (or applications) are capable of exchanging data and/or communicating with one another. Interoperability requires standards, protocols and procedures. 2 Privacy Enhancing Technologies ( pets ) is the collective name for various tech- nologies built into information systems to support the protection of personal data. 3 Privacy by Design is based on the principle that designers, at an early stage in the design process, must consider the proper use of personal data within an organisa-tion, the necessity of using that data, and how to protect it. Data protection,including pet s, should be incorporated into the design of the information system's architecture from the very start. 4 A victim of identity fraud, Ron Kowsoleea was wrongly registered in government information systems as a hard-drugs criminal for thirteen years. It turned out thata drug addict had stolen his identity. Kowsoleea was consequently identified as anirregular alien; he acquired a criminal record and fines for no reason; he had trou-ble travelling through Schiphol Airport; and the fiod (Tax Authority Investiga- tion Agency) raided his home while his two children were present. An enquiry bythe Office of the National Ombudsman showed how difficult it was for the police,the courts and the border police to remove the incorrect records (NationalOmbudsman, press release of 23 October 2008). 5 Data mining is also referred to as the \"predictive analytics of knowledge discovery from databases\". Without data mining, data analysis is restricted to a smallnumber of aspects that are thought to play a role. The use of data mining expandsthe scope of data analysis enormously. Artificial intelligence, statistical analysisand visual reporting methods can reveal all the hidden patterns and relationships,making it possible to analyse large datasets and discover complex connections. 6 In Germany, more than 17 million customer datasets were stolen from T-Mobile in 2006. The data included mobile telephone numbers (including unlisted ones),addresses, birthdates and e-mail addresses. All this data was offered to criminalsvia the Internet. There were a series of breaches of data security in the uk in recent years (i.e. secure information that was unintentionally made available in an inse-cure context). The cases included the loss of two computer discs storing data on 25million child benefit recipients (November 2007); a stolen laptop with personaldata on 600,000 Royal Navy recruits (January 2008); six stolen laptops with dataon 20,000 patients (June 2008) (www.bbc.co.uk, consulted on 22 January 2009).196 igovernment9 recommendations: working on igovernment Government must become aware that it has developed from an eGovernment into an iGovernment. That awareness is essential if it hopes to meet the challenges ofunremitting digitization and to use digitization to exploit the benefits of innova-tion. A rationale based on iGovernment self-awareness will require government tolook beyond technology and individual applications and shift its view to a broaderperspective on information. That broader perspective means focusing on theinformation flows that result from the many different applications and theconnections between them. In particular, it also means considering the conse-quences for society and policymaking of the ongoing expansion and specificdynamic of iGovernment. It is tempting to assign the task of accomplishing the necessary transformation and related measures to a particular ministry, organisation or official, i.e. to assignresponsibility to a single entity or person with an overall view of iGovernment.That is largely impractical, however, given the scale, complexity and multifariousimplications of ict for the relationship between government and the citizen. This book cannot provide a comprehensive strategy or blueprint for arriving at anevenly balanced development of iGovernment, nor do the authors expect 'govern-ment', understood as a single entity, to do so. iGovernment self-awareness and theconsequences of that awareness will have to sink down through the many levelsand institutions that make up government, i.e. the ministries, agencies, localauthorities, police, regulatory bodies, citizens, and - last but not least - politicians.iGovernment has evolved in many different places within government, andawareness of its consequences will have to do so as well. Be that as it may, it isnaturally also true that, as George Orwell put it, \"all animals are equal, but someanimals are more equal than others.\" The current chapter will suggest a number oforganisations to take on the responsibility of promoting this awareness and guid-ing the evolution of iGovernment in the right direction. These 'duties' should beviewed as the organisational side of an agenda of government transformation. Thetransition from eGovernment to iGovernment requires a paradigm shift that canbe detected in the real-lif e developments descr ibed in previous chapters, but that must now, crucially, be embedded in the institutions of government and theirthinking. That transformative agenda is much more important than any specific suggestions relating to the institutions themselves. Many roads lead to Rome, butgovernment cannot afford never to arrive in Rome at all. The first three sections of this chapter make a number of normative and procedural recommendations. Section 9.1 begins by offering recommendations for the tripar-tite division into driving, underpinning and process-based principles presented197earlier in this book, which have played such an important role in our empirical analysis. Based on that analysis, Section 9.2 describes three properties of informa-tion that should serve as warning flags for self-aware iGovernment. These are notcategories of information, but features of information processes that require special guarantees both for government itself and for its relationship with the citi-zen. Such guarantees form the basis for the two recommendations made in Section9.2; these, in turn, provide a basis for reflecting on the limits of iGovernment, asrecommended in Section 9.3. Finally, Section 9.4 and Section 9.5 describe thecomponents of an institutional framework for embedding 'iGovernment self-awareness'. 9.1 weighing up the driving, underpinning and process- based principles As experience has shown, the dynamic relationship between the driving princi-ples (notably, effectiveness/efficiency and security) and the underpinning princi-ples (notably, privacy and freedom of choice) is a defining factor in the evolutionof iGovernment. In addition, process-based notions such as transparency andaccountability point out the difficulties of creating a normative and institutionalcontext for the development of iGovernment, as well as the opportunities thatsuch a context creates. When put on the spot, every official - whether policy-maker, politician or public servant - will attest to the importance of all these prin-ciples. After all, they appeal to common sense, responsibility, fundamental values,and due care. No one opposes security or privacy, for example, the two conceptsthat are most often played off against one another. And no one will deny that theseprinciples should be weighed up carefully against one another. The decision-making process must, after all, be evenly balanced; decision-makers must look atall sides of an issue. When it comes to the theoretical foundations, then, there isgeneral consensus. The everyday reality of government is often very different,however, as Part ii of this book has made clear. As noted in previous chapters, ict should be seen as a political choice and, as such, as more than a purely instrumen-tal solution to a problem. When all is said and done, politics is strife. In the realworld in which iGovernment is evolving, the process whereby politicians andpolicymakers weigh up the various principles is a less evenly balanced and publicaffair, as a rule, than theory might lead us to believe. There are a number of reasonswhy that is so: first of all, the principles are seldom discussed explicitly andopenly; secondly, the principles are dissimilar and therefore difficult to pin downand weigh up against one another; and finally, a skewed presentation of issues canbe advantageous in politics and policymaking. We look in detail at these reasonsbelow and propose two recommendations for making the rationale and the debateon iGovernment more open, explicit and realistic with respect to the associatedprinciples. 198 igovernmentThe three clusters of principles described in this volume - driving, underpinning and process-based - should be well balanced at all decision-making levels. That isno mean task, given that a quasi-quantitative concept such as efficiency, a morenormative concept such as freedom of choice, and a process-based concept such asaccountability all clearly fall under different registers of analysis. Furthermore,driving principles such as efficiency and security need very little encouragementto claim the limelight, as experience has shown. That is often otherwise when it comes to the underpinning principles. These are grounded in civil liberties and individual autonomy and are enshrined in the prin-ciples of privacy and freedom of choice. Although the concept of freedom seemsfundamental and absolute, such notions are in fact much more pliable in everydaylife than the arguments that weigh in on the other side of the scale, i.e. efficiencyand security. The argument that we must embed such principles institutionally isoften prompted by the fear that individual interests will be harmed; that fear tendsto lose out when weighed up against the perceived interests of the collective. Inother words, the privacy of an individual is often not as important as the safetyand security of the collective. Regulatory and judicial reviews virtually alwaysfocus on whether the infringement of a fundamental right is proportional. Valu-able as the notion of proportionality may be, it runs into the difficult that there isreally no common unit of measure or currency that allows us to make a quasi-mathematical comparison between dissimilar clusters of principles (drivingversus underpinning). The problem with squeezing such a comparison into oneparticular straightjacket - for example a cost-benefit analysis - is that the argu-ments (and the language) of effectiveness/efficiency tend to prevail. In everyday life , finding the right balance between the driving and underpinning principles of iGovernment often depends on the degree to which the intermedi-ary, process-based principles of accountability and transparency have been putinto effect. Without a sound application of these principles, no assessment is guar-anteed a solid foundation. The principles of accountability and transparency mustensure the validity of the process by which iGovernment develops. Together,these principles require the implicit choices made by government to be madeexplicit: clear, comprehensible, open to discussion, and susceptible to objection.In fact, the only credible way to weigh up the various principles against oneanother in this context is by means of argumentation. In order to give such argu-mentation free rein, government must explain its rationale publicly at every level.One of the most important agenda items for iGovernment is that governmentmust be required to explain, explicitly, how it weighs up the principles involved (aprocess that is unavoidable). That process must be laid bare at all levels, from thepreparation and introduction of a specific application to the comprehensive diver-sification of processes and information flows that form the building blocks ofiGovernment. Government must explain its rationale not only at the national199 recommendations: working on igovernmentlevel, but also with respect to the decisions it takes at the international and, specif- ically, at the European level. That requires the Dutch Government to clarify wellin advance what rationale it intends to bring to the European conference table andwhat results, in terms of that rationale, it hopes to take back home. This brings usto our first recommendation. An evenly balanced development of iGovernment requires the driving, underpin- ning and process-based principles to be properly weighed up against one another ina manner that is clear, verifiable and can be publicly accounted for. There is an urgent need for government to weigh up the various principles comprehensively and publicly, as doing so will help it avoid the undesirable conse-quences that may ensue from a unilateral approach to iGovernment. Ultimately,the single-minded pursuit of one principle only (whether it be security, privacy,transparency, or any other) means that iGovernment will gradually - applicationby application and link by link - take on an extreme, impractical and vulnerableform. It is therefore important to keep an eye out for signs and warnings that oneor more of these principles are set to stifle the rest. After all, society can have toolittle of a specific principle - but too much as well. The potential danger of domi-nation applies to all principles, especially when taken to extremes: driving princi- ples such as effectiveness/efficiency become economic reductionism; underpin-ning principles such as freedom of choice become choice overload; and even aprocess-based principle such as accountability can result in excessive mistrust andlitigiousness when applied unilaterally. But even the 'midfield' - between the twoextremes - requires a proper balance. Too much emphasis on security may soon beat the expense of privacy and transparency. Too much emphasis on privacy, on theother hand, may be at the expense of transparency and accountability, as accounta-bility always requires a certain degree of openness. All too often, initiatives havegone ahead without a genuine, meticulous and verifiable comparison betweenthese dissimilar principles. The comparisons that have been made - for example asexplained in parliamentary documents - are often fragmented and/or superficial. That is not only due to the conceptual difficulty of reaching a credible balance, of course. The principles must be weighed up at different moments, at a variety ofdifferent levels, and in the many different processes and procedures that togetherresult in iGovernment: in a parliamentary debate about a new application; whendescribing the work contracted out to an applications designer; when deciding tolink files or connect new organisations to a network; and in the rulings and opin-ions of the courts, regulatory bodies, and citizens regard ing new de velopments and decisions. There is much at stake in each of these situations, and one can attimes witness a tendency to allow a single principle to overrule the others simplyin order to be done with a dispute or avoid a dispute in advance. It has happenednumerous times in the course of iGovernment's evolution that plans for a new200 igovernmentapplication were unveiled in a way closely resembling a marketing campaign. At times, 'techno-trust' is not really trust per se ; it is really more of a political sales pitch. A little less hocus-pocus with terms such as effectiveness/efficiency andsecurity would be advisable. But realistic and verifiable arguments and compar-isons are also lacking at the other end of the spectrum, for the underpinning prin-ciples of privacy and freedom of choice. If something has to be sacrificed at thatend (and that is often enough the case), then the 'loss' should be acknowledgedand communicated as such. In other words, although in most cases it is not clear inadvance what the 'right' balance is between the driving and underpinning princi-ples, the debate on this question is in sore need of improvement. Discussions as to how iGovernment is to evolve further and the role that the prin- ciples should play in its de velopment must be more solidly grounded in reality. So far, neither those who emphasise the opportunities nor those who emphasisethe dangers have argued their case entirely credibly. The process-based principlesof transparency and accountability can play an important role in this respect. Asound and credible process-based framework for iGovernment can help groundthe discussions about the direction that should be taken in reality. The argumentsrelating to the underpinning principles must also be made explicit and as verifiableas possible. It particular, it would be more realistic at this end of the spectrum tocease regarding privacy and freedom of choice as all-or-nothing principles. Some-times it is in fact necessary to sacrifice a degree of privacy or freedom of choice,provided that the sacrifice is made clear and there is good reason for it. Govern-ment should not, after all, pass up every opportunity to use modern technologyand scientifically sound methods of risk assessment, diagnosis and intervention to protect human lives (Buruma 2011). Too much privacy may mean that theauthorities never become aware of a child at risk; too much freedom of choice in a complex situation may leave citizens empty-handed after all. Clarifying the driving principles and making them as verifiable as possible would in turn raise two issues and open them up for discussion. The first of these is theoften unjustified optimism among politicians and policymakers about what ict can do, as the cases cited in previous chapters and in many other studies haveshown. Although optimism often drives innovation, in the Netherlands it has ledto ad hoc projects, impossible deadlines, and expensive ict failures. The second issue is that 'spill over' and 'function creep' are often quietly calculated into theequation from the very start of project. Officially, politicians distance themselvesfrom such 'fiddling' and reject it in their discussions and debates, but they are infact fully aware that the future is likely to bring precisely the thing that theGovernment is officially ruling out at an earlier point in time. The formal argu-ment then is that political responsibility only extends to the proposal at hand, andnot to the possibilities that the proposal holds out (implicitly, but without requir-ing too much imagination). When iGovernment consists of a chain of such201 recommendations: working on igovernmentisolated decisions, reasoning of the 'after us, the Deluge' kind is simply untenable. Real iGovernment self-awareness requires politicians to take the expression 'agovernment forewarned is a government forearmed' seriously in the digitaldomain, and to apply this philosophy to implicit but foreseeable ict trends. Government often anticipates the future in its policy, and it would be to its creditto do the same, and to do so openly, in its political assessments of iGovernment. 9.2 warning flags for igovernment As the process of digitization continues, it is important for government to bemuch more aware of certain features of information than is now the case. Thepoint is not to focus on the information content , as is so often the case (with dna data requiring a higher level of protection than biometric data, for example, andbiometric data requiring a higher level of protection than simple personal datasuch as names and addresses). Although it is important to break down informationinto content-related categories - as indeed happens in many of our existing lawsand rules - this book focuses on information processes , precisely because they have a huge impact on the nature and the reliability of the information that keeps iGov-ernment running and on which it depends. In today's digital era, these processeshave a number of features that must be taken into account when considering howto expand or set limits to iGovernment in a way that is evenly balanced. We have therefore tagged three interrelated processes with warning flags. These warning flags are not intended to be prohibitions; rather, they are a sign that poli-cymakers and politicians must be extra vigilant. They will help improve general'iGovernment self-awareness': when information is either part of or the result ofthe tagged processes, government must pay close attention to the quality of thatinformation and consider who bears responsibility for it. In some cases, theconclusion may even need to be that it is necessary to impose certain limits on theuse of information. An evenly balanced development of iGovernment requires usto look very closely at these information processes. The three processes that wehave flagged in this way are:aT h e networking of information, i.e. the shared use and management of infor- mation within a network of actors. bT h e compiling and enhancing of information, i.e. creating new information and profiles based on different sources from different contexts. c The pursuit of a preventive and pro-active policy based on information, i.e. actively evaluating and intervening in society founded on an information-driven risk calculation. These three information processes are the core of iGovernment, enabling it tofine-tune and customise policy, obtain a comprehensive picture of the public andof the policy issues involved, and take pro-active action where needed. At the202 igovernmentsame time, they are processes that themselves have an impact on information: they influence its nature, reliability, recognisability, contextuality and traceability.Although there are no insurmountable or absolute objections to this, it is impor-tant to make sufficient allowance for the risks involved in these processes whendealing with and using that information or when allocating responsibility for it.That is very often not the case given that iGovernment lacks self-awareness. It isimportant to realise - much more so than at present - that it is precisely thesethree processes that have a big impact on (a) the quality of information content and (b) the demands made on the organisational context of information flows. Conse- quently, there are a number of important conditions that can be identified for theongoing development of iGovernment. 9.2.1 quality of information content All three information processes - the networking of information, the compilingand enhancing of information, and the pursuit of information-driven preventiveand pro-active policy - require a critical assessment of both the quality and therelevance of the information produced by the systems of the various authorities.Part ii discussed various tendencies and reflexes, for example: the nonchalant link- ing up of information files; the habitual overstepping of the boundaries betweenthe service, care and control domains; the absence of a clear and pre-determinedplan to control the unstoppable flood of information; the continuous dilution ofinformation quality owing to repeated use; and the accumulating and mixing ofmany different kinds of information. In iGovernment as it has evolved in recentyears, composite information circulating in networks easily crosses 'boundaries'.Those boundaries are not only territorial ones (the borders between countries),but also, and in particular, the dividing line between public and private sectors and'their' information, and the distinction between information used for service, forcare, and for control purposes. Much of this information is, moreover, decontextu-alised when it is retrieved from its original environment, only to be recontextu-alised when combined with other data in a different policy context. That naturallyhas consequences for the reliability and recognisability of the information. Theseconsequences are not only felt by the professionals who work with the data (andwho are obliged to interpret information taken from a different professionalcontext), but also apply, to an even greater extent, when the informationconcerned is the result of technological 'reproductive processes', such as profilingand data mining. The more data and information files are contaminated - and theyoften are contaminated, or at least vulnerable to being so - the more networks willincrease exponentially any risk associ ated with contaminated information due to the unique dissemination characteristics of networks. A contaminated informa-tion system will not grind to a halt on its own, after all. On the contrary, in manycases no one is even aware of the diminishing quality of the information, and itcontinues to be processed and reprocessed, used and re-used, again and again.203 recommendations: working on igovernmentMeanwhile, both the relevant government official and the citizens in question are unaware of the deterioration. It is all too easy for the quality gap to remain unno-ticed, especially in networked situations, without anyone being 'to blame'. Indeed,this may well be an unavoidable risk of what can be referred to as the 'multipliereffect' of ict: information circulates and is effectively distributed at lightning speed, whether or not it is correct. Administrative reality and 'real reality' candiverge quite dramatically in iGovernment, and errors can be disseminated muchmore quickly, making them more difficult to rectify later on. Such errors can havehuge repercussions for the daily lives of individual citizens, especially if profilingis used to enhance information or pursue a pro-active policy based on faulty data. The quality of iGovernment therefore requires constant attention and consistent policy across the breadth of government. The assumption that information iscorrect must be replaced, across the board, by the realisation that some informa-tion is very likely to be inaccurate, obsolete, or even misused and manipulated.The default position within government, however, is that the system always tellsthe truth; margins of error are ignored and citizens are increasingly held responsi-ble for the problems that ensue. There is too little awareness of the consequencesof iGovernment; the multiplier effect and the constant decontextualisation owingto the networks are not factored into the monitoring of information quality, ifsuch monitoring takes place at all. Policymakers can also be blinded by the positiveresults of networks and composite information. Their concern about the quality ofinformation should not be limited to the information itself, but should also extendto the metadata. Metadata acts as an indispensable signpost in informationmanagement systems. It plays a crucial role in tracing information and identifyingthe original context and origins of that information. The quality of an iGovern-ment information management system depends on the presence of good qualitymetadata. In addition, the quality of the information depends on such technicaland organisational prerequisites as data security, well-designed work processes,and a reliable authentication and identification infrastructure. Government must do more than it currently does to counteract 'techno-trust', as evidence shows that every system and every information flow has both inten-tional and unintentional effects, and that those effects, in turn, influence thecontent of the information as such. All too often, government insists - and oftendoes so officially - that its data is correct. In other words, government trusts toomuch in the quality of information and lacks a healthy dose of scepticism in thatregard, adding to the vulnerability of iGovernment. Self-aware iGovernment always looks critically at its own information manage- ment systems. It regards the quality of the information and of the informationprocesses with a healthy dose of scepticism; both must be judged continuously ontheir merits and improved where necessary.204 igovernmentThe role that information plays in policy processes changes once digitization is introduced. Increasingly, information is being used to anticipate the future, a trendthat is also catching on in the areas of service, care and control. In a growingnumber of cases, the traditional method - whereby statistics are used to informand improve policy - is being supplemented by information-driven policydesigned to predict individual behaviour. Information and risk calculations are used to predict which children may be at risk and which passengers may be terror-ists, for example. Action is then taken based on that risk calculation. The shift infocus to individual behaviour means that the outcome of a risk calculation may bevery valuable - a life is saved or an attack thwarted - but it also means that therepercussions are extremely serious if the calculation is wrong. Anyone who isflagged in government networks and systems as a potential terrorist, criminal orabusive parent will feel the consequences in his or her daily life. There is too littleawareness in government of the use of statistics and risk calculations in connec-tion with individuals (rather than in connection with broad policy categories), andof the potential consequences of doing so. The most dramatic examples with the most far-reaching implications are found in the area of national security and in care sectors involving life-threatening situa-tions. But even in less precarious areas of service and care, statistical methods andthe effects of networked information processing can assign individual citizens tothe wrong category and retain them there for a lengthy period. These separatedomains are also increasingly coming to overlap thanks to ict, with errors being circulated and dispersed between them. It is clear as well that information is nolonger as easily 'forgotten' in the everyday reality of government informationmanagement, despite the prescribed retention periods. Certain categories ofpersonal information tend to persist in profiles and networks, with all that thisimplies for the individuals involved. iGovernment must therefore keep a keen eye on the possible negative and even damaging effects of information-driven policy. Sound procedures for dealing withsuch policy are vital for those individuals who find themselves in a tight corner.They are also important as a way of maintaining and boosting confidence in iGov-ernment. They require an even balance between the principles of accountabilityand transparency and also require the roles and responsibilities of government andthe citizen to be evenly balanced. It is important to distinguish between the role ofthe citizen as citoyen (a participant in the political life of the community) and the role of the citizen as an individual (someone who has certain legal rights and obli-gations). In the first instance, the citizen is a productive countervailing power whoshould be 'kept in the loop' as regards government policy and the role that infor-mation processes play within it. In the second instance, a citizen who is treatedunfairly or improperly by government or who ends up trapped by the systems ofiGovernment must be able to invoke his or her rights. Both roles require a certain205 recommendations: working on igovernmentamount of vigilance - a combination of watchfulness and assertiveness - to act as a counterweight to the expansion of iGovernment. Citizens cannot be assumed,however, to exercise vigilance by default; they must be supported by rights andprocedures that are, in effect, the practical outcome of taking the principles ofaccountability and transparency seriously. Generally speaking, the citizen- citoyen sees transparency as a greater priority, whereas the citizen-individual gives toppriority to accountability. In order to support citizens as a countervailing power, iGovernment must display a certain amount of openness about its affairs. Without transparency and access toinformation, real democratic supervision is impossible. That means that iGovern-ment must be more open and that it must encourage citizens to think and talkmore about its deve lopment, and do so at earlier stages of its 'design'. Government must do so both of its own accord and in response to vigilant citizens and organ-ised groups that have submitted requests and followed procedures in order to gain access to information. The platitude 'you have nothing to fear if you have nothingto hide' can just as well be applied - tongue in cheek of course (after all, it is just aplatitude) - to iGovernment itself. As a supervisor of government, the citizen mayjustifiably be expected to be vigilant and assertive; equally justified, however, isthe citizen's expectation that government should be more transparent. When a matter concerns the citizen as an individual - and in particular when that citizen is seeking justice from the state - then transparency is only thebeginning. Transparency will ease the way towards being better informed, ofcourse, but an emphasis on transparency should not mean that the well-informed citizen is (erroneously) taken as the standard, thereby putting the onuson all citizens to get their digital affairs in order and to be unrelenting in theirvigilance. The existence of a 'digital divide' alone implies that there would soonbe enormous inequality between different groups of citizens. What is more, thecitizen has neither the authority nor the power to change anything permanentlyin the networked back office of iGovernment. Experience shows that citizens areoften the victims of back office errors and are powerless to correct them. It isimportant, therefore, to set up sound procedures relating to final responsibilityfor information and an unambiguous access point that enables citizens to induceiGovernment authorities to act accordingly. That involves striking the rightbalance between the citizen's responsibility to alert the authorities to inaccura-cies (and his or her capacity to do so) and the authorities' responsibility to actu-ally correct such inaccuracies. Particularly in the more sensitive domains of careand control (in which successes are extremely beneficial to society and errors areextremely disadvantageous to individuals), citizens should not be saddled withthe unique responsibility for incorrect or obsolete government information (orits consequences). In short, government bears a heavy responsibility because italone has the power to take binding decisions that will correct errors throughout206 igovernmentthe iGovernment network, and not only in the particular database or organisa- tion where the problem has been detected. On the other hand, the thresholdshould not be too low for individual citizens either, as it will then be too easy torequire officials to go to unnecessarily excessive lengths. iGovernment must invest in procedures that will improve transparency (supporting the citizen as citoyen) and accountability (supporting the citizen as an individualwith legal rights and obligations). Right now, responsibility and accountabilityprocedures within iGovernment are inadequate and insufficiently effective; respon-sibility and accountability must be identified and allocated more comprehensively,explicitly, and clearly. 9.2.2 embedding sustainable and fair information flows in the organisation iGovernment self-awareness, and in particular the three warning flags ofnetworked information, composite information, and information-driven proac-tive policy, naturally also have repercussions for the practical and organisationaldesign of iGovernment. Despite the increasingly common use of the term 'infor-mation management', information flows are still not properly embedded in theorganisation of government when it comes to management, quality, and thesafeguards. The evolution of iGovernment has so far been 'a lot of flow, and toolittle management'. The flow of information throughout the organisation ofgovernment (and beyond) is growing freer, but the conditions for properlycontrolling and managing such flows are lagging behind. Converting paper filesand filing cabinets into digitally linked information files offers new opportuni-ties, but it also casts government's traditional duties and obligations in a differentlight. The work of organising and managing all the information circulating ingovernment's databases and networks is qualitatively different to the work ofmanaging information on paper. Information management also involves the wayiGovernment's 'memory' functions, and that immediately leads to two prob-lems. On the one hand, government is growing 'feeble-minded' and forgettingthings that should not be forgotten. On the other, government increasingly'remembers' information about citizens, the thinking being that such informa-tion may come in handy someday. The first is harmful because transparency andaccountability are impossible without a good memory. The archiving function ofgovernment enables it to hand on, trace, disclose, and account for its actions.That is vitally important both internally, within government, and externally, vis-\u00e0-vis the citizen. In the digital era, however, archiving requires a radically differ-ent approach to government information management. The Netherlands Courtof Audit has emphasised this repeatedly and offered various organisationalguidelines to that effect. 207 recommendations: working on igovernmentAt the same time, government appears to be incapable or unwilling to forget certain types of information. The inability to forget is also harmful, however, because itmeans that citizens may not be able to escape from their past. Government some-times proves unable to observe its own prescribed retention periods; it is also in-clined to extend these periods, based on the notion that more information equalsbetter information. Security and fraud prevention are magic words in this respect,but there are also good reasons for government not to consider all of the past whenjudging citizens in the present or future. By working with profiles, governmentquenches its own thirst for information and makes the very act of storing and re-membering information important in itself. People are much more likely to be seenas the products of their past than they were in the pre-digital era. If digital records arestored in perpetuity, 'once a thief, always a thief' takes on new meaning. The factthat it is technically possible to store personal data for ever is not a good enough rea-son to actually do so. Once again, we need to examine the pros and cons of storing (ordeleting) information within the relevant context, and that examination may differfrom one context to the next. For example, information that is used in criminal in-vestigations may need to be scrutinised differently to information in the healthcaresector, where long-term data storage can be of enormous benefit for research and forestimating mortality risk and heredity. The next question, i.e. how the data should be stored (for example, whether or not it should be anonymised), is also one thatshould be considered and evaluated on a category-by-category basis. There is in factnot one standard for storing or forgetting all personal or other information (i.e. anabsolute right to be forgotten); it comes down to government weighing up each situation properly and rationally and then acting in accordance with its findings.In short, it is vital to the ongoing development of iGovernment to take its'memory' into account. The archiving function of government must be improved,and that will require a radical turn-around in thinking. In order to decide whichcitizen records should be 'forgotten', government will need to constantly set offcollective interests, for example security, against individual 1interests, such as the right to be forgiven and forgotten, and to do so transparently. To guarantee that itis acting fairly, moreover, government must be more aware than it currently is ofthe risks associated with using obsolete data. The Dutch Government must alsoensure that the organisations operating within iGovernment are continuouslyaware of the importance of forgetting. Organisations must weigh up the two sides(remembering versus forgetting), make their arguments explicit, and see that theresults of this process are given solid organisational foundations. iGovernmentmust also come up with structures and low-threshold methods for helping citi-zens remove obsolete, incorrect and inaccurate data. iGovernment must have a memory that is effective, sustainable, and above all fair. The importance of storage and archiving demands a radical change in culture. Theimportance of forgetting must be permanently acknowledged and requires a strat-egy that is embedded both in policy and in the organisational structure.208 igovernment9.2.3 igovernment's 'limits to growth'? When iGovernment self-aware, its natural tendency is to continue expand- ing. After all, only self-awareness can induce it to set limits to its own growth. Untilthen, there will be no real limits to the size of data collections or on the number oflinks between systems; information will become contaminated; organisations andinformation flows will be misaligned; citizens, businesses and even governmentorganisations will become trapped in the tangle of government data; it will be diffi-cult to prove one's identity; and it will be virtually impossible for citizens to extri-cate themselves from the information that is gathered, processed, and exchangedabout them. Without iGovernment self-awareness and without an awareness ofwhat iGovernment means for the relationship between government and the citi-zen, there is little reason or opportunity to consider the growth of the informationstructure that government is building. There is also little reason to ask questions,for example whether such growth is actually necessary, whether there is a need toset limits, and how iGovernment should continue to develop. Questions and con-cerns regarding the relationship between information flows and their implicationswill be left unaddressed even as the work of constructing iGovernment continues.But government is selling itself and the citizen short by proceeding in this manner.Moreover, both the citizen and government are left vulnerable. The practical reality of information dissemination and linkage, and the reasonable expectation that claims will be made on data collections in the future, requiregovernment to engage in a broader assessment that (a) looks beyond any specificpolicy initiative that it may be considering and (b) looks beyond the currentcircumstances. The process of weighing up the various interests at stake in iGov-ernment also raises a more fundamental question: is the iGovernment that hasevolved the iGovernment that we would have wanted if we had specificallyplanned and designed it in full awareness of the context and relationshipsinvolved? This raises another issue: are there limits to iGovernment? If so, whereare those limits to be drawn, and where not? And how do we determine that? The questions relating to limits also touch on a certain vulnerability of iGovern- ment that is best illustrated by the Internet. The fact that the Internet is, funda-mentally, an unregulated and open network makes it virtually impossible to'manage' it or to monitor the information circulating there. After all, anyone canaccess information once it has been placed on the Internet. Incorrect or undesir-able information can be deleted from one's own site or perhaps (after legalproceedings) removed from someone else's, but by then it has usually alreadybeen copied and 'mirrored' elsewhere. The WikiLeaks case in late 2010 offers anexcellent example of how information on a site is quickly copied elsewhereprecisely because the authorities and other stakeholders wanted to restrict accessto it. 209 recommendations: working on igovernmentThe uncontrollable nature of the Internet and the fundamental consequences of such uncontrollability play a similar role with respect to iGovernment, in twodifferent ways. First of all, they affect iGovernment itself, or more specifically,government's internal information management. That differs from the Internet inthat it is a semi-restricted system and not an entirely open one. It is thereforepossible to control information flows to a certain extent. However, the dynamicevolution of iGovernment today is putting pressure on that ever-so-slight control-lability of information. Thanks to the networked nature of information and themerging of information flows across public-private boundaries, the semi-restricted system of iGovernment is growing increasingly similar internally to the Internet. A growing amount of information belongs to everyone in the systemrather than to only a single organisation, making the job of properly guiding infor-mation flows virtually as difficult within iGovernment as within the Internetmodel. As this trend continues, it will become more difficult for government to channel, verify and guarantee the reliability of information. Alongside the risk of iGovern-ment 'internalising' the logic of the Internet, there is another risk: that iGovern-ment will unintentionally become part of the Internet. The WikiLeaks affair once more provides a striking example, foreshadowing what will undoubtedly happenmore often in future. Thanks to WikiLeaks, the authorities' internal informationmanagement system suddenly became public property on the Internet. Copiedcountless times and migrating rapidly from server to server and from cloud tocloud, information circulated beyond control. Dutch versions of WikiLeaks havealready turned up that leak government documents anonymously and confiden-tially, for example www.opennu.nl (www.opennow.nl). Only methods such as those applied by the Chinese government might succeed in putting the genie backin the bottle, and even that is uncertain - to say nothing of whether it would bedesirable. Before government information is actually leaked on the Internet, therisk of disclosure is thought to be a question of data security and the technologyand policy required to effectuate it. Once sensitive information is leaked anddisseminated on the Internet, however, policy is pushed aside and the authoritiesstart to improvise in order to regain control. It is a rather unedifying sight. Thepressure that the usgovernment put on service providers to remove WikiLeaks from the Web led Amy Davidson of The New Yorker to ask whether \"Lieberman feels that he, or any Senator, can call in the company running The New Yorker's printing presses when we are preparing a story that includes leaked classifiedmaterial, and tell it to stop us. The circumstances are different, but not so differentas to be really reassuring.\" 2Nevertheless, digitization has made such leaks virtu- ally unavoidable, and they will, unavoidably, become more frequent in the future:the 250,000 pages in the possession of WikiLeaks would have never been leakedin the same manner or on the same scale if they had existed only on paper. It isdigital compression that makes information mobile and permits major leaks of210 igovernmentthis kind. Many earlier notorious cases of leaked information, for example in the uk, also concerned huge volumes of personal data stored on a lost usb stick no bigger than a cigarette lighter. The fact that leaks are unavoidable - whether theyare intentional or due to error, carelessness or gross negligence - and, in particular,the consequences of such leaks are reason enough to consider the limits to iGov-ernment. Although we will not identify those limits in this book (that is a matter for poli- tics), we can indicate the general areas that should be considered. Our purpose, inother words, is to raise awareness and to spark off a debate about such limits, andnot to identify precisely where they are. After all, what was most valuable aboutthe Club of Rome's report Limits to Growth was that it put the environmentalproblem on the political agenda, and not that it made precise predictions andextrapolations. The processes identified in previous chapters offer us somepreliminary guideposts for identifying where the limits might lie: we are, in effect,being forced to think about the limits to iGovernment when we weigh up the vari-ous principles involved and observe the warning flags indicated. Although it hasnow grown common (albeit largely unnoticed) to mix service, care and control andto cross the boundaries between the public and private domains, these tendenciestoo turn out to be problematical when examined more closely and from theperspective of iGovernment. Finally, the realisation that the Internet has created acompletely different information environment in which iGovernment too mustfunction gives us every reason to analyse the nature of iGovernment and to actaccordingly. Well-reasoned limits are extremely important here, not least becausethey give the authorities something to go on when identifying the right way todeal with information or to share it with other parties (even those in government).Right now, that is often left open to interpretation. For example, the Tax andCustoms Administration decided not to exchange information within a partner-ship of various parties assembled by a local authority with a view to clearing atravellers' camp. 3Tax and Customs did not feel it had the right to share sensitive information with an electricity company or other private parties; as a large,autonomous government department, it defined its own 'absolute' limits andpulled out of the negotiations. Another example is the Dutch Supreme Court'sruling (described in Chapter 7) on the Public Prosecutions Service's requisitioningof passenger data from Trans Link Systems. 4It should not, however, be left to bottom-up campaigns or isolated judicial rulings to set such limits or to define theframework for the ongoing development of iGovernment. After all, if Tax andCustoms or Trans Link Systems had agreed to provide the information asrequested, the data exchange would have quietly taken place, without any furtherdiscussion. A self-aware iGovernment cannot exist without there being a well-reasoned strat- egy regarding the limits to that same iGovernment. Such limits are required by both211 recommendations: working on igovernmentthe internal dynamic of iGovernment and the dynamic of the iSociety: without limits, government will ultimately lose the ability to guide the ongoing developmentof iGovernment in manageable channels. 9.2.4 an agenda for the transition to a self-aware igovernment It is urgent that 'iGovernment self-awareness' become ingrained government-wide, both as a concept and as an organisational factor. The danger, however, isthat such awareness will be cancelled out by the political issues of the day. Givenwhat is at stake, that would be an unfortunate turn of events. In order to act on therecommendations given above, government must transform its existing system ofpublic administration into one capable of identifying and tackling the challengesthat iGovernment brings. The organisational and administrative effort involvedwill require the engagement of many different organisations and levels of govern-ment. In other words, our recommendations are not intended solely for the DutchGovernment. The national authorities can, however, drive the search for solutions. In addition, iGovernment is now so dynamic that it must have sufficient leeway torapidly integrate new developments and the responses to such developments intoits thinking. 'iGovernment self-awareness' is not just a status to enjoy, but ratheran ongoing challenge. In a world of rapid and dynamic digitization, however, it isimportant to create various champions that (a) claim stewardship of 'iGovernmentself-awareness' and (b) provide iGovernment with a well-defined, authoritativepoint of contact and recognisable identity. The institutional landscape as it now exists is not equipped to create such cham- pions. At its core, iGovernment consists of interrelated information flows andnetworks - and it is precisely on that point that we lack organisations that arewilling and able to concern themselves with the integrated whole. The politicaldebate is broken down into laws, areas of policy, Parliamentary committees, andtechnologies; only rarely does it consider the overall information picture, letalone any existing or future links between information flows and their conse-quences. The same compartmentalisation applies with respect to the funding fordigitization projects, and consequently for how funding is managed and influ-enced. There is no 'Ministry of Information' or 'Parliamentary Committee onInformation'. Ministries, government agencies and other local and regionalauthorities are primarily concerned with their own policy problems and sparelittle thought for the consequences of incoming and outgoing information flowsthat reach beyond the 'limits' of their own duties and organisation. The same canbe seen in cross-border contexts. The European network of information flowsand personal data is expanding and diversifying without there being any frankdiscussion as to whether, how, and under what circumstances the Netherlandswill participate in the emerging iEurope. Government agencies use the informa-tion they obtain in communication with citizens, but they are powerless to trace212 igovernmenterrors in information flows and correct them throughout the entire chain or network when the same citizens run into problems. The many different supervi-sory bodies (for example the Data Protection Authority and the Office of theNational Ombudsman) and other organisations such as the Identity FraudHelpdesk, which identify and attempt to resolve some of the excrescences ofiGovernment on behalf of citizens and government agencies, are often simplynot equipped for the task in that their responsibilities do not reach far enough,and are in fact incapable of producing solutions (or at least lasting ones). Cross-ministry programmes and other arrangements, such as the Reinforcement ofPublic Sector Identity Chain policy programme (Versterking IdentiteitsketenPublieke Sector , vips ), are only temporary, and in many instances are not suffi- ciently high-profile in terms of bureaucratic stature. Not one of them has theauthority to implement its methods or solutions permanently across the bound-aries of ministries and institutions. Government also lacks the expertise neededat the policy-technology interface to develop new systems that are 'iGovern-ment-proof'. Brave attempts are made at all these levels to consider iGovernmentin its entirety, to conduct proper assessments, and to search for solutions toproblems, but the existing organisations and arrangements are unable to meetthe challenges of iGovernment because they have not been assigned the neces-sary statutory duties or the authority to take binding decisions. There is there-fore an urgent need to develop an agenda for institutional transformation.Government must catch up with practical reality by transforming itself institu-tionally from eGovernment into iGovernment. It needs institutions that willallow it to channel the discussion on the ongoing development of iGovernmentin the right direction, to claim responsibility for its own networked informationmanagement system, and to provide citizens with a form of protection that takesthe properties of iGovernment into account. Fleshing out the targets for iGovernment will therefore require an institutional transformation that assigns and embeds three functions within government: at h e strategic function , i.e. guaranteeing the well-considered, ongoing develop- ment of iGovernment; bt h e societal function , i.e. making iGovernment more transparent for the public and improving its accountability vis-\u00e0-vis individuals who become entangledin information networks; ct h e operational function , i.e. improving well-reasoned connections between policy, implementation, technology, information flows, and networks. Also,improving the commissioning practices of government. These three functions constitute the absolute minimum requirements for shapingiGovernment self-awareness and acting on the implications of the new reality. Thefollowing section offers specific proposals for these three functions, along withthe necessary institutional 'mechanisms'. It should be noted that the institutional213 recommendations: working on igovernmenttransformation as such - which involves embedding aims and facilitating imple- mentation - is ultimately more important than merely the labels for the organisa-tions proposed here. iGovernment requires the system of public administration to be transformed, with existing arrangements being redesigned at the strategic, societal and operationallevels. 9.3 igovernment institutions iGovernment as it has evolved in recent years certainly does not lack for institu-tions. Our analysis in Part ii of this book involved a procession of government organisations and did not even mention an equally large number of organisationsthat are concerned in various other ways with ict and government. All these institutions and organisations do their work as best they can in their own specificarea. The problem is that - like iGovernment itself, which has evolved largelywithout a pre-determined design or plan - many of them have also emergedspontaneously along with iGovernment or have been added piecemeal. In thesame way that iGovernment has developed application by application and link bylink, so too has the institutional landscape evolved in response to individualapplications and the related opportunities and problems. These organisations arein fact eGovernment - and not iGovernment - institutions. However: they donot have the same relationships and links that are such important features ofiGovernment. That is true both for the way they have developed and for the waythey exercise supervision and enforcement. Although many organisations arededicated to promoting the opportunities of ict or to highlighting the disadvan- tages and risks involved, as a group they are not sufficiently effective. The indi-vidual organisations scarcely acknowledge that their own work is related to thework of the others, let alone explicitly refer to that relationship in their missionor in the action they take. One important conclusion that we can draw from our arguments above is that the networked nature of iGovernment makes it extremely difficult to control from acentral point. Hierarchies and networks are uneasy bedfellows. At the same time,something or someone must drive iGovernment self-awareness forward, theimplication being that this should be a national body with the authority to takebinding decisions. The challenge, therefore, is to identify institutions that cancombine the logic of networks and the power to take decisions, within bothgovernment and the broader social context of iGovernment. iGovernment oper-ates against the backdrop of an iSociety that is influenced by and in turn influencesict. In addition, government's public information networks often flow over into the private networks of businesses and citizens. iGovernment cannot be struc-tured autonomously and in isolation. All the relevant actors must be involved -214 igovernmentnot only those within government but also stakeholders in the private sector and the citizen. The motto must therefore be: 'Make sure we involve the iSociety inbuilding an iGovernment to last'. If we follow this book's line of argument to its logical conclusion, then the only real institutional recommendation that we can make is that iGovernment self-awareness must seep down into every government organisation and into everyvital point in the process of digitization, from the initial plans drawn up at thenational or international level or the first sketches for a new application to thespecific assignment or contract and, later on, to the linking up of information.iGovernment self-awareness must be ingrained throughout: that is the aim. Suchawareness grows by means of an evolutionary process that can be accelerated byexternal factors, for example (as we have seen in other countries) the uproarsurrounding the publication of confidential government documents byWikiLeaks, or a major scandal relating to information management. But thegrowth of that awareness can also be encouraged by establishing institutionsspecifically designed to act as drivers. In this final section, we describe the general outlines of four institutions capable of driving iGovernment self-awareness. The strategic, societal and operational func-tions are allocated to four new organisations that must be given the power toshape the transformation of iGovernment. As indicated above, recognising theurgency involved and developing an associated agenda are more important thanhammering out every detail. The biggest priority is to allocate the strategic, socie-tal and operational functions to institutions and to equip these institutions withthe necessary means and the power to take binding decisions. It is against thisbackground that we make four proposals for iGovernment institutional innova-tion: to allocate the strategic function to a permanent committee for iGovernmentthat reports to the Senate and House of Representatives; to allocate the societalfunction to a national iPlatform and an iAuthority, the first being responsible fortransparency and the second for dealing with and resolving problems that citizensencounter with iGovernment; and finally, to allocate the operational function toan organisation responsible for ensuring professional commissioning practices ingovernment. 9.3.1 permanent committee for igovernment The responsibility for promoting iGovernment self-awareness must be allocatedto a national organisation. That is because, in any scenario, there is too great a riskthat such awareness will be dissipated among the particular interests of the vari-ous actors and organisations that concern themselves with ict and its conse- quences. 215 recommendations: working on igovernmentSet up a permanent committee for iGovernment that reports annually to Parlia- ment on 'the state of information'. The main task of such a committee woul d be to note trends and developments, recognise how they are related, and think them through from the perspective of iGovernment, i.e. beyond the boundaries of ministries and levels of government,and with a view to potential future de velopments. Th e committee's advice would focus specifically on the 'warning flags' described above, i.e. networked informa-tion, composite information, and preventive and pro-active policy. Its annual reportwould be made available in the public domain and offer information-related (as op-posed to technology-related) recommendations relating to government's plans,viewed within the broader context of iGovernment and iSociety. Where relevant, itsadvice would specifically consider European and international trends and develop-ments. Decisions taken at these levels often only emerge as topics of political and social debate in the Netherlands at a much later stage. Because they influence howiGovernment and its branches beyond the Dutch borders develop, however, theyshould be noted, discussed and thought through at a more appropriate point in time. The committee's agenda must involve more than just advising on planned meas- ures, however. One recurring item would be to evaluate ict projects - whether up and running, abandoned, or completed - in the light of information flows and therelationship between service, care and control. The very fact that iGovernmentconsists of ongoing processes of linking and diversification makes it crucial to keepclose track of projects and links, draw lessons from the past, and encourage therelevant debate. Ideally, that debate should concern function creep and similarmatters, with function creep being recognised both as an inherent feature of inno-vation and as a problem - i.e. opposite sides of a coin that can be confusingly simi-lar at times. Drawing on the annual reports of the iPlatform and iAuthority (seebelow), the committee would also take stock of situations and systems in whichcitizens (and companies) have run into difficulties and, at a more general level,draw lessons from such cases and monitor them for improvement or deterioration.One specific point to watch for would be the all-too-common tendency to evalu-ate ict projects strictly from the narrow perspective of the technology or the budget involved. The committee must focus much more explicitly on facilitatingand carrying out evaluations that consider whether the new application in factdelivers the information specified by the underlying policy objective. If the aim isto embed 'iGovernment self-awareness' throughout government, then a willing-ness to learn is more important - at least for the time being - than any accountabil-ity mechanisms. The committee's report would be discussed in both chambers of Parliament and in the presence of the committee's chairperson. It would be up to the House ofRepresentatives to draw conclusions from the recommendations. The Coordinat-216 igovernmenting cio would run the committee's secretariat, as this would create an institu- tional relationship between iGovernment self-awareness in the Government and in Parliament. The new task would also boost the strategic position of the Coordi-nating cio and improve his or her forward-looking capacity. The Office of the Coordinating cio could help establish a broad public forum to support and assist the committee. The forum, an advisory body, would nurturethe relationship between the permanent committee for iGovernment and theiSociety. Following the example of the broadly-based Standardisation Forum - setup to support the Standardisation Board - the iGovernment forum would providethe permanent committee with ideas, express its concerns, and suggest solutions.The forum would be made up of a wide range of stakeholders and experts. In addi-tion to representatives of ministries, government agencies and local authorities, itwould also include experts from the private sector (not representing specific busi-nesses but based on the particular expertise that they can bring to the table), scien-tists, supervisory bodies, and 'citizens', i.e. ngo s such as the Consumers' Associa- tion and human rights organisations. In 2001, the Docters van LeeuwenCommittee suggested setting up a similar body (which it called the 'Platform forthe Electronic Society') to advise a government commissioner ( ict and Govern- ment Ad Hoc Advisory Committee 2001). At the time, the Government rejectedthis proposal, pointing out that the Minister for Urban Policy and Integrationplayed a coordinating role with respect to ict. In its official comments, the Government concluded that the Minister would provide a more effective institu-tional anchor. But that argument no longer holds water. iGovernment represents abreak with government's tradition of thinking in terms of eGovernment; theapproach it requires differs from the role that a coordinating minister can or mayeven want to play. The networks that make up iGovernment, whether internal orexternal, and recognition of their impact make for an agenda that should not berestricted to a single ministry or even exclusively to government. iGovernmentwill become a matter of coordination only when self-awareness of iGovernmenthas been well and truly embedded throughout the system. 9.3.2 iplatform and i authority There is strong evidence that an enormous 'back office' of government informa-tion flows has been created, which sometimes extends beyond the boundaries ofgovernment. As mentioned above, much of the information in these networks hasbeen 'abandoned', in the sense that no one claims responsibility for it. It is some-times impossible for citizens to correct erroneous information, even though theyare confronted with the consequences of such errors in their dealings with govern-ment. In addition to the extreme cases of identity fraud that make the headlines,there are numerous other situations in which citizens have attempted to correctcontaminated government information but did not know where to turn. The217 recommendations: working on igovernmentorganisations that should be there to assist these citizens are limited in scope and ill-equipped for their task: some are only temporary; others do not deal with indi-vidual cases; many of them operate with barebones staff and funding; and none ofthem is empowered to take binding decisions that will actually correct errors inthe underlying network. Even the Office of the National Ombudsman, afterreviewing the most publicised case of identity fraud (the Kowsoleaa case), had toadmit the impossibility of correcting erroneous information once and for all. But the 'abandonment' issue goes beyond erroneous information alone. It also applies to the information that government communicates to citizens through apatchwork of websites, e-helpdesks and Web portals. A growing number of theseprojects involve multiple parties (including private-sector actors) and have arisenwithout the benefit of democratic legitimacy or decision-making. In many of thesenew networked communication models, and in the communication that takesplace through them, there is no clear allocation of official responsibility for theinformation made available. The societal function can be implemented by prop-erly organising transparency and accountability in a way that protects citizensagainst falling victim to those elements of iGovernment that they can neitherfathom nor influence. iGovernment transparency and accountability must have an identifiable 'home'. Citizens should have access to a single platform that concerns itself with trans-parency and a single authority that is responsible for accountability. In the same way that government is attempting to provide its service through a single helpdesk, it should also consider concentrating responsibility for trans-parency and data correction in a single access point or portal. That would meanclustering government forums that are currently dispersed over different websitesand that tend to be application or problem-driven 5at a single digital location. The iGovernment Platform would serve as an interactive source of information aboutthe use of ict in the relationship between government and the citizen. To increase transparency it would clarify to citizens what kinds of records are held on them inthe linked systems of iGovernment, who has access to those records, and why -and provide that information through a clear and unambiguous informationportal. Following the example of the Tax and Customs Administration'sallowances portal, such a Platform would allow citizens to alter and correct theirpersonal data themselves within a secure environment, and it would also guaran-tee that those alterations will then be implemented throughout the entirenetwork. Making the transparency function interactive would also empower citi-zens. Adding interactivity to the platform would reflect a broader tendency iniSociety, with digitization improving and driving the potential for citizen empow-erment. 218 igovernmentThe second societal function, accountability, is active and has already been advo- cated by the National Ombudsman (2009). The iAuthority must ensure that anymisrepresentation of citizens in the back office or other systems is actuallycorrected. Citizens must literally be relieved of the burden of rectifying and solv-ing problems that creep into the chains and networks of iGovernment. Thisproposal represents a radical centralisation of accountability. The existing proce-dures and methods - whereby errors that have crept into the network must becorrected locally and via different institutions and supervisory bodies - haveproved to be inadequate. The new iAuthority must combine expertise and apersonal approach with the power to take binding decisions vis-\u00e0-vis the organisa- tions that populate the back-office network of iGovernment. It is very importantthat the iAuthority should in fact possess such authority; if it does not, it will begiven the same run-around as the hapless citizen, and the problem would simplybe shifted on to another's shoulders rather than resolved. Careful thought mustalso be given to the degree of access that the citizen should have to the iAuthority.On the one hand, it should be a recognisable and low-threshold institution; on theother, too low a threshold makes it all too easy for certain individuals to throw aspanner into the works of iGovernment, 6given the amount of effort that the model requires on the part of the administrators. The iPlatform could act as a digital extension of the current government portal mijnoverheid.nl (mygovernment.nl). In organisational terms, the iAuthorityshould be set up as an autonomous body with the power to take binding decisions.All existing information platforms and operational organisations (including theIdentity Fraud Helpdesk), should be merged into or combined within these organ-isations. The iPlatform and the iAuthority would publish a combined annualreport describing their work and the results they had attained and reviewing themost important trends and developments of the past year. 9.3.3 professionalising commissioning practices Ultimately, iGovernment self-awareness must also be extended to the technicalrealm, i.e. with respect to the development of standards, applications, and links between data and information flows. This is the operational function. It is, afterall, the engineers and systems designers and the relevant national and interna-tional bodies that determine what iGovernment will look like at the operationallevel. The realisation that the relevant decisions are essentially political or policy-driven is often cancelled out by the notion that technology is nothing more thanan instrument. Anyone who follows the flow of information - as we have done in this book - knows that technology gives rise to categories and that 'categorieshave politics.' That means that questions of design, standardisation and interoper-ability are all decisive for the way iGovernment develops as a whole, and not justfor individual applications and decisions. One of the critical elements in the evolu-219 recommendations: working on igovernmenttion of iGovernment is the quality of government commissioning practices in the field of ict . By specifying the requirements for a new system or application and identifying what functions it must have, government is in fact setting the stage forfuture applications and how they fit into the broader context of iGovernment.Government faces a dilemma in that respect: on the one hand, it wants to be incharge of development, for example via the ictu ; on the other, it is impossible and impractical for government itself to have all the necessary technical knowledge inhouse. Most of the technical specialists who 'work for government' are in factexternal consultants and experts. The result is over-investment in technical know-how and too little concern for the interaction between policy, implementation,and technology in information flows. Government's commissioning practices must therefore be remodelled: instead of investing in technical expertise, it should invest in knowledge at the interface ofpolicy, implementation, and technology. If it aims to take systematic action tosolve ict problems, then it will have to turn its attention from technical develop- ment to professional outsourcing. That means that the technical side of thingsmust be left largely in the hands of parties that operate outside government (bycontracting these external parties to develop applications or by purchasing appli-cations in the commercial marketplace). Instead, government should learn howto frame an assignment; accurately define the specifications, legal context andunderlying conditions; place the assignment in a broader context; and provideprofessional supervision during development. It is up to the developer to ensurethat the technology actually works, but it the commissioning party's job to ensure(by supervising and guiding the work) that the technology generates the 'right'information and facilitates information processes that fit in well with the relevantpolicy and with the wishes of the agencies or other organisations that will actuallyimplement it. This means setting up an organisation that is responsible for govern-ment commissioning practices and that is not limited by the boundaries betweenministries and individual agencies. Such an organisation would employa small group of 'core' ict specialists and legal experts in ict matters who under- stand iGovernment. That core group would be joined, on a project-by-projectbasis, by the cio and other officials from the relevant ministry, and by the agency staff who will ultimately have to work with the system. It would seem obviousthat the partners in the chain or network should always be involved in developinga new system or application, but in fact this rarely ever happens. Here too, theinformation flows generally outstrip the relevant organisations. iGovernment must improve its commissioning practices by investing in knowledge at the interface of policy, implementation, and technology, rather than by investingpurely in in-house technical expertise and development capacity. 220 igovernment9.4 implementing igovernment If the Dutch Government is to take on board the reality of iGovernment and become capable of prudently guiding its de velopment, it must make the transition from eGovernment to iGovernment in thought, word and deed. For governmentto tread the path of digitization with confidence, iGovernment self-awareness willneed to be embedded at every level. Government faces a crucial challenge in thatrespect: it must be willing and able to move the focus of debate from technologyand individual applications to a new level, i.e. to interrelated informationprocesses and linked information. What is essential is to create enough leeway andgenerate enough interest in weighing up the driving, underpinning and process-based principles and to do so with an open mind. Scrupulous development of iGovernment cannot proceed without such an assessment, and it is vitally impor-tant to consider iGovernment as a whole. In addition, government must exerciseparticular caution, both in this assessment and in its policymaking and policyimplementation, whenever the three processes of information handling noted inthis book come into play. These processes - furnished with symbolic warning flags- are associated with a) the networking of information, b) the compiling andenhancing of information, and c) the pursuit of preventive policy based on infor-mation. The specific implications that these processes have for policy implemen-tation, the position of the citizen, the quality of government information manage-ment, and the internal and external reference points for liability andaccountability make it vital to look critically at the usefulness, necessity, andimpact on society of digitization projects. To support government as it meets this challenge and ensure the necessary institu- tional grounding, this book lays out an agenda for institutional transformation.The institutions proposed within the context of this transition are intended toguarantee that iGovernment is equipped with the tools it needs to foster self-awareness, protection, and innovation. It must be clear that the institutional trans-formation as such is much more important than the specific form and nametags ofthe institutions proposed in this volume. The transition will need to take place atthree different levels: the strategic level (by installing a permanent committee foriGovernment), the societal level (via an iPlatform responsible for transparency andan iAuthority responsible for accountability), and the operational level (by instill-ing professional commissioning practices in government and prioritising knowl-edge at the interface of technology and policy above technical know-how). Finally,in the case of both the challenge that government faces and the necessary institu-tional transformation, the development of iGovernment cannot be viewed asseparate from the path that the iSociety as a whole is treading. 221 recommendations: working on igovernmentnotes 1 That is ultimately also a collective interest, because a society that does not forgive and forget is a fundamentally different society to one in which people are permit- ted to start again. 2 In a statement, Senator Joseph Lieberman said that providers such as Amazon (which had hosted WikiLeaks) should cut all ties with WikiLeaks. \"I will be askingAmazon about the extent of its relationship with WikiLeaks and what it and otherweb service providers will do in the future to ensure that their services are notused to distribute stolen, classified information\"; see \"Banishing WikiLeaks\" smobqa , requested on 10 3 Interview with Peter Wijntje and Sjoerd Peereboom (Ministry of Finance/Tax and Customs Administration), 19 October 2010. 4 ljn: bk6331, Dutch Supreme Court , 08/04524 B. 5 Examples include burgerservicenummer.nl (for infobsnzorg.nl (for the epd ), lastvandeoverheid.nl, mijnoverheid.nl, and the Identity Fraud Helpdesk for the public. 6 Cf. discussions on (among other things) environmental organisations and their sometimes disruptive access to the administrative courts. 222 igovernmentafterword: igovernment and isociety In essence, this publication is about government taking responsibility for the way it uses ict . The role that government plays in the information society and the responsibility that it bears go much further, however. In addition to beingaccountable for iGovernment, government is also responsible, to a certain extent,for the way the iSociety as a whole functions. Such sweeping responsibility can be defined in terms of the following questions: What aspects of the informationsociety should government be concerned about? Should it intervene? If so, how?Former Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok addressed this issue in April 2001 at theInfodrome Conference: \"We must nevertheless ask ourselves what responsibili-ties government will face in the years ahead in connection with the consequencesinherent to the information society.\" That responsibility can be described as thesystem responsibility that iGovernment has for the iSociety. Any intervention in the iSociety will naturally be politically charged and to a certain extent contro-versial, but an attempt must nevertheless be made to find common ground formatters that government is obliged to guarantee. iGovernment's system responsi-bility cannot simply be ignored. That is because, first of all, government must stand up for its citizens when the private sector fails to adequately guarantee their interests. For example, the grow-ing power over information exercised by such global corporations as Google, Facebook and Apple will force government (and the European Union) to considerwhether - and if so how - that power should be restricted in the public interest.There have already been certain moves in that direction. Responding to questionsraised by Parliament in August 2010, the then Minister of Economic Affairs Mariavan der Hoeven undertook to ask the Data Protection Authority ( cbp ) to evaluate a new clause in Apple's privacy policy. 1In some cases, questions touching on government's system responsibility will need to be addressed at the Europeanlevel and through a European actor (a 'lead authority' 2) because it is only the Euro- pean Union that has the necessary weight and authority to take forceful action.However, the popularity of interactive communication in social networks andthrough Web 2.0 raises another question: is it government's responsibility tocontrol or restrict the behaviour of citizens and/or to protect them againstcommercial actors in that sphere? To a certain extent, moreover, government'ssystem responsibility in these and other cases can be legally enforced as a humanrights matter (De Hert 2011).223\"It is not true that European jurisprudence offers the authorities too little in the way of specific guidelines. The Court of Justice has formulated general principles concerning the protection ofpersonal data that are being applied in a growing number of cases. The same is true, to a somewhatlesser extent, of the battle against identity fraud and the protection of media pluralism. TheNetherlands can make good use of these principles\" (De Hert 2011). How iGovernment should interpret its system responsibility is in our view, the key issue - we've moved beyond the question as to whether it should do so at all. Secondly, system responsibility becomes an issue when trends in the private sector interfere too blatantly with crucial government policy. Cases in point arethe various advances in the area of identity management. As we saw in Part ii, government is making a major investment in digital identity tools, for examplethe biometric passport, the DigiD system, and (potentially) the eLicence. It isprecisely because it is investing heavily in identity authentication - and makesclaims as to its accuracy - that government must also concern itself with identityauthentication in the semi-public and commercial sectors, in particular wherethere is a risk that the quality will deteriorate. What is the point of investing inthe data security of a national database under the terms of the Passport Act,when the same data is also generally available beyond the domain of govern-ment? The introduction of the biometric passport raises questions about the useof biometrics in the private sector. Little has been done to regulate such use, and politicians have so far ignored this issue. Swimming pools, supermarkets,employers and computer manufacturers, for example, will be at liberty to experi-ment with new applications. The growing stockpile of information also makes identification an increasingly important key for linking and combining data outside the context of government.Experience shows that the use of digital identities is blurring the boundariesbetween the public and private sectors. The impact of that use is therefore spillingover the same boundaries, especially when private-sector actors have duties underpublic law (civil-law notaries) or when government requires private actors toestablish the identity of individuals - under the Compulsory Identification Act(Wet identificatieplicht ; provision of services; employment) - based on the identity documents issued by government. For example, the bsn was conceived as an iden- tity authentication code for government services; no one considered the possibil-ity that it would very quickly catch on as a universal (public-private) unique iden-tifier. For these and other reasons, government must keep a careful eye on trendsoutside its own territory and consider whether and when stricter guidelines orrules are required. 224 igovernmentThe fact that government bears final responsibility in such cases does not mean that it must take matters solely into its own hands (De Hert 2011) or even that ithas the capacity or leeway in its own organisation to do so (Meijer 2011). There are,however, a number of pitfalls that it must try to avoid with regard to this funda-mental responsibility. First of all, ministers must think hard before deciding tointervene. Government naturally has a duty to intercede in societal relationships(in this case informational relationships): that is one of its raisons d'etre . At the same time, however, such intervention can be risky: it can be thwarted by socialdynamics for all kinds of reasons, and government must anticipate such a possibil-ity. Secondly, it would be risky to adopt an ' ict user's mentality' at the start of an intervention. The information society - the ict-immersion of everyday life - does not 'belong' to government in the way that its own ict systems do, and govern- ment must be aware that there are constitutional aspects that need to be taken intoaccount when it decides to intervene. Thirdly, there are different ways to inter-vene, and it is all too easy to choose the wrong one. To start with the most tradi-tional scenario: government can decide to intervene in informational relations byimposing mandatory regulations. It can also take a 'soft' approach, however, andmerely offer itself as an interlocutor for private players. The middle groundbetween the two extremes is facilitatory: it can create the right basic conditionsfor society to work out its own potential solutions. Each of these modi operandi is based on a different conception of responsibility. According to Meijer (2011), however, it is becoming more difficult, and indeed perhaps impossible, for government - as the actor bearing system responsibility -to play a key role in the turbulence and complexity of technological networks.\"Instead of overall responsibility, government can increasingly claim two otherresponsibilities: procedural responsibility and miscellaneous responsibility.\"Procedural responsibility means that government would no longer be responsiblefor outcomes, but merely for the quality of the process. Miscellaneous responsibil-ity would allow government to guarantee that those involved are making an effortto protect citizens and prevent system failures. It would involve governmenttaking on the duties that others have failed to fulfil. The permanent committee foriGovernment proposed above could play an important role in setting the agendafor the concept of government system responsibility. The key questions that thecommittee would address are: what trends and developme nts in the broader iSoci- ety should be encouraged or discouraged, and what is the most suitable level fortaking regulatory action (national or international)? Which general trends anddevelopments can be expected to trickle down to iGovernment and what does thatimply for any regulatory action? However, certain iSociety trends will increasingly force government to face fundamental questions that it has not even begun to answer. The speed at whichinformation is disseminated and copied - even (or especially) when it is unwel-225 afterword: igovernment and isocietycome to government - means that the authorities will also have to consider their own information management system. The WikiLeaks affair has made thatpatently clear. Transparency is generally regarded as something that governmentconcedes to citizens (passive transparency); it is not often considered a virtueworth practising (active transparency), and certainly not something that only ahandful of citizens can claim or force from government. In today's digital world,however, the authorities will increasingly have to consider precisely how theyintend to deal with transparency. As John Naughton commented in The Guardian , the authorities must \"[l]ive with the WikiLeakable world or shut down the net. It's[their] choice\" (Naughton 2010b). They are not likely to choose the latter option.Nevertheless, they will need to find a new balance between freedom of the press,data confidentiality and data security; a regulatory system may be an option. Partof the answer may lie in regulating parties outside government (servers, cloudsetc.), but part of it may also require government to engage in self-examination.Some information should perhaps not be stored at all; other information sourcesshould be more transparent rather than confidential and secret; and still otherinformation should be stored more securely than it currently is. 3But government can never entirely rule out the unpredictability and uncertainty of society and,consequently, the iSociety. When it comes to iGovernment's responsibility for the iSociety, the frame of reference is the same as when assessing government's use of ict. In essence, we can define government's system responsibility by - once again - weighing up thedriving, underpinning and process-based principles, although in this case thedriving principles often operate beyond the boundaries of government. The publicand businesses move ahead, inspired by the promise of new technologies and prof-its. When this drive is not offset against underpinning principles or kept in checkby the process-based principles that make information flows transparent for thepublic and - if necessary, open to criticism - then those responsible for iGovern-ment should at the very least ask themselves whether the time has not come totake action.226 igovernmentnotes 1 Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Affairs responding to questions about a new clause in Apple's privacy conditions, 3 August 2010. 2 There are now arguments within the euin favour of a \"lead authority\" with suf- ficient powers to resolve these sorts of issues for the 27 Member States (interview with J.
