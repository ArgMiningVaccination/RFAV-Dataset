We are excited that you are interested in this unique multi -disciplinary graduate program at the University of Tennessee (UT), Knoxville. We offer both Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy ( PhD) degrees which prepare student s for careers in the health sciences. Students can take either non -thesis or thesis MS degree options. We also have the option for students to take the PhD with a concurrent MS degree. Toget her with the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) program, we offer an accelerated dual degree program leading to the conferral of both DVM and PhD degrees in less time than would be required to both degrees independently. This dual DVM -PhD program prepares students for careers in research. We also offer a dual DVM - MS option that leads to conferral of both D VM and MS degrees in less time than would be required for the two degrees taken independently . Our program actively promotes the concept of \"One Health, One Medicine\" by emphasizing the comparative approach to the study of biomedical science. We have recently extended this by offering a One Health minor that is available to students from all programs and colleges of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. The CEM program is open to graduate students seeking biomedical training and provides an opportunity for a multi -disciplinary approach to study health issues in animals and humans while also considering their environment . This intercollegiate program involves participation of faculty with a wide -range of interests in biomedical disciplines and life sciences. The interdisciplinary training environment provides our students access to facilities , faculty, and other personnel from the College of Veterinary Med icine, UT Medical Center at Knoxville, life sciences departments, Herbert College of Agriculture, College of Engineering, College of Nursing, the Department of Nutrition, and the Department of Public Health. It is my hope that you will find this handbook useful if you are planning to pursue or are already pursuing a graduate degree in Comparative and Experimental Medicine. It contains basic information about policies and procedures in the graduate program, including curricula and degree completion requirem ents. We update this document periodically in light of changes instituted by the program or other administrative units. If you would like to be involved with the program as a student, collaborator, faculty, or sponsor , please do not hesitate to contact us at the address on the next page .

This and other methods of support may be arranged with individual faculty . Successful pairing with a major professor does no t guarantee f unding support. Graduate Research Assistantships Assistantships are a warded as funds are available. Persons with a professional degree in the health sciences who wish to pursue a PhD program are given priority. Awards are renewable up to 4 years for the PhD and up to 2 years for the MS. Awards typically include a stipend, tuition waiver, and health insurance. How to Apply: Requests must come through the major professor ad dressed to the Director of Graduate Studies. Notification of Award: Awardees are notified by a letter from the Director of Graduate Studies. Requirements for Maintaining an Assistantship Students holding a one -half time (20 hours per week) assistantship no rmally should enroll in at least 6 credit hours during the semesters of the assistantship. A one -fourth time (10 hours per week) graduate assistant normally should enroll in a t least 9 credit hours during the semesters of the assistantship. A student must be enrolled in at least 9 credit hours to be considered full -time for federal financial aid purposes, even if the student has an assistantship. Summer enrollment must be at least 3 credit hours in order to maintain student health insurance. For internation al students , the minimum enrollment may be different. International students should always check with the Center for Global Engagement to determine the number of credit hours needed to satisfy the requirements of the ir specific visa. Students must make timely and satisfactory progress as described in the Degree Requirements and Academic Standing sections of this handbook. Assistantships are not automatically renewed. Funding assistance is dependent on the availability of funds and satisfactory performance of the student's assigned duties. Students must submit a yearly progress repo rt to the Director of Graduate Studies each academic year. In cases where corrective measures must be taken to remediate deficiencies, the CEM program will follow procedures as outlined in the Policy for the Administration of Graduate Assistantships in the Graduate Catalog . Instances in which a graduate assistant wishes to take a leave of absence will be handled on a case -by-case basis between the student, the student's ma jor professor, the CEM program office, and the Graduate School. No guarantee can be made that a student's position will be available upon their return. A Leave of A bsence Form must be filled out and submitted to the Graduate School for approval. Workload for an Assistantship As student employees, graduate assistants are balancing professional development through work experience with progress toward their degree. To encourage that balance, the workload for an assistants hip may not exceed 20 hours per week without prior approval from the Dean of the Graduate School. Appointments are normally on a one -half time (20 hours per week) or one -fourth time (10 hours per week) basis. However, the normal number of hours for conducting an assignment should be mutually understood by the stud ent and the major professor. Graduate School Fellowships The Graduate School offers and administers various fellowships. These awards are for full -time study at UT and awardees are selected on the basis of high achievement, broad intellectual ability, and potential for significant career contributions. Students do not apply for fellowships; they are nominated by the department. More detailed information can be found on the Graduate Fellowships webpage. 14 Other Ty pes of Financial Aid Information on other types of financial aid is available at One Stop Student Services : Grants Scholarships Work-Study Loans Study Abroad Summer Consortium Agreements Fee Deferment of Veterans Education Benefi ts Service members, veterans, and dependents of veterans who are eligible beneficiaries of United States Department of Veterans Affairs Education Benefits may elect, upon formal application, to defer payment of required tuition and fees until the final day of the term for which the deferment has been requested. Instructions for requesting a fee deferment can be found on the Veterans Success Center website under VA UTK Enrollment Information/ Fee Deferment . Student H ealth Insurance Student health insurance is available for purchase by graduate students who do not have a graduate assistantship. All students are subject to minimal eligibility requirements set forth by the insurance company. The student health insurance covers most medical costs provided by the Student Health Center at 100%. Off campus, it functions as a comprehensive health plan subject to deductibles, co -pays, and co -insurance. Students not otherwise covered by insurance are urged to purchase this or another comparable plan, since paying for medical care is the student's responsibilit y. Enrollment in the student insurance plan is mandatory for international students . Fees are charged to their MyUTK account. International students may waive the cost of UT insurance if they have already purchased insurance before arriving in the United States , as long as it meets the university -mandated criteria. All graduate assistants on at least a one -fourth time (10 hours per week) appointment are automatically enrolled in the Graduate Assistant Health Insurance Program. These students will have 100% of the premium paid by the university. If students already have insurance coverage through another insurance carrier, this policy functions as additional coverage. GSS T ravel & Academic Suppor t Awards The Graduate Student Senate (GSS) administer s travel and academic support awards for graduate students attending professional meetings . These awards are based on both need and merit and help defray expenses for transportation, lodging, and registration fees. To request a travel award, students must complete an online application . All applications require electronic signatures from the advisor/ major professor, department head, and college dean and must be submit ted no later than 5 p.m. on the day of the deadline . If you have any questions about the t ravel award application process, please contact gsstravel@utk.edu . 15 REGISTRATION AND ADVISI NG The minimum number of credit hours for registration is 1 credit hour (for students who must register for course 600 Dissertation, the minimum is 3 credit hours). Registration allows use of services such as library checkout, laboratories, and recreation facilities not open to the public. Information concerning registration is available on the One Stop Student Services webpage. Registration is accomplished via the web through the MyUTK student portal (you will be asked to log in using your UT NetID and password). Payment of Registration Fees During prio rity registration, students receive an email at their UT email address indicating their payment statement is available for viewing at MyUTK . Payment is due by the deadline stated . A graduated late fee is assessed to any student who fails to register during priority registration. Additional information can be obtained at One Stop Student Services . Failure to pay required fees before the deadline for the semester will result in the student being dropped from all courses. Students may not attend and credit cannot be earned for classes without proper enrollment registration. Change in Registration (Adds, Drops, Withdrawals) The permanent record will show all courses for which the student has registered, except those audited and those from which the student has withdrawn on or before the \"Drop Course without a W\" deadline. A s tudent who fail s to attend the first class meeting, without prior arrangement with the instructor, may be dropped from the course to make spa ce available to other students. However, it is the s tudent 's responsibility to assure that a course has been dropped; otherwise, a grade of F w ill be received for the course. If a student drops all courses for the semester, that is considered Withdrawing from the University . Students calle d to active military duty during enrollment should contac t the Veterans Success Center for assistance with withdrawal and readmission procedures. Type of Change for Full Term Classes (fall/spring) Deadline Add or Drop a course without a W or change credit/grading 1st thru 10th day of class Add a course or change credit/grading with instructor/advisor permission 11th thru 42nd day of class Drop a course with a W 11th thru 84th day of class For summer semester, the periods for add, drop, change of credit/grading are determined based on a percentage of the equivalen t deadline for a full semester. Within the change of registration period, a student may change registration on MyUTK . If the deadline has already passed, the student must submit a Late Change of Registration Form to the Graduate School , with approval from the course instructor and the Director of Graduate Studies. Registration deadlines for a given semester can be found under Timetable/Financial Deadline Calendar s on the Office of the University Registrar website . 500- and 600 - Level Course Distinction Graduate courses offered through the CEM graduate program provide information and training at both fundamental and advanced levels. Offerings at the fundamental level present information and challenges for which the foundations have been set at the undergraduate level. In the CEM, these courses are listed as 500 -level courses. CEM courses listed at the 600 level are advanced presentations based on foun dations provided at the 500 level and lower. 500-level Course description: Information presented in these courses is foundational for the disciplines represented in comparative and experimental medicine. Courses at this level may be core courses for both MS and PhD programs and may be required by student committees for both MS and PhD curricula. These courses are typically lecture -based with examinations as the grading mechanism; however, grading may also be 16 based on written papers and oral presentations. Credit hours are based on contact hours with students. As examples, a 1-credit -hour course must meet the equivalent of one 50 -minute session per week during a semester whereas a 4 -credit course must meet the equivalent of 4 sessions per week (2,800 minute s) during a 14 -week semester. Faculty: The responsible faculty member must be at the rank of assistant professor or above , and all invited lecturers must have at least a master's degree or professional medical degree (DVM, MD, DDS, or equivalent). 600-level Course d escription: Information presented in these courses is advanced beyond the fundamental information presented in courses at the 500 level. Courses at the 600 level may be presented in traditional or non -traditional formats, including interactiv e and group or individual learning activities. Depending on the course format, grading may be based on examinations, written papers, oral presentations, or defined participation. Course credit is determined from a combination of lectures, group learning ac tivities, and interactive and individualized learning activities. Faculty: The responsible faculty member must be at the rank of assistant professor or above and must have previously taught in at least one graduate -level course (500 -level graduate course o r 800-level veterinary course). Special and Advanced Topics and Variable Credit Courses The CEM offers different courses titled as either special or advanced topics. These courses are individualized to meet specific needs of students. Credit hours are var iable, and the courses may be repeated with different subject matter. Approval to offer special and advanced topics courses must be requested prior to the semester in which the course is proposed to be offered. CEM faculty should submit requests to the Director of Graduate Studies using the Course Request Form, accompanied by a course syllabus. Proper Use of Courses 502 and 500/600 Course 502: Use of Facilities is for students who are not taking coursework and do not wish to register for thesis or dissertation hours. Registering for this course will permit borrowing privileges in the U T Libraries or use of computer labs, other labs, and other university resources. NOTE: Credit hours taken in course 502 may not be used toward degree requirements. Course 500 Thesis is for the master's -level student working on a thesis. Six credit hours of course 500 Thesis must be taken for the degree, and students must register for course 500 each semester during work on the thesis. At least 3 credit hours of course 500 must be taken during the semester in which the student p lans to graduate. Course 600 Dissertation is for the doctoral -level student working on a dissertation. Twenty -four credit hours of course 600 Dissertation must be taken for the degree, and students must register for course 600 when work toward the dissert ation begins. Continuous registration of at least 3 credit hours in course 600 (including summer semester) is required thereafter until graduation. Full-Time Status The maximum load for a graduate student is 15 credit hours during fall and spring semesters. While 9 credit hours are considered full time, the typical full academic load varies by discipline. For the summer semester, graduate students may register for a m aximum of 12 credit hours in an entire summer semester. Students holding a one -half time (20 hours per week) are required to enroll in at least 6 credit hours during the semesters of the assistantship. A student must be enrolled in at least 9 credit hour s to be considered full -time for federal financial aid purposes, even if the student has an assistantship . Registration for more than 15 credit hours during any semester, or for more than 12 credit hours in the summer semester, is not permissible without prior approval.

Once approved, any revisions needed to add or remove courses for candidacy must be done by submitting a Revised Admission to Candidacy -Doctoral Degree Form . 26 Comprehensive Examination This examination should be taken when the student has completed, or nearly completed, all prescribed courses and should be completed before the end of the third year of the program (medical residents pursuing a PhD degree have until the end of their fourth year). S uccessful completion indicates that, in the judgment of the faculty, the doctoral student can think analytically and creatively, has a comprehensive knowled ge of the field and the specialty, knows how to use academic resources, and is deemed capable of completing the dissertation. The comprehensive exam should be a learning experience in which specific skills are developed, including effective and comprehensi ve literature review, writing ability, experimental design for hypothesis -driven research, and oral presentation skills. The comprehensive exam must be passed prior to admission to candidacy. In case of failure, the candidate may not take the examination again until the following semester. The result of the second examination is final. The exam will consist of two parts: 1) a written research proposal/grant application . 2) an oral exam that assesses the general knowledge of the student in the research emphasis area and serves as a defense of the written proposal. Comprehensive Exam Timeline Overview Student and major professor plan the semester in which the student should t ake their comprehensive exam This should be done well in advance of completing their 3rd year. Students should schedule and set the date for their oral examination portion before starting the process below, to ensure committee availability and room schedul ing. Student submits proposal topic to major professor for approval Well in advance of completing their 3rd year. Student independently writes their full research proposal Student is given 4 weeks to complete the research proposal after topic approval . Then submits the proposal to their committee. Committee reviews written proposal ahead of oral examination Committee should have 3 weeks between receiving the written proposal and the oral examination date to review the proposal. Oral examination and results Students receive comprehensive exam results immediately following oral examination. Part 1 - Written Examination: Submission & Approval of Research Proposal Topic The student will submit to their major professor a topic for a written grant propos al and a short statement defining the subject area (no more than 1 page in length). The student can get feedback from their committee regarding the topic, but their major professor gives the final approval. The proposal topic may be conceptually related to the student's intended doctoral research, but need not be identical in terms of experimental design. Once approved, the student informs the committee of the topic and timeline. The student will have 4 weeks to submit the completed written proposal to the members of the committee. The proposal must be written completely independently by the student. The major professor should guide the student on the overall project idea, but the 4 -week preparation and writi ng process should be independent of the major professor. In preparation for the written exam, students will need mentoring and/or coursework on how to prepare a compelling grant. This assistance should be provided well in advance of the 4 -week writing peri od.

B. Positions and Honors. List in chronological order pre vious positions, concluding with your present position. List any honors. Project Budget : No written budget is expected. In lieu of a written NIH/NSF format modular/R&R budget, the student should be prepared to discuss, during the oral exam (Part 2), the budget needed to carry out the proposed project. The budget and study time frame should stay within the constraints (2 years; $275,000 direct cost). Assessment of Written Proposal Each member of the committee will evaluate the proposal. The major professor should ensure that a copy of the written proposal is filed in the CEM Program Office. 28 Part 2 - Oral Examination No more than 3 weeks after submitting the written research proposal , the student should sit for the oral examination with all of t he committee members . The student's oral exam will be closed -door with the student's committee members . The Director of Graduate Studies can also be invited to attend. The oral examination should be scheduled as early in the process as possible, preferably before the topic is chosen . The CEM program office is available to assist the student in securing an exam room once the committee and student have agreed upon a date and time for the exam. Students should prepare a summary of their grant proposal and give a brief 10-20-minute presentation. The oral exam is intended to establish the student's ability to orally present and defend a research proposal as well as to survey the student's general b readth of knowledge in the primary study area. Therefore, students should expect questions that probe their scientific knowledge as it relates to the subject matter of the research proposal. Although students are not expected to prepare a written, formal b udget, the student should be prepared to discuss, during the oral exam, the budget needed to carry out the proposed project. Assessment of Oral Examination The committee will convene immediately after the oral examination to determine if the student has successfully passed the oral exam. The student will pass the examination provided it has been established that: A consensus exists among the examining committee members in favor of passing with at least a 2/3 majority on the committee (including the vote o f the Director of Graduate Studies, if they choose to vote). An appropriate number of questions dealing with the declared research emphasis area were administered. The examination was fair and rigorous. If the committee decides against a grade of pass for the oral exam, a time for re -examination - not before the following semester and including a revision of the written proposal - should be scheduled before the end of the current semester. The major professor is to send a short summary of the oral exam wi th a record of its outcome to the Director of Graduate Studies no later than 2 weeks after the examination is completed. 29 Dissertation The dissertation represents the culmination of an original research project completed by the student. The organization, method of presentation, and subject matter of the dissertation are important in conveying to others the results of such research. The dissertation must be prepared according to the guidelines provided on the Theses and Dissertations webpage, including the requirement to use university -approved plagiarism detection software prior to the defense. Upon successful defense of the dissertation , the final electronic copy must be submitted to TRACE (Tennessee Research and Creative Exchange) and must be accompanied by a Thesis/Dissertation Approval Form signed by all members of the doctoral committee. The approval sheet certifies to the Graduate School that the committee members have examined the final copy and found that its form and content demonstrate scholarly excellence. An Initial Embargo Request is required if a student would like to request an embargo on their work. The Survey of Earned Doctorates certificate of completion is also submitted at this time. Final Examination (Defense of Dissertation) A doctoral candidate must pass an oral defense of the dissertation. The examination is announced publicly and is open to all faculty members. The defense of the dissertation will be administered by ALL members of the PhD committee after completion of the d issertation and all course requirements. The examination must be passed by a simple majority. The dissertation, in the form approved by the major professor, must be distributed to the committee at least two weeks before the examination. The student should start working with the CEM office to schedule their defense date early in the semester in which they plan to graduate. After a defense date and time are confirmed and scheduled by the CEM office, t he student must submit a Schedule of Dissertation/Capstone Defense Form to the UT Graduate School. The student i s responsible for complying with the graduation deadlines provided by the Graduate School Graduation Deadlines page. Upon successful defense of the thesis , the final electronic copy must be submitted to TRACE (Tennessee Research and Creative Exchange) and must be accompanied by a Thesis/Dissertation Approval Form signed by all members of the committee. The approval form certifies to t he Graduate School that the committee members have examined the final copy and found that its form and content demonstrate scholarly excellence. An Initial Embargo Request is required if a student would like to request an embargo on their work for 1, 3, or 5 years. Following the oral defense, the Report of Final Examination must be submitted to the Graduate School by the deadline date for that semester. Requests for second attempts must be sent to the Director of Graduate Studies for approval/disapproval. In case of failure, the student may not apply for re -examination until the following semester. The result of the second examination is final. Information on the appeals process is located in the Grievances and Appeals section of this handbook. The final examination should also fulfill the following CEM guidelines: A seminar will be scheduled and presented by the student. The seminar will be announced through the CEM program office and be open to all interested persons at UT. Seminar announcements should identify this as a dissertation defense. This is an official university academic activity; pets (with the exception of service animals) and young children are not permitted to attend. Stude nts should not bring refreshments to the defense. At the end of the presentation, questions will be open to the audience and be appropriate to that presentation. An oral defense of the dissertation, by the student, will be conducted by the PhD committee immediately following the seminar . The Director of Graduate Studies is also invited to attend the oral defens e. 30 Program Deadlines for Completion of PhD Degree Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Semester 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Entry into program X PhD committee approved X Responsible Conduct of Research training X Take comprehensive examination X Submit admission to candidacy form X Dissertation credit hours X X X X X X Final exam/dissertation defense X * Yearly Progress Report due each summer and 2 UTCVM Research Day presentations before graduation. ** X indicates the deadline, but these tasks should be completed prior to the deadline. PhD with Concurrent MS Degr ee The CEM program offers a concurrent master's degree option for doctoral students who plan to complete the master's degree while maintaining enrollment in the doctoral program. The concurrent master's degree is designed primarily for the benefit of t hose entering the PhD program with a baccalaureate degree only. Students will gain experience working with a committee, performing research, and writing that will help prepare them for their PhD work. The degree requirements for the concurrent MS/PhD are i ntegrated within the degree requirements for the PhD, with a common committee (except in special circumstances; i.e., when the research emphasis area for the MS is different from that for the PhD ). To apply for a concurrent MS degree, s tudents must submit a Request for Concurrent Master's Degree in accordance with the instructions on the form. To earn the concurrent master's degree, all requirements must be met at the University of Tennessee. The student will decide the path to degree as outlined below. Concurrent master's students will be expected to follow all of the requirements for a CEM maste r's degree. This includes forming a master's committee and submitting a Masters Committee Appointment Form to the Director of Graduate Studies fo r approval. Path 1: MS with thesis; PhD with dissertation Students will progress through the MS program requirements and complete a thesis and oral defense before attempting the PhD comprehensive examination and completing the dissertation and dissertatio n oral defense. Six credit hours of 500 Thesis and 24 credit hours of 600 Dissertation are required. Students who have already started taking dissertation credit hours will need to register for both 500 Thesis and 600 Dissertation. Note: Credit hours earne d in 500 Thesis may not be counted toward PhD candidacy. Path 2: MS with project in lieu of thesis option; PhD with dissertation Students will progress through the MS program requirements with 6 credit hours in CEM 501/510/515 completed under the supervis ion of the student's major professor and committee. The individual project will involve a literature survey, development of a pre -doctoral fellowship grant targeted toward a specific funding agency, or other comparable project deemed acceptable by the stud ent's committee. The student will undergo an oral defense of the project before attempting the PhD comprehensive examination and completing the dissertation and dissertation oral defense. 31 DUAL DVM -PHD DEGREE REQUIREMENTS The College of Veterinary Medicine and the CEM program offer a coordinated accelerated dual program leading to the conferral of both the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine and the Doctor of Philosophy degrees in less time than would be required to earn both degrees independen tly. This accelerated program is designed to prepare highly motivated students for a career in veterinary research. 16 credit hours in Core Coursework * *CEM 504 Descriptive and Applied Epidemiology (3 credit hours) *CEM 541 Cellular and Molecular Basis of Disease (3 credit hours) *CEM 616 Comparative & Experimental Medicine Seminar (1 credit hour) *Journal Clubs 500 - or 600 -level (6 credit hours) *Statistics 500 - or 600 -level (3 credit hours) 32 credit hours in graduate c oursework. The CEM program will award up to 32 credit hours of DVM coursework toward the PhD in approved preclinical courses offered by the College of Veterinary Medicine. These courses must be graded A -F, with an earned grade of at least a B. Courses eligible for dual credit will be at the recommendation of the student's CEM major professor in consultation with the stud ent's PhD committee. 24 credit hours of course CEM 600 Doctoral Research and Dissertation . 72 credit hours total The doctoral comprehensive examination must be successfully completed within 2 years of completing all DVM coursework. Students entering the dual degree program must meet the minimum admission requirements for both the DVM and PhD programs. Applicants for the dual program must make separate application to, and be competitively and independently accepted by, the College of Veterinary Medicine for the DVM and the CEM program for the PhD. Students who have been admitted to the College of Veterinary Medicine may apply for approval to pursue the dual program at any time prior to or after matriculation. Such approval will be gran ted, provided that dual program studies are started prior to entry into the fourth semester of DVM coursework. Students enrolled in the dual program will be officially classified as primarily veterinary students until the DVM coursework is completed, with the following exception: dual program students will typically enroll as primarily PhD students during the summer semesters following completion of their first and second years in the veterinary curriculum. After the DVM is conferred, the student's primary major will be CEM. Degrees do not need to be awarded simultaneously. If a dual student has not completed the requirements for the PhD, the student may still be awarded the DVM. If the student completes the PhD requirements, but does not complete the DVM, the student may still be awarded the PhD . Students must satisfy the graduation requirements of each program. 32 MINORS OFFERED One Healt h Min or CEM offers a graduate minor in One Health . Emerging infectious diseases, controlling zoonoses, antibiotic resistance, and food safety threaten economic stability, human life, and biodiversity. Global One Health initiatives have been developed to protect global health security by creati ng transdisciplinary collaborations among human, animal, and environmental sectors. The One Health minor is for undergraduate and graduate students wishing to develop skills to prepare themselves for careers in agricultural, environmental, and human sciences in addition to scientific policy and communication. The required courses are interdisciplinary and will provide training in communication and leadership, translation of evidence to policy, a nd One Health that is relevant for all majors. For advising n eeds, students should contact the One Health Scholar within their college .

Admission to Candidacy When application is made for admission to candidacy, the minor and the courses required for the minor must be indicated. Students who do not complete the requirements of the minor will still receive academic credit for the courses they have successfully completed . 33 LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR RESEAR CH Institutions of higher education have maintained a centuries -old tradition of integrity and objectivity. U T is pleased with the overall support given by its faculty, staff, volunteers, and students in upholding this tradition and wants to ensure that the highest level of integrity in all academic activities is continued. Therefore, any individual who has reason to believe that they have knowledge of an act of research misconduct, including fabrication of results, plagiarism, and/or misrepresentation of findings, should communicate this information to a supervisor or appropriate administrator. If an allegation of misconduct is substantiated, the chief administrative officer of the campus wil l initiate the applicable disciplinary procedures, and sanctions, if appropriate, will be imposed under those procedures. Responsible Conduct of Research and Compliance Trainin g All researchers at UT are expected to comply with the university's research policies, regulations, and guidelines. Information and required forms are available at UT's Division of Research Integrity & Assurance . Regulations must be followed for all research, especially that involving animal care, biosafety, human subjects, and radiation. It is re quired that all students in the CEM program complete training in the responsible conduct of research during their first year of study. Training may be acquired by completing one of the following options: 1. Satisfactory completion of approved online training module s: CITI - Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative 2. Graduate course: CEM 525 Research Ethics for the Life Sciences Additional opportunities for responsible conduct of research training may be available through the UTIA and UT Knoxville research offices, as we ll as through periodic training sessions from other campus groups. Upon satisfactory completion of responsible conduct of research training, students should record the training as part of their yearly progress report . YEARLY PROGRESS REPO RT Each summer semester, students who have been in the CEM graduate program for at least two semesters must meet with their major professor to discuss their progress and performance. The major professor is responsible for providing a written evaluation describing the student's accomplishments, strengths, and deficiencies and, if necessary, suggested corrective actions. In the event of an anticipated unsatisfactory evaluation, the major professor consults with the student's advising committee before preparing the evaluation. Following the major professor's evaluation and prior to the start of fall semester, the student must submit a report packet to the CEM program office. The packet includes a detailed reporting form, a current curriculum vitae (CV), and a copy of the major professor's evaluation. The reporting form includes explanations and corrective actions to be taken in response to deficiencies or unsatisfactory progress reported in the major professor's evaluation. The packet will be available to the major professor and to members of the student's advising committee. If warranted, the Director of Graduate Studies will notify the student, the major professor, and the student's advising committee that a report of unsatis factory performance is being made to the AAPC. The AAPC will review the report and any additional materials provided by student's committee members and decide if there are grounds for probation or dismissal from the program. S hould a progress report not be filed by the specified deadline, access to financial support may be jeopardized, and students may be restricted from registering for courses. 34 GENERAL DUTIES & RESPONSIBILITIES OF GRADUATE STUDENTS AND FACULTY Guidelines for Students Commitment to the Program Students are expected to fully participate in professional activities related to the CEM program. Adequate Preparation With regard to learning in their respective courses, students have the responsibility to seek the information necessary to participate in classroom activity. Students should accept responsibility for adequate preparation for each class meeting, arriving for all classes able and willing to interact through classroom participation, testing, writing, in-class exercises, and other methods provided by the instructor. Basic to these activities is the need for students to employ appropriate resources, as assigned by the instructor, such as textbooks, other supplies, and outside reading materials. Satisfying University Requirements It is the student's responsibility to be aware of and follow guidelines, schedules, and deadlines provided by the CEM program, the Graduate School, the university, and instructors. All regulations must be satisfied in a timely fashion. Guidelines for Faculty Atmosphere for Teaching and Learning It is important that the faculty member create from the beginning, and preserve, an atmosphere conducive to learning. Both teacher and student should feel that they have come together in the common cause of the pursuit of learning. Faculty members should ensure that their students are progressing through their course of study in a timely fashion. Conducting a Course It is the instructor's responsibility to organize class material as efficiently and effectively as possible at the beginning of each term of instruction. At the beginning of the semester, faculty members will distribute to students a syllabus that makes clear the basis of the final grade with regard to the value placed on each component of the course. The faculty member should set an example for students in being faithful in attendance and punctual in starting and ending classes. Students should be informed of all planned instructor absences as early as possible. In presen ting course content, the faculty member should endeavor at all times to adhere to the subject; the classroom should not be used as a theater for expression of personal views that are not germane to the course. Guidelines for Major Professor (Primary Advis or/Mentor) The major professor, in conjunction with the graduate committee, is primarily responsible for supervising and guiding the student's graduate program. This includes ensuring adequate funding for the student's research, stipend, and/or tuition; compliance with Graduate School and CEM program requirements and deadlines; timely progress through the student's program of study; and successful completion of the student's thesis/dissertation, with publication of the student's work as the first author in peer- reviewed scientific journals before or shortly after graduation. The major professor will act to best serve the research, education, and career development of the student. 35 ACADEMIC STANDING Expectations for Good Standing Students in the CEM program are expected to maintain a 3.00 cumulative grade -point average (GPA) on all graduate courses graded A -F. For all other courses, a grade of either P or S must be received. In addition, students are expected to make reasonable pro gress in their thesis/dissertation research projects. The CEM program has a formal process for annual evaluation of student progress in the form of a yearly progress report . The process is designed to optimize the value of individual student programs and to ensure timely progression through degree requirements. Grade of Incomplete Under extraordinary circumstances the grade of I (Incomplete) may be awarded to students who have satisfactorily completed a substantia l portion of the course requirements but cannot complete the course for reasons beyond their control. It is the responsibility of the student receiving an I grade to arrange with the course instructor whatever action is needed to remove the I grade at the earliest possible date. If the I grade is not removed within one calendar year or upon graduation, it will be changed to an F and count as a failure in the computation of the GPA. No student may graduate with an \"I\" grade on record (see Graduate Catalog for additional information). Repeating Courses Graduate students may repeat up to two courses in which they earned a grade of D or F. The decision to repeat a course is made between the student and the major professor. Each course may be repeated only once. Both the original and repeat grades will be included in the calculation of the cumulative GPA. Credit hours will only be counted once toward meeting degree/program requirements. To re-enroll in a class in order to improve an earned grade, the student must complete a Permission to Repeat a Gradu ate Course Form and submit it to the Director of Graduate Studies to co -sign. Final approval rests with the Dean of the Graduate School. Academic Probation Upon completion of 3 or more credit hours of graduate coursework, if a student's cumulative GPA fal ls below 3.00, the student will be placed on academic probation. The student will be allowed to continue graduate study in subsequent semesters if each semester's grade point average is 3.00 or greater. Upon achieving a cumulative GPA of 3.00, the student will be removed from probationary status. Dismissal If a student is placed on academic probation , the degree status will be terminated by the Dean of the Graduate School if the student's semester GPA falls below 3.00 at the end of the next semester. When the particular circumstances are deemed to justify continuation, and upon recommendation by the Director of Graduate Studies and approval of the Dean of the Graduate School, a student on probation whose semester G PA is below 3.00 may be allowed to continue on a semester- by-semester basis. Other terms of dismissal are failure to pass the comprehensive or final examination (requests for second attempts must be sent to the Director of Graduate Studies and reviewed by the AAPC for approval/disapproval), failure to meet CEM program time limit requirements, violations of academic honesty , research misconduct, or unsatisfactory progress. Unsatisfactory progress includes two consecutive grade reports of \"No Progress\" (NP) in 500 Thesis or 600 Dissertation. Dismissal of a graduate student from the CEM program is accomplished by written notice to the student, with a copy to the Graduate School. In those cases where the department's requirements for continuation are more stringent than university requirements for graduate programs, the Dean of the Graduate School will evaluate the student's record to determine whether the student is eligible to apply for a change of status and register in another a rea of study. Registration for courses in the CEM program by students dismissed from the program will not be permitted, except by written authorization from the Director of Graduate Studies . 36 ACADEMIC HONE STY Expectations Plagiarism or academic cheating of any description (during closed -book examinations, thesis/dissertation preparation, manuscript preparation, and research) is considered a serious breach in academic honesty, as is falsification of data. Violations Violations of academic honesty by a studen t should be reported in writing to the Director of Graduate Studies. The student will be notified, in writing, of the charge(s) by the committee within 7 days of the latter receiving the charge. The Director of Graduate Studies will investigate the circums tances of the alleged offense by meeting with both the accuser and the accused and either impose a penalty or dismiss the charges within 30 working days of student notification of the charge (unless an extension requested by the student is approved). Penal ties Appropriate penalties for violation of academic honesty are probation, suspension, or dismissal. The exact penalty will depend on the circumstances under which the violation was committed. Appeals After a hearing by a CEM appeals panel, a student diss atisfied with the decision rendered may appeal the decision to the Appeals Committee of the Graduate Council in the manner detailed in Hilltopics under Student Code of Conduct CONFLICTS OF INTERE ST Students are discouraged from providing food and refreshments for participating faculty during comprehensive examinations and thesis/dissertation defenses. The student being examined is not expected or required to do this, and the action may place examining faculty in an uncomfortable situation. Following a successful examination or thesis/dissertation defense, it is then acceptable for participating faculty to be invited to a celebration. Students are not required to provide food and refreshments at regular committee meetings, and providing anything beyond inexpensive snacks and coffee or soft drinks is strongly discouraged. Students should not give gifts to faculty in the CEM program, including their own major professor, before they have completed all requirement s for their degree . Although gift giving is common in other cultures, this practice can be misinterpreted as creating or contributing to a conflict of interest, and is therefore strongly discouraged. CONF LICT RESOLUTION If a conflict develops between a student and the student's major professor, both parties should work to correct the interfering issues. Conflicts may include issues of disruptive conduct and insubordination. If the conflict cannot be resolved, the professo r or student should request mediation through the Director of Graduate Studies. If all efforts fail and the professor decides to stop serving as the student's major professor, that professor documents in writing all the problems and the attempts to make corrections and provides a copy to the student, the student's committee members, and the Director of Graduate Studies. Conversely, students may similarly request changes. Under either scenario, to remain in the program, the student must provide to the Director of Graduate Studies a written explanation and request to formally visit with other program faculty (as in laboratory rotations) or to associate formally with another faculty member (who must provide written agreement). The Director of Graduate Studies will notify the student, the major professor, and the student's advising committee of their decision. The CEM program is not responsible for replacing any stipend and tuition support provided by the first faculty mentor, and it is possible that sti pend and tuition support for the student may be lost. 37 GRIEVANCES AND APPEALS PROCEDU RES Graduate students and faculty should first try to resolve any grievances through informal discussions. If a satisfactory resolution is not met, the stud ent should file a grievance in writing to the Director of Graduate Studies. If applicable, any person accused in the grievance must be notified, in writing, by the Director of Graduate Studies within 7 days of receiving the written allegation. The student must present details of the grievance in person and provide documentation of the issue. The Director of Graduate Studies will work with the student to appoint a three -member panel composed of faculty who are not involved in the dispute. The panel will rend er a decision within 30 working days of receiving the grievance, unless an extension requested by any of the parties involved is approved. If the student is not satisfied with the decision of the panel, further appeals may be made to the Graduate Council Appeals Committee by contacting the Office of the Assistant Dean of the Graduate School at gradsch ool@utk.edu . The Assistant Dean will work with the student and the Chair of the Appeals Committee to process the appeal as outlined in the Graduate Council Appeal Procedure . There are three types of appeals that may come before the Graduate Council Appeals Committee: 1) students with grievances concerning the interpretation of and adherence to university, college, and department policies and procedures as they apply to graduate education; 2) students with grievances concerning grades; and 3) students with grievances concerning academic penalties imposed for academic and/or research misconduct. Academic misconduct is a violation of the UT Student Code of Conduct . Allegations of academic misconduct are handled as described in the Hilltopics student handbook under Student Code of Conduct . Allegations of research misconduct are managed through UT's Division of Research Integrity & Assurance . Students with grievances related to race, sex, color, religion, national origin, a ge, disability or veteran status should file a formal complaint with the Office of Equity and Diversity , 1840 Melrose Avenue. For all other problems students may encounter related to their graduate studies that they feel cannot be addressed by or to their major professor and committee, students are strongly encouraged to seek guidance from the Director of Graduate Studies. Undergraduate students who wish to appeal a grade in a graduate course should follow the procedures outlined in the Undergraduate Catalog . No appeal may be filed later than 90 days after the final grade has been issued 38 STUDENT RESOURCES CEM Website Applications and Admissions Graduate School Admissions SLATE Application Steps Funding Costs and Funding Opportunities Financial Aid and Scholarships GSS Student Travel and Support Awards Graduate School Graduate School Main Website o Graduate School Graduation Deadlines o Graduate School Forms Graduate Student Senate o GSS Student Travel and Support Awards Theses/Dissertation Theses and Dissertation Help Current Coordinator of Student Services at the Graduate School is Abby Sherman thesis@utk.edu The Coordinator of Student Services is available to assist in many areas: to show students resources for research approval and understanding of copyright to demonstrate how to use iThenticate to validate the work to outline the approval process to ensure that theses and dissertations conform to the formatting requirements of the University of Tennessee to provide guidance in submitting the work to TRACE to explain the policies around the public availability of theses and dissertations Research Support and Resources Resources for your research.
