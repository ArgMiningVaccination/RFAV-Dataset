Are you looking for a integrative medicine provider? A holistic primary care doctor can treat you, your spouse, and children all at the same center. Imagine how much time that would save you and your family from a hectic work and school week? You can't put a price on convenience. At its core, holistic medicine focuses on person-centered care; the patient as a whole person (1). On the other hand, modern medicine examines and treats specific sick parts. Holistic primary care providers are certified medical practitioners who provide health treatment to people of all ages. Let's examine how a holistic primary care physician may be right for your entire family. Holistic Primary Care Doctor Conventional doctors always urge their patients to eat healthy and exercise. Although, the basis of conventional medicine is treating chronic conditions and disease with prescription drugs. At our premier [integrative medicine center](https://centrespringmd.com/), our licensed team combines conventional medical practices (Western medicine) with holistic treatments (Eastern medicine). Also known as alternative or functional medicine, integrative practices truly combine the best of both worlds. Natural remedies and supplements from herbs and plants, combined with therapies and lifestyle changes are the bases of natural medicine. Holistic care and western medicine date back millennia and have proven to be effective (2). In your initial consultation, your holistic doctor will look at your diet, emotional wellness, exercise, lifestyle habits, and stress factors. A holistic primary care physician links various elements of the body together (emotional, physical, mental, spiritual). In other words, integrative doctors look at the social, psychological, and physical factors of your daily life.
