Preparations of Rotavirus Vaccine Rotavirus vaccines are live-virus vaccines. RV5 and RV1 are currently licensed for use in infants in the United States. Indications for Rotavirus Vaccine The rotavirus vaccine is a routine childhood vaccination (see [CDC: Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule by Age](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html)). Contraindications and Precautions for Rotavirus Vaccine Contraindications for rotavirus are A severe allergic reaction (eg, [anaphylaxis](/professional/immunology-allergic-disorders/allergic,-autoimmune,-and-other-hypersensitivity-disorders/anaphylaxis) [Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening, IgE-mediated allergic reaction that occurs in previously sensitized people when they are reexposed to the sensitizing antigen.

The dosing for the 2 vaccines is slightly different: RV5 is given orally in 3 doses, one dose at age 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months. RV1 is given orally in 2 doses, one dose at age 2 months and 4 months. If any dose in the series is either RV5 or unknown, default to a 3-dose series. If the first dose of rotavirus vaccine is inadvertently given at age 15 weeks, the remaining doses should be given at the routinely recommended intervals. Rotavirus vaccine should not be given after age 8 months 0 days, even if the series is incomplete. Adverse Effects of Rotavirus Vaccine Adverse effects are rare. Infants may become irritable or have mild temporary diarrhea or vomiting. There is a very small risk of bowel intussusception with the rotavirus vaccine. Intussusception usually occurs within a week after the first or second dose. Surgery may be required. More Information The following English-language resources may be useful.
