Unfortunately, that might be happening if you're not using an eco-friendly tea kettle. Once you [pick out the best reusable tea bags](https://earthfriendlytips.com/the-best-reusable-tea-bags-for-a-zero-waste-cup-of-tea/) so you can safely [avoid the plastic hidden in some conventional tea bags](https://earthfriendlytips.com/plastic-in-tea-bags/), then make sure you select the best non-toxic tea kettle so your hot tea is as safe and healthy as possible. Why Is it Important to Use an Eco-Friendly Tea Kettle? Depending on the materials your old kettle is made from, it might not just be ruining the flavor of your tea. It might also be negatively impacting your health! Just like some of the old cookware in your kitchen, your tea kettle might contain toxic substances like PFAs, PFOA, PTFE, lead, and cadmium. When you heat water in your kettle, these chemicals break down and leach toxins into your brews. Related: [17 Must-Have Items You Need for a More Sustainable Kitchen](https://earthfriendlytips.com/best-eco-friendly-kitchen-products-for-a-sustainable-kitchen/) This is just one reason why it's so important to protect yourself and your family by using [the best non-toxic cookware](https://earthfriendlytips.com/the-best-non-toxic-cookware-for-healthier-eating/) for your meals, as well as [the best non-toxic baking sheets](https://earthfriendlytips.com/the-best-non-toxic-baking-sheets/) and the [top eco-friendly muffin pans](https://earthfriendlytips.com/the-best-non-toxic-muffin-pan-to-eliminate-toxins/) for your treats. Types of Tea Kettles to Avoid Could your tea kettle affect your health over time? Depending on the type of kettle you have, it might be. Here are the five types of tea kettles you definitely want to avoid and why: Plastic Plastic kettles are incredibly toxic and should be avoided at all costs. We already know that plastics that contain Bisphenol A (BPA) can leach hormone-disrupting chemicals that are linked to diabetes, high blood pressure, infertility, and obesity. Unfortunately, researchers are also beginning to discover that even non-BPA plastics that are touted as safer BPA replacements (like BPS and BPF) have the same chemicals that can cause the same issues. Related: [How to Safely and Effectively Freeze Food Without Plastic](https://earthfriendlytips.com/how-to-freeze-food-without-plastic/) The harmful chemicals in BPA can leach into food and drink when they're simply stored in a container. However, when they're heated in the container, these chemicals start to leach up to 55x times faster! Don't forget, this also includes those \"hidden\" plastic components that might touch water, such as plastic lids, spouts, fill gauges, and hinges. This is why we should [always attempt to remove as much plastic from our lives as possible](https://earthfriendlytips.com/alternatives-to-plastic-for-plastic-free-july/) \u2014 especially any plastic that touches our food. We can protect our children with [the best plastic-free baby bottles](https://earthfriendlytips.com/best-non-toxic-and-plastic-free-baby-bottles/), and we can protect everyone in our family with [the best eco-friendly and plastic-free food storage containers](https://earthfriendlytips.com/the-best-plastic-free-and-eco-friendly-food-storage-containers/). Copper Copper kettles that are lined with stainless steel are completely safe. However, bare copper can make you sick. Your body is typically pretty good at filtering out excess copper. But an old, corroded copper kettle can leach a lot of chemicals, and you could get copper poisoning if you use it daily. Too much copper causes stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, and damage to the liver and kidneys. Aluminum Aluminum is another metal that leaches into boiling water. Like copper, our bodies do a pretty good job of filtering out any excess aluminum we consume. However, anyone with impaired kidney function is at risk of accumulating too much aluminum in their bodies. Increased amounts of aluminum have been linked to dementia. This is another reason why a lot of people are ditching traditional deodorants that might contain aluminum and [making the switch to a more effective natural deodorant](https://earthfriendlytips.com/best-natural-deodorant/). Color-Glazed Color-glazed tea kettles (including cast iron kettles) might look pretty, but they're hiding a dangerous secret. Companies often use lead and cadmium to color and seal the glaze. While any color might be toxic, shades of red, orange, and dark yellow are the ones that most often contain lead and cadmium. Related: [Could Your Saucepans Be Secretly Poisoning Your Family?](https://earthfriendlytips.com/enjoy-safer-meals-with-the-best-non-toxic-saucepan/) Exposure to even small amounts of lead can damage the brain and cause other health issues. Unfortunately, color-glazed tea kettles aren't the only things that could be hiding lead. Studies have also found lead in [numerous store-bought face paints](https://earthfriendlytips.com/how-to-make-homemade-natural-face-paint/) and [the needles of artificial Christmas trees](https://earthfriendlytips.com/real-vs-artificial-whats-the-most-eco-friendly-christmas-tree/). Exposed Heating Elements If you're shopping for an electric kettle, you want to make sure it has a sealed heating element for two reasons. First, many exposed heating coils contain a high percentage of nickel, which leaches into boiling water. If you're allergic to nickel (and around 10-20% of people are), this can cause an itchy rash and other unpleasant symptoms. Second, boiling calcium-rich hard water can leave behind a white, chalky substance known as limescale. While limescale isn't toxic, it can ruin the taste of your tea. If you ever notice your tea tastes bitter or salty, that's because of limescale.

Electric Tea Kettles vs. Stove Top Tea Kettles Tea drinkers will have endless debates on whether electric or stovetop kettles make a tastier cup of tea.

Some suggest it takes the same amount of energy to heat the same amount of water on both a stove top kettle and an electric kettle. At the same time, there will be some energy wasted around the bottom of the kettle \u2014 especially if the kettle is smaller than the burner of the stovetop.
