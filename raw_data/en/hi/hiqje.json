It is a right for every person who needs it, desires it, and can benefit from it. A continuous process which ex tends from childhood through adulth ood, it is designed to develop work attitudes, saleable skills, and usable knowledge for employment and business ownership. Technical education also includes awareness and exploration of career choices and specialized tra ining. There are vocational impli cations in all education, but technical education is best characterized by its purposes and methods. One purpose is to provide economic benefit to the learner by facilitating preparation for employment or business ownersh ip. Another purpose is to provide e conomic benefit to the community and the state by increasing productivity. Since people spend the larger part of their lives at some form of work, there could be no nobler goal than to provide an opportunity for individua ls to develop the knowledge, skills , and attitudes necessary to secure personally satisfying and socially useful careers that lead to personal economic gain and economic benefits to society as a whole. Vision Georgia Piedmont Technical College is the prem ier institution for technical and a dult education with a global commitment to personal, professional, and community transformation. Mission Statement Georgia Piedmont Technical College, a unit of the Technical College System of Georgia, promotes a student - centered environment for lifelon g learning and development, encompassing academic and technical education for employment in a global community. Technical Education Guarantee In collaboration with the Technical College System of Georgia and other techni cal colleges in the state, Georgia Piedmont Technical College has established curriculum standards with direct involvement of business and industry. These standards serve as the industry -validated specifications which allow Georgia's 22 technical colleges to provide a Technical Education Gu arantee. The Technical Education Guarantee states that: \"If a graduate from a standard program and his/her employer finds that the graduate is deficient in one or more competencies as defined in the standards, the technic al college will retrain the employe e at no instructional cost to the employee or the employer.\" This Technical Education Guarantee applies to any Georgia Piedmont Technical College graduate who is employed in the field of his/her training and is in effect for a period of two years after gr aduation. Georgia Piedmont Technical College graduates or their employers who see a need to inquire or to file a claim under this Guarantee should submit to the Office of the Vice President of Academic Affairs a Georgia Piedmont Technical College 2019-20 College Catalog Page | 16 written r equest citing the graduate's name, student identification number, program of study, and dates of attendance along with a description of the deficiency. The Office of the Vice President of Academic Affairs will review the claim and take appropriate action. History of Georgia Piedmont Techni cal College Georgia Piedmont Technical College was established in 1961 as DeKalb Technical Institute. It was organized initially in cooperation with the Vocational Division of the State Department of Education as a divisi on of the total educational program operated by the DeKalb County Board of Education. The College enrolled its first class of 18 students in Electronics Technology in 1961. At that time, it was housed in temporary quarters while the DeKalb Campus facility was under construction. The facility at 495 North Indian Creek Drive, Clarkston, Georgia, consisting of four buildings totaling 170,000 square feet of floor space, was occupied on October 14, 1963. DeKalb Technical Institute operated as a branch and campu s of DeKalb College (subsequently changed to Georgia Perimeter College; currently Georgia State University) from 1972 to 1986, and as the postsecondary unit of DeKalb County School System until June 30, 1996. On July 1, 1996, DeKalb Tech began operating as a unit of the Technical College System of Georgia. Construction of the Newton Campus was completed August of 1997. This campus location consists of approximately 68,000 square feet of instructional space on 67 acres in the Covington/Newton County Industri al Park. In 2000, DeKalb Technical Institute's name was officially changed to DeKalb Technical College. To more accurately and appropriately reflect the College's multi -county service region, the name again officially changed October 2011, to Georgia Pie dmont Technical College. Established to serve a multi -county area east of Atlanta, Georgia Piedmont is one of a statewide network of area postsecondary technical colleges and now offers programs and services in numerous other locations throughout DeKalb, Newton, and Rockdale counties.

Appli cants who meet the minimum high GPA requirements for their program of study will not be required to test in o rder to gain admittance to GPTC. Georgia Piedmont Technical College will focus on high school grade point averages (GPA) without the need for test scores. The minimum high school GPA requirements are as follows: Degree -seeking students: If a student has a high school GPA of 2.5 or higher, Accuplacer is not needed If a student has a high school GPA of 2.0 -2.49, Accuplacer is not needed, but a learn ing support class will be needed Diploma -seeking students: If a student has a high school GPA of 2.3 or highe r, Accuplacer is not needed If a student has a high school GPA of 2.0 -2.29 Accuplacer is not needed, but a learning support class will be needed Once normal operations resume, testing will be available to students who need guidance on coursework that is a ppropriate for their skill level.

Transcripts: Also, GPTC h as made adjustments to the requirement for official high school or high school equivalency (GED) transcripts for admission for those applicants who wish to begin this summer or fall 2020 semester. In the interim, students may submit unofficial high school and GED transcripts or a copy of their high school diplomas until the college resumes normal business operat ions. Once the college resumes normal operations, the student must submit official transcripts later and it is the responsibility of the student to obtain the official copies.

The HOPE Grant program provides assistance to Georgia residents pursuing certif icates and diplomas and the HOPE Scholarship Georgia Piedmont Technical College 2019-20 College Catalog Page | 50 provid es assistance for students in degree programs of study. The Georgia Student Finance Commission (GSFC) is the state agency that administers the HOPE scholarship and grant programs. Below are some of the highlights of the grant and scholarship programs. For detailed information, please visit their website at www.gsfc.org. Students are able to track their eligibility and usage of HOPE funds by logging into MyGAFutures at www.gafutu res.org . HOPE Grant The HOPE grant is available to Georgia residents in certificate or diploma programs of study who are U.S. citizens or eligible non -citizens who also meet residency requirements. If a student was a resident of Georgia at the time of hi s or her high school graduation, home study program completion, or successful GED test, that student must also meet the residency requirement for twelve (12) consecutive months immediate ly prior to the first day of classes of the school term/semester for w hich the HOPE grant is sought.

The HOPE program currently pay s $7 6 per semester hour toward the cost of tuition only at Georgia Piedmont Technical College. Th e current rate of tuition is $100 per semester hour. Below is an example to illustrate. Example : A student enrolls in 10 semester hours in a diploma program o f study and is eligible for the HOPE grant based on residency requirements. The HOPE grant will pay $650.00. The student is responsible for paying the difference between the actual charg es and the amount paid by the HOPE program. $100 x 10 semester hours = $1000 .00 (tuition charged by GPTC). $76 x 10 = $76 0 (this is the amount that will be paid by HOPE). $1000 - $760 = $240 (The stu dent is responsible for the $240 + $359 in fees, for a total of $59 9). If the student is receiving other types of financial a id assistance (for example, the Pell grant), in excess of the $ 240 and fees, those funds may be applied to lower or eliminate the balance. Students must have at least a 2.0 GPA at two checkpoints (30/60 semester hours) to remain eligible. Students who do not have a 2.0 GPA at the 30 hour checkpoint will lose the grant but may regain it at the 60 hour checkpoint if the student then has a 2.0 GPA or better. There is a solid cap of 63 pai d semester hours. For the term that a student reaches the Paid -Hours li mit of 63 semester hours, the grant will only pay for hours up to the limit. Example: The student has 60 semester hours that have been paid by HOPE at the end of Fall semester. The student registers for 6 hours for Spring semester. The HOPE grant will o nly pay for 3 credit hours. The student is responsible for paying for the other 3 credit hours). Georgia Piedmont Technical College 2019-20 College Catalog Page | 51 ZELL Miller Grant Georgia's Zell Miller Grant is available to Georgia re sidents who are working towards a certificate or diploma. Full-time enrollment is not required and students are not required to graduate from high school with a specific GPA.

Accepting Financial Aid Students have to accept the Terms and Condi tions in regards to all funds awarded. All student aid is automatically awarded based on eligibility and availability of funds. Students who have been awarded Federal Work Study must accept the award in Banner Web prior to accepting a work assignment. Afte r the student completes the login to Banner Web, follow the below steps to first accept the Terms and Conditions. Then accept the Award Offer. Select Student Services and Financial Aid Select Award Information, Current Award Year Select Terms and Conditio ns to accept Select Accept Award Offer to accept, adjust, or decline Financial Aid for Basic Law Enforcement Certification Basic Law Enforcement Certificate operates as a non -term program that uses credit hours, and has its own academic calendar. The stan dard academic year for this program is defined as 30 weeks, and the course runs for 17 weeks totaling 42 credit hours. Since the program is less than 1 academic year, federal aid will be disbursed in 2 disbursements, with the first disbursement being betwe en the first day of classes and week 9, and the second disbursement being after week 9 of the program. If a student is not able to progress in the program, the remaining classes with be no -showed wit h a tuition refund. Since federal aid for a non -term pr ogram is based on the number of weeks in the term, students who are no - showed will only get credit for completing the weeks of the classes they remain registered for, and their federal aid may be red uced, or they may not receive the 2nd disbursement of fed eral aid. Students who only enroll in part of the program will receive federal awards that are based on the number of weeks they are in class for. The formula used for federal aid is formula 4 from t he Department of Education FSA handbook. Satisfactory Ac ademic Progress (SAP) The U.S. Department of Education requires institutions of higher learning to establish standards of satisfactory academic progress for students receiving financial aid. The sati sfactory progress policy must include both a qualitative measure (cumulative GPA) and a quantitative measure (maximum time frame). Students must declare a major and be working toward the completion of that major in order to receive financial aid. Notes: T he SAP policy applies to all students regardless of wheth er he/she has previously received aid. SAP is checked at the end of each semester. Standards for the Title IV students are the same or stricter than non - Title IV students enrolled in the same educati onal program. Georgia Piedmont Technical College 2019-20 College Catalog Page | 55 Qualitative: Students must maintain a cumu lative Grade Point Average (GPA) of at least 2.0. The GPA is computed by the Office of Registration & Records on a scale of 4.0. Successful completion of learning support classes requires a C* or better. Students enrolled in a program of study of more than two academic years must have a GPA of at least a 2.0. Quantitative : Students must successfully complete two -thirds (66.66%) of all hours attempted. Example: Cumulative hours attempted (hours at GPTC as well as any hours transferred in as credit) = 25 25 x 66.66% = 16.65 (must round up to next whole number). In this example, you must successfully complete at least 17 hours to be making satisfactory progress. See unsuccessful grades below. Success ful grades include A, A*, B, B*, C, C*, and D. Unsuccessful grades include D*, F, F*, I, IP, W, W*, WF, WF*, WP, and WP* (see Grading System in catalog). Students must also show a completion rate that will allow the student to complete a program of study in at least 150% of the time it should require (as determine d by the college catalog). For example, a student in a program requiring a total of 50 semester credit hours will receive financial aid up to 75 semester credit hours for that program. Transfer c redits accepted by GPTC will be counted in the maximum timef rame. SAP is calculated at the end of each term. Failure to maintain satisfactory academic progress will result in the loss of financial aid including Pell, state grants and scholarships (HOPE/Z ell), and private student loans. The SAP policy applies to a ll students, regardless of whether they have previously received aid. Warning Students that do not meet the above guidelines will initially be placed on Financial Aid Warning. A student assigned a Warning will be notified by email at their GPTC student e mail account. The student may continue to receive financial aid for one subsequent semester under this status. SAP standards must be met to continue eligibility. Exclusion Students who do not mee t SAP standards under the Warning status at the end of the s ubsequent semester will be placed on Financial Aid Exclusion. Students on Exclusion are not eligible to receive financial aid but may appeal this status. See the Appeals section below. Probation Students who were placed on Financial Aid Exclusion may choo se to appeal the exclusion. If the appeal is approved, the student is placed on Financial Aid Probation status and must be placed on an Academic Plan that will require the student to meet certain terms and conditions as determined an academic advisor. At t he conclusion of each semester that the student is on the academic plan, the student must be meeting the requirements specified in the Academic Plan to continue to be eligible for aid. Once a stud ent is meeting SAP standards, the student is returned to goo d standing and the academic plan is concluded. Special Considerations Affecting SAP Criteria Learning Support Classes Georgia Piedmont Technical College 2019-20 College Catalog Page | 56 Learning support classes are counted in the quantitative measures affecting SAP (both completion rate and 150% maximum timeframe). Succes sful completion of all learning support coursework is required to meet qualitative progress. This is defined as completing all learning support coursework with a grade of A*, B*, or C*. Dropped and Repeat Coursework All coursework taken at Georgia Piedmo nt Technical College will be included in the qualitative and quantitative measures for SAP. This includes courses that are withdrawals or repeated. Courses that are dropped during th e drop/add period or courses in which a student is a no show are not cou nted. Successful grades include A, A*, B, B*, C, C*, and D. Unsuccessful grades include D*, F, F*, W, WP, WF, and WF*. Grades of I or IP are treated as unsuccessful and SAP will be reevaluated once a final grade is posted. Transfer Credits Credits that are transferred from other institutions (including courses taken as a transient) will count in a student quantitative SAP measure (pass rate and 150% maximum timeframe) but will not c ount in the qualitative (GPA measure). Multiple Programs Students who co mplete a program of study and reenroll into a new program will be eligible for a grade of completion reset. The reset will require a manual calculation for students identified as exce eding the 150% threshold. Students will not have to appeal if the manual calculation determines they are eligible. Students may do an appeal and be put on an academic plan if they choose to do so. Effective January 28th, 2019, students will not be eligible for a completion reset, and must submit an appeal when changing programs . Notification The college evaluates SAP at the end of each term after the office of registration and records have calculated GPA's. Student that are placed on warning or exclusion ( either from GPA, pass rate, or maximum timeframe) will be notified via st udent email. Students who will be hitting the 150% cap at the conclusion of the current semester will be given a courtesy reminder midway through the semester so they can begin the ap peal process. Students who are on warning status will be given a courtesy reminder midway through their next semester of enrollment. How to Reestablish Financial Aid Eligibility Students may regain financial aid eligibility after being placed on exclusion by either Meeting the cumulative SAP standards described in this policy in their course of study at a future evaluation (end of semester) Successfully appealing as described in this policy and being placed an academic plan. Appeals Students placed on Fi nancial Aid Exclusion may appeal the denial of financial aid if extenuati ng circumstances are present. A Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal form must be submitted explaining the extenuating circumstances, how these circumstances have changed, and their plan to maintain satisfactory academic progress if the appeal is approved . Supporting documentation is required. Appeals must be submitted to the Financial Aid Office prior to the midpoint of the semester for which students are appealing their exclusion st atus. Financial aid appeals are reviewed by a committee of faculty and staff. Georgia Piedmont Technical College 2019-20 College Catalog Page | 57 Tips for Submitting the SAP Appeal Form 1. Read the SAP Appeal form thoroughly. Incomplete appeal forms will not be accepted. 2. Please explain in detail the extenuating circumstances in your personal statement and be sure to include documentation to suppo rt your statement. An attempt should be made to explain all terms with failing grades or withdrawals since SAP uses cumulative GPA and credit hours. Examples of extenuat ing circumstances include, but are not limited to: Death of a relative Hospitalizatio n of immediate family members Personal injury or illness Unexpected work issues beyond the student's control 3. Once you have completed your appeal and the attached documents, please submit it to the Financial Aid Office. Academic Plan The academic plan cons ists of the following elements: 1. For GPA/Completion rate appeals, a 100% pass rate for each term: Any withdrawals or failing grades will result in termination of a n academic plan. A grade of D in a class that requires a C will not be considered passing. A cumulative 67% completion rate and 2.00 GPA is required for students on a plan for maximum timeframe. 2. Advisement and follow up with the Student Support Services, and/or other on campus services that will ensure students are successful in both following th e academic plan and successfully completing their program of study on time. Each agreement will set the minimum pass rate, GPA, and the offices/services to be included in the student's plan. Appeals for 150% will also have an expiration date for the plan as determined by the advisor based on the program and the student's progress. Failure to meet the terms of the plan will result in the student being placed on financial aid exclusion until he/she meets SAP standards. Process for Those Who Fail to Follow t he Academic Plan or are not Approved for an Academic Plan The decision of the financial aid committee is final ; however if the committee denies an appeal because of lack of documentation, a student will be given one week from the time they are notified to provide follow up documentation and have their appeal re -evaluated by the fin ancial aid director. Students are eligible to appeal again 3 terms after their initial appeal was approved or denied. Example: Student appeals for Fall Semester 2018 and is den ied; student cannot appeal again until Fall Semester 2019. Example 2: Studen t's appeal is approved effective Fall Semester 2018. Student fails to meet the plans requirements at the end of Fall 2018 and the plan is terminated. The student returns to exclus ion status for Spring 2019 , and cannot appeal again until Fall 2019 . All Stud ent Financial Services information is subject to change. Return to Title IV Policy An overpayment occurs when the student receives more aid than he or she was eligible to receive . One kind of overpayment, traditionally called an over award, results from c hanges in the student's aid package; a Georgia Piedmont Technical College 2019-20 College Catalog Page | 58 second occurs when a student withdraws. Title IV funds are awarded with the assumption the student will complete the entire period of enroll ment for which financial aid was intended. Department of Education requires schools participating in the awarding of Title IV funds to calculate the amount of \"earned\" student aid for the semester when a student withdraws completely from all classes comp leting 60% or less of the term. Return to Title IV (R2T4) is the calculation performed by the school to determine eligibility. Once students complete more than 60% of the payment period, students have earned all the assistance he or she was scheduled to re ceive for that period. R2T4 calculation will also determine if there is any f ederal aid students can be awarded after withdrawal. A student who wishes to withdraw from school must notify the school in writing or verbally. Also, students violating academi c requirements will be withdrawn from the program. Students failing to notify school about withdrawal intentions will have 50% of the payment period as withdrawal date unless a later date can be accurately determined based on coursework activity. Coursewor k activity includes submitting assignments, exams, and discussions. Presence in a classroom, whether it be virtual or physical, does not constitute participation for determining coursework activity.

When a student passes such an examination, it is reported to the Office of the Registrar on the Examination Credit Form by the Aca demic Dean. The Registrar will record the course on the student's record showing the course number and title and indicate that it was credited by examination. Inquiries concerning available program exams should be directed to the faculty advisor. Students who pass the exam will have their credits recorded on their transcript. No record is made for students who do not pass program exams. The fee for academic credit by examination is 25% of the cost of tuition for the course. Credit earned by examination is not intended for transfer. Units of Credit The semester hour is the unit of credit representing one hour of class work per week for one semester or its equivalent in other forms of instruction. Two or sometimes three hours of laboratory work are considered as equivalent to one hour of class work. Continuing Ed ucation Unit (CEU) credits are awarded for completion of Continuing Education courses and are subject to the same grading system as academic credit courses. Continuing Education course g rades do not average with regular credit courses in computing grade po int averages. Georgia Piedmont Technical College maintains a permanent record for each participant indicating the course(s), grade(s), and CEU credit(s) earned. Attendance Regular and p unctual attendance at all scheduled classes is an essential aspect of student success. Students will be expected to complete all work required by the instructor as described in each course syllabus. Students who stop participating in class, but do not formally withdraw, may receive a grade of F and face financial aid reperc ussions in upcoming semesters. Students will not be withdrawn by an instructor for attendance; however, all instructors will keep records of graded assignments and student participation in course activities. The completion dates of these activities may be used to determine a student's last date of participation in the event a student withdraws, stops attending, or receives an F in a course.

Grading System / Grade Symbols The grading system and grade symbols used at Georgia Piedmont Technical College are as follows: Georgia Piedmont Technical College 2019-20 College Catalog Page | 68 A 90 - 100 Excellent B 80 -- 89 Good C 70 -- 79 Satisfactory - the minimum grade required for certain courses, as specified in the Catalog* D 60 -- 69 Needs Improvement - while giving hours credit, will not apply toward the diploma, degree, or certificate in courses requirin g a minimum grade of \"C\" F Below 60 Unsatisfactory WF Withdrawn - Failing Unsatisfactory No credit toward graduation is given for a course in which a grade of \"F\" or \"WF\" was received. The following symbols are used in the cases indicated, but will n ot be included in the determination of the grade point average: W Withdrawn Indicates that a student initiated a withdrawal before the mid -point and was permitted to withdraw from the course without penalty. I Incomplete Indicates that a student has sat isfactorily completed a substantial portion of the course work, but for NON -ACADEMIC reasons beyond his/her control was not able to complete some specific part or amount of the work required (for example, the final examination). An \"I\" not satisfactorily r emoved by the end of the following semester will automatically be c hanged to an \"F.\" The time allowed for completing work may be extended to a maximum of twelve months when circumstances prevent the student from completing the work during the following sem ester. To obtain an \"I\" the student and their instructor must compl ete the Petition for \"I\" which will include a description of the work to be completed and the completion date. Copies of the Petition for \"I\" will be filed with the instructor and with the appropriate School Dean. IP In Progress Indicates that a course continues beyond the end of the semester (Continuing Education courses only). S Satisfactory Indicates that a non -graded course was satisfactorily completed (Continuing Education courses onl y). U Unsatisfactory Indicates a non -graded course was not satisfactorily completed (Continuing Education courses only). AC Articulated Credit Indicates credit earned through articulation. AU Audit Indicates that a course was audited. No credit is given . EX Credit by Exam Indicates a credit by school examination. TR Transfer Indicates that transfer credit was awarded for a course at another college. A grade followed by an asterisk (*) indicates a Learning Support course.

Georgia Piedmont Technical College 2019-20 College Catalog Page | 69 Grades of IP, S, and U are awarded to Continuing Education courses only. Work Ethics Evaluation Georgia Piedmont Technical College (GPTC) instructs and evaluates students on work eth ics in designated courses in each of the a cademic schools, excluding Arts and Sciences. Ten work ethics traits have been identified and defined as essential for student success: appearance, attitude, character, communication, cooperation, organizational sk ills, productivity, respect, and teamwork. Grade Point Average Determination of academic standing is generally based upon a grade point average (GPA) that appears on the student's permanent record. This average is computed by multiplying the credit hours a ssigned a course by the grade points earne d. The sum of grade points divided by the total number of credit hours attempted at Georgia Piedmont Technical College produces the grade point average. Credits earned in other institutions, credit by examination, and other courses where symbols are assign ed are not used in calculating the cumulative GPA. All courses and grades earned at Georgia Piedmont Tech are calculated into a student's cumulative grade point average (GPA). Grade: A B C D F WF Points: 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 Forfeiture of Credit By registering for a course for which the student has already received credit at Georgia Piedmont Technical College, a student forfeits the previous credit in that course for graduation purposes. The student's official grade in the course will be th e one earned on repetition. Although both grades remain on the record and are part of the cumulative grade point average, only the final attempt will be calculated for the purpose of graduation requirements. Full-time Student Status A degree, diploma, or certificate student who is registered for at least 12 -semester credit hours is considered to be a full - time student. CEU credit hours are not included in the student load calculation. Any course load in excess of eighteen (18 ) semest er hours must be approved by the appropriate campus academic dean prior to registration. Course load requirements vary from one program to another. Enrolling for fewer hours for a particular semester may affect eligibility for financial aid or vete rans' be nefits and enrollment certification. It is the student's responsibility to consult with appropriate school officials regarding this matter. A student who is placed on academic probation cannot register for more than 12 -semester credit hours until the prob ationary status has been removed. Continuous Enrollment To remain continuously enrolled, a student must not have an absence of more than (3) consecutive semesters of enrollment at Georgia Piedmont Technical College. Georgia Piedmont Technical College 2019-20 College Catalog Page | 70 Working Students Students who wo rk while attending Georgia Piedmont Technical College are reminded that carrying a normal academic load is a full -time job. Some students may be able to work part -time and still do satisfactory course work. It is recommended that no full -time students work more th an 20 hours a week. Students who find it necessary to work more than this should not try to carry a normal academic load. Students needing financial assistance should contact the Office of Student Financial Services about the various opportunities for fina ncial aid.
