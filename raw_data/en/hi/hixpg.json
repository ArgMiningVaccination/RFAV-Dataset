Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge Study Protocol 2 TABLE OF CONTENTS Importance of Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge Consult ................................ ................................ ................................ ... 17 20 Mi'kmaq Significance OF MI'KMAQ ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE Since time immemorial, the Mi'kmaq have relied on the natural world for many aspects of their daily life. There were very few resources which the Mi'kmaq did not utilize in some way. Mi'kmaq subsistence and spiritual practices encompassed the natural world in a manner distinct from that of the non -Native world. The Mi'kmaq d id not view themselves as distinct from the natura l world, but rather saw themselves as merely one life being within a natural world of many life beings. This Mi'kmaq spiritual belief or \"World View\" is the foundation for their interdependence and interconnection with all aspects of the natural world. Today, the Mi'kmaq continue to use and occupy Mi 'kma'ki based on their Mi'kmaq World View . They maintain a deep and profound relationship with their traditional lands, waters and resources. This longstanding relationship has given rise to Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge (MEK) - a body of knowledge that the Mi'kmaq maintain regarding the natural environment. Specifically, MEK is unique information that Mi'kmaq possess in regards to the lands, waters, plants and various animal species . Most simply, MEK is about the interaction that Mi'kmaq have had, and continue to have, with the environment which has provided them with an understa nding that may not be found in W estern science knowledge systems. MEK is a cumulative body of knowledge that is passed on from generation to generation, E lder to child and is dynamic. MEK draws upon the ever changing natural world - as ecological knowledge changes over time, and new experiences bring forward ne w understa ndings regarding the E arth's ecology , the Mi'kmaq will continue to learn, grow and share, just as they have done for over ten thousand years. Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge Study Protocol 4 PREFACE In 2007, the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq Chiefs (t he Assembly) developed the Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge Study Protocol (MEK SP) for the purpose of providing guidance in the development of MEK Studies . The Assembly recognized the significance of MEK Studies with respect to land and water development and their potential effects on Mi'kmaq R ights, and identified the need to ensure that MEK Studie s were being developed in a professional and accountable manner. This need was furthered when in 2010 Canada endorsed the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples which, at Article 31, states: Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and tradi tional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions. Since the release of the first edition of the MEKSP, t he Assembly has conducted a review to identify successful practices and to further determine if changes were neces sary to ensure successful application. This undertaking identified that the MEKS P is viewed as a key document to be utilized in the development of MEK Studie s. The second edition of the MEKSP builds upon earlier successes and provides clarity on issues identified as requiring further comment. Specifically, the second edition now includes language that indicat es activities required when developing a M i'kmaq Ecological Knowledge Study (MEKS) , clarif ies the expectation of the Assembly, and increase s accountability through specific requirements for proponents/companies to provide . This 2nd Edition also address es the issue of \"Consultation\", the Duty to Co nsult and the role that MEK Studies contribute to the \"Consultation Process\". 5 Through the development of the MEKS Protocol 2nd Edition, it is the Assembly's hope that MEK Studie s will continue to be developed in a professional and accountable manner, recognizing that the Mi'kmaq have a special role to play in the land, water, air and resource development in N ova Scotia . It is important to be mindful that t he Mi'kmaq Nation asserts right s to their cultural heritag e, traditional knowledge and/ or traditional cultural expressions . Information that is free ly and voluntarily shared , with the prior informed consent of Mi'kmaw individuals, governments or organizations is , and shall remain , the sole and exclusive property of the individual, government or organization. Any unauthorized use or disclosure shall be subject to prosecution pursuant to Canada's protection of intellectual property legislation in force from time to time. Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge Study Protocol 6 METHO DOLOGY The Methodology relied upon within the Review consisted of three components: MEK Studies Review - A review of all of the MEK Studie s that have been completed to identify how they are being conducted, their format, and their content. This analysis provided insight into MEK Studies concurrence with the guidelines of the MEK SP; MEK SP Quantitative Data Review - A Review of seven National and International First Nation Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) Best Practices. This analysis identified whether the ME KSP and Best Practices are consistent in their approach on TEK issues. This analysis also identified issues that have been addressed by other First Nations and should be addressed by the MEK SP in th e future. MEK SP Qualitative Data Review - Twenty -two i nterviews with Government Officials, MEKS Consultants, K -klusuaqn Negotiation Office (K MKNO ) Staff, Mi'kmaq Organizations, Proponents and Mi'kmaq community leaders to gather opinions, conce rns and relevant information regarding present practices for MEK Studies and the MEK SP. This analysis identified practices and other significant issues that should be addressed in the revision of the MEKS P. 7 DEFINITIONS 2.1 Within this Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge Study Protocol: a) \"Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq Chiefs \" (the Assembly ) - the institution of governance for the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia. b) \"Consultant\" - a company, group or individual that has primary responsibility to undertake and de liver a Mi'kmaq Ecological Study wit hin the P rovince of Nova Scotia; the Consultant can include any individual (e.g. interviewer, researcher, fieldworker, etc.) contracted or employed to undertake work for the Study. c) \"Consultation \" - any Crown and Mi'kmaq government1 discussion, negotiation or meeting used to justify Crown infringement of Aboriginal and Treaty R ights. d) \"Government\" - any federal, provincial or municipal department, agent or representative. e) \"Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge \" (MEK) - the collection of wisdom and experiences that the Mi'kmaq have with all components of the natural environment ; the interrelationships that exist between all life forms from a unique historical, cultural and spiritual perspective. f) \"Mi'k maq Ecological Knowledge Study Protocol\" (MEKSP) - a working document, developed by the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq Chiefs, to identify the essential components of a Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge Study. g) \"Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge Study\" (MEKS) - all components related to the planning, collection, analysis, reporti ng and distribution of Mi'kmaq traditional ecological k nowledge in Nova Scotia. h) \"MEK Report\" - a document that co nsiders MEK data pursuant to a Project defined in this MEKS Protocol. 1 Mi'kmaq Government is intended to mean any of the thirteen Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq Bands in whole or in part.

Kwilmu' kw Maw -klusuaqn Negotiations Office INTRODUCTION In 2007, t he Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq Chiefs (Assembly) developed the 1st Edition of the Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge Study Protocol (MEKS P) to provide guidance to proponents and consultants undertaking MEK Studies in Nova Scotia. The Assembly recognized the relevance of ecological knowledge when co nsidering project development in Nova Scotia, particularly regarding the possible effects of resource and land development on Mi'kmaw Aboriginal and Treaty Rights and Aboriginal Title. The MEKS P has suc cessfully provided guidance to Government, P roponents and Consultants in the development of MEK Studies to date . Through experience it was realized that a s the data contained in MEK Studies i s relied upon by the Assembly, Government and P roponents when making decisions, ensuring that the Studies are careful ly prepared and contain all relevant data has been crucial. This 2nd edition of the MEKS P builds on the 1st edition and incorporates recommendations for improvement and observations from Mi'kmaq, Consultants, Proponents and G overnment on how to clarify t he MEKS process to ensure that the high est quality and most relevant information is provided to decision makers and the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia. MEK Studies provide insight on the Mi'kmaw re lationship to lands, waters and/ or resources and provide s essential information that must be considered by the Crown and P roponents when identifying the potential adverse effects of projects and developments. These studies are not \"C onsultation\"2 and the production of a MEKS cannot be used as proo f that the Crown fulfilled its Duty to C onsult. It is the expectation of the Assembly that given the importance of MEK to the Mi'kmaq and the significance of the data in MEK Studi es, the stipulations of the MEKS P will be strictly adhered to by those developing and u ndertaking MEK Studies. 2 See page 3 for further details regarding Duty to Consult. Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge Study Protocol 10 This MEKS P shall be read to complement any Mi'kmaw community, regional or provincial processes pertaining to MEK data collection and, in the event of a conflict between said processes and this Protocol, this Protocol shall take precedence and prevail. MISSION STATEMENT In recogniti on of the uniqueness of MEK and its importance to the Mi'kmaq Nation, this MEKS P has been developed to ensure that MEK Studies are conducted in a manner that recognizes respects and upholds Mi'kmaw cul tural practices, values and understandings, including the Mi'kmaw language. The Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia recognize the significance of their traditional knowledge as a means of gaining a holistic environmental understanding. This MEKS P will ensure that ME K Studies are completed in a transparent and accountable process, all the while protecting the integrity of traditional Mi'kmaq knowledge . CONSULTATION AND THE DUTY TO CONSULT The Duty to Consult In 2004, the Supreme Court of Canada, in the Haida Nation case, affirmed the Crown has a duty to consult with Aboriginal people s. 3 The Court stated the duty to consult arises when the Crown has knowledge, whether real or constructive, of the potential existence of an Aboriginal Right or T itle and contem plates conduct that might adversely affect it.4 Further, when the Crown undertakes Consultation they must do so with the \" intention of substantially addressing [Aboriginal] concerns as they are raised through a meaningful process of consultation .\"5 3 Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests) , 2004 SCC 73, [2004] 3 SCR 511. , at note 1, para 42. 11 Thus, the Duty to C onsult must be exercised by th e Crown in a meaningful manner which upholds the honour of the Crown and respects the Constitution Act Section 35 R ights asserted by an Aboriginal group. Consultation may require an accommodation to address Abori ginal concerns, depending on the circumstances and the potential adverse effects of Crown decisi ons or actions on the asserted R ights or T itle of the Aboriginal group.6 Consultation Terms of Reference In 2010, the Terms of Reference for a Mi'kmaq -Nova Scotia -Canada Consultation Process was signed and established a formal process for whenever Canada or Nova Scotia wishes to conduct Consultation on the record, and with prejudice, with one or more Mi'kmaq Bands in Nova Scotia. Within the consultation p roce ss discussions have , and will continue to , occur between the Assembly and Provincial and Federal Government s, to discuss proposed Crown activities. In these discussions, MEK Studies may be considered and referenced, primarily as data sources to identify M i'kmaw activities or knowledge involving lands, water s and natural resources. A MEKS provides an exceptional snapshot of understanding the Mi'kmaq , past and current , relationship to an area of land and/or water and it can be a vital source of data for consider ation . However, within the \"Consultation\" dialogue, when a MEK S is considered a relevant source of data , its p reparation and acceptance is not considered \"Consultation\" within itself, nor is it deemed to fulfill the Duty to C onsult owed by the Crown to the Mi'kmaq. A MEK S and related discussions, communications or documentation can not be used or interpreted as \"C onsultation\" for purposes of justifying an infringement on section 35 Mi'kmaq A boriginal or Treaty R ights that exist , or may be found to exist in the future. 6 Haida, supra, note 1 at para 47. Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge Study Protocol 12 BEFORE YOU BEGIN A MEK S As one begins to undertake a MEK S, a number of activities must be completed by the Consultant prior to gathering and documenting ecological knowledge. These activities are the required first steps for all MEK Studies. When developing a MEK S proposal, the P roponent should pay particular attention to the following principles in rel ation to the scoping of its MEK S: The MEK S should be completed in an appro priate time manner that is consistent with the E nvironmental Assessment (E A) approval process f or the Project. Proponents and C onsultants should be cognizant that MEK Studies that are completed early in the EA approval process will decrease the likelihood of unforeseen project delays. A new MEKS is required where a previous MEK S for the same study area is more than five years old. If a MEKS has been completed for t he same study area, and is less than five years old, the existing MEK S may be considered. However, the Assembly may consider the following factors, but not limited to; o the type of project proposed and its scope; and, o the amount and quality of MEK data previously documented. If a MEK S was previously comp leted covering the same study area, a new MEK S may incorporate the historical component of the original Study with the c onsent in writing from the initial C onsultant. Letter to the Mi'kmaq MEK is of significant importance and i ts documentation requires transparency and accountability. To ensure the Assembly and N ova Scotia Mi'kmaw communities are aware that a MEKS is being undertaken - and to ensure that those who are developing the MEKS have the required capacity and skills to do so - Letters of I ntent shall be sent to the Assembly ( via the Kwil mu'kw Ma w- klusuaqn Negotiation Office) and to the NS Mi'kmaw communities wher e the Consultant in tends to gather MEK. The letters shall be sent as e arly as possible in the process and be copied to the Union of Nova Scotia Indians and the Confederacy of Ma inland Mi'kmaq. The letter shall contain the following information: Proponent Project Information: Information regarding the Project Proponent ; and Specific details regarding the nature of the proposed Project, such as the location of project, type of project, and any other relevant details. 13 Consultant Information: Name and credentials of principal researcher; name an d title of all other personnel who will take part in researching and preparing the MEKS ; Background information regarding the Consultant, which shall include any prior experience in addressing Mi'kmaw issues; Consultant capacity regarding Mi'kmaw community engagement skills; Consultant capacity regarding Mi'kmaw cultural knowledge and Mi'kmaw language skills; and, Contact information (mail ing address, fax, e -mail, telephone and contact person). MEKS Information: Purpose and use of the MEK S; Process for gathering MEK (i.e. interviews, site visits, etc.); Anti cipated process for identifying Participants who will be interviewed; Details of the information to be provided to any Consultants (i.e. maps, photos, reports, etc.); Mi'kmaw communities where MEK will be gathered; and Expected time frame for developing the MEKS . Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge Study Protocol 14 GATHERING MI'KMAW ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE Beginning the process of gathering MEK, the Consultant shall adhere to the following procedures. Engaging a Mi'kmaw Community The C onsultant shall work with the Mi'kmaw communities to gather MEK. All Consultants, their employees and contractors , shall conduct themselves and their activities in a manner respectful of Mi'kmaw cultural norms and th e values of the community. C onsultants should remember that their activities are to be based on developing a positive relationship with the community, re cognizing that the ability to document MEK within a community is a privilege. Trust building with community leaders and Participants should be the aspiration of the Consultant. Consultants should be mindful that Participants are sharing their traditional knowledge and personal/cultural experiences , much of which is often considered sacred . Adequate Resources It is recommended that the Consultant ensure that sufficient time, funding and resources are available to aid the collection of sufficient MEK data. Scope of Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge While collecting MEK data the C onsultant shall remember that MEK is held by individuals who have acquired the information through personal experience and through Mi'kmaw cultural practices and traditions, which are distinct from Western science practices. Therefore, gathering MEK demands an approach which respects both the knowledge gathered and the manner in which it was transmitted and gained . 15 \"The concept of s ignificance in the MEKS is distinct from the concept of significance under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act or the Nova Scotia Environmental Assessment Regulations....potential project impacts on Mi'kmaq should be used by regulators to inform their determination of the significance of the environmental effects of the Project.\" Confederacy of Mainland Mi'kmaq Type of Data - historic and current The Mi'kmaq have acquired knowledge thro ugh subsistence and spiritual practices which have continued to take place over a long period of time. T his information is relevant to a MEK S and where applicable, historic and current data s hall be included . MEK is drawn from a wide range of traditi onal and cultural activities. When gathering MEK, the Consultant shall include information on all relevant Mi'kmaw harvesting and foraging practices , and data on species /resources exploited. In addition, loc ational data shall be included listing all Mi'kmaw use and occupation sites, burial sites, hunting areas, fishing areas, spiritual sites, plant gathering areas and significant cultural areas. Because both historic and current data is relevant to the MEK S, information gathered shall take into account both first and second -hand knowledge as provided by the Participant . Both historic and current (gen erally defined as \"within living memory\") data are relevant. Within living memory can include information transmitted to the informant by a parent or a grandparent. The knowledge passed down is relevant and, if credibl e, is to be included in the MEKS . Historical research employs a combination of gathering oral history from Participants and written sources. It may document MEK of an area going back hundreds of years. As with any data, the written and oral history sources must be assessed for credibility bef ore being included in the MEK S. Study Area When determi ning the study area for the MEK S, the C onsultant shall take into account the nature of Mi'kmaw harvesting practices and the use and occupation which may extend over an area larger than the proposed P roject footprint. For example, the project footprint may be limited to \u00bd hectare, but the harvesting activities which form part of the relevant MEK data , could take place, adjacent to , and including the project footprint. To ensure that MEK data is recorded in a manner consistent with t he nature of the activity, the C onsultant shall document MEK data in its entirety, which may require establishing a buffer and study area beyond the project footprint, allowing for a broader ec ological understanding. Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge Study Protocol 16 \"...Interviews allowed the team to develop a collection of data that reflected the most recent Mi'kmaq traditional use in this area, as well as historic accounts.\" Membertou Geomatics Solutions Adequacy of Data It is important that the C onsultant ensure s that an adequate amount of data is collected within the proposed study area , and that such MEK data is credi ble and reliable. This will depend on a number of factors which can include , but may not be limited , to the identification of Participants who are relied upon for MEK, the geographic area where the proposed project is located, the extant historical data, and the current state of the geographic area (e.g. have the river s been dammed, has there been a recent forest fire , etc. ). Interviews The C onsultant must confirm that the Participants interviewed are recognized by their Mi'kmaw community and acknowledged by the ir community as a credible provider of MEK data. When gathering data , individual interviews with Participants are the most appropriate mechanism for gathering MEK and are required in the work plan. Group gatherings can also be utilized , but must be done in conjunction with one-on-one interviews as they will not be satisfactory on their own. Target Group When gathering MEK, the Consultant must ensure that the individual(s) selected to be interviewed have specific knowledge of the st udy area or have conducted land or water -based use activities in the proposed study area. Consultant s are reminded that different types of MEK are held by different me mbers of the Mi'kmaq Nation, varying by gender, age and lifestyle. Consultants must demonstrate that efforts were made to gather a variety of data from different Participants . Cultural Appropriateness When und ertaking interviews, C onsultant s must possess sufficient understanding of the Mi'kmaq way of life to ensur ing that interviews are conducted in a manner respectful of Mi'kmaq culture, traditions, and practices. The interviews will include: language options , which may be in either Mi'kmaq or English; having the interview occur in the Participant's place of preference; respect for the Mi'kmaw spiritual and cultural beliefs; and, an appropriate gift, item, etc. as a thank you for participation and information . 17 Interview Materials Consultants shall ensure that he or she has the appropriate materials required to document the MEK that is provided when conducting an interview . This shall include maps (either digital or paper copies ) to provide a cl ear delineation of the project and buffer area s. If using a laptop for maps, ensure the batteries are charged and that the adapter is included in the field pack carried to all interviews. If using paper maps, ensure the field pack includes pens, markers, over lays, and paper to record all data provided by the knowledge holder. While it is advisable to record all interviews to document the information provided, audio or visual recording may only be done with the prior , informed consent of the Participant . Informed Consent - Education and Agreement Before any data collection takes place, the Consultant must first secure the free, informed consent of the Participant . Two key elements to informed consent are education and agreement . The C onsultant shall ensure all Participants are provided with detai led project information and MEK S information to allow them to make an informed decision whether or not to participate in the Study. Agreement - Consultants must ensure that the Mi'kmaq Partic ipant's decision to participat e in the MEKS is voluntary and that he/ she clearly understands the use of the MEK. The Participant must signify that she/ he understands that : their participation is voluntary; he/she can end the interview or withdraw her /his participation at any time; she/ he does not have to answer any question with which she/ he is not comfortable; if desired, his/her identity will be kept confidential; and, that the MEK provided will be included in the MEKS , which may become public record. A written Consent and Release Form explaining and identifying the above Agreement factors must be signed and completed. Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge Study Protocol 18 Education - Consultants must provide the relevant information to ensure that the Participants demonstrate a clear understanding of: the type of Project p roposed - its location, and goals (purpose of it ' development ); the scope and purpose of the MEKS ; the use of the MEK S data in the applicable approval process( es); and, that the MEKS is not C onsultation for the purpose of justifying an infring ement of Aboriginal and Treaty R ights. Site Visits The MEKS C onsultant shall undertak e a site visit( s) to the proposed project area with an appropriate Participant (s) who has knowledge or familiarity with the project area. If no Participants familiar with the area can be identified, this must be disclosed in the MEK S Report, together with a description of all efforts made to identify individuals with knowledge or familiarity with the proposed P roject & study area. The purpose of the site visit is to gather ecological knowledge regarding the availability of resources and the importance of the land to Mi'kmaq. Any MEK identified during the site visit may correspond t o previous MEK provided in the interview process or may be newly acquired MEK. During the site visit it i s the responsibility of the C onsultant to ensure the safety of the Participant and the C onsultant themselves . The Consultant shall ensure all safety leg islation, regulations, and policies are complied with by all members of the party during the site visit. Historical Research The MEKS must include a historical review of the Mi'kmaw relationship to the proposed study and surrounding area. The historical d ata shall include information obtained from primary and secondary7 written sources and can include Mi'kmaq oral history. Historical and ecological data that is broad in scope, not specific to the MEKS area, and of little r elevance to an understanding of the Mi'kmaw relationship to the study area is not to be included in the MEK S. 7 Primary sources are original, first -hand information sources including diaries, letters, news film foota ge, official records, etc . Secondary sources interpret and analyze primary sources and can include textbooks, commentaries, magazine articles, encyclopedias, etc. 19 Mi'kmaq hunters, fishers and plant gatherers, have a relationship intrinsic to their natural environment. Knowledge, passed down from Elder to Child, provides a unique und erstanding of any Project Study Area. Kwilmu'kw Maw -klusuaqn Negotiation Office For a MEK S to provide a holistic understanding of the Mi'kmaw connection to a specific place, information must focus on the P roject area. All historical information ga thered must be relevant to the P roject area and its close surrounding area. If no primary or secondary records , relevant to MEK , in the study area are uncovered during the documentary review, this informatio n is to be disclosed in the MEKS R eport together with a description of the research undertaken and a list of the sources consulted. NOTE : In the event that the C onsultant is unable to collect an adequate amount of MEK data , as provided for in the MEKS P, the C onsultant must include the reasons or potential cause s for such circumstances in the final MEKS . Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge Study Protocol 20 WRITING THE MEK S In the written format of the MEKS, the C onsultant shall ensure that the following components are included and addressed in the following manner: GIS Data GIS software program shall be used to ensure that the presentation of the MEK data allows an easy compre hension . When identifying a reas and resources for Mi'kmaq use and significance (including but not limited to spiritual sites, fishing sites, etc. ) careful attention must be paid to the protection and privacy of hunting, fishing and gathering sites and areas, as provided by the Participant . Where a resource site location is considered sacred and/or is seen by the Participant or Mi'kmaq community as a site should be kept p rivate, the data should be presented in general terms and not site specific. Historical Data The C onsultant shall ensure that the historical information included within the MEKS is specific to the Project area , or the immediate surrounding area , and will lead to a greater understanding of MEK. Consultation and Intellectual Property Rights An explicit statement must be included in the MEK S that states that the Study is not intended to be interpreted as \"C onsultation\" for the purpose of justifying an infringement on the existing Aboriginal and Treaty R ights of the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia. The MEK S must include a provision acknowledging that the MEK contained within the Study is subject to the intellectual pr operty rights of the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia , which they individually and collectively hold . Mi'kmaq Significance Species Analysis To ensure that the MEK gathered is presented in a manner allowing a clear understanding of the significance of wildlife, fish and pla nt species to the Mi'kmaq, the C onsultant must include an analysis of any species , identified by the Participants and other research, to be present, harvested , or near the study area. Such an analysis shall include an adequate amount of bas e line information to acknowledge the significance of the species to the Mi'kmaq and the potential availability of th ese species within the project and immediate surrounding area. 21 When determining the significan ce of the MEK data, the C onsultant must take into consideration both western scientific ecological perspectives and Mi'kmaw ecological practices and perspectives. Confidential Data The C onsultant must give due regard to MEK data that is of a private or sacred nature, as indicated by a Participant or the Mi'kmaw community and use their discretion to ensure that such data is referenced in a manner that considers the integrity and privacy of the Mi'kmaq . Mitigation and Recommendations Where a MEK S identifies adverse effects on Mi'kmaw acti vities an d/or the exercise of Section 35 Aboriginal and Treaty R ights, arising from proposed project activities, the final MEK S shall contain recommendations for the proponent to initiate a dialogue with the Assembly to further discuss. Archaeological Site Protect ion Archaeological data can provide significant understanding to Mi'kmaq past relationship to the land . As such, this information may at times be included in a MEK S. Archaeological data is important to the Mi'kmaq and the C onsultant must take the appropriate steps to ensure that any archaeological site is not represented in a manner that c ould compromise the site or its artefacts. When archaeological information , location especially, is included in t he MEKS, reference s must be made in general terms. As well, when an archaeological site is referenced on a GIS map, its representation must also be presented as to not reveal the specific location of the site. Mi'kmaq Ecological Knowledge Study Protocol 22 THE FINAL MEK STUDY CONSULTANT'S ROLE When a MEKS is completed, the Consultant must provide a copy to KMKNO, with correspondence indicating that it is completed and being submitted for the Assembly' s consideration. The final MEK S must be provided within 14 days of of completion . KMKNO ROLE In accordance with the goals o f transparency and accountability, it is important that all MEK Studies that are developed are reviewed by K MKNO, on behalf of the Assembly, as a means to ensure the consistency with the MEKS P requirements. Upon receipt of the MEKS , KMKNO shall review the document in accordance w ith the requirements of the MEKS P. Within 20 cale ndar days of receipt of the MEK S, KMKNO shall advise the C onsultant in writing wheth er or not the MEK S meets requirements and if ne cessary, indicate where th e MEK S must be amended8. MEK Study Distribution Upon completion of a MEK S, it is important that all relevant Mi'kmaw pa rties receive a copy of the Study in a timely manner, to permit an understanding of its findings. The MEKS must be provided to the Mi'km aw communities that provided the MEK data and/or those that are in the immediate vicinity of the P roject area; along with the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq Chiefs and any relevant Mi'kmaq organization . The MEK S can be provided in either a digital format by e -mail , or in a hard copy format de livered by postal mail. The MEK S sent to a Mi'kmaw community or communities shall be directed to the attention of the Chief and Council of the respective community or communities. Upon request, any Participant who provided MEK data shall be provided with either a digita l or hard copy of the final MEKS . 8 Checklist of what is required can be found in the Appendices. 23 CLOSING The development of the MEKSP was an important milestone for the Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq. Since the release of the 1st Edition, we have all learned a gre at deal; but what has not wavered, is the significance of including and respect ing Mi'kmaq cultural practices, values, traditions and identity. The MEKSP has been a catalyst for all involved to be open -minded, transparent and accountable to a process that is receptive to the unique needs of the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia. The goal of the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi' kmaq Chiefs is that as time passes, and as relationships evolve, the MEKSP will enable us to share who we are, what teachings have been passed do wn from our ancestors , and how we can help shape Nova Scotia 's future , together.
