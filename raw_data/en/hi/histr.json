As such, we prize the graduate student who can combine curiosity, strong capabilities, and a mind drawn to the highestchallenges of history or economics or neural science or the interdisciplinary exploration of socialthought or any other big field. Our bulletin tells faculty, students, and others about our intellectual vision and the programs and people that embody that vision.Our offerings demonstrate that graduate schoolsare the academic nerve center of the contemporaryuniversity. Here, ground-breaking discoveries aremade, ideas (old and new) investigated, and thenext generation of scholars, researchers, thinkers, and faculty educated. New York University has been a pioneer in graduate education. In 1866, it became the second university in the United States to offer an earned doctorate. In 1886, theGraduate School of Arts and Science opened to a wide variety of able students. Today, wehouse 53 programs that offer doctoral and master's degrees and certificates. They balancedisciplinary and interdisciplinary work. We enroll over 4,700 students each year. I hope that we stay true to an experimental and fluid spirit. In order to do so, we call on the abundant creative energies of New York, that greatest of global cities, and of our faculty, which will grow by 25 percent by the end of this decade. Together, faculty and thestudents who choose to work with them are the brains that power our school. So, buoyed by the city and rooted in our faculty, we are happy to share this bulletin with those who care about an intellectual community with the core values of rigorous yetimaginative inquiry, the incessant exploration of ideas, and a commitment to the ethics ofscholarship\u2014freedom of inquiry, mutual respect among teachers and learners. Sincerely, Catharine R. Stimpson Dean, Graduate School of Arts and Science NEW YORK UNIVERSITY BULLETIN 2007-2009 Graduate School of Arts and Science ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE 122 NDAND 123 RDSESSIONS NEW YORK UNIVERSITY WASHINGTON SQUARE, NEW YORK, NEW YORK 10003 WEB SITE: http://gsas.nyu.edu Notice: The policies, requirements, course offerings, schedules, activities, tuition, fees, and calendar of the school and its departments and programs set forth in this bulletin are subject to change without notice at any time at the sole discretionof the administration.

MacCrackenbelieved that universities shouldrespond to the needs of modernity bygiving unprecedented priority toadvanced research and professionaltraining. Guided by MacCracken'svision, New York University becamethe second university in America toaward a Ph.D. on the basis of academicperformance and examination. In addition to the emphasis on excellence in research, MacCracken rec-ognized the urban environment as both source and inspiration for academic life.He believed that the University's bestinterests lay in its interactions with thecity. By the early 1900s, the GraduateSchool had introduced courses con-cerned with major global issues, and thecurriculum reflected movement towardprogressive values. MacCracken's new vision of graduate training attracted ever-growing numbersof young women and men to doctoralprograms. The rst female graduate stu-dents entered the University in 1888.Today, women constitute over half of the4,500 master's and Ph.D. graduate stu-dents enrolled in 53 departments and programs, as well as in a growing num-ber of institutes and interdisciplinaryresearch areas. Mirroring the cultural diversity of New York City, the Graduate School ofArts and Science is an urban, diverse,and internationally focused majorresearch center, with students frommore than 100 countries. The GraduateSchool still honors the ideal expressedby Albert Gallatin, private univer-sity in the public service.\" 6 HISTORY OF THE GRADUATE SCHOOL Washington Square by Fernand Harvey Lungren (c.1890). Private Collection. Photograph courtesy of Hirschl & Adler Galleries, Inc.New York University and New York New York University LibrariesThe striking, 12-story Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, designed by Philip Johnson and Richard Foster, is the flag-ship of an eight-library, 4.9 million-vol-ume system that provides students andfaculty members with access to theworld's scholarship and serves as a centerfor the University community's intellec-tual life. Located on WashingtonSquare, the Bobst Library houses nearly3.7 million volumes, 34 thousand jour-nal subscriptions, and over 5 millionmicroforms and provides access to thou-sands of electronic resources both on siteand to the NYU community around theworld via the Internet. The library isvisited by more than 6,000 users perday, and almost one million books cir-culate annually. Bobst Library offers three specialized reference centers, 28 miles of open-stackshelving, and more than 2,000 seats forstudy. The stacks are open until mid-night. The newly renovated BrineLibrary Commons, located on the twolower levels, provides students withwireless access, hundreds of computerworkstations, three computer class-rooms, group and individual studyspaces, and 24-hour access for study. The Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media, one of the world's largestacademic media centers, has over 100audio and video viewing carrels and 4 media-enhanced classrooms; studentsand researchers use more than 53,000audio and video recordings per year. TheStudio for Digital Projects and Researchoffers a constantly evolving, leading-edge resource for faculty and studentprojects and promotes and supportsaccess to digital resources for teaching,learning, research, and arts events. Bobst Library is also home to signi- cant special collections such as the FalesCollection of English and AmericanLiterature, one of the best collections ofEnglish and American ction in theUnited States. Fales contains the uniqueDowntown Collection, archives docu-menting the downtown New York liter- ary and arts scene from the 1970s to thepresent, focusing on the developmentsof postmodern writing and dance, per-formance art, outsider art, and thedowntown music scene. Bobst Libraryhouses the Tamiment Library, one of thenest collections in the world for schol-arly research in labor history, socialism,anarchism, communism, and Americanradicalism. Tamiment includes theRobert F. Wagner Labor Archives,which holds the Jewish LaborCommittee Archives and the historicalrecords of more than 130 New YorkCity labor organizations. The library supports students throughout all phases of their universitystudy and research, including instruc-tional sessions, term paper clinics, andonline tutorials. Subject specialistlibrarians work directly with students,at the reference centers and by appoint-ment, to assist with specic researchneeds. Digital library services continueto expand, providing students and fac-ulty with library access anywhere anytime, whether on campus or off site. Inaddition to e-journals and other elec-tronic resources, the library offers e-mailreference service, electronic reserves, andstreaming audio services.

Thecity's extraordinary resources enrich boththe academic programs and the experi-ence of living at New York University. Professors whose extracurricular activities include service as editors forpublishing houses and magazines; asadvisers to city government, banks,school systems, and social agencies; andas consultants for museums and indus-trial corporations bring to teaching anexperience of the world and a profes-sional sophistication that are difcult tomatch. Students also, either through course work or in outside activities, tend to beinvolved in the vigorous and varied lifeof the city. Research for term papers inthe humanities and social sciences may take them to such diverse places as theAmerican Museum of Natural History,the Museum of Modern Art, a garmentfactory, a deteriorating neighborhood, ora foreign consulate. Students in science work with their professors on such problems of immedi-ate importance for urban society as thepollution of waterways and the conges-tion of city streets. Business majorsattend seminars in corporation board-rooms and intern as executive assistantsin business and nancial houses. Theschools, courts, hospitals, settlementhouses, theatres, playgrounds, and pris-ons of the greatest city in the worldform a regular part of the educationalscene for students of medicine, dentistry,education, social work, law, business andpublic administration, and the creativeand performing arts. The chief center for undergraduate and graduate study is at WashingtonSquare in Greenwich Village, longfamous for its contributions to the nearts, literature, and drama and its per-sonalized, smaller-scale, European styleof living. New York University itselfmakes a signicant contribution to thecreative activity of the Village throughthe high concentration of faculty andstudents who reside within a few blocksof the University. University apartment buildings pro- vide housing for nearly 2,000 membersof the faculty and administration, andUniversity student residence hallsaccommodate over 11,500 men andwomen. Many more faculty and studentsreside in private housing in the area.Academic CalendarGRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE 2007-2009 ACADEMIC YEAR 2007-2008 Fall Term September 2007 3 Monday University holiday: Labor Day4 T uesday First day of classes 14 Friday Final dissertations due in the Ofce of Academic and Student Life forSeptember 2007 degrees October 2007 1 Monday Applications for Graduate School of Arts and Science Foreign LanguageProciency Examination due in theOfce of Academic and Student Life 5 Friday Graduation application deadline via TorchTone, 212-995-4747, for January2008 degrees 8 Monday No classes scheduled November 2007 2 Friday Graduate School of Arts and Science Foreign Language Prociency Examination 21 W ednesday (classes meet on a Monday schedule) Legislative day*22 Thursday-24 Satur day Thanksgiving recess December 2007 7 Friday Preliminary dissertations due in the Ofce of Academic and Student Life forJanuary 2008 degrees 11 T uesday (classes meet on a Thursday schedule) Legislative day 12 W ednesday Last day of classes13 Thursday Reading day14 Friday Fall semester examination period begins21 Friday Fall semester examination period ends 22 Satur day Winter recess begins *All Monday classes will meet on Wednesday, November 21.

Topics include Pan-Africanism,the Harlem Renaissance, black migra-tion, black feminism, and black cul-tural studies. Ethnography and the Global City G11.2102 4 points. Introduces students to the theory andpractice of ethnographic research incontemporary urban settings. Particularemphasis is directed toward examiningtheoretical and methodological issuesassociated with the study of complex\"global\" cities. How, for example, dowe frame and investigate questions ofcultural identity, social inequality, andpolitical agency in cities that are nodalpoints in the transnational circulationof capital, commodities, labor, and cul-tural forms?Seminar: Visual Studies G11.2303 4 points.This seminar explores how the trope of\"blackness\" is mediated over a range ofideas, images, and expressions of socialdifference in cinema. Screenings andreadings examine how popular cinema,ranging from black independence tothe commercial \"mainstream,\" deals notonly with issues of race and color, buthow these issues intersect, and interact,with other social categories of differ-ence(s) mainly related to class, sexualorientation, and gender but includingmany others. The course explores suchissues as seeing beyond the \"black-white binary\" model of race relations;gendered perspectives on \"blackness\"and black women's lmmaking; thecultural and political dynamic betweenblackness and gayness on the screen;and issues of class, caste, and \"colorism\"in cinema. The course also examines anumber of ideas and theories related tothe material, including passing, doubleconsciousness, unmarked difference,and creolization.Colloquium in Women's History: Race and Reproduction G11.2600 4 points.From the policies, priorities, and per-versions of slave owners to the prona-talist campaigns of colonial Africa, tothe family planning programs that area hallmark of liberalism and develop-ment in the postcolonial world, and,most recently, to the promotion ofassisted reproduction technologiesamong western elites, race and repro-duction have always been among theprimary axes on which large-scalepolitical, economic, cultural, social,and intellectual processes are cong-ured. Because reproduction connectsthe intimate experiences of individualsto larger historical structures and forcesand because reproduction is such a fun-damental (if varied) biological andsocial experience, this topic in particu-lar lends itself to comparative work.This course explores issues in the his-tory of race and reproduction, focusingprimarily (though not exclusively) onAmerican and African contexts. Thiscross-cultural breadth helps students toconsider the relationship between bio-logical experiences (which are oftenportrayed as universal) and sociocultu-ral context. Through readings, students 13 AFRICANA STUDIESProgram and RequirementsAdmission: Students are expected to have a broad background in blackstudies, African studies, or Caribbeanstudies. Prociency in at least one for-eign language (African or European) isdesired but not required. MASTER OF ARTS The master's degree in Africana studiescan be pursued full time or part time.Full-time students are required to sat-isfactorily complete 32 points of grad-uate course work distributed as follows:semester 1) the required ProseminarBlack History and Culture plus twoadditional Africana studies courses;semester 2) either three Africana stud-ies courses, or two Africana studiescourses and one Directed Readingscourse; and semester 3) either two 4-point Directed Readings courses, one4-point Directed Readings course plusone other 4-point course, or two other4-point courses, in addition to a mas-ter's thesis. To qualify for the M.A. degree, stu- dents must either write a thesis or takea comprehensive examination at theconclusion of their nal semester ofwork. Internships in institutions andorganizations in New York City may be taken for 4 points. Students areassigned advisers to assist them inarranging courses for their area ofstudy and in the supervision of theirthesis or comprehensive exam. JOINT MASTER OF ARTS PRO- GRAM IN AFRICANA STUDIESAND ECONOMICS The goal of this program is to help students develop social science skillsthat can be used to better society inthe public and private spheres, speci-cally in the support of African andAfrican diaspora communities. Theprogram provides students with asocial science background in economicsand Africana studies. Students analyzedevelopment economics, politics, andother social sciences and gain a broaderperspective of how these disciplinesapply to Africa and the African dias-pora. Students can earn a Master ofArts in this program by taking 32points over three terms. The curricu-lum consists of required courses fromboth economics and Africana studies,as well as elective courses from othersocial science disciplines, such as poli-tics, or from other schools at NYU, such as the Wagner Graduate School ofPublic Service. The nal requirement iseither a master's thesis or a specialproject associated with an internshipconducted at a site involving the appli-cation of social science knowledge andprinciples to African affairs. While thisprogram specically targets Africanstudents, others with interest in thisinterdisciplinary connection betweenAfricana studies and economics areencouraged to apply. CONCENTRATION IN MUSEUM STUDIES This concentration requires the com- pletion of 36 points (16 in museumstudies), a master's thesis, and a fullsummer internship in a museum orcultural institution. Those planning towork as museum professionals withcollections in museums, historic housesand sites, and government agenciesrelating to black history and culture,literature, and politics are encouragedto apply. For more information, contactthe Program in Africana Studies, 212-992-9650, or the Program in MuseumStudies, 212-998-8080.14 AFRICANA STUDIESconsider how different disciplinary orientations (social history, medicalanthropology, feminist theory, art his-tory, etc.) approach women's historyboth methodologically, theoretically,and in terms of narrative and analyticstrategies. Exodus: The Politics of Black Liberation G11.2610 4 points. Seminar on the struggle for culturaland political autonomy in the UnitedStates among African Americans, primarily in the urban North, whorejected the church-based nonviolentCivil Rights Movement. Focuses on the \"Negro\" or African side of what W . E. B. DuBois called Afro-American\"double-consciousness.\" To the Mountaintop: The Movement for Civil RightsG11.2612 4 points. Seminar on the struggle to end racialsegregation and discrimination in theformer slave societies of the UnitedStates. Focuses on the \"American\" sideof what W . E. B. DuBois called theAfro-American \"double-consciousness.\" Steal Away: African Atlantic Religious Culture G11.2614 4 points. This seminar is a comparative study ofAfrican Atlantic religious celebration,primarily in the context of Afro-Christianity, but touching on Islam,\"Voodoo,\" Santer\u00eda, and Candombl\u00e9.Although designed for graduate students,this seminar is also open to seniors with aGPA of 3.65 or better, who may chooseto take the seminar on a pass-fail basis. Topics in Postcoloniality G11.2645 4 points.Explores and interrogates the notion ofthe \"postcolonial\" in relation to certainkey aspects of contemporary Africanand/or Caribbean societies, cultures,and histories. Individual areas of inves-tigation include theories of Africa andAfricans, Caribbean literary theory,modern postcolonial theory and itsapplicability and relevance to recentdevelopments in the African continentand its diaspora, new identity forma-tions, African and Caribbean culturalstudies, nationalism and the nation-state, creolization, and theories ofresistance.Haiti in the Caribbean Context G11.2652 4 points. Francophone communities in theCaribbean are as different from eachother as they are different from theirAnglophone and Hispanophone neigh-bors. This course concentrates on therepresentation of Haiti, arguably themost distinctive Caribbean country inthe region and the second independentrepublic in the hemisphere, in theimagination of Caribbean writers. It isas much an introduction to key issues inHaitian politics, history, and culture asan investigation of the impact of Haition the rest of the hemisphere. The latteraspect of the course is examinedthrough a number of texts that react toHaiti and are drawn from literature forthe most part but also from history andanthropology in the 20th century. Afro-Latino Culture and History G11.2802 4 points. Latinos are now called \"the nation'slargest minority,\" outpacing AfricanAmericans and thereby signaling abenchmark in the changing meaning ofwhat it means to be American. In publicaccounts of this dramatic shift, Latinosare commonly counterposed againstAfrican Americans in mutually exclu-sionary terms: either you are Hispanic oryou are black. Little if any attention goesto the huge though uncounted blackLatino population, the group that tsneatly in neither the Hispanic nor theblack category and yet may play a deci-sive role in the emerging cultural cong-urations and political alignments of ourtimes. This course examines the pro-found sociological and cultural implica-tions of the growing Afro-Latinopresence in light of recent theorizing onrace and diasporas. After an overview ofthe historical background of African-descendant peoples in the Spanish-speak-ing Americas, the course then traces thelongstanding social experience of blackLatinos in the United States. Along witha discussion of migration patterns andcommunity formations, there is a focuson narrative accounts of Afro-Latino lifeand on the traditions of cultural expres-sion; special attention goes to Afro-Latino poetry and to the rich history ofAfro-Latino music through the genera-tions, from rumba, mambo, and Cubopto salsa, Latin soul, and hip-hop. Finally,the course turns to the possible theoreti-cal and political consequences of thisincreasingly self-conscious transnationalidentity formation.African Literature and Culture G11.2803 4 points. Deals with ethnicity, identity, and thenation-state in African literature.Analyzes the connections between sto-rytelling and inclusion in history andshows that African attempts to narrateidentity, religious belonging, andnationalism are pursuits of historicalrecognition. Crucially, explores thesedenitions and their power to bringAfricans into relation with historicity. Locations of Africa G11.2964 4 points.Focuses on specic regions and peopleson the African continent, providing in-depth historical, anthropological, soci-ological, and aesthetic considerations oftheir cultures and forms of socialorganization\u2014as well as how they havebeen constructed, classied, and other-wise misread by Western ethnogra-phers and anthropologists.

It is designed toprepare students for advancedwork and teaching in Americanstudies. Interdisciplinary bydenition, the student's courseof study is arranged with thedirector of the program and thedirector of graduate studies and includes seminars offered in theprogram, in the largerDepartment of Social andCultural Analysis, and The program's afliates include faculty from many ofthese departments. The pro-gram interprets \"American\" in abroad sense to include assess-ments of the historical role ofthe United States in theAmericas and, more generally,in world affairs. Inasmuch as the program has a regionalfocus, special attention is givento studies in urbanism and toNew York in particular, aglobal city that comprises manyworld cultures. The programalso emphasizes the interrela-tion of social formations,including those of race, gender,class, and sexuality, with globalpolitical economies both histor-ical and contemporary. Studentspursue these studies throughmethodological training in his-torical analysis, ethnographicresearch, and critical and cul-tural theory. 41 EAST 11TH STREET, 7TH FLOOR NEW YORK, NY 10003-4602 212-992-9650 WEB SITE: www.nyu.edu/gsas/program/amerstu TProgram and RequirementsAdmission: Admission to graduate studies in the Program in AmericanStudies is based on academic recordsand letters of recommendation. TheGraduate Record Examination (GRE)is required of all students. The basis of the program is multi- disciplinary; therefore it tends to admitexceptional students who are attunedto working across disciplines. MASTER OF ARTS Course of Study: The terminal M.A. program does not lead directly toPh.D. enrollment, though M.A. stu-dents may apply for Ph.D. study alongwith the general Ph.D. applicant poolin any given year. A total of 32 pointsof course credit\u2014at least 24 taken inresidence at NYU\u2014is required for theM.A. degree. M.A. students must com-plete the introductory American stud-ies seminar, a research seminar, andthree other courses taught by core pro-gram faculty, and they must demon-strate reading prociency in a foreignlanguage. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Matriculation: Students may be admitted to the Ph.D. program eitherfollowing M.A. study at NYU or else-where or directly after receipt of thebachelor's degree. In either case, therst semesters of enrollment in the Ph.D. program must conrm students'readiness for doctoral work. Thus, students holding the M.A. uponadmission must ofcially apply tomatriculate for the doctorate after com-pleting 12 points of course work inAmerican studies at NYU; those enter-ing with only a bachelor's degree mustdo so upon completing 32 points ofcourse work. Approval of matriculationis based on students' progress to dateand on recommendations from facultyfamiliar with their work. Degree Requirements: To qualify for the doctorate, a student must satisfac-torily complete graduate studies totaling at least 72 points, with a min-imum of 32 points at the doctoral levelin residence at New York University;pass qualifying examinations; and pre-sent an approved dissertation. Studentswho have completed relevant graduatecourses elsewhere may request thatsuch courses be credited to degreerequirements within the second semes-ter of study. Credits may be earnedthrough courses, independent study,and group study. Course of Study: All students must take the introductory Seminar inAmerican Studies (G13.3301), GroupResearch Seminar (G13.2319), andIndividual Research Seminar(G13.2306). Beyond this, students work with the director of the program,the director of graduate studies, andcommittee advisers to establish theircourse of study; at least 24 points (gen-erally six courses) in addition to thoseentailed by the required seminars mustbe earned in courses offered by the pro-gram's core faculty. The program offersa range of six elds: (1) culture, work,and consumption; (2) identity, citizen-ship, and social formation; (3) media,communications, and expressive cul-ture; (4) social and political theory; (5) science, technology, and society;and (6) urban and community studies. Doctoral students choose to concen- trate their course work in two of theseelds and are examined in each. Underspecial circumstances, elds can beconstructed for students with extraor-dinary interests. If they wish, studentsmay concentrate their work in specicdisciplines, although the chief purposeof the eld structure is to encouragetransdisciplinary study. Foreign Language Requirements: Every matriculant must satisfy the doc-toral foreign language prociencyrequirement. This may be done in oneof three ways: (1) demonstrate pro-ciency at an intermediate level in a sec-ond foreign language as described inthe Degree Requirements section of this 16 AMERICAN STUDIESJennifer Morgan, Associate Professor, Social and Cultural Analysis (AmericanStudies, Africana Studies), History.

This view makesanthropology a complex disci-pline, its theories and methodstranscending the usual bound-aries of natural science, social sci-ence, and the humanities. Cultural anthropologists in the department share a belief thatstudy and research must bermly grounded in rigoroustraining in general social andcultural theory, both in contem-porary writings and in the clas-sics of anthropology andsociology. The faculty alsobelieve that basic ethnographyremains the cornerstone onwhich all cultural anthropologyrests and are concerned with therepresentation of anthropologicalknowledge in writing and lm.There is a commitment to anunderstanding of complex soci-eties that is informed by a com-parative perspective andknowledge of small-scale soci-eties. Recent eld research byfaculty and students has beenconducted in Africa, Australia,Oceania, East Asia, India, theMiddle East, Europe, SouthAmerica, the Caribbean, Mexico,and the United States. converge processes; scienceand health; and urban life. Muchfaculty research focuses on themediation of identities throughpopular and public culturalforms\u2014such as art, television,indigenous media, urban space,regional cultures, and ideologiesof language use\u2014in a variety ofchanging social contexts. Linguistic anthropology focuses on how language is usedto create and maintain the socialrelations and symbolic systemsthat constitute everyday life.Students are encouraged to carryout ethnographic studies of lan-guage use in communities andinstitutions both within and out-side New York City. Archaeologists in the depart- ment are committed to the beliefthat the material remains ofancient societies provide signi-cant insights into the dynamicsof sociocultural evolution. Thedepartment has developed anarchaeology program that focuseson evolution; the of artand archaeology andgender; of foodproduction; class inequality andurbanism; and the developmentand collapse of chieftaincies and early states. A diversity of theo-retical perspectives, includingcultural ecology, political econ-omy, and symbolic archaeology,are represented and encouraged.The geographic scope of facultyresearch includes the Near East,Egypt, South Asia, Europe, andNorth America. The biological anthropologists in the department are involved inresearch on primate socioecology,comparative primate morphol-ogy, molecular primatology, pale-oanthropology, primatepaleontology, and skeletal mor-phology. In addition to these spe-cialist areas, faculty research isunied by a conceptual and intel-lectual foundation in genetics,evolutionary theory, ecology, andbehavior. These are core themesin a common enterprise that canbe referred to as evolutionary pri- matology \u2014the study of human beings and other primates withinan evolutionary context. Facultyresearch is based on a solid foun-dation of traditional approachesand concepts in physical anthro-pology, an appreciation of themultidisciplinarity of the subdis-cipline, and technical and theo-retical prociency in newlyemerging specialty areas. Theresearch and training program department is distinguishedby its unique commitment tointegrating laboratory-based andeld-based research. We havestate-of-the-art laboratories in RUFUS D.

Lynch.Programs and RequirementsAdmission: Admission to graduate study is based on academic records,scholarly recommendations, and scoreson the Graduate Record Examination.The department offers the Master ofArts and Doctor of Philosophy degreeswith specialization in various subdisci-plines. The department offers onestand-alone M.A. program in biologi-cal anthropology (track in humanskeletal biology). In all other cases, theM.A. is awarded as a step in fulllmentof requirements for the Ph.D.Applicants should apply directly to thePh.D. program. They will be formallyadmitted to the Ph.D. program, how-ever, only after the requirements out-lined below have been fullled. MASTER OF ARTS A total of 36 points of course work isrequired for the M.A. degree, 12 of thesebeing in the core courses. All students ineach of the subdisciplines are required totake certain departmental core courses.Each of the subdisciplines also has itsown structured program; students gener-ally take most of their courses withintheir own subdiscipline of specialty. Therequirements for each of the subdisci-plines are described below. Human Skeletal Biology Track: All students must take the followingcourses or their approved equivalents:(1) Departmental Seminar (G14.1000)or Ph.D. Seminar I (G14.3210); (2) Human Osteology (G14.1516); (3) Interpreting Human SkeletalMorphology (G14.1520); and (4) Biological Variation AmongHuman Populations (G14.1517) orHuman Genetics and Biology(G14.339X). In addition, studentsmust take at least one eld training orinternship course. Biological Anthropology: All students in the Ph.D. program must take (1)Departmental Seminar (G14.1000) or analternative course approved by the direc-tor of graduate studies and their M.A.advisory committee; (2) all three of theNew York Consortium (NYCEP) core courses; Anthropology (G14.3218) or anequivalent seminar approved by theirM.A. advisory committee. Archaeological Anthropology: All students must take (1) DepartmentalSeminar (G14.1000); (2) SocialAnthropology Theory and Practice(G14.1010); or an alternative courseapproved by the director of graduatestudies and their M.A. advisory com-mittee; (2) either History of Anthro- pology (G14.1636) or a course in thehistory of archaeology; (3) one archaeol-ogy course focusing on a specic geographic region; (4) one course inarchaeological methods; and (5) a super-vised eld trip experience approved bytheir M.A. advisory committee. Cultural and Linguistic Anthropol- ogy: All students must take (1) Departmental Seminar (G14.1000) oran alternative course approved by thedirector of graduate studies and theirM.A. advisory committee, SocialAnthropology Theory and Practice(G14.1010), History of Anthropology(G14.1636), and Linguistic Anthro-pology (G14.1040) as their corecourses; and (2) at least one Ethno-graphic Traditions course, chosen inconsultation with their M.A. advisorycommittee. On entering the M.A. program, each student is assigned an advisorycommittee consisting of three facultymembers who meet with the studentonce each semester to plan the stu-dent's course work for the followingsemester. During the rst year ofmatriculation, the department evalu-ates M.A. graduate courses taken atother universities, and credit may betransferred within the limits set by theGraduate School of Arts and Science. No later than the middle of the term in which all M.A. course workhas been completed, usually the thirdsemester of full-time course work, thestudent selects an M.A. paper commit-tee, consisting of a supervisor and areader, from among the faculty. Thetopic of the paper is selected in consul-tation with the M.A. paper committee,and this committee must approve theM.A. paper before the master's degreeis awarded. Note: Students in the mas- ter's program may take no more than 8 points in research or reading courses. During the second year of graduate study, students petition to enter thePh.D. program, as described below. Bythe beginning of the third year ofstudy, the M.A. paper must beapproved as pre-Ph.D. quality by theM.A. committee and the petitionaccepted by the full faculty. Studentsfailing to meet this requirement willbe placed on academic probation andmay be dropped from the program. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY All students must formally petition forentry to the Ph.D. program. Thosewishing to transfer credit from a priorM.A. in anthropology do so at the beginning of the second semester inresidence; all others submit the peti-tion at the beginning of the fourthsemester in residence. To petition, astudent must develop a program ofstudy that has been approved by his orher Ph.D. committee, consisting ofthree faculty members in the depart-ment who formally agree to supervisethe student's research. The head of thePh.D. committee is the student's maindissertation adviser. A successful peti-tion consists of a written statementindicating a plan of study and research,formulated in consultation with theproposed Ph.D. committee and thenapproved by the entire departmentalfaculty. Final acceptance is conditionalon successful completion of the mas-ter's course work and master's paper.These course points are then appliedtoward the Ph.D., which requires atotal of 72 points (or up to 86 pointsfor students in the Program in Cultureand Media). On completion of at least 60 points of course work and no later than oneyear after completion of all Ph.D.course requirements, a student musttake the written Ph.D. comprehensiveexaminations. These examinationscover work in three areas of specializa-tion and are evaluated by the student'sPh.D. committee. After completing allPh.D. course work and passing thecomprehensive exam (as well as fulll-ing the GSAS language requirement),the student is eligible for the M.Phil.degree. Completion of these require-ments as well as an oral defense of thedissertation proposal means that thestudent has achieved Ph.D. candidacyand may pursue dissertation research. After completion of the dissertation, the student defends the dissertation at anal oral examination conducted bymembers of the Ph.D. committee andtwo additional scholars. Three membersof the examining committee must befrom the anthropology faculty. LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS The Graduate School requires that allcandidates for the doctorate demon-strate reading prociency in one for-eign language. The language is usuallychosen from Arabic, Chinese, French,German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese,Russian, or Spanish. Petitions to takeother languages should be made to thedirector of graduate studies. Prociencyis demonstrated by a departmentalexam, a GSAS exam, or prior coursework at the intermediate level. 25 ANTHROPOLOGY26 ANTHROPOLOGYStudents at the master's level are not required to demonstrate compe-tence in a foreign language, but thedepartment recommends that suchcompetence be developed. URBAN ANTHROPOLOGY The special area of study in urbananthropology is open to students in thedepartmental curriculum but has nospecic requirements. It emphasizesapplication of anthropological method-ology to the problems of urban societyin the United States and abroad. NewYork City provides excellent trainingconditions for studies of urban life, aswell as access to urban institutions andagencies at the local, state, national,and international levels. CERTIFICATE PROGRAM IN CULTURE AND MEDIA (See the Certicate Program in Culture and Media section of this bulletin for further information.) The Departments of Anthropology and Cinema Studies offer a joint course ofstudy, integrated with Ph.D. work ineither of those departments, leading tothe Advanced Certicate in Culture andMedia. Core faculty are Professor FayeGinsburg, director of the Program inCulture and Media; Assistant and Jonathan Kahana of theDepartment of Cinema Studies. The certicate program provides a focused course of graduate studies inte-grating production with theory andresearch. Training in this program willenable students to pursue the following: 1. Production of work in 16 mm lm and state-of-the-art digital video basedon their own research, resulting in ahalf-hour documentary. 2. Ethnographic research into the uses and meanings of media in a range ofcommunities and cultures. Studentsfrom the program have been doingPh.D. research on the development ofmedia in diverse settings, from theemergence of media in Papua NewGuinea, to circulation of religious mediain Northern Nigeria, to the use ofmedia in linking the Tibetan diaspora. 3. Teaching the history, theory, and production of ethnographic documen-tary and related issues in cinema andmedia studies. 4. A career in media requiring an understanding of anthropology, such asspecialized programming and distribu-tion of ethnographic lm and video,community-based documentary pro- duction, management of ethnographiclm/video libraries and archives, orwork in new media. The program's philosophy takes a broad approach to the relationships betweenculture and media in a number ofdomains including a critical anthropology of cultures through media; thedevelopment of media in indigenous,diaspora, and non-Western communi-ties; the emerging social and culturalformations shaped by new media prac-tices; and the political economy shap-ing the production, distribution, andconsumption of media worldwide. Curriculum: The program requires approximately one additional semesterbeyond the M.A. degree and consists ofan original project and eight courses,two of which may be counted towardthe M.A. degree, two toward the Ph.D.Courses include seminars that criticallyaddress the history and theory ofethnographic lm and issues in cultureand media, production courses in lmand/or video in the lm school, cul-tural theory and the documentary, andelectives on topics such as Third Worldcinema and feminist lm criticism.Students may not take courses in theculture and media program unless theyare pursuing an M.A. or a Ph.D. incinema studies or a Ph.D. in anthro-pology at NYU. Students with priortraining in media may be able to sub-stitute other courses from the extensivecurriculum offered in cinema studies,anthropology, or media production\u2014including other forms such as photog-raphy and new media. Internships: The program also arranges supervised internships forcourse credit, tailored to individualresearch and professional interests.Students work in a variety of program-ming and production positions forinstitutions such as the Margaret MeadFilm Festival, the Museum of theAmerican Indian, the Asia Society, andthe Jewish Museum. The program works closely with the Center for Media, Culture, andHistory (see below). STAND-ALONE MASTER OF ARTS The only stand-alone M.A. that is offered is in the human skeletal biol-ogy track (HSB). This track preparesgraduates to apply the principles andtechniques of skeletal biology andgenetic research in biological anthro- pology to a variety of contexts, includ-ing those in the forensic sciences (e.g.,medical examiner's ofce, coroner'sofce, armed forces, criminal justice,law enforcement, mass disasters). HSBalso provides useful training for stu-dents who are preparing for admissionto doctoral programs in skeletal biol-ogy and human evolution. Prospectivestudents should hold a B.A. or B.S.,preferably with an emphasis in anthro-pology, biology, or the natural sciences. An integral part of this M.A. track is hands-on, semester-long professionalinternships developed according to stu-dent interest. These opportunitiesrange from those in genetics (depart-mental labs and the medical examiner'sofce), osteology and odontology(departmental labs, NYU College ofDentistry, the American Museum ofNatural History, and the medicalexaminer's ofce), and eld recoverytraining (departmental or other eldschools). Ideally, student research proj-ects evolve from these internships intoM.A. theses. Yearly skeletal biologycolloquia bring visiting scientists fortalks and workshops. THE NYCEP PROGRAM New York University participates inthe New York Consortium forEvolutionary Primatology (NYCEP), agraduate training program evolu-tionary primatology CityUniversity of New York, ColumbiaUniversity, the Wildlife ConservationSociety at the Bronx Zoo, and theAmerican Museum of Natural History.The consortium provides an integratedtraining program that allows studentsto take courses, seminars, and intern-ships at any of these institutions givenby more than 40 physical anthropolo-gists, primatologists, and vertebratepaleontologists participating in theprogram. In addition to the departmental requirements, students in biologicalanthropology must take three NYCEPcore courses. These are the foundationalcourses Primate Behavior, Ecology, andConservation; Evolutionary Morphology;and Genetics and Evolutionary Theory.Students also gain practical experiencethrough required internships, wherethey work individually on research proj-ects with NYCEP faculty. Most studentsare provided the opportunity to travelabroad during the summer to conductresearch at active eld sites.27 ANTHROPOLOGYCENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HUMAN ORIGINS The Center for the Study of Human Origins (CSHO) in the Department ofAnthropology at New York Universitywas founded in 2002. Its mission is toenhance and facilitate research in allelds of biological anthropology andarchaeology that are broadly related tothe study of human origins and evolu-tion from a biological and cultural per-spective. CSHO's aim is to foster andsupport multidisciplinary investiga-tions, on the devel-opment of collaborative projects,international eldwork, and state-of-the-art laboratory research. Faculty members associated with the Center currently work on aspects ofprimate and human paleontology,skeletal biology and comparativeanatomy, and the origins ofsymbolism, complex societies, andcity-states. In addition to research, theCenter also aims to promote a greaterunderstanding and appreciation of thestudy of human origins among the aca-demic community and the public atlarge through conferences, workshops,educational programs, and outreachactivities. JOINT PH.D. PROGRAM IN ANTHROPOLOGY ANDFRENCH STUDIES The Department of Anthropology and the Institute of French Studies offer ajoint Ph.D. degree for students inter-ested in the anthropology of France.The degree prepares a student forteaching and research as a Europeanistin departments of anthropology or as acivilization specialist in departments ofFrench. Students must be admitted to both the Department of Anthropology andthe Institute of French Studies. Fluencyin French is required. Students nor-mally begin by completing the M.A.in French studies and petitioning foradmission into the Ph.D. program inanthropology in the fall of the secondyear in residence.

Ethnographic lm has a peculiarand highly contested status withinanthropology, cinema studies, and doc-umentary practice. This seminar situ-ates ethnographic lm within thewider project of the representation ofcultural lives, and especially of\"natives.\" Starting with what areregarded as the rst examples of thegenre, the course examines how theseemerged in a particular intellectualcontext and political economy. It thenconsiders the key works that have dened the genre, and the epistemo-logical and formal innovations associ-ated with them, addressing questionsconcerning social theory, documentary,as well as the institutional structuresthrough which they are funded, dis-tributed, and seen by various audi-ences.

Whileclaims about media in people's lives aremade on a daily basis, surprisingly littleresearch has actually attempted to lookat how media is part of the naturallyoccurring lived realities of people's lives.In the last decade, anthropologists andmedia scholars interested in lm, televi-sion, and video have been turning theirattention increasingly beyond the textand the empiricist notions of audiences(stereotypically associated with theethnography of media), to consider,ethnographically, the complex socialworlds in which media is produced, cir-culated, and consumed, at home andelsewhere. This work theorizes mediastudies from the point of view of cross-cultural ethnographic realities andanthropology from the perspective ofnew spaces of communication focusingon the social, economic, and politicallife of media and how it makes a differ-ence in the daily lives of people as apractice, whether in production, recep-tion, or circulation.

This workshould demonstrate competence inshooting and editing using digital cam-era/audio and Final Cut Pro nonlinearediting systems. Students devote thespring semester to intensive work onthe project, continuing to shoot andedit, presenting work to the class, andcompleting their (approximately 20-minute) ethnographic documentaries.Student work is presented and critiquedduring class sessions, and attendanceand participation in group critiques andlab sessions is mandatory. Studentsshould come into the class with projectideas already well-developed. Studentswho have not completed the workassigned in the rst semester are notallowed to register for the second semes-ter.

The curriculumincludes a broad base of course work in cellular and molecular biology together with specialty classes in concepts andtechniques of structural biology.During their rst year ,students per - form research rotations with faculty at NYU or at an NIH campus. The latter usually is an option during the sum-mers. After exploring all the thesisresearch options available, students select a faculty research supervisor at either the NIH or NYU. Dependingon the thesis research area, students may perform research at either or both institutions and have an advisory committee composed of both NIH and NYU faculty. After meeting allrequirements, students receive theirPh.D. degree from New YorkUniversity. NYU Program (Medical Scientist T raining Program or MSTP): The New York University School of Medicine and the Graduate School of Arts and Science jointly sponsor the Medical Scientist Training Program. The program is designed to prepare individuals for careers as physi-cian-scientists: professionals who areknowledgeable of human biology anddisease by virtue of their medical edu- cation and who are research scientistsby virtue of their basic science educa-tion. These individuals will approachhuman disease and basic biology fromunique perspectives. Their medicalbackgrounds inform and give directionto their basic science, while their sci-ence education informs their approachto observing and understanding humandisease. The program's foundation con-sists of the medical school curriculumleading to the M.D. degree and thegraduate school curriculum usually inone of the programs of the SacklerInstitute of Graduate BiomedicalSciences leading to the Ph.D. degree,with a typical course of study eightyears in duration. Building on this baseare unique activities dedicated to thecombined degree student: weekly basicscience seminars oriented to exploringeach topic' srelation to human biology and disease; post-Grand Rounds dis - cussions linking the clinical aspects ofadisease to its roots in fundamental biology; other experiences providingexamples of the most successful unionsof basic science and medicine; as wellas retreats and social functions. Theprogram is supported by an NIHgrant, the NYU School of Medicine,and the Sackler Institute. In a typical program, the rst 18 to 24 months are devoted to a preclinicalbasic sciences curriculum similar tothat pursued by candidates for theM.D. degree. The student then enters agraduate program in which he or shetakes advanced graduate courses andpursues a research project.

In addition to course require- ments, students engage in apracticum in one of the medicalor environmental organizationsin New York City\u2014for example,the bioethics committees at theNYU Medical Center and associ-ated hospitals, the BellevueClinic for Victims of Torture, theCouncil on the Environment ofNew York City, the Bronx RiverAlliance, or Riverkeeper. Theysubsequently write a master'sessay on the practicum (or, alternatively, expand a courseterm paper). The program welcomes stu- dents at different stages of theireducation or careers, in particular: Recent college graduates who wish to explore bioethics,broadly conceived, before com-mitting themselves to doctoralstudies and/or professionalwork in medical or environ-mental ethics. Physicians, nurses, and health care administrators who wantto go beyond the short, inten-sive courses or certicate pro-grams at NYU and elsewherein the New York metropolitanarea. Medical students during or after completion of medicalschool who hope to serve onhospital bioethics committeesor teach medical ethics aftercompleting their residencies. People in the metropolitan area who want to think moreclearly and systematicallyabout moral issues debated inthe media, legislatures, andother public arenas. Full-time students can com- plete the program in threesemesters\u2014or, in some cases, intwo semesters and a summer ses-sion. Part-time students mayproceed at a slower rate. 5 WASHINGTON PLACE, ROOM 305 NEW YORK, NY Ravesz, Victor Rodwin, W agner Graduate School of Public Service; William Rom, School ofMedicine; Richard Rosner, School of Medicine; Melanie Shulman, School of Medicine; Michael Strevens, Philosophy; Sharon Philosophy; George Biology; School of Social Work; Beth Weitzman, W agner Graduate School of Public Service;Rae Zimmerman, W agner Graduate School of Public Service; Arthur Zitrin, School of Medicine.

The following is a sample of a full- time course plan: Fall Semester Advanced Introduction to Bioethics Contemporary Debates in Environmental Ethics Cultures of Biomedicine Comparative Health Care Systems Spring Semester Advanced Introduction to Ethics Clinical EthicsEnvironmental Values, Policies, and the Law Colloquium on Health, Medicine, Law, and Society Summer Session Practicum and Master's Essay Courses CORE COURSES Advanced Introduction to Bioethics G83.1005 Ruddick and others. 4 points. This course explores a range of con-cepts and principles for framing andaddressing moral questions in bothmedical and environmental practices.Combining these two areas broadensbioethics to include and connect indi-vidual, public, and global health issues.Topics include respect for life andnature; comprehensive concepts ofhealth, disease, and cure; autonomyand rights to life and health care; ethi-cal principles of medical care, research,and environmental \"stewardship\"; pop-ulation and environmental constraintson creating and extending human lives. Contemporary Debates in Environmental Ethics E50.2020 Jamieson and others. 4 points.Environmental philosophy is a largesubject that involves discussions inmetaphysics, philosophy of science, andhistory of philosophy, as well as in suchnormative areas as ethics, aesthetics,and political philosophy. This course isprimarily devoted to these normativeareas. Beginning with some basic con-cepts in value theory, the goal is not toarrive at denite solutions to specicenvironmental problems, but rather to (1) improve the student's ability tothink critically, read closely, and arguewell about environmental issues; (2) introduce the student to somemajor controversies in environmentalphilosophy; and (3) aid the student inarriving at his or her own rational andclear-minded views about the mattersunder discussion. Philosophical Research (Practicum and Master's Essay) G83.3300, 3301 2-6 points. Students work on a practicum, or afli-ation with a medical or environmentalorganization, committee, or project,and a supervised master's essay on themoral issues these groups address andignore (or, alternatively, an extension ofa course term essay).

Environmental Politics E50.2021 Jamieson. 3 points.This seminar is devoted to discussingvarious dimensions of environmentalpolicy, especially as they arise at theintersection of concerns about climateand questions about sustainability.Important themes of the seminar includeresponsibility and equity, the relationsbetween climate change and variability,the complex feedbacks between climateand society, interactions between scienceand policy, and the holistic nature ofglobal governance and regulation. Environmental Values, Policies, and the Law L01.3563 Jamieson. 2 points. Environmental law is the site of con-flicting value perspectives. In additionto concerns about economic growthand quality of life for our contempo-rary compatriots, concerns about futuregenerations, citizens of other countriesand even nonhuman nature gure inour discussions and debates. This seminar focuses on the way these valuequestions emerge in discussion of\"global\" environmental change. Ethics: Selected Topics G83.2285 Murphy, Nagel, Ruddick, Street, Unger,Velleman. 4 points.Seminar on different topics in ethicaltheory and applied ethics, varyingyearly. Some of the following topics (aswell as others of research interest to theinstructor and students) may be con-sidered: concepts of duty, virtue, and right; kinds of moral failure; the moraldistinction between actions and omis-sions; the relation of individual ethicsto group ethics and politics; moralityand the law. Global Health Governance and Management P11.2244 Boufford. 4 points.After discussing denitions of health ininternational agreements and the gen-eral influence of globalization onhealth, this course explores the rolesand responsibility of national healthleadership, primarily ministries ofhealth, in assuring the health of theirpopulations and the different strategiesand variable capacity of national gov-ernments in developed, developing,and transition counties. The coursethen explores in some depth the role,functions, and effectiveness of globalorganizations affecting health in theUnited Nations, NGO and businesssectors, as well as multilateral andbilateral donors and how they interactwith each other and with national lead-ership. Finally, the course looks atemerging instruments for global healthgovernance, how they operate, andtheir effectiveness for promoting healthaction at the country level. Health Law L13.3525 S.

Programs and RequirementsAdmission: In addition to the general Graduate School of Arts and Sciencerequirements for admission, applicantsare expected to have an average of B orbetter in the sciences and to have com-pleted the equivalent of an undergradu-ate major in biology. Admission tograduate study is based on academicrecords, recommendations, assessmentsof the applicant's scientic potential,and scores on the Graduate RecordExamination (GRE). The GRE generaltest is required of all applicants to theM.S. and Ph.D. programs. Theadvanced GRE test in biology is recom-mended of all applicants to the Ph.D.program. Consideration is given toapplicants with an undergraduate majorother than biology; remedial work tomake up any undergraduate decienciesmay be taken prior to, or concurrentwith, the master's program but must becompleted within the rst year in thePh.D. program.Applications for graduate study are accepted on a continuing basis. M.S.students may begin study in the fall,spring, or summer semester; however,Ph.D. students may start only in thefall semester. All students with international cre- dentials whose native language is notEnglish should refer to the Admission to Degree Programs section of this bulletin regarding the required Test of Englishas a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Insome cases, prior to taking graduatecourses, students may be required toenroll in noncredit English courses attheir own expense. In special cases, a student may be accepted as a nonmatriculant. A nonde-gree student may take up to 12 pointsin the Department of Biology beforeapplying for matriculated status in theM.S. or Ph.D. program. The applica-tion for matriculation is only consid-ered if the student has received a B orbetter in each course included in the 12 points. Deadlines for applying fornonmatriculant status are the same asfor the M.S. program. Seminars: All faculty and doctoral stu- dents attend the weekly departmentalseminar, at which scholars from otherinstitutions discuss their research nd-ings. In addition, the departmentsponsors special topical seminarsthroughout the year. Special Notes: Although master's stu- dents may start their program in anysemester, some courses are full-yearcourses and must be started in the fall. Full-time students are expected to carry three courses or the equivalent inapproved research per semester. Allstudents in both programs are expectedto maintain a B or better average eachterm. Permission must be received from the director of graduate studies for any56 BIOLOGYcourse work taken outside of the department. MASTER OF SCIENCE The Master of Science program offersthree courses of study: general biology,computers in biologic research, andrecombinant DNA technology. Inaddition, biomedical journalism isoffered jointly with the Department ofJournalism, and a combined M.S.-M.B.A. program is offered jointly withthe New York University Leonard N.Stern School of Business. The optionsare described in the Graduate Student Handbook, available on request from the Department of Biology. Courses num-bered in the 1000-level and 2000-levelranges are open to students in the M.S.program. Degree Requirements: Students are awarded a Master of Science degree on(1) completion of 36 points with anaverage of B or better and (2) satisfac-tory completion of a research paper. Ofthe 36 points required, 24 must befrom the Department of Biology atNew York University. All enteringM.S. students are required to take BioCore 1 (G23.1001) and Bio Core 2(G23.1002). Students working withinone of the special M.S. programs maybe required to take additional courses. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The department accepts a limitednumber of outstanding students intothe Ph.D. program, which is a full-time program. The Ph.D. degree is aresearch degree. To qualify for the doc-torate, a student must satisfactorilycomplete graduate studies totaling atleast 72 points (at least 36 in residenceat New York University), pass a quali-fying examination, and present anacceptable dissertation. Each doctoralstudent is expected to have teachingexperience at the college level; studentsgain this experience through teachingassistantships within the department. Course of Study: Of the 72 points required, a minimum of 36 pointsmust be in courses at the 1000 and2000 levels; after review and approvalby the director of graduate studies, upto one-half of these 36 points may betransferred from outside the depart-ment. The remaining points may beselected from courses generally at the3000 level. Doctoral students arerequired to complete Bio Core 1-4(G23.1001, G23.1002, G23.2003, andG23.2004), Biology(G23.2030), and The ScienticInvestigation (G23.3001). Doctoralstudents must also satisfactorily com- plete, during the year of residence,the required Predoctoral Colloquium:Laboratory Rotation (G23.3034-3035).All Ph.D. students par-ticipate in Predoctoral Colloquium:Graduate Student Seminar (G23.3015)every semester. Students in the special collaborative track in environmental health sciences(EHS) select courses based on theirinterests with the advice and guidanceof faculty from both departments. Students with an interest in BRIDGES should complete G23.1072and all courses that doctoral studentsare required to complete. Further infor-mation on BRIDGES can be obtainedfrom Professor David Fitch. Students with an interest in devel- opmental genetics should completeG23.2130, G23.2131, and all coursesthat doctoral students are required tocomplete. Further information ondevelopmental genetics can be obtainedfrom Professor Stephen J. Small. All doctoral students must main- tain an average of B or better. Qualifying Examination/Admission to Candidacy: The written Ph.D. qualifying examination (preliminaryexamination) is generally taken at theend of the rst year of full-time study,that is, in the spring semester of a stu-dent's rst year. The examination con-sists of two parts: a written researchproposal and an oral presentation of theproposal that is defended before a com-mittee of three faculty members.Committee members are assigned toeach student by the director of gradu-ate studies, Ph.D. program, in collabo-ration with the instructors of recordfrom Bio Core III and IV . The proposalmay not be in the area of the student'sthesis research. This examination teststhe student's skills in scientic writing,reasoning, analysis and interpretationof data in the literature, integration ofscientic concepts, and creativity in thedesign of new experiments. By the end of the spring semester of their rst year, doctoral studentsmust secure a faculty sponsor and athesis advisory committee of at leastthree faculty members from within thedepartment who have formally agreedto supervise the dissertation research. Athesis proposal should be presented tothe thesis advisory committee anddefended orally before June 15 of thesecond year. When Ph.D. students passtheir thesis proposal examination, theybecome Ph.D. candidates.Doctoral Dissertation: The plan of study and the dissertation research areformulated in consultation with thefaculty sponsor and the research advi-sory committee. The dissertation mustrepresent original, independentresearch in a signicant area of biologyat a level comparable to research pub-lished in recognized journals or as pro-fessional monographs. When thedissertation is completed and has beenapproved by the sponsor and by theresearch advisory committee, the candi-date defends the results of the researchbefore a faculty committee and invitedoutside examiners with expertise in theeld of research. No less than sixmonths may lapse between the oralproposal examination and the disserta-tion defense.

LENGTH OF PROGRAM Completion of the M.S. program inbiomaterials requires 36 credit hours ofcourse work as well as completion andacceptance of a research thesis based on the student's original work. Of the 36required credit hours, up to 6 credithours may be approved for the student'smandatory research work. The timerequired to complete the program isnot specied and will vary as it isaffected by time commitment, motiva-tion, and the uncertainties of research.However, generally, the course workportion of the program for full-timestudents (a minimum of 12 credit hoursper semester for full-time status) can becompleted over approximately threeregular semesters. The research for thethesis will overlap with the course workpart of the program. A full-time stu-dent can expect to complete the pro-gram in approximately 1.5 to 2.5 years,depending on other commitments. Apart-time student is required to registerfor 6 credits a semester and could com-plete the program in approximately 2.5to 3.5 years. Students must be in continuous enrollment during the period of theirparticipation in the program, either bycourse registration or by the mainte-nance of matriculation registration(G47.4747). All requirements must besatised within a period of ve yearsfrom the time of original registrationfor courses.

The Graduate RecordExamination (GRE) scores from thegeneral test and the advanced chem-istry (or other appropriate advanced-level area) test are required. Students whose native language is not English must submit the scorefrom either the Test of Spoken English(TSE) or the Test of English as aForeign Language (TOEFL). Students beginning graduate study are usually accepted only for Septemberadmission. Part-time candidates for the M.S. degree are accepted only if they areable to attend classes in the daytime,since very few courses are offered in theevening. MASTER OF SCIENCE Requirements: Students must satisfac- torily complete 32 points (at least 24 inresidence at New York University) witha GPA of B (3.0) or better, and one ofthe following alternatives: (1) presenta-tion of a seminar on an advanced topicin the major eld; (2) preparation of aninterpretative review of the literature ofa selected area of chemistry; (3) prepa-ration of a dissertation based on origi-nal research; (4) passing an oralexamination in the major eld.Students opting for option 3, whichentails original research, are required totake 20 points of course work and 12 points of research. All other optionsrequire 28 points of course work and 4 points of research in preparation fortheir nal presentations. The suggested courses in each eld of Philosophy is a researchdegree. It signies that the recipient isable to conduct independent researchand has both a broad basic knowledge ofall areas of chemistry and a comprehen-sive knowledge of one eld in particular. Since graduate students arrive with a variety of backgrounds, many withM.S. degrees from other institutions inthe United States and abroad, the pro-gram of courses for each student isdesigned in consultation with thedirector of graduate studies, takingeach student's specic background,experience, and interests into account. While there are no specic course requirements for the Ph.D. in chem-istry, students in the Ph.D. programmay choose to participate in one of thefollowing three tracks. Each track rep-resents an area of study reflecting boththe current research foci of the facultyand the evolving interests of studentsand is designed to provide a morestructured academic experience. Eachtrack provides a guideline for 24 of the72 points required for the degree.These tracks may also be modied inconsultation with the adviser and thedirector of graduate studies to better tthe individual needs of students. Note: Except where noted, each of the follow-ing courses carries 4 points. Organic/Bioorganic Chemistry Track: Organic Reactions (G25.1311) Structure and Theory in OrganicChemistry (G25.1313)Organic Analysis (G25.1326)and 12 points selected from the in Organic 2262)Organic Photochemistry (G25.2281)Bioorganic Chemistry Reaction Mechanisms(G25.1314), pointsTotal Methods Dynamics(G25.2666)NMR Spectroscopy (G25.2680), 2 pointsApplied Infrared Spectroscopy(G25.2690), 2 points Students must satisfactorily complete at least 72 points derived from coursesand research, at least 32 of which mustbe taken in residence at New YorkUniversity. Students usually gain labo-ratory research experience in one ormore groups during their rst year.This laboratory experience providesstudents with direct exposure to tech-niques and methodology used in thevarious labs and helps them to choose athesis adviser. Students are expected tosatisfy the GSAS foreign languagerequirement, which consists of a shortwritten translation with the aid of adictionary. Bilingual students areexempt from this requirement. In order to gain matriculation into the Ph.D. program in chemistry, a stu-dent must pass the Ph.D. qualifyingexamination at the beginning of thespring semester of their second year.The exam is designed to ensure thatstudents are ready to embark on seriousresearch and scholarship. It consists ofa written report (5-10 pages) and anoral examination before their divisionalfaculty. If performance is not satisfac-tory, one more attempt is allowed atthe end of the second year. Studentswho pass are graduated to the status ofa Ph.D. candidate. The Ph.D. program in chemistry requires two additional oral/writtenexaminations. At the end of the thirdyear of graduate study, students arerequired to pass a research progressexamination, in which students give a30-minute presentation on theirresearch to date before their thesisadvisory committee. At the beginningof the fourth year of graduate study, awritten and oral original research pro-posal examination must be passed. Theexam tests student skills in scienticwriting, reasoning analysis, integrationof scientic concepts, interpretation ofdata in the literature, and creativity inthe design of new experiments.Feedback on student abstracts submit-ted prior to the exam is intended tohelp students identify promisingresearch directions. The nal writtenproposal (10-12 pages) and oral exami-nation are evaluated by an appointedcommittee. A passing grade must be 72 CHEMISTRYCoursesMost courses are lecture oriented; oth- ers emphasize individual study withattention to the needs of each student.For additional information about a par-ticular course, see the instructor.

The thesis defense,performed before the thesis advisorycommittee, is the last step of the Ph.D.program. All doctoral candidates are expected to participate in the seminar programoffered by their division and to attendthe departmental colloquia presentedby distinguished visiting scientists. Doctoral Dissertation: The heart of the doctoral program is the researchleading to the preparation of the dis-sertation. The accumulation of highgrades in formal courses, while impor-tant, is secondary to the demonstrationof a capacity for original thinking and the completion of an investigation thatcontributes signicantly to chemicalknowledge. When a student is formallyadmitted to matriculation for the doc-torate, a committee consisting of theresearch adviser and two other facultymembers is selected to advise the can-didate and monitor the progress of theresearch by meeting with the studentat scheduled intervals and wheneverrequested by the student. When thedissertation is completed, it is read bythe research committee and two addi-tional faculty members. Up to two out-side readers who are experts in the eldof the dissertation research may beappointed as dissertation readers. A public oral defense of the approved dis-sertation is then held.

The approachto cinema is interdisciplinaryand international in scope and isconcerned with understandingmotion pictures in terms of thematerial practices that producethem and within which they cir-culate. While lm constitutesthe primary object of study, thedepartment also considers othermedia that fall within the realm of sound/image studies (e.g.,broadcast television, video art,and online technologies) to bewithin its purview. Graduate programs leading to the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees areoffered jointly by the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science andthe Tisch School of the Arts through the department. Graduate students may take a production course only in thesummer through the Depart-ment of Film and Television.Students enrolled in theCerticate Program in Cultureand Media are required to takefurther production courses dur-ing the academic year.Most courses in cinema studies include extensive lm screeningsthat are supplemented by aweekly cinematheque. lmand resources George AmbergStudy Center. In addition, theElmer Holmes Bobst Libraryhouses a substantial video collec-tion that is located in the AveryFisher Center for Music andMedia. Other New York Cityinstitutions such as the Museumof Modern Art, the Library ofthe Performing Arts at LincolnCenter, and the Anthology FilmArchives offer further invaluableresources for the lm student. 721 BROADWAY , 6TH 212-998-1600 WEB SITE: http://cinema.tisch.nyu.edu/page/home.html TPrograms and RequirementsThe M.A. program is a self-contained curriculum that provides the studentwith an advanced course of study in thehistory, theory, and criticism of lmand the moving image. Students alsohave the opportunity to pursue intern-ships for credit at lm libraries andarchives in the city or in the lm andmedia industries in order to furthertheir professional development. Manylecture classes are offered in the eveningfor the convenience of working stu-dents. Graduates of the program havegone on to successful careers as lmcurators, programmers, preservationists,critics, and educators as well as lm-makers, screenwriters, and industryprofessionals. The Ph.D. program prepares stu- dents to develop teaching competenceand to pursue research in cinema andmedia studies. The curriculum drawson the methods of a number of disci-plines, including art history, culturalstudies, American studies, psychoana-lytic theory, and philosophy andinvolves intensive seminar-level studyin lm theory, history, and researchmethods. Graduates of the programhave gone onto positions of academicleadership in the eld.

The examination maybe taken on completion of 24 points ofcourse work but no later than a semesterafter the completion of 36 points ofcourse work. The comprehensive exami-nation is a take-home examination con-sisting of ve questions, of which thestudent must answer two. The questionsare drawn from the total course of studyas well as from material on the M.A.comprehensive exam lmography andbibliography, lists of important worksprovided by the department. Studentshave one week to complete the exam.Students who fail the exam may retake itonce. Students are notied by mail of theexam results. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Doctor of Philosophy degree isconferred for advanced studies in whichthe student demonstrates outstandingoriginal scholarship. It signies thestudent can conduct independentresearch and has both a broad basicknowledge of all areas of his or hereld and a comprehensive knowledgeof one eld in particular. A doctoral candidate must com- plete all requirements no later than tenyears from matriculation or seven yearsfrom the time of his or her matricula-tion if the candidate holds a master'sdegree. Course of Study: Students must com- plete 36 points of course work in addi-tion to their M.A. degree (which willbe assessed at 36 points) for a total of72 points; three qualifying exams; aforeign dissertation proposal; dissertation; and a dissertationdefense open to faculty and students.Students are permitted to take up totwo classes outside the department oras independent study. A student inter-ested in independent study mustobtain approval from a full-time fac-ulty member after submitting a state-ment of purpose and a proposedbibliography. Summary of Ph.D. Program First Year Fall semester: two courses and rst qualifying exam. Spring semester: three courses and sec- ond qualifying exam.Second Year Fall semester: two courses and third qualifying exam. Spring semester: two courses and lan- guage requirement. Dissertation semi-nar/proposal. Oral defense. Third and Fourth Years Dissertation writing. Internships: It is possible for Ph.D. students to receive independent studycredit for work at various lm libraries,associations, and archives (such as theDonnell Library, the Association ofIndependent Video and Filmmakers,and the Museum of Modern Art).Permission from a liaison at the insti-tution and from a faculty adviser isrequired for such work. Incompletes: The department strongly discourages grades of \"incom-plete.\" Any incompletes granted mustbe made up before the end of the nextsemester. Outstanding incompletesmay render a student ineligible forassistantships and nancial aid. See theGSAS guidelines for completion dead-lines for incompletes. The dissertationdefense cannot be scheduled if out-standing incompletes exist. Qualifying Examinations: Each stu- dent must pass three exams: one in theeld of lm/culture/media theory, onein the eld of lm/media history, andone in a third area drawn from theexisting exam offerings or drawn up inconsultation with the student's facultyadviser as a special area of study thatrelates to the student's proposed disser-tation topic. The theory exam areasinclude gender, sexuality, and represen-tation; race, nation, and representation;cultural theory; media theory; theory ofnarrative and genre; theory of The areas the American lm\u20141895 American lm\u20141927 to 1960,or American history of French lm; history ofItalian lm; history of Japanese lm;history of Soviet and post-Soviet lm;history of German lm; history theinternational avant-garde; history history of lm; history British lm. All exams are take-home exams. The take-home exam consists of six ques-tions, of which three are to be answeredin the form of a 10-page essay per ques-tion. The student has one week to com-plete the take-home exam. Each subjectarea is offered for examination once ayear either in the fall or spring semester.A schedule of the areas offered in a par-ticular semester is available from the department at the beginning of eachacademic year. Exams are graded bythree faculty members. The studentreceives a grade of high pass, pass, orfail. If a student fails an examination,the exam in the same subject area mustbe taken the next time it is offered.Upon failing an exam in any one areatwice, the student must leave the Ph.D.program. Students sit for their qualify-ing exams in their rst, second, andthird semesters of course work. Foreign Language Requirement: A student must demonstrate prociencyin one foreign language. Six languagesare accepted toward fullling thePh.D. language requirement: Chinese,French, German, Italian, Russian, andSpanish.

The departmental examination is administered once during both the falland spring semesters. For further information, contact Elaine Bajana at212-998-1600.78 CINEMA STUDIESPh.D. Dissertation Adviser: Ph.D. students are advised by the director ofgraduate studies or chair of the depart-ment until such time as they selecttheir dissertation adviser. Ph.D. stu-dents should select their dissertationadviser no later than their fourthsemester of Ph.D. course work. Thecommittee chair must be a full-timefaculty member of the Department ofCinema Studies or, in the exceptionalcase, an afliated NYU faculty memberapproved by the chair. Doctoral Committee: Each student must select two faculty members toserve as members of the core commit-tee alongside his or her adviser.Students must select two additionalreaders for the examining committeesoon after their core committee is inplace. The examining committee con-sists of ve members: the student's corecommittee and two additional readers.At least three members of the examin-ing committee must be graduate fac-ulty of New York University. Advanceapproval by the dissertation adviserand the Graduate School of Arts andScience is necessary for any non-NYUmember. No student should begin the nal draft of the dissertation until he or shehas consulted (in person, except inextraordinary circumstances) with allthree of the core members of his or herdissertation committee. Where possi-ble, core members should receive acopy of each chapter of the dissertationas it is drafted. Dissertation Seminar and Proposal: All Ph.D. students must takeDissertation Seminar in their fourthsemester of Ph.D. course work. Thisseminar is used to develop the disserta-tion proposal that is defended in thePh.D. oral defense. The dissertationproposal consists of a document of nomore than 20 pages that outlines indetail the candidate's proposed area ofstudy. It should include (1) an outlineof the research to be undertaken; (2) astatement of the project's contributionto the eld in the context of a briefreview of the literature; (3) an outlineof the method to be used; (4) a state-ment of how the candidate intends tocomplete the research; and (5) a chap-ter-by-chapter breakdown of the proj-ect. A 250-word abstract and abibliography and lmography must beattached to the proposal. Ph.D. Oral Defense: In the latter part of their fourth semester of Ph.D. coursework, students sit for an oral defenseconducted by a faculty evaluation com-mittee. In this defense, students are questioned on their dissertation pro-posal and other academic progress. If astudent fails the oral defense, she or hewill have the opportunity to sit againfor it in the next semester. The oraldefense must be successfully completedbefore a student may begin writing thedissertation and in order for a studentto be eligible to receive a dissertationaward. All students must have theirdissertation proposal approved by theiradviser and two oral defense committeemembers to be eligible to receive a dis-sertation award. Approval should becertied by having the adviser sign anddate the front page of the proposal.This process usually takes place at theconclusion of the Ph.D. oral defense.The signed copy should then be sub-mitted to the department ofce to beled. Completion of all course work,comprehensive examinations, and thelanguage requirement is also necessaryto obtain this dissertation award. Oral Defense of Dissertation Chapter(s): In the second semester of the student's third year, an oral defenseof at least one complete chapter of thedissertation is scheduled and conductedby a faculty evaluation committee. Thestudent is questioned on the work andon plans for continued research andwriting. If a student fails the review, heor she must rewrite, resubmit, andobtain approval of the chapter beforethe start of the next academic year. Doctoral Dissertation: A dissertation title card and a preliminary outline ofthe dissertation are kept on le in thecandidate's department. The disserta-tion must show the ability to follow anapproved method of scholarly investi-gation and evidence of exhaustivestudy of a special eld. It should add tothe knowledge of the subject or repre-sent a new, signicant interpretation.Every dissertation should contain aclear introductory statement and asummary of results. The dissertationmust include an analytical table of con-tents and a bibliography and, whensubmitted to the Degree and DiplomaOfce of the Ofce of the UniversityRegistrar, must meet formattingrequirements and be accompanied byan abstract. When the nal draft of thedissertation has been approved by thecore committee, the student workswith her/his adviser and departmentadministration to establish a date forthe dissertation defense and submitsthe nal draft to the additional exam-ining readers. The date of the disserta-tion defense must be set at least threeweeks after all committee members have received the nal draft. Followingthe defense, the examining committeevotes on whether or not to accept thedissertation; the committee has theoption of passing the dissertation \"withdistinction.\" The candidate is required to submit one copy of the ofcially submitteddissertation to the department. A doctoral candidate must com- plete all requirements no later than tenyears from matriculation into the M.A.program or seven years from the timeof matriculation into the Ph.D. pro-gram if the candidate already holds themaster's degree. MASTER OF PHILOSOPHY The Master of Philosophy is conferredonly on students who have beenaccepted as candidates in a doctoralprogram and who have fullled all therequirements for the doctorate exceptthe dissertation and its defense. Theminimum general requirements for thedegree of Doctor of Philosophy in theGraduate School of Arts and Scienceare the satisfactory completion of 72points (at least 32 in residence at NewYork University), demonstrated com-petence in a foreign language, and thepreparation and successful defense of adissertation. Additional special require-ments for the degree invariably includea written qualifying or comprehensiveexamination testing the candidate'sknowledge of the eld of study.Students who fail the qualifying orcomprehensive examination do notreceive the Master of Philosophydegree. It should be emphasized thatrecipients of the degree of Master ofPhilosophy have completed all of thegeneral and special requirements forthe degree of Doctor of Philosophyexcept those relating to the dissertationand its defense. CERTIFICATE PROGRAM IN CULTURE AND MEDIA The Certicate Program in Culture and Media (formerly the CerticateProgram in Ethnographic Film andVideo) was initiated in the fall of 1986as an interdisciplinary course of studycombining the rich resources of theDepartments of Cinema Studies andAnthropology at NYU. This programprovides a focused course of graduatestudies integrating production workwith theory and research into the usesand meanings of media in a range ofcommunities and cultures. Training inthis program enables students to pur-sue the following:79 CINEMA STUDIES1. Production work in lm and video based on their own or other anthropol-ogists' eldwork. 2. Teaching the history, theory, and production of ethnographic lm andmedia studies. 3. A career in media requiring an understanding of anthropology, such asspecialized programming and distribu-tion of ethnographic lm and video,community-based documentary pro-duction, or management of ethno-graphic lm/video libraries andarchives. Located in New York, the program pro- vides students with ready access to themany ethnographic lm activities thattake place in the city, such as theannual Margaret Mead Film and VideoFestival, the Biannual Native AmericanFilm and Video Festival, and theAfrican Diaspora Film Festival. Theethnographic lm program itself spon-sors many events that allow students tomeet and see the works of ethnographiclmmakers from around the world andfollow developments in the eld. Theseinclude monthly workshops in visualanthropology; occasional events withdistinguished guests such as JeanRouch; conferences on special topicssuch as ethnographic lm archives andnew technologies; and an annual sym-posium on ethnographic lm held inconjunction with the Margaret MeadFilm and Video Festival. Admission: To enroll in the Certicate Program in Culture and Media, inter-ested students should follow the proce-dures for applying to the M.A. orPh.D. program in cinema studies orthe Ph.D. program in anthropology.Application forms and nancial aidinformation are sent under separatecover. Students should indicate on theirapplication that they are interested inpursuing the certicate. Once accepted,students meet with the departmentalliaison to the certicate program tobegin designing the course of studyappropriate to their overall plan forgraduate work. Course of Study: To complete the cer- ticate program, students must fulllthe requirements outlined in the fol-lowing curriculum. The program con-sists of the following eight courses inaddition to those required for the M.A.or Ph.D. degree in cinema studies. Sixof the courses that count toward thecerticate may also be counted towardan M.A. or Ph.D. degree in cinemastudies; they are the courses listedbelow with an H72 code. All studentsare required to complete an independ- ent original ethnographic video project,which may be either a production orscholarly research, designed in consulta-tion with the departmental liaison. Thecurriculum is organized into two tracksto complement the course workrequired by one of the two disciplines. Required Courses for All Certicate Students: Culture and Media I (H72.1402) Culture and Media II (H72.1403) Cultural Theory and the Documentary (H72.2001) Cinema: The Language of Sight and Sound (H72.1998) Video Production Seminar I, II (G14.1218, 1219) or DocumentaryWorkshop (H56.1041) Required Course for Anthropology Students: Television: History and Culture (H72.1026) Required Course for Cinema Studies Students: Social Anthropology: Theory and Practice (G14.1010) or approved elec-tive in social anthropology or advancedproduction course Approved Elective: Approved internship/independent proj- ect/reading course With the approval of the director of the program, anthropology studentswith prior training in media may beable to substitute other courses fromthe extensive curriculum offered in his-tory and theory by the Department ofCinema Studies or in lm and videoproduction. Internships: In addition to studying ethnographic lm history, theory, andproduction, students in the CerticateProgram in Culture and Media mayarrange appropriate supervised intern-ships or research projects. Students inter-ested in this should consult with thedepartmental liaison to the program. Resources: The Department of Anthropology has a lm and multisys-tem video theatre that seats up to 40and has an excellent collection of over300 ethnographic lm and videoworks. The Department of CinemaStudies has a collection of over 600lms. New York University's AveryFisher Music and Media Center hasover 1,000 documentaries in its videolibrary facility available to students. Inaddition, some of the best lm, video,and broadcast libraries are available inNew York City, including the DonnellFilm Library, the Museum of ModernArt Film Library, the Museum of Television and Radio, and the lm andvideo collection of the NationalMuseum of the American Indian.

Hamilton he Department of ComparativeLiterature exploresthe range of litera- ture, its transmission, and itsdynamic of linguistic,geographical, cultural, political,and disciplinary boundaries.Students in the departmentadopt a global perspective andinterdisciplinary outlook as they pursue work in various lan-guages, traditions, and academicelds. Faculty members offercourses that embrace the ancientand modern periods of world lit-erature and explore critical, theo-retical, and historical issues andproblems of representation in thebroadest sense. This type ofanalysis expands the eld of lit-erature to include a wide varietyof cultural practices\u2014from his-torical, philosophical, and legaltexts to artifacts of visual andpopular culture\u2014revealing the roles literature plays as a form ofmaterial expression and symbolicexchange.

UNIQUE INTERDISCIPLINARY FEATURES OF THE CURRICULUM COB Research Seminar: The four- semester COB Research Seminar courseis a distinctive educational experience.Because of the fluid and multifacetednature of contemporary computationalbiology, this course is flexible in struc-ture and adaptive in its content. Eachof the four semesters contains two tofour modules, each focusing on one ofthe key research themes of the program(see above). To build an in-depthunderstanding of the topic, the mod-ules begin with reading/discussion ofan introductory-level article on a cut- ting-edge topic integratedlook at the basic biological/chemical/neural and computational conceptsunderlying the topic, followed by more advanced research reading anddiscussion. These fundamental conceptsand computational methodologies may recur across research themes.Consideration of such commonalities isused to develop a rich understanding ofthe breadth of computational biology. Crossover Courses: Students are required to take two courses frompartner departments other than theirown home department. Thesecrossover courses are intended tobroaden the interdisciplinary trainingof COB students. Laboratory Rotations and provide a rsthand experi-ence with cutting-edge research incomputational biology and a way forstudents to identify faculty with whomthey may wish to work on their disser-tation. Partner departments that do notoffer laboratory rotations attain thesame goal with to researchin biology. COB Colloquium/Student Seminar: The COB Colloquium series comprisesapproximately seven 90-minute presen-tations per semester by COB faculty,COB students, and invited externalspeakers. Each speaker provides an arti-cle title (either upon which the presen-tation is based or a background article)that COB students are required to readprior to the colloquium. In addition,the speaker is paired with a host. Theone-hour presentation is followed by ahalf-hour discussion among the stu-dents and the speaker, coordinated bythe speaker's host. The colloquium pro-vides COB students with a survey ofresearch across the COB program andin the broader community. 97 COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGYate handbook at http://fusion.mssm.edu/ gradschool/courses/course.cfm for biologycore courses (Biochemistry andMolecular Biology: Core I and CellBiology: Core II) and possible elec-tives/crossover courses.

Special Topics in Computer Science G22.3033 3 points. A selected recent topic is describedbelow. Computational Biology/ BioinformaticsThe term \"computational biology\"was originally coined by an analogyto the role that computing hasplayed in the physical sciences. Atpresent, its most obvious role is pri-marily in terms of gathering, ware-housing, and analyzing largeamounts of statistical data that canbe generated by high-throughputexperiments (e.g., whole-genomesequence data, microarray-basedgene expression data). It is begin-ning to be expanded, however, toinclude many other advances inbiology, namely, design of newbiotechnology (e.g., single-DNAmolecule analysis, nanoscale analy-sis of biological materials, etc.), cre-ation of novel systems biologicalmodels (e.g., WNT signaling, cas-pase cascade of intrinsicapoptosis, circa-dian and ultradian cycles, etc.),machine learning approaches hypotheses from (e.g.,a SNP-based haplo-type copy-number poly-morphisms, newbiological objects and systems (e.g.,synthetic biology, engineered bacte-ria, etc.), and many others. The emphasis of this course is to introduce students to this encom-passing view. Topics include intro-duction to algorithmic biology;some biology for computer scien-tists; and thefuture.Mathematics Methods I G63.2010 Identical to G22.2420. Prerequisites:undergraduate and stability; numerical linearalgebra, including Computerprogramming assignments form anessential part of the course. Special Topics in Numerical Analysis G63.2011 3 points. A selected recent topic is describedbelow. The Immersed Boundary Method for Fluid-StructureInteractionThe immersed boundary method isa general framework for the com-puter simulation of flows withimmersed elastic boundaries and/orcomplicated geometry. It was origi-nally developed to study the fluiddynamics of heart valves, and it hassince been applied to a wide rangeof problems in biofluid dynamics,such as wave propagation in theinner ear, sh swimming, andinsect flight. Nonbiological applica-tions include sails, parachutes, flowsof suspensions, and two-fluid ormultifluid problems.

Methods of Applied Mathematics G63.2701 Corequisites :undergraduate advanced calculus, ordinary differentialequations, and complex variables. 3 points.Convergent and divergent in Mathematical Biology G63.2851, 2852 3 points. Selected recent topics are describedbelow. Cardiac Mechanics and ElectrophysiologyThis course is about the equationsof a heartbeat, which are partial dif-ferential equations. The Navier-Stokes equations of a viscousincompressible fluid, to include fluid-structure inter-action with the muscular heartwalls and the flexible heart valveleaflets, describe the mechanicalfunction of the heart. Cardiacmechanics is coordinated and con-trolled by an electrical system gov-erned by Hodgkin-Huxleyequations in their Bidomain form,which describes both volt-age, transmembraneionic and capacitive currents. Bothmechanical and electrical activityare strongly influenced by the berarchitecture of the heart, the differ- ential geometry of which is gov-erned by partial differentialequations derived primarily fromconsiderations of mechanical equi-librium. To what extent is the berarchitecture of the heart and itsvalves determined by these equa-tions? Meanwhile, at the molecularlevel, the contractile machinery ofthe heart is described by populationdynamics equations that govern theattachment (birth), motion (aging),and detachment (death) of myosincross bridges interacting with theactin laments of the muscle. Whatare the special features of cardiaccross-bridge dynamics that givecardiac muscle its distinctive prop-erties in comparison to skeletalmuscle? The emphasis of the courseis on the formulation of thedetailed realistic models describedabove and on the numerical solu-tion of the model equations.Simplied models that allow foranalytic or asymptotic solution arealso introduced for comparison. Biomolecular Motors Biological cells contain microscopicrobotic machinery that is used forcell motility, for transport of vesiclesand organelles within cells, to moveprotein molecules across internalmembranes, to partition chromo-somes at cell division, and to manu-facture energy-rich compounds suchas ATP as well as information-richcompounds such as proteins andnucleic acids. Unlike the macro-scopic machinery of everyday experi-ence, these biomolecular motorsfunction in a regime in whichBrownian motion (i.e., thermal fluc-tuation) plays an important role.Throughout the course, mathemati-cal modeling and computer simula-tion are used to elucidate the diversemechanisms of biomolecular motors,with particular emphasis on theprobabilistic aspect of their function.Topics to be studied include cross-bridge dynamics in muscle, kinesinas a molecular walker, optimaldynamic instability of microtubulesfor chromosome capture, a depoly-merization ratchet mechanism for themovement of chromosomes, the roleof elasticity in the function of bio-molecular motors, the role of chro-mosome flexibility in chromosometransport during mitosis, a look-ahead mechanism for RNA poly-merase, and rotary molecular motorsdriven by ion gradients, such as ATPsynthase and the bacterial flagellar motor. Students have the opportu-nity to work in teams on computersimulations of selected motor sys-tems, with computer animation as ameans of visualizing the results.

In addition,individual research groups have variousresources, including a variety of Linuxand Windows PCs. Access to theInternet is provided through a T3 con-nection. Each doctoral student is pro-vided with a personal desktop or laptop.Many other research machines providefor abundant access to a variety of com-puter architectures. For example, theMedia Research Laboratory has videoand editing facilities, a unique motion-capture laboratory, and access to relatedfacilities at the Tisch School of the Arts.The bioinformatics group has a cluster offast PCs for computing genome map-pings. The distributed computing groupmanages a dedicated cluster of PCs andworkstations for experiments in robustdistributed systems.CoursesCourses are generally scheduled from 5 to 7 p.m. or from 7 to 9 p.m.; how-ever, honors courses (intended prima-rily for full-time Ph.D. students) areheld during afternoon hours. For courses requiring program- ming, students may use the CourantInstitute's computing facilities. Detailed course descriptions may be accessed each semester from the\"Courses\" links on the department'sWeb site. PREPARATORY ACCELERATED COURSE (PAC) Applicants to the master's programs who have insufcient background incomputer science but are otherwiseadmissible are referred to PAC. Thesetwo courses (part one, which is offeredin the fall, and part two, in the spring)are designed to fulll the minimumprerequisites for beginning a master'sprogram in computer science or infor-mation systems. Those admitted to theM.S. program with the requirement tocomplete PAC are considered M.S.degree students while they are enrolledin PAC courses, although the creditsfor the courses do not count toward theM.S. degree. Applicants should apply for their ultimate degree objective rather thanfor PAC, even if they expect to berequired to take these courses.

SEMINARS AND RESEARCH Information Technology ProjectsG22.3812 Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 3 points.This course teaches students some of theskills required to participate in and runIT projects that succeed in the realworld. Students simultaneously learnskills in the classroom and apply theskills in a project while interning at alocal \"client.\" Clients are mostly companies, but sometimes they are gov-ernment agencies or nonprot organiza-tions. Students are given the opportunityto work on projects early in their devel-opment so that they can experience thefull software project life cycle. Studentswork in teams of about four individuals.Each team undertakes one project thatlasts the entire semester. The readings,classroom lectures, discussions, andactivities teach skills that help imple-ment projects of this size. The followingare examples of some projects: Software purchase evaluation: In this type of project, a client needs somesoftware to solve a particular businessproblem. However, it makes moresense to address this problem by pur-chasing, rather than building, the soft-ware. In this case, the team begins byanalyzing the business problem andgathering requirements. It thendesigns an architecture that would con-nect the new system with existing sys-tems. In the project's second half, theteam evaluates commercial productsthat might meet the requirements. Software development: A client needs some software to solve a business prob-lem. The team quickly prosecutes thesoftware development life cycle\u2014including requirements gathering,architecture, design, development, andtesting\u2014to produce a prototype systemthat addresses the business problem.The deliverables are the prototype codeand a report. The report documentsadvice and knowledge gained duringthe project that might be useful to thestaff at the client who will build a pro-duction system based on the prototype.About three-quarters of the projectsinvolve software development.110 COMPUTER SCIENCEAdvanced Laboratory G22.3813 Prerequisites: permission of the faculty proj-ect supervisor, completion of at least 12points of study, and programming back-ground. 1-3 points per term for master'sstudents, 1-12 points per term for Ph.D.students.Large-scale programming project orresearch in cooperation with a facultymember.

Thisincludes studies in the critical historyof visual anthropology, the ethnogra-phy of media, and training in docu-mentary production. These courses areintegrated with graduate studies inM.A. and Ph.D. degree programs.Training in this program enables stu-dents to pursue the following: 1. Production work in 16 mm lm and state-of-the-art digital video based ontheir own research, resulting in a shortdocumentary.2. Ethnographic research into the uses and meanings of media in a range ofcommunities and cultures. Studentsfrom the program have been doingPh.D. research on the development ofmedia in diverse settings, from indige-nous media collectives in Mexico to thecirculation of religious media inNorthern Nigeria, to the use of mediaof all sorts in the Peruvian diaspora. 3. Teaching the history, theory, and production of ethnographic documen-tary and related issues in cinema andmedia studies. 4. A career in media requiring an understanding of anthropology, such asspecialized programming and distribu- tion of ethnographic lm and video,community-based documentary produc-tion, management of ethnographiclm/video libraries and archives, orwork in new media. The program's philosophy takes a broad approach to understanding the relation-ships between culture and media in anumber of domains including ethno-graphic lm's signicance for the eldsof anthropology and cinema/mediastudies; problems in representation ofcultures through media; develop-ment of media in indigenous, Media I G14.1215 Ganti, Himpele. 4 points.This course offers a critical revision ofthe history of the genre of ethno-graphic lm, the central debates it hasengaged around cross-cultural repre-sentation, and the theoretical and cine-matic responses to questions of thescreen representation of culture, fromthe early romantic constructions ofRobert Flaherty to current work inlm, television, and video on the partof indigenous people throughout theworld. Ethnographic lm has a peculiarand highly contested status withinanthropology, cinema studies, and doc- umentary practice. This seminar situ-ates ethnographic lm within thewider project of the representation ofcultural lives, and especially of\"natives.\" Starting with what areregarded as the rst examples of thegenre, the course examines how theseemerged in a particular intellectualcontext and political economy. It thenconsiders the key works that havedened the genre and the epistemolog-ical and formal innovations associatedwith them, addressing questions con-cerning social theory, documentary, aswell as the institutional structures through which they are funded, dis-tributed, and seen by various audi-ences. Throughout, the course keeps inmind the properties of lm as a signi-fying practice, its status as a form ofknowledge, and the ethical and politi-cal concerns raised by cross-culturalrepresentation. Culture and Media II: Ethnography of Media G14.1216 Ganti, Ginsburg, Himpele. 4 points.In the last decade, a new eld\u2014theethnography of media\u2014has emerged as 112 CULTURE AND MEDIAemerging social and cultural formationsshaped by new media practices; and thepolitical economy shaping the produc-tion, distribution, and consumption ofmedia worldwide. INTERNSHIPS The program can arrange supervisedinternships for course credit, tailored toindividual research and professionalinterests. Students work in a variety ofprogramming and production positionsfor institutions, such as 1. American Museum of Natural History/Margaret Mead Film and VideoFestival 2. National Museum of the American Indian, Film and Video Center 3. The Asia Society4. The Jewish Museum RESOURCES The Department of Anthropology has a lm and multisystem video theatrethat seats up to 40 and has an excellentcollection of over 600 ethnographiclm and video works. The Departmentof Cinema Studies has a collection ofover 1,000 lms. New YorkUniversity's Avery Fisher Music andMedia Center has over 2,000 documen-taries available to students in its videolibrary facility. In addition, some of thebest lm, video, and broadcast librariesare available in New York City, includ-ing the Donnell Film Library, Museumof Modern Art Film Library, andNational Museum of the AmericanIndian Film and Video Archive. CENTER FOR MEDIA, CUL- TURE, AND HISTORY The program works closely with the Center for Media, Culture, and History,directed by Professor Faye Ginsburg.The Center sponsors fellows, screenings,lectures, and conferences and integrates concerns of faculty and students fromthe Departments of Anthropology,Cinema Studies, History, andPerformance Studies as well as otherprograms, including the Center forReligion and Media. The Center forMedia, Culture, and History addressesissues of representation, social change,and identity construction embedded inthe development of lm, television,video, and new media worldwide. Formore information about the Center,visit the Web site at www.nyu.edu/gsas/ program/media .

While claims about media in people'slives are made on a daily basis, surpris-ingly little research has actuallyattempted to look at how media is partof the naturally occurring lived reali-ties of people's lives. In the last decade,anthropologists and media scholarsinterested in lm, television, and videohave been turning their attentionincreasingly beyond the text andempiricist notions of audiences to con-sider, ethnographically, the complexsocial worlds in which media is pro-duced, circulated, and consumed, athome and elsewhere. This work theo-rizes media studies from the point ofview of cross-cultural ethnographicrealities and anthropology from theperspective of new spaces of communi-cation focusing on the social, eco-nomic, and political life of media andhow it makes a difference in the dailylives of people as a practice, whether inproduction, reception, or circulation. Cultural Theory and the Documentary H72.2001 Kahana. 4 points.Advanced seminar that considersanthropological, historical, gender, sci-ence, sociological, and cultural studiestheory in the light of a range of docu-mentary genres: counter-colonial,direct cinema, ethnographic, instruc-tional, historical, and auteurist. Television: History and Culture H72.1026 McCarthy. 4 points. Examines the background, context, andhistory of radio, television, video, andsound. Topics include politics and eco-nomics of media institutions; audiencesand reception; cultural and broadcastpolicy; aesthetic modes and movements. Social Anthropology Theory and Practice G14.1010 Myers. 4 points. This course is intended to acquaintgraduate students in anthropologywith some core issues in social/culturalanthropology. It cannot pretend to be acomprehensive introduction to the dis-cipline; matters are too complex.Instead it seeks to highlight basicissues in social theory and the relation-ship of theory and ethnographic prac-tice. It proceeds through aconsideration of key controversieswithin the eld and through mappingsome contemporary directions.Although the course covers materialfrom the 19th through the 20th cen-turies, it is not a history of anthropo-logical thought; students are expectedto complement this course withHistory of Anthropology (G14.1636)and a lifetime of reading in anthropol-ogy and related elds. The Language of Sight and Sound H72.1998 Taught by Tisch School of the Arts faculty. 6 points.Intensive six-week hands-on summerproduction course (mid-May to lateJune) in techniques of 16 mm lm-making. Students are required to com-plete ve short lms using equipmentand materials provided. Emphasis isinitially on documentary techniques,which rely on editing for meaning.Students then move on to the scriptednarrative. The goal is to develop tech-nical skills while exploring creativepossibilities. Early application isencouraged, as this is a limited-enroll-ment workshop. Video Production Seminar I, II G14.1218, 1219 Open only to students in the Program in Culture and Media.Limited to 10 students. Prerequisites:G14.1215, H72.1998, and permission ofthe instructor. Ganti, Ginsburg, Himpele.4 points per term.Yearlong seminar in ethnographic doc-umentary video production using state-of-the-art digital video equipment forstudents in the Program in Culture and Media. The rst portion of thecourse is dedicated to instruction, exer-cises, reading, and familiarizing stu-dents with fundamentals of videoproduction and their application to abroad conception of ethnographic anddocumentary approaches. Assignmentsundertaken in the fall raise representa-tional, methodological, and ethicalissues in approaching and workingthrough an ethnographic and docu-mentary project. Students develop atopic and eld site for their projectearly in the fall term, begin theirshooting, and complete a short (5- to10-minute) edited preview tape by theend of this semester. This work shoulddemonstrate competence in shootingand editing using digital video cam-era/audio and Final Cut Pro nonlinearediting systems. Students devote thespring semester to intensive work onindependent projects, continuing toshoot and edit, presenting work to theclass and completing their (approxi-mately 20-minute) ethnographic docu-mentaries. Student work is presentedand critiqued during class sessions, andattendance and participation in crewsfor independent projects as well as ingroup critiques and lab sessions ismandatory. Students should come intothe class with project ideas alreadywell-developed. Students who have notcompleted the work assigned in therst semester are not allowed to regis-ter for the second semester. There is nolab fee, but students are expected toprovide their own videotapes. In addi-tion to class time, there are regulartechnical lab sessions on the use ofequipment.East Asian StudiesDEPARTMENT OF 114 EAST ASIAN STUDIESCHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Xudong Zhang DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Mitsuhiro Yoshimoto he Department of East Asian Studiesof New YorkUniversity offers a doctoral and a master's programin East Asian cultures. The grad-uate program is concerned withculture, media, and questions ofrepresentation as they relate tothe formation of East Asian soci-eties such as China, Japan, andKorea in modern times. Ratherthan pursue the practice of areastudies in the traditional sense,the program is committed to acritical and, whenever possible,interdisciplinary examination ofEast Asia's modernity in a globalconguration. In the course of their study, students are challenged todevelop a critical awareness ofthe political, institutional, andmethodological consequences, aswell as the historical provenanceof both disciplinary-based andarea studies inquiry. Workingwith their advisers and other fac-ulty inside and outside of thedepartment, students are encour-aged to design their programsaround literary and lm studies, as well as studies of other mediaand forms of representation; the-oretical or andpolitical movements; or anycombination of the above. The intellectual strength and identity of our graduate programlies, rst of all, in its sharp focuson the modern period and in itsdedication to a theoreticallyinformed, interdisciplinaryapproach to the study of cultureand society of modern East Asia.Our core faculty members spe-cialize in modern Chinese,Japanese, and Korean languagesand literatures; Chinese andJapanese and cultural Korean society; andcomparative studies of national-ism, colonialism, revolution, andcultural politics. This unit ofexpertise is further reinforced byour truly impressive array ofassociated members in history,anthropology, religious studies,art history, and cinema studieswhose work is mainly concernedwith modern East Asia. As a part of the University community, the graduate pro-gram in East Asian studies sharesthe general dynamic of NYU,which has been embarking on itspursuit to become a truly globaluniversity. The program closelyworks with and benets from aplethora of interdisciplinary pro-grams, centers, and instituteswith a distinct international ten-dency, such as the InternationalCenter for Advanced Studies; theCenter for Media, Culture, andHistory; the Asian/Pacic/American Studies Program andInstitute; the Center for theStudy of Gender and Sexuality;the Institute of Fine Arts; theInstitute of the History ofProduction of Knowledge; theInstitute for Law and Society;and so forth, with which our faculty have afliations or working relations. This internalnetwork of knowledge andknowledge production, coupledwith the University-wideresources committed to interna-tional student and scholarlyexchanges, visits, and coordina-tion, has created a truly stimulat-ing environment in which thestudent can thrive in his or herstudy of modern East Asia. 715 BROADWAY , 3RD Each year, the Department of East Asian Studies admits to itsPh.D. and M.A. programs a few selectstudents who have a strong undergrad-uate record and appropriate academicpreparation. Normally, at least threeyears of Chinese, Japanese, or Korean atthe college level and substantial coursework in Asian culture are required toenter the Ph.D. program. THE M.A. PROGRAM The M.A. program is designed for students who seek specialized and indi-vidualized enhancement of their under-graduate education. The departmentoffers an array of language courses at alllevels in Chinese, Japanese, and Koreanfor the further development of languagecapability. Besides language instruc-tion, the department offers a widerange of courses in modern Asian cul-ture, with emphasis on the literature,lm, and visual culture of China, Japan,and Korea. Many of these courses treatthese subjects in the context of suchglobal issues as socialism, colonialism,fascism, and modernization. In workingout their individual course of study,those seeking the M.A. degree are expected to balance out the differentcomponents of the program. For thosewho are interested, some course workand guidance on premodern China isalso available. Language Requirements: The M.A. degree in East Asian studies requiresdemonstrated student acquisition oftwo languages other than English. As arule, one of these languages must beChinese, Japanese, or Korean andattainment must be at a high level ofprociency. While it is preferable forstudents to develop research compe-tence in at least two East Asian lan-guages, students are permitted to use aEuropean language as their secondchoice. Students may select one of the fol- lowing two options, met by formalcourse work, or its approved equivalent: Chinese: third-year level in modern Chinese; rst-year level in Japanese. Japanese: third-year level in Japanese; rst-year level in Chinese or Korean. Korean: third-year level in Korean; rst-year level in Chinese or Japanese Students are expected to be exam- ined for language prociency. Degree Requirements: After success- ful completion of 32 points of credit incourses selected in consultation with afaculty adviser and the director ofgraduate studies, the student must passa written examination prepared andread by two members of the faculty.The student must also submit aresearch paper on an approved specialproject to be read by two members ofthe faculty. When the paper has beenaccepted, and the student has success-fully passed the general examination,the student is awarded the M.A.degree. Course of Study: In the rst year, the student should take two to four lan-guage courses toward fullling the lan-guage requirements; one course fromthe Seminar on East Asian Studiesseries; one course from the Theory andMethodology Seminars; and othercourses in his or her chosen eld. 115 EAST ASIAN STUDIESFacultyThe intellectual strength and identityof our graduate program lies, rst of all,in its sharp focus on the modern periodand in its dedication to a theoreticallyinformed, interdisciplinary approach tothe study of culture and society of mod-ern East Asia. Our core faculty mem-bers specialize in modern Chinese,Japanese, and Korean languages and lit-eratures, Chinese and Japanese lm andmedia studies, modern Chinese andJapanese intellectual and cultural his-tory, modern Korean society, and com-parative studies of nationalism,colonialism, revolution, and culturalpolitics. This unit of expertise is furtherreinforced by an array of associatedmembers in history, anthropology, reli-gious studies, art history, and cinemastudies whose work is mainly concernedwith modern East Asia. This intellec-tual conguration, both sound in a tra-ditional academic sense and marking adeparture from the older area studiesmodel, allows us to address many deep-seated and pressing issues of modernEast Asia\u2014as they take shape in thecomplex of global relations\u2014with adepth of knowledge and critical rigor.Harry Harootunian, Professor, History, East Asian Studies.

The bulkof the course work during the secondyear, however, should be taken in thestudent's chosen eld under variousspecialized \"topics\" (Chinese literature,Chinese history, Japanese literature,Japanese visual culture, Korean lm,East Asian cinema, etc.). A total of fourtopics courses must be taken withinthe student's chosen eld. THE PH.D. PROGRAM Each student's program is determinedin consultation with a faculty adviserand with the director of graduate stud-ies in East Asian studies. Courses inother departments may be includedwhenever appropriate. Courses relevantto the student's research but not avail-able at NYU may be taken throughthe Inter-University Consortium withColumbia University, CUNY GraduateCenter, the New School, and PrincetonUniversity. In order to complete the Ph.D. requirements, the student must acquire72 points, which are equivalent to 18 courses. Among those, 40 points,including Independent Study, must betaken within East Asian studies, whileothers can be completed through courses taken outside of East Asianstudies, such as directed readingcourses and research credits (a maxi-mum of 16 research credits can betaken over ve semesters). In the rst year, the student should enroll in two to four language coursestoward fullling the language require-ments. At the end of the rst year, thestudent is required to complete aresearch paper, based on the two com-pleted rst-year seminars, thataddresses the theoretical-historicalquestions concerning the eld of EastAsian studies. This paper is separatefrom the term papers required by eachcourse and constitutes a part of thegeneral examination. Two members ofthe faculty (one of whom is the stu-dent's adviser) grade the examination.In the event of a failed performance,the student is permitted to retake theexamination after consultation with hisor her adviser. During the second year of study, the student is also required to fulllthe language requirements, includingthe requirement in a second East Asianlanguage and/or a major European lan-guage, by either signing up for lan-guage or nonlanguage courses offeredin Chinese, Japanese, or Korean. Thebulk of the course work during the sec-ond year, however, should concentrateon the chosen eld under various spe-cialized \"topics\" (in Chinese literature,Chinese history, Japanese literature,Japanese visual culture, Korean lm, East Asian cinema, etc.). A total of fourtopics courses must be completedwithin the student's chosen eld Course work in the third year is designed to allow the student to renewhis or her inquiry in theory andmethodology and to explore researchareas that are interdisciplinary innature. By the rst half of the thirdyear, the student should have nishedall the required courses in East Asianstudies. The student is advised to takethe qualifying examination in threedistinctively different subelds of EastAsian studies by the end of the thirdyear. A three-member faculty commit-tee (including the student's adviser) isformed for each student taking thequalifying exam. The student and theadviser decide on the formation of thecommittee after consultation. After thesuccessful completion of the qualifyingexamination, the student submits adissertation prospectus, which shouldinclude a thesis and methodologicalstatement, a preliminary table of con-tents, a bibliography, etc. The studentmust pass the oral examination basedon his or her prospectus to advance tocandidacy. The dissertation prospectuscommittee continues to function as thestudent's dissertation committee, withpossible additional members fromwithin or outside of New YorkUniversity. CoursesThe following is a selected list ofdepartmental course offerings: Historical Epics of China and Japan G33.0726 Roberts. 4 points. An in-depth study of the major epics ofChina, Japan, and Vietnam, from thehistorical-military and the social-roman-tic. The Chinese historical epic Three Kingdoms is read against the Japanese epic Tale of the Heike. Emphasis is placed on the political nature of the dynasticstate form, the types of legitimacy andthe forms of rebellion, the process ofbreakdown and reintegration of animperial house, the empire as dynastyand as territory, and the range of charac-terology. In the second half of thecourse, the Chinese classic Dream of the Red Chamber is read against the Japanese The Tale of Genji. In addition to the above-mentioned topics, attention isgiven to the role of women and mar-riage in a governing elite, the modali-ties of social criticism in a novel of man- ners. The Vietnamese national classicTale of Kieu is used as an introduction to the course because it combines all of thekey topics. Particular attention is givento the ways in which Buddhist, Daoist,and Confucian doctrines function ineach work. First-Year Seminar: Introduction to Critical Asian Studies G33.1001 4 points.This course is an introductory seminaroffered to rst-year graduate students inEast Asian studies. The seminar pro-vides a critical overview of the social,political, intellectual, and institutionalhistory of the eld of East Asian studies. Readings in Japanese Humanities and Social Sciences: AcademicProse and Critical TerminologyG33.1280 Hanawa. 4 points. Scholarly reading and research in mod-ern Japanese. With varied content, approaches, and organization, thiscourse exposes students to modern lit-erary and expository works, and partic-ularly to academic prose. Texts areselected to reflect circuits of knowledgeand the development of disciplinarycharacteristics in style. Some emphasisis paid to the choice of text in order tofacilitate familiarization of critical ter-minology. Particular attention is givento the role of translation as a means ofconsidering the circulation of academicand intellectual terminology (and con-cepts) and the development of lan-guage by which academic discourse isconducted. The course also introducesstudents to some of the key referencework and methodology for solvingproblems of reading and interpretationat an advanced level.117 EAST ASIAN STUDIESEthnographic Traditions: East Asia: of China G33.1315 Identical to Zito. 4 points.This course provides toencounter ethnographies produced byeld-working anthropologists workingin the People's Republic of China and inTaiwan and the methodological and the-oretical problems they raise. The courseopens with discussion of the founding ofanthropological inquiry and pursues itsvexed relationship to the state all alongthe way. Areas of social life that are cov-ered include issues of family, embodi-ment, exchange, memory, sexuality andgender, minority ethnicity, religious life, violence. Students have the oppor-tunity to watch some lms and hearinvited anthropologists share experi-ences with them. History and Capitalism G33.1747 Identical to G57.1747. Harootunian. 4 points. Material Culture in Chinese History G33.1917 Identical to G57.1917. W aley-Cohen. 4 points.Material culture and the nature of con-sumption in China, focusing mainly onthe mid-Ming to the late Qing period,approximately 1550-1850. The coursehas three main, interlocking goals.First, it introduces students to some ofthe current theoretical scholarship onmaterial culture and consumption inthe West; second, it provides studentswith a deep knowledge of Chinese elitesocial and cultural practices during thisperiod; and third, it addresses, withinthe context of material culture and con-sumption, the currently much-debatedissue of continuity and change from thelate Ming to the period immediatelypreceding the age of imperialism inChina. Overarching themes includeperiodization, urbanization, commer-cialization, internationalization, gender,and aesthetics. Students explore theseissues through number of specicaspects of material culture, includingprinting and publishing; court culture;textiles, clothing, and fashion; art,including collecting and connoisseur-ship; and architecture and gardens. Problems in the History of Early Modern China G33.1919 Identical to G57.1919. W aley-Cohen. 4 points.Advanced reading-intensive courseintended for those who have alreadytaken at least one and preferably twocourses in Chinese history and/or those with an interest in world history.Explores some of the most hotlydebated issues concerning China 1500-1900. General topics include empire and ethnicity; China and the globaleconomy; intellectual life; gender rela-tions; urbanization; material culture andconsumption; civil society and the exis-tence of a public sphere. Requirementsinclude intensive reading assignments,active class participation, and threepapers (5-10 pages each). The Asiatic Mode of Production: Theory and History G33.2530 Karl. 4 points.Investigates aspects of the historicalinterpretation of China in the 19th and20th centuries, focusing on the genesisand development of one of the mostdebated and enduring tropes of the his-toriography of China: the Asiatic modeof production. Colonialism and Modernism in East Asia G33.2570 4 points. An exploration into the cultural andintellectual history of modernism inEast Asia. Particular attention is givento the relationship between modernismand various East Asian social formationsof colonialism. Concepts such as colonialmodernity, semicolonialism, and post-colonialism are interrogated throughintensive reading both of theoreticalwork on modernism and colonialismand modernist cultural texts. Althougha major emphasis is placed on literarymodernism, it is understood as part of abroader historical phenomenon thatencompassed artists, philosophers, andother intellectuals. Contemporary essaysare juxtaposed with novels and shortstories, and, where possible, othermedia. The course also builds on therecent proliferation of research on modernism in East Asia. Where possible, emphasis is placed on theinterconnected nature of modernism in East Asia. Structures of Modernity G33.2700 Looser. 4 points.This course starts with\u2014and aims torethink\u2014the basic theoretical terms andpractical conditions of mass culture andeveryday life as denitive of modernity.In part, the course is framed by claimsmade in new media theory (especiallywith regard to the advent of digitalelectronic technologies) and the ways inwhich new media supposedly are plac-ing us within new world horizons.Modernity, however, is made up of mul-tiple moments of \"new media\"; thiscourse provides historical perspective onthese moments. Nor does the courseassume a technological determinism; inaddition to changing relations between\"new\" media (including theatre, lm, and animation), it examines the chang-ing structuring of experience in terms ofnarrative form; architecture; art; andurbanism. One of the unifying concerns,however, is history itself and the ways inwhich differing material conditions cre-ate new visions of, and positions within,history. History, therefore, is one of themeans through which new media condi-tions claim to allow the rethinking of,and critique of, the grounds of modernexperience. Emphasis is placed onJapan, but comparative material isdrawn from elsewhere in Asia and theWest; the context is for the most partglobal. Literary Theory: Comparison and Comparability: TheoreticalConsiderations on ComparativeLiterature and Area StudiesG33.3610 Identical to G29.3610. 4 points. Cinema and Modernity: Melodramatic ImaginationsG33.3615 Yoshimoto . 4 points. Examination of melodrama as a lm genre and as a mode specically articulatingmodern experiences. Melodrama hasbeen extensively studied and analyzedsince the early 1970s. Unfortunately, avibrant theoretical inquiry into melo-drama has been almost exclusivelybased on the study of Hollywood eventhough melodramatic lm practicesoccupy a central position in cinemas ofso many other countries. In this semi-nar, students focus on Japanese lmmelodrama as a genre and as a mode ofimagination negotiating the Japaneseself-identity in the age of modernityleading up to our contemporary times.The seminar's approach is fundamen-tally comparative: rst become familiarwith Hollywood melodrama and theextensive scholarship on this subject;then, closely dissect concrete Japaneselms and relevant written texts notonly to probe into the specicity ofJapanese lm melodrama but also tocritique and revise the existing melo-drama theory and criticism. RELATED INSTITUTE OF FINE ARTS COURSES Theories of Modernity G43.2536 Hay. 4 points.This colloquium seeks to introduce,and critique from a non-Western per-spective, some of the theories ofmodernity that have been developed inrecent decades by Western historians(De Certeau), sociologists (Giddens,118 EAST ASIAN STUDIESLuhmann), and cultural theorists (Jameson). The course consists of a mix-ture of lectures by the instructor andcollective close readings by the class.This \"pure theory\" course should beparticularly useful to students specializ-ing in modern or early modern art. Seminar: Ink Painting in Socialist China, 1949-1976 G43.3010 Hay. 4 points.The arrival of the Chinese CommunistParty to power in 1949 led many artistswith a modernist training to give upthe media associated with modernismin favor of ink painting; these artists were later joined by others originallytrained in socialist realism. It also ledto a demand for the depiction of social-ist themes by ink painters of all kinds,including those with a purely tradi-tional training. As a result, ink paintersdeveloped new iconographies for and gure painting; intro-duced genresof flower, plant, and tree painting; andcreated new rhetorics of style. Onceconsidered outside China as merecuriosities, to be appreciated despitetheir socialist themes for their evidentskill, these paintings of the 1950s and 1960s have beneted from historicaldistance. Today, it can be argued thatthey represent a more considerableartistic achievement than Chinesesocialist realism, which itself hasrecently been the object of positivereevaluation. This course reconstructsthis achievement in its broad lines andmakes the case for the integration ofpost-1949 ink painting into a globalhistory of modern art. No prior studyof Chinese painting is required.EconomicsDEPARTMENT OF FacultyJushan Bai, Professor. ale. game theory; indus- trial Bisin, (economics), M.A. 1990,Chicago; Laurea 1987, Bocconi.

Programs and RequirementsAdmission: Admission to graduate studies in economics is limited to stu-dents of outstanding promise. Allapplicants must take the general test ofthe Graduate Record Examination(GRE). All international students musttake the Test of English as a ForeignLanguage (TOEFL). Exceptions to thisrule include students who received abachelor's master's degree from anEnglish-speaking college-level institu-tion. Students from English-speakingcountries, such as the United Kingdomor Ireland, are also exempt from takingthe TOEFL. The M.A. program is designed to accommodate both full-time and part-time students. The Ph.D. program isdesigned for full-time students only.Applicants for the M.A. programshould have mastered intermediatemicroeconomics, intermediate macro-economics, at least one semester of cal-culus, and a course in statistics\u2014allwith a grade of B+ or better. Theymust also obtain GRE quantitative andanalytical scores in the 75th percentileand above (preferably above 720 forquantitative scores and above 5.0 foranalytical scores. GMAT scores areaccepted in lieu of the GRE (for theM.A. program only). International students should aim for TOEFL scoresabove 260 for the computer-based ver-sion, above 620 for the paper-basedversion, and above 105 for theInternet-based version. Successfulapplicants may also be required to takea diagnostic language evaluation test atthe American Language Institute atNYU and additional English languagecourses tailored to the needs of gradu-ate students. Applicants should have agrade point average of at least 3.25 in their undergraduate work. For studentsapplying to the Ph.D. program, theM.A. requirements should be supple-mented by at least one additionalsemester of calculus and one course inlinear algebra. In evaluating applicantsfor either of the above programs, mem-bers of the departmental admissionscommittee consider the following cri-teria: previous academic performance,quantitative GRE scores, letters of rec-ommendation, personal statement, andeconomics as well as mathematicsbackgrounds. Because of the diversenature of such information, the admis-sions committee does not adhere tostrictly dened cutoff points on gradepoint averages or GRE scores. All incoming full-time Ph.D. stu- dents are guaranteed nancial aid,renewable for four years, conditionedon satisfactory academic performance.Financial support includes certain obli-gations to provide teaching assistanceand may be conditioned on the pres-ence or absence of outside funding.There is no funding for M.A. students. It is important to note that students who want to enter the Ph.D. programshould not start off with the M.A. pro-gram. The Ph.D. and M.A. programsare separate and distinct; entry into theM.A. program does not guarantee entryinto the Ph.D. program. MASTER OF ARTS A master's degree in economics is anincreasingly essential degree in a globaleconomy. The M.A. program in eco-nomics at New York University com-bines analytical rigor with an appliedfocus. It provides students with a solid background in advanced economics fora career in business and government. Itenables students to upgrade their tech-nical skills in applied economic andstatistical analysis. It is also an excel-lent preparatory degree for graduateprograms (e.g., Ph.D. in economics,law degree) elsewhere in the UnitedStates. Graduates have been employed at Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg, Citicorp,and Credit Suisse. Other graduates havebeen admitted to Ph.D. programs ineconomics (e.g., Boston University),law schools (e.g., Columbia University),and public policy schools (e.g., SyracuseUniversity). The M.A. degree in economics requires a minimum of three semestersof full-time study. The time limit forcompletion of the degree is ve yearsfor both full- and part-time students. Course of Study: Formal requirements for the Master of Arts degree in eco-nomics are the satisfactory completionof graduate studies totaling at least 32 points and the writing of a specialproject report. In order to graduate,students must complete at least 24 points within the Department ofEconomics at New York University(i.e., courses with a G31 prex).(Transfer credits do not count towardthis requirement.) Most courses carry 3 points; the special project carries 2 points. Students must have a cumu-lative GPA of at least 3.0 (B) with 18 points of B (3.0) or better. Studentsmay take 8 points outside theDepartment of Economics. 122 ECONOMICSThe M.A. degree requires ve core courses, ve elective courses, and a spe-cial project in economic research. The ve core courses are Mathematics for Economists(G31.1001), Microeconomic Theory(G31.1003), Macroeconomic Theory I(G31.1005), Applied Statistics andEconometrics I (G31.1101), andApplied Statistics and Econometrics II(G31.1102). Special Project in Economic Research (G31.3200) is taken in thenal or penultimate semester. The aimof the course is to integrate materialand tools that have been taughtthroughout the M.A. program inaddressing applied economic and policyproblems. Students are encouraged toapproach research questions from out-side a narrow specialization and to con-sider linkages between different elds. Elective courses are selected from the department's regular course offer-ings. Students may also select relevantcourses at the NYU Leonard N. SternSchool of Business. This strategy isdesigned to give students a well-rounded education that will be usefulafter graduation in the nonacademicworld. In addition to regular courses ineconomics, students take courses innance, accounting, international busi-ness, and operations research at Stern.Highly qualied M.A. students prepar-ing for a Ph.D. program may also takecourses in the graduate division of theDepartment of Mathematics at theCourant Institute of MathematicalSciences, which offers balanced trainingin mathematics and its applications inthe broadest sense. MASTER OF ARTS AND ADVANCED CERTIFICATEPROGRAM IN APPLIED ECONOMIC ANALYSIS The department offers an advanced cer- ticate program in applied economicanalysis with areas of study in eco-nomic development and internationaleconomics. Participating students musttake the required core courses (listedabove) and complete the M.A. specialproject report. After receiving theM.A. degree, students may continuetheir studies to earn an advanced cer-ticate with the opportunity to focuson one of the areas of study. (Theadvanced certicate option is also avail-able to qualied master's-level studentsholding degrees from institutions otherthan New York University.) A mini-mum of six specialized courses is required. When certain requiredcourses are not offered, the departmentmay substitute other appropriatecourses to satisfy the requirements forthe advanced certicate. Economic Development: This area of study is designed for those concernedwith economic study of developmentpolicies in the less developed countries.It is geared to those planning careerswith governments of developing coun-tries, the United Nations and otherinternational institutions, U.S. govern-ment agencies concerned with develop-ment and foreign assistance, andcorporations doing business in the lessdeveloped countries as well as otherprivate organizations. Requirements include the core courses; G31.1603; where appropriate,G31.3001, 3002; additional electivepoints to complete 32 points; and aspecial project report. For the advanced certificate, three additional courses must be selectedfrom G31.1505; G31.1506;G31.1605; G31.1608; and, whereappropriate, G31.3001, 3002. A total of 41 points at minimum isrequired for the M.A. and theadvanced certificate. International Economics: The objec- tive of the international economics areaof study is to train economists to func-tion effectively in international organi-zations such as the United Nations andits related agencies, regional economicgroups such as the European Union orthe Latin American Free TradeAssociation, national government bod-ies such as central banks and tradeministries, and companies in the pri-vate sector. Requirements include the core courses; G31.1505; G31.1506;G31.1402; and, where appropriate,G31.3001, 3002. A total of 32 pointsand a special project report completethe requirements for the M.A. For the advanced certicate, three additional courses must be selectedfrom Management (B40.3388). Atotal of 41 points at minimum isrequired for the M.A. and the advancedcerticate. Note: Courses designated by num- bers beginning with the letter B areoffered by the Leonard N. Stern Schoolof Business. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Doctor of Philosophy is a researchdegree. It signies that the recipient isable to conduct independent researchand has both a broad basic knowledgeof all areas of economics and a compre-hensive knowledge of one area in par-ticular. To qualify for the doctorate, astudent must satisfactorily completegraduate studies totaling at least 72points (at least 64 in residence at NewYork University), pass three Ph.D.comprehensive examinations (in micro-economics, macroeconomics, and onearea of specialization), write and present a third-year paper and, nally,defend an acceptable dissertation.Fields of specialization include eco-nomic theory (including game theory),monetary theory and macroeconomics,political economy, econometrics, indus-trial organization, international eco-nomics, labor economics, developmenteconomics, and Austrian economics. After passing all three Ph.D. com- prehensive examinations and havingcompleted 72 points of graduate work,a student is asked to submit a formaldissertation proposal. This serves as thebasis for a preliminary oral examina-tion. When the dissertation is com-pleted and approved by three facultymembers, a public oral examination isheld, at which research results are pre-sented and defended by the candidatebefore a faculty committee. Reading prociency in a foreign lan- guage is required, demonstrated by anyof the methods described in the Degree Requirements section of this bulletin. Course requirements include Mathematics for Economists I(G31.1021) and II (G31.1022);Microeconomic Theory I (G31.1023)and II (G31.1024); orMicroeconometrics Ph.D. at least two 3000-level courses (advancedcourses, seminar/workshops).

StarrCenter for Applied Economics.Students have the opportunity to asso-ciate with the Center's prominent visi-tors and distinguished researchscholars. PURPOSE The C.V . Starr Center for AppliedEconomics is the research branch of theDepartment of Economics at New YorkUniversity. The Center seeks to bridgethe gap between academic research andeconomic decisions in both businessand government. The Center analyzes issues of important economic and socialconsequences to improve tomorrow'seconomic decisions. These goals arepursued by the Center in three ways:analysis of current economic issues,design of tools to facilitate economicdecision making in the future, andwide dissemination of research resultsthrough publications, seminars, andconferences. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES The research activities of the Center areorganized into two categories: short-term projects and long-term projects. Short-term projects are major research projects that seek to completea specic piece of applied economicresearch in a period not exceeding 12 months. Long-term projects are major research endeavors focusing on topics ofsuch fundamental intellectual impor- tance that one can expect the projectwill be continued past the terminationof the Center's funding. These projectstypically involve at least two membersof the Center/Department of Economicsat New York University. VISITORS PROGRAM Since its inception, the Center hasfunded a vigorous visitors program forleading academics from both theUnited States and abroad. These visi-tors have immersed themselves inmany Center research activities, includ-ing seminar presentations, workingpaper publications, and research collab-orations. Because of the Center's closeafliation with the Department ofEconomics, graduate students have theopportunity to exchange ideas withthese distinguished visitors. 123 ECONOMICSFirst Year Fall Semester Microeconomic Theory IMacroeconomic Theory IMathematics for Economists IEconometrics I Spring Microeconomic Theory IIMacroeconomic Theory IIMathematics for Economists IIEconometrics IISecond Year Fall Semester MicroeconometricsField Course I (Part I)Field Course II (Part I)Elective Course Spring Semester MacroeconometricsField Course I (Part II)Field Course II (Part II)Elective Course Third Year Fall Semester Seminar Workshop Spring Semester Seminar WorkshopDUAL DEGREE PROGRAMS The Department of Economics offers dual degree M.A.-J.D. and Ph.D.-J.D.programs with the School of Law.Interested students should contact thedirector of graduate studies.

Programs and RequirementsAdmission: Applications are accepted for programs leading to the M.F.A.degree, the M.A. degree with a concen-tration in creative writing, and thePh.D. and M.A. degrees in English andAmerican literature. Applicants for allof these programs must submit com-pleted applications and the followingsupporting documentation: a statementof purpose, Graduate RecordExamination (GRE) general test results,one ofcial copy of the transcript fromeach university previously attended (the Creative Writing Program requires twocopies of each transcript), and three let-ters of recommendation. Applicants whose native language is not English must submit Test ofEnglish as a Foreign Language(TOEFL) results unless they havereceived their undergraduate degreefrom an accredited American collegeor university or from a college or uni-versity where the language of instruc-tion is English. Near-native fluency in English is crucial for successful com-pletion of all the programs offered bythe department. All application materials and sup- porting documents must be sentdirectly to Graduate EnrollmentServices (see the GSAS Application for Admission and Financial Aid for instruc- tions). Applications submitted directlyto the department are not considered.The department and the Creative132 ENGLISHWriting Program withdraw from con- sideration all applications that aremissing supporting documents onemonth after the posted deadline. Applicants for the M.A. programs and for the M.F.A. program areaccepted into those programs only.Applicants for the Ph.D. program whoare not accepted into that program areconsidered for the M.A. program ifthey request it in a cover letter.Students who have completed or willhave completed an M.A. or M.F.A.degree at New York University mayapply for the Ph.D. program. Theymust meet all the requirements for thePh.D. application. They may submit anew statement of purpose, a new writ-ing sample, and additional letters ofrecommendation. Their applicationsare considered along with applicationssubmitted by external candidates. English and American Literature Applicants: In addition to the items listed above, which are requiredthroughout the Graduate School ofArts and Science, applicants for theM.A. or Ph.D. program in English andAmerican literature must also submitresults of the GRE subject test inEnglish and a writing sample (10-12pages). The department considersapplications for the M.A. or Ph.D. pro-gram in English and American litera-ture for fall admission only. Creative Writing Applicants: Applicants for the M.F.A. program orthe M.A. program with a concentrationin creative writing must also submit awriting sample, which should consist ofno more than 25 double-spaced, typedpages of ction (in a font size no smallerthan 12 points) or 10 single-spaced,typed pages of poetry (in a font size nosmaller than 12 points). The writingsample is the most important compo-nent of the application for the CreativeWriting Program (CWP). The CWPvery strongly prefers that applicants usethe online application and submit alldocuments through that process. If foran unusual reason an applicant cannot doso and must apply by mail, then twocopies of all materials should be sent toGraduate Enrollment Services, includingthe writing sample and each part of theapplication; the completed le is for-warded to the CWP .

The Program inEnvironmental Health Sciences collab-orates with other departments of theGraduate School of Arts and Science.For example, a collaborative doctoralprogram between biology and environ-mental health is designed for studentswho wish to obtain a solid foundationin biology while specializing in envi-ronmental health. A description of the programs can be obtained from the environmental health sciences(EHS) Web site at www.med.nyu.edu/ environmental/graduate or the biomechanics (ERBI) www.oioc.org under \"Education.\" Applicants for admission and fellow-ship support should contact the EHSgraduate coordinator at 845-731-3661or the ERBI program administrator at212-255-6690. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTHSCIENCES The M.S. program in environmental health sciences is a specialized course ofstudy providing students with theopportunity to develop applicable skillsand expertise in a selected subject area.It is designed for individuals needinggraduate training for employment injobs involving worker health and safety,health hazard communication, healthrisk assessment, and environmentalanalysis of toxicants, including relatedareas of administration and technicalsales. Potential employers include aca-demia, industry, consulting rms, tradeassociations, and local, state, and federalgovernmental agencies. The expansionof regulations in occupational safetyand health and environmental protec-tion provides increased career opportu-nities for individuals trained in variousaspects of environmental health sci-ences. The program can also providesecondary school teachers with theappropriate background to allow intro-duction of environmental science intotheir school's curriculum or into exist-ing science courses. The program of study, which may be full time or part time, emphasizesan understanding of how to applyappropriate scientic methodology tothe solution of real-world environmen-tal problems. It provides the student with a basic background in areas ofenvironmental pollution, toxicology,and biostatistics and also with practicalknowledge on how to present scienticdata and how to properly interpret sci-entic reports. Beyond this, the courseof study is individualized to the needsand interests of the particular student.To this end, students may take relevantcourses in other schools within theUniversity, for example, in environ-mental management and planning,environmental law, risk assessment,and environmental impact assessment. Admission: Applicants to the M.S. program in environmental health sci-ences are generally expected to have abachelor's degree in a scientic eld,such as biology, chemistry, physics,engineering, or a related discipline.Exceptions to this may be made on anindividual basis depending on theselected course of study. Generaladmission guidelines are an overallGPA of 3.0 (on a scale of 4.0) andGRE scores of 500 verbal, 600 quanti-tative, and 4.5 analytical writing. Financial Support and Costs: All successful full-time M.S. applicants(ERBI candidates not included) In the 2006-2007 academic year, the stipend was$13,000 plus tuition and fees. A com-prehensive list of University, GraduateSchool, and departmental fellowships,prizes, and awards appears in theFinancing Graduate Education section of the GSAS Application for Admission and Financial Aid. This information is also available on the GSAS Web site athttp://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.nancialaid. Course of Study: Awarding of the M.S. degree is dependent on the following: 1. The successful completion of 36 points of course work, of which at least24 must be in residence at theGraduate School of Arts and Science.Some M.S. tracks require additionalcourse work. 2. The satisfactory completion of a spe- cial project. Depending on the stu-dent's needs, this may be either alibrary thesis or a thesis based on a lab-oratory project performed under theguidance of a faculty member. The M.S. degree program in environ- mental health sciences offers two spe-cialized tracks: toxicology andenvironmental hygiene. The latterspecically focuses on the recognition,evaluation, and control of chemical andphysical agents in occupational set- tings. Required courses for the toxicol-ogy track are Environmental Health(G48.1004), Communication Skills forBiomedical Scientists (G48.2025),Introduction Biostatistics(G48.2303), Principles of and Organ (G48.2311). and Introduction toEpidemiology (G48.2039). In addition, students are required to attend departmental seminars andare strongly encouraged to attend jour-nal clubs. Laboratory rotations may bearranged in consultation with the stu-dent's academic adviser. Most coursesare offered at the Washington Squarecampus of New York University,located in Manhattan, and most of theresearch is performed in laboratories atSterling Forest in Tuxedo, New York,about 50 miles northwest ofManhattan. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN ERGONOMICS AND BIOMECHANICS The Program in Ergonomics and Biomechanics (ERBI) offers the Masterof Science degree to students who seekan advanced understanding of thesecomplementary disciplines. The ERBI program focuses on mus- culoskeletal ailments and utilizes amultidisciplinary approach to examineways of controlling musculoskeletaldisorders, injuries, and disabilities. Assuch, it emphasizes the complex inter-action of individual and environmentalfactors that lead to injury, disease,and/or disability. Applicants are expected to have the equivalent of an undergraduate degreein biology, physics, engineering, orhealth-related sciences with a totalmean grade of B (3.0) or higher.Acceptance is based on undergraduategrades, GRE scores, professional or aca-demic experience, letters of recommen-dation, and an interview. All studentsare required to have basic anatomy,physics, and calculus as prerequisites. The master's degree requires the successful completion of 36 points ofcourse work. The program is designedto provide the skills essential for thedevelopment and management of mus-144 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCESculoskeletal ailment prevention pro- grams in industry and the health careenvironment. The program also trainsthe student in basic research, studydesign, and the use of equipment andmeasurement techniques employed inergonomic and biomechanical evalua-tion and analysis. The master's program encourages students to participate in ongoingresearch in areas of ergonomics andbiomechanics. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Ph.D. program is designed to pre-pare scientists for active and productiveresearch careers and other professionalservice. The didactic portion of theprogram places a particular emphasison achieving a solid foundation in rele-vant basic sciences, while the researchportion provides trainees with theopportunity to design, conduct, andinterpret studies focused on specicscientic issues in environmentalhealth disciplines. The diversity of theresearch within the program allowstrainees to develop skills incorporatingtheir expertise using various investiga-tory approaches. Admission: Admission is based on a strong academic background in a basicor applied science as judged by priorundergraduate academic performance,recommendation letters, an interview,performance on the general GRE, priorgraduate studies, and any relevantwork or research experience. Generalguidelines for admission are as follows:an overall GPA of at least 3.0 (on ascale of 4.0), a major eld GPA of 3.3,and GRE scores of at least 550 verbal,600 quantitative, and 4.5 analyticalwriting. However, each application iscarefully considered, and there may beexceptions to the above. General Degree Requirements: A total of 72 points, as well as a doctoraldissertation, are required for the Ph.D.degree. At least 48 points must befrom didactic courses; the remainingcan be research and tutorial credits.Candidacy for the Ph.D. is achieved through a qualifying examination, andthe completed dissertation is thendefended in a nal oral examination.The qualifying examination consists oftwo stages: a written examination, andthe writing and oral defense of a spe-cic research project proposal (doctoraldissertation outline). Doctoral studentsare required to attend departmentalseminars and journal clubs. Studentsare encouraged to establish early andfrequent discussion with members ofthe faculty and to acquaint themselveswith the types of research activitiesconducted within the department. Thisenables them to explore mutual inter-ests, which facilitates the ultimateselection of a thesis research mentor. Tothis end, all rst-year predoctoral stu-dents (ERBI candidates not included)are required to begin participating in aformal series of rotations within labora-tories, selected on the basis of theirperceived interest and with the adviceand approval of their initial academicadviser. Presentations of availableresearch opportunities are given duringthe rst week of each academic year, inan orientation program at which fac-ulty members describe the researchopportunities in their laboratories. Allstudents in the program are required totake three core courses environmen-tal health toBiostatistics (G48.2310).In addition, students are also requiredto take certain courses in the basic sci-ences, the nature of which depends onthe specic area of concentration. Thesecourses are generally offered througheither the Department of Biology orthe Program in Basic Medical Sciences.Beyond the above requirements, thereare no universal course requirements.Thus, a specic program of study isarranged for each student that is appro-priate to his or her particular back-ground and career goals. Areas of Specialization: The six areas of specialization offered in the programare biostatistics, epidemiology, ergonomics and biomechanics, toxicology/carcinogenesis,and toxicology (see www.med.nyu.edu/ environmental/graduate/phd.html for details on these specializations). Thedistinctions between these areas aremore for academic planning than fortrainee research, as there is much over-lap in the research approaches avail-able. The full range of researchresources within the program andexpertise of the faculty are available toall trainees regardless of the specializa-tion selected. Financial Support and Costs: All successful full-time Ph.D. applicants(ERBI candidates not included) aresupported by graduate assistantshipsfor up to six years. The stipend for the2006-2007 academic year was $26,000plus tuition and fees. A comprehensivelist of University, Graduate School, anddepartmental fellowships, prizes, andawards appears in the Financing Graduate Education section of the GSAS Application for Admission and FinancialAid. This information is also available on the GSAS Web site at http://gsas .nyu.edu/page/grad.nancialaid.

Fleming he Center for European andMediterraneanStudies supports and promotes the study of con-temporary Europe, both Westand East, within the College andthe Graduate School of Arts andScience and between the latterand the professional schools ofthe University. It complementsexisting European programs inboth the humanities and thesocial sciences, such as theInstitute of French Studies, theprogram in Italian studies coor-dinated by the Casa ItalianaZerilli-Marim\u00f2, and theAlexander S. Onassis Program inHellenic Studies, by offeringcourses and lectures on othermajor Western European soci-eties and cultures as well as on Central and Eastern Europe. Italso offers courses, researchopportunities, and noncurricularlectures and seminars on theEuropean Community and onEuropean issues that transcendnational borders. Normally theCenter does not offer courses insubjects that are covered by otherdepartments. The Center offersan undergraduate major andminor in European studies aswell as a Master of Arts program. The programs, activities, and funding opportunities offered bythe Center and listed below arepartly supported by funds from agrant provided by the U.S.Department of Education, whichin 1991 designated the Center,along with the Institute for theStudy of Europe at ColumbiaUniversity, as a National ResourceCenter for Western Europe. Thetwo units operate together as the New York Consortium forEuropean Studies in outreachefforts toward other schools andcolleges in the region, researchplanning, and sharing of visitinglecturers. Cooperation within thisconsortium permits graduate stu-dents to cross-register for coursesat our partner institution. Thegrant also funds the ForeignLanguage and Studies(FLAS) Fellowship Program,which full-year and fellowshipsfor graduate students in variousdisciplines who are conductingresearch on Western Europe. The Center represents the University in the Council forEuropean Studies, a nationalassociation of European pro-grams, and in expanding rela-tions with similar programs inEuropean universities. 285 MERCER STREET, 7th FLOOR NEW YORK, NY 10003-6653 212-998-3838 FAX: 212-995-4188 STUDIESPrograms and RequirementsMASTER OF ARTS The Master of Arts program in European studies is an interdisciplinaryprogram in the social sciences andhumanities designed to prepare stu-dents for professions requiring anadvanced understanding of Europe.The program draws upon the estab-lished resources of existing countryprograms in French studies, Italianstudies, and Hellenic studies, as well asthe disciplinary programs, and alsooffers courses of its own. M.A. studentschoose one of three tracks for special-ization: European culture and society;European politics and policy; orMediterranean studies. Eight courses (32 points), a thesis or a special project, and an oral exami-nation are required for the M.A.degree. Of the eight courses, two arerequired (an introductory course, WhatIs Europe?, and the graduate researchseminar in European studies). Thedegree may be completed in 12months, that is, two semesters and asummer session. Students are stronglyrecommended to complete their sum-mer session at one of NYU's studyabroad sites in Europe. Students in theMediterranean studies track usuallyspend the summer session in Athens;summer programs are also available inFlorence and Paris, as well as at theNew York campus. Knowledge of a European language (other than English) at the advancedlevel is also required. Students canprove this advanced knowledge eitherby having completed during theirundergraduate studies an advanced-level language course or by passing theGSAS foreign language prociencyexamination prior to graduation.Knowledge of a second European lan-guage is also encouraged. A 4-pointinternship approved by the M.A.adviser is recommended. STUDY ABROAD Candidates for the M.A. degree inEuropean studies are encouraged tospend their summer session abroad.RESEARCH WORKSHOPS AND EVENTS Research Workshops: These ongoing study groups are made up of facultyand graduate students from New YorkUniversity and other area institutionsand aim to help rene and designresearch projects, both individual andcollective. Currently the organized workshops are as follows: Assessment. Faculty Colloquia: A series of public lectures, the Center for European andMediterranean Studies Lecture Series, isorganized by the Center primarily tobring specialists from Europe and fromother American universities to theNYU community. Speakers from theUnited States and Europe focus onsuch issues as immigration, class rela-tions, the political construction ofEurope, nationalism, and the relation-ship between politics and culture. Conferences: The Center organizes national or regional conferences onEuropean subjects, open to faculty andgraduate students. Conferences held in2005-2007 \"The German Presences inthe U.S. and Post-Cold War Germany.\" Film Series: Each year the Center for European and Mediterranean Studieshas addressed timely and relevantEuropean issues through its student-run lm series. All events are free andopen to the public. The spring 2006 lm series, Balkan Conflict: Internal, External, Eternal?,explored the roots and workings ofBalkan conflict\u2014ethnic, social, eco-nomic, political, and religious. Can theres of hatred be extinguished, or willthey continue blazing into the 21stcentury? Five Balkan directors haveattempted to answer that complexquestion, while also producing master- ful works of cinematic art, such as thefollowing: The Hostage (Constantine Giannaris, Greece); Before FACILITIES The Center's ofces include a seminarroom and a modest document and peri-odical collection dealing with contem-porary Western and Eastern Europe.The latter includes journals, weeklies,and newsletters from European centersand institutions. The NYU LawLibrary is a depository of ofcial docu-ments of the European Community,and the Elmer Holmes Bobst Libraryhas a wide selection of European news-papers and periodicals in addition tostrong book collections on all aspectsof contemporary Europe. The Centerassists Bobst Library in developing itsEuropean holdings.

Marincola he Institute of Fine Arts (IFA) isdedicated to grad-uate teaching and research in the history of art andarchaeology and in the conserva-tion of works of art. The Instituteoffers programs leading to the degrees of Master of Arts andDoctor of Philosophy, theAdvanced Certicate in Conserva-tion of Works of Art in conjunc-tion with the M.A. program, andthe Certicate in CuratorialStudies issued jointly with theMetropolitan Museum of Art inconjunction with the Ph.D. pro-gram. The courses of study pre-pare students to enter careers inuniversity teaching, museumwork, independent scholarship,art criticism, and art conservation.The Institute strives to give its students, whatever their goals, asound knowledge in the historyof art and a foundation in schol-arship and connoisseurship as abasis for independent criticaljudgment and research. To thestudent who goes beyond themaster's degree to the doctorate,the Institute provides a deeperunderstanding of a major area ofthe subject and develops a capac-ity for independent scholarship.Research is as important a partof the program as instruction. 1 EAST 78TH STREET NEW NY M.A. and Certicate(conservation) 1990, New York; B.A.1981, Brown.

Programs and RequirementsAdmission: In addition to the require- ments for admission to the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science (see theAdmission section of this bulletin), can- didates for the Institute of Fine Artsmust have a good background in theliberal arts, normally including at leastfour courses of undergraduate art his-tory. The Graduate Record Examinationis required of all applicants. The exami-nation must be taken sufciently inadvance to ensure that the scores appearon the application when reviewed. (SeeConservation Center, below, for additional requirements for admission to the con-servation program.) Applicants arerequired to make up deciencies in theirpreliminary preparation. As part of the admission procedure, applicants with a master's degree in arthistory are requested to provide a copyof their thesis or another research paperto be read by a faculty member in theappropriate eld. For further admission information, consult the Academic Ofce, Instituteof Fine Arts, 1 East 78th Street, 212-992-5800; e-mail: ifa.program@nyu.edu. Also see the GSAS Application for Admission and Financial Aid. Registration: Fall, spring, and limited summer registration takes place byappointment made through theAcademic Ofce. Students from otherNew York University programs mustconsult the Academic Ofce before reg-istering for a course at the Institute.(See the calendar in the Announcement of Courses for details on the registration periods.)Nonmatriculated Status: A student in another university's graduate art his-tory program may register for coursesat the Institute by applying for nonde-gree status, with the permission of theIFA director of graduate studies,through the Graduate EnrollmentServices ofce of the Graduate Schoolof Arts and Science. Advisement: Each student in the rst semester is assigned a member of thefaculty as the adviser with whom he or she plans a program and consultsregularly. Minimum Program: During the rst year of study, each student registers fora minimum of ve courses. Exceptionsare made only for urgent reasons andmust have the approval of the directorof graduate studies. The conservationtraining program must be followed ona full-time basis only. MASTER OF ARTS Language Requirements: To succeed in their graduate and professionalcareers, M.A. students need to beequipped to read the modern scholarlyliterature in art history, archaeology,and conservation. To this end, they areexpected to demonstrate reading pro-ciency in two modern languages otherthan English by passing a written lan-guage examination in each. In princi-ple, these two languages are Germanand French. The rst examination mustbe taken at the beginning of the stu-dent's rst semester at the Institute,with a failure made up in the followingsemester. The Institute administerswritten examinations in German and French in fall, winter, and spring; datesare posted on the academic calendar.Application to the director of graduatestudies is required to take either lan-guage examination for a third time. Under rare circumstances, if Italian or Spanish is the primary scholarly lan-guage in the student's eld of special-ization, that student's faculty advisermay recommend that the student beexamined in that language instead ofFrench. In such a case, the student'sfaculty adviser must petition the direc-tor of graduate studies for approval ofthe exception. Written examinations inItalian and Spanish are scheduled asneeded. The faculty adviser of students in the East Asian program may petitionthe director of graduate studies toallow a student to substitute a readingknowledge of Chinese or Japanese forFrench or German. If the exception isapproved, a written examination inChinese or Japanese will be scheduled. Those students who fail the German or French examination are required tofollow a plan of study approved by thefaculty. A list of suggested courses andtutors may be obtained from theAcademic Ofce. The Institute offerscourses in German and French readingcomprehension. These courses meet fortwo hours twice a week. There is anominal charge. Students who wish tofollow a plan of study not alreadyapproved by the faculty must submitthe plan to the faculty in writing.156 FINE ARTSA student entering with an M.A. degree from another institution mustsatisfy the language requirementswithin the rst year of study and priorto the Ph.D. candidacy interview.Students with a foreign baccalaureatemay petition for the substitution oftheir native language for eitherGerman or French on the M.A. levelonly. Before applying to matriculate forthe Ph.D. program, international stu-dents must pass tests in both Germanand French. Students in the East Asianart program may petition to substituteprociency in Chinese or Japanese forone of the required languages. First-Term Paper: During the rst term, all students are required to sub-mit a written paper, the topic chosenin consultation with an Institute fac-ulty member. In the case of studentsholding an M.A. degree obtained else-where, a thesis or paper written in con-junction with his or her work for theM.A. degree may be submitted as therst-term paper. Timing: Completing the requirements for the M.A. degree should not exceedtwo years. Students in the conservationprogram normally complete the M.A.degree requirements in ve semesters. Academic Standards: Each student's record is subject to review after thecompletion of the rst semester andrst year of study. A student mustachieve a B+ or better average. Failureto do so results in automatic proba-tionary status. A student on probationis expected to attain a B+ averagewithin one semester. Distribution of Course Points: A total of 36 points (nine courses) isrequired for the M.A. degree. Of these,8 points must be in two classroomseminars in different major areas asdened below. Of the 36 points takenin lecture courses, seminars, colloquia,and reading courses for independentstudy, at least one course must betaken in four of the six following majorareas: (1) East Asia, India, and Islam;(2) ancient Near East, Egyptian, Greek,and Roman; (3) Early Christian,Byzantine, and Western medieval artto 1400; (4) Western art, 1400 to1780; (5) Western art, 1780 to thepresent; and (6) African, Oceanic, pre-Columbian, and Native American art.At least one course must be taken inarea (1) or (6). In addition, one coursemust be taken in the conservation ofworks of art. Students planning to specialize in East Asian art may, with the writtenapproval of their adviser, take two ofthe distribution requirement courseslisted under (1) above. T wo Qualifying Papers for the Master's Degree: One qualifying paper is required in each of two differ-ent major areas, as dened above. Eachpaper is written under the direction ofa different instructor. The papers mustbe in publishable form. Topics may bedeveloped from seminar reports, fromthe rst-term paper, in connection witha lecture course, or independently inconsultation with a faculty member.For students enrolled in the conserva-tion training program, one qualifyingterm paper may be supervised by amember of the conservation faculty. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Qualifying as a Matriculant for thePh.D. Degree: The applicant must have fullled all requirements for theM.A. degree in art history and be spon-sored by a faculty member. A studententering the Institute with a master'sdegree must complete all M.A. degreerequirements of the Institute of FineArts (or provide evidence of equivalentwork) within one academic year.During this probationary period, thestudent must also nd a faculty spon-sor. Students may be requested to showa reading knowledge of languages nec-essary for their special elds of study. Students completing the master's degree at the Institute may take up to8 points of additional course workbefore acceptance into the Ph.D. pro-gram. These courses are taken entirelyat the student's risk and must beapproved by the director of graduatestudies and the student's adviser. Candidacy Interview and Faculty Review: Acceptance into the Ph.D program is determined by (1) an inter-view with a three-member facultycommittee at the time the studentcompletes all Institute of Fine Artsrequirements for the M.A. degree and(2) an all-faculty review of the stu-dent's record and the results of theinterview. Timing: The interview must be held before the end of the rst term aftercompleting the requirements for theM.A. degree, except in the case of stu-dents holding an M.A. degree obtainedelsewhere, who must schedule theinterview no later than the end of theirsecond term of residence. Reviews bythe full faculty are scheduled inSeptember, January, and May of each year. (See the calendar in theAnnouncement of Courses for dates.) Sponsorship: Application for the interview must be sponsored by a regu-lar member of the Institute faculty.Institute lecturers associated part timewith the Institute may serve as cospon-sors only if a regular faculty memberhas rst agreed to serve as sponsor.Advisers from other institutions canserve as dissertation advisers onlythrough prior arrangement between aregular faculty member and the stu-dent and with the permission of thedirector of graduate studies. Character of the Interview: The inter- view is administered by a committee ofthe faculty and is oral. The student dis-cusses his or her proposed program ofstudy, i.e., choice of major and minorelds and possibly the subject or area heor she expects to treat in the disserta-tion. The committee, in reviewing thestudent's record, assesses his or her basicknowledge of the history of art as wellas intellectual qualications and under-standing of the areas in which the stu-dent plans to work. A major factor indetermining the student's eligibility formatriculation for the Ph.D. degree isthe evaluation of the student's proposedprogram in relation to the quality of hisor her previous qualifying papers, semi-nar reports, and course work. For those entering with an M.A. degree, admission to the Institute doesnot imply acceptance of all graduatecourses taken prior to enrollment atthe Institute. If transfer of such coursesis desired, the candidate must petitionthe faculty for approval immediatelyfollowing acceptance into the doctoralprogram. Distribution of Course Points: A total of 72 points is required for thePh.D. degree, including the 36required for the M.A. degree. At least24 points (six courses) must be inclassroom seminars, of which 8 points(two courses) must be outside the stu-dent's major area of study. Of the total72 points, 8 may be taken as theinternship in curatorial studies. With the prior written consent of the director of graduate studies and aninstructor, one or more SpecialProblems courses may be taken indi-vidually with a faculty member in lieuof lecture courses or, in exceptionalcases, of a seminar. Students specializing in East Asian, ancient Near Eastern, Egyptian, andIslamic art may be allowed up to four157 FINE ARTScourses for undergraduate language study in their eld. Dissertation Proposal: A dissertation proposal must be approved by theentire faculty, usually prior to themajor oral examination. A SpecialProblems course may be taken with theadviser in preparation of the proposal.The proposal consists of a statementdescribing the project and currentresearch (1,000 words maximum), achapter outline (one page), a short bib-liography, and a single image. Twentycopies of the proposal, approved andsigned by the Institute faculty sponsor,should be provided to the AcademicOfce for distribution to the faculty. Ifthe topic should change substantiallyin the process of research, it may benecessary to submit a new proposal. Final Examination in Major and Minor Fields: Students matriculated for the Ph.D. degree are required topass the nal examination in one majorand two minor elds. A candidate maynot take the nal examination, or anypart thereof, more than twice. Timing: A student may take the oral and written portions of the examina-tion in the major and related minorelds in the term in which therequired classroom courses are com-pleted, but no later than the followingterm. Note that the nal examinationis not completed until the unrelatedminor portion is also satised. Character of the Examination: There are three components to the nalexamination: an oral session on themajor and related minor elds, a two-week written paper on questionsdesigned for the individual studentimmediately after the oral portion, anda written examination in the unrelatedminor. Students may request exemp-tion from the examination in the unre-lated minor if they have completedthree courses (including a seminar)within the respective eld with anaverage of A- or better. Major and Minor Fields: Each area listed below constitutes a minor eld.Normally two contiguous areas consti-tute a major eld. An additional eld,the related minor, must be directlyrelated to the major, while a secondeld, the unrelated minor, should bedistinctly removed from the major eld.A related minor outside the history ofart is encouraged, and, in the specialareas of study of East Asian art andarchaeology, classical art and archaeol-ogy, and Near Eastern art and archaeol-ogy, it is required. The minor areas fromwhich a student selects the major andminor elds for examination are (1) pre- historic and protohistoric art of the OldWorld; (2) African and Oceanic art; (3) pre-Columbian art; (4) early Chineseart through the Han Dynasty; (5) Chinese art from the Northern andSouthern Dynasties to the YuanDynasty; (6) later Chinese art, MingDynasty to the present; (7) Chinese pic-torial art; (8) Japanese art, ca. 600-1300; (9) Japanese art, ca. 1300 to thepresent; (10) Buddhist art; (11) Indianart (non-Muslim); (12) of Eastern art; (15) Aegean art; (16) (17) art; (18) Early Christian throughCarolingian art; (19) Byzantine art; (20) Islamic art to the Mongol conquest,690-1250; (21) Islamic art after theMongol conquest, 1250-1800; (22) Romanesque art; (23) Gothic art;(24) Italian art from 1300 to 1500; (25) Italian art of the 16th century; (26) art outside Italy from 1400 to1600; (27) art in Italy, France, andSpain from about 1580 to the end of the17th century; (28) art of theNetherlands, Germany, and Englandfrom about 1580 to the end of the 17thcentury; (29) European (includingEnglish) and American art from 1660 to1780; (30) European (includingEnglish) and American art from 1780 tothe end of the 19th century; (31) art ofthe 20th century; (32) Latin Americanart; (33) conservation and technology, inrelation to a eld or elds designatedabove, upon petition to the faculty. Dissertation: The dissertation is nor- mally no longer than 250 pages of text.Permission to exceed this limit can begranted only through petition to thefaculty. The completed dissertation isexpected to be submitted within fouryears of the completion of the majororal examination. In addition to thecopy of the dissertation required by theGraduate School of Arts and Science,candidates are required to le a secondcopy with the Institute of Fine Arts.Further information may be obtainedfrom the Academic Ofce. Final Oral Defense of the Dissertation: Each candidate in the Institute of Fine Arts submits to a naloral defense of the dissertation before acommittee of ve scholars, three ofwhom are members of the GSAS fac-ulty. Scholars who are not members ofthe Institute may be invited to con-sider the dissertation and take part inthe proceedings. SPECIAL AREAS OF STUDY Special areas of study follow the nor-mal requirements for the Ph.D. degreein ne arts and should include themodications outlined below. Studentsmust consult their advisers before reg-istering for any courses given outsidethe Institute. Students interested inany of the areas listed below shouldconsult the appropriate adviser. Classical Art and Archaeology: Students wishing to earn the Ph.D.degree with a specialization in classicalart and archaeology may do so eitherbased on art historical and archaeologi-cal course work or by way of interde-partmental studies, i.e., with coursestaken in classics, ancient history, andclassical art and archaeology. A facultycommittee decides on this course ofstudy in accordance with the appli-cant's educational background and spe-cial interests. Combined Studies in Near Eastern Art and Archaeology: This area of study for students working toward thePh.D. degree in ne arts includes thefollowing combinations: Egyptian/ancient Byzantine/early Islamic; Early Christian/earlyIslamic. Students should decide where their principal interest lies within the com-bined area of study and then study theappropriate language or languages. Atleast 16 but no more than 20 pointsmay be in the history of postclassicalWestern art. The total of these coursesmust be 72 points. East and South Asian Art: Students working toward the Ph.D. degree inne arts with a specialization in thisarea should take at least 48 points inclassroom art history courses; they maytake up to 20 points in SpecialProblems courses (8 points for theM.A. degree and 12 additional pointsfor the Ph.D. degree) and up to a totalof 16 points in credit courses in lan-guage and culture (of which up to 16points may be for undergraduate studyin language). Architectural Studies: This area of study offers the possibility for studentsto earn the Ph.D. with a specializationin the history of architecture andurbanism. The purpose of the programis to prepare students for research,teaching, and curating in this area inacademic departments, schools of archi-158 FINE ARTStecture, and museums. Study may include archaeological work as well ascourses given outside the IFA frame-work in both architectural programsand art history departments where suchcross-registration is allowed, such as atColumbia University. Certain coursesin history, philosophy, and the socialsciences may also be considered rele-vant to this program. In formulatingthe areas for which the student isresponsible in the Ph.D. oral examina-tion, architecture and urbanism may begiven greater than normal weight. Allsuch decisions regarding the student'scourse of study are determined by aspecial faculty committee in accordancewith the applicant's background andspecial interests, in consultation withthe director of graduate studies. CURATORIAL STUDIES PROGRAM This program is open only to candidates for the Ph.D. degree in the history of artat the Institute. The program is offeredjointly by the Institute of Fine Arts andthe Metropolitan Museum of Art, underthe supervision of the Joint Committeeon Curatorial Studies, which is composedof faculty and curators and includes thedirectors of both institutions. The purpose of the program is to prepare students for curatorial careers.Problems of museum education andgeneral administration are not empha-sized. The Certicate in CuratorialStudies is awarded at the completion ofall requirements. Requirements: 1. Curatorial Studies I (G43.2037): This colloquium, focusing on the roleand responsibilities of curators in artmuseums and emphasizing connois-seurship and research methods, isrequired for admission to the program;it is also open to students who do notintend to pursue the full CuratorialStudies Program. The course meets inthe spring term in the galleries, store-rooms, and conservation laboratories ofthe Metropolitan Museum of Art andmay be taken at any time before apply-ing for the curatorial studies interview(see below). 2. Materials, Media, and Techniques: Technical Considerations for the ArtHistorian (G43.2539): A colloquiumdesigned to acquaint art historianswith the nature and use of materials inart and archaeology. Other courses inconservation open to art historians maybe substituted with the approval of theprogram director. 3. M.A. degree in art history: All requirements for the Institute's rigor-ous master's degree must be completedas the foundation of the program. Seethe Admission paragraph and Master of Artssection for a description of the admission and degree criteria. 4. Ph.D. candidacy interview: Whether or not the student intends to pursuethe doctorate as well as the curatorialstudies certicate, he or she must beaccepted by the faculty as being capa-ble of doing Ph.D. work throughacceptance into the Ph.D. program. Seethe Doctor of Philosophy section for a description of the necessary qualica-tions and the candidacy review process. 5. Curatorial studies interview: Students interested in pursuing thecuratorial studies certicate must beaccepted into the program by the JointCommittee on Curatorial Studies.Interviews are scheduled at the begin-ning of each academic year. Studentsare asked to discuss their long-termcareer goals, areas of special interest,and their preparation to date, includ-ing academic work and a demonstratedinterest in curatorial issues. Normallythe interview is held after the require-ments listed above have been met andbefore Curatorial Studies II is taken. 6. Curatorial Studies II (G43.2537): A colloquium, conducted by a full-timecurator from the Metropolitan Museumof Art, with additional lectures by con-servation and visiting outside special-ists, as appropriate, introduces studentsto curatorial responsibilities throughhands-on involvement with originalworks of art in the context of an actualexhibition or cataloging project at themuseum. The topic and the supervis-ing curator vary from year to year. Thecourse meets in the fall, and admissionis determined by interview. 7. Six courses beyond the nine required for the master's degree are chosen inrelation to the student's specialty andmay include Curatorial Studies I and II. 8. Curatorial Studies III (G43.3037): Normally a nine-month internship,designed to provide maximum practi-cal experience in each student's area ofspecialization. Completion ofCuratorial Studies I and II is a prereq-uisite, and usually the internship iselected after completion of all coursework. Students should apply to thedirector of the program to makeinternship arrangements at least sixmonths in advance of the desired start-ing date. The internship may be in adepartment at the MetropolitanMuseum of Art or at another museum as appropriate to the student's inter-ests. A substantive written project isrequired. Recommendations: Students should seek out courses in art history that con-sider objects in the original and shouldtake full advantage of the opportunityto study and work with Institute facultywho are active in museum projects.Relevant work experience is encouraged.Students are urged to avail themselvesof appropriate courses in conservationbeyond the required minimum. Financial Assistance: For the intern- ship, fellowships are available on acompetitive basis up to the level of topdissertation grants. Other aid may beawarded on the same basis as for stu-dents in other programs at the samegeneral point of progress in their stud-ies. Applications should be madethrough regular Institute of Fine Artschannels. Questions about the Curatorial Studies Program offerings should be directedto the Academic Ofce at the Instituteof Fine Arts, 212-992-5868. CONSERVATION CENTER The Institute's Conservation Center,located in the Stephen Chan House, isdedicated to the teaching and advancedstudy of the technology and conserva-tion of works of art and historic arti-facts. Since 1960, the Center hasprepared students for careers in conser-vation through a four-year graduateprogram that combines practical experi-ence in conservation with art historical,archaeological, curatorial, and scienticstudies of the materials and construc-tion of works of art. Students undertakeresearch projects, laboratory work, andseminars in special areas of conserva-tion, such as advanced X-ray techniquesor the treatment of modern and con-temporary paintings, and gain intensiveconservation experience throughadvanced eldwork and an internship.Students are encouraged to obtain addi-tional conservation experience duringsummer archaeological excavations orother formal work projects. The Center provides special courses for students pursuing studies in arthistory, archaeology, and curatorialstudies, which are intended to acquaintthem with the physical structure ofworks of art, the need for conservation,and the possibilities and limitations ofconservation. These students partici-pate in research projects, laboratorywork, and courses dealing with materi-159 FINE ARTSals, care, repair, and presentation of objects. In addition to their teaching responsibilities, the Center's distin-guished faculty are active in researchand other professional activities in theUnited States and abroad. Admission: Candidates for admission to the conservation training programmust rst satisfy the requirements foradmission into the Institute of FineArts as candidates for the M.A. degreein the history of art. See the Admission paragraphs and the Master of Arts sec- tion above. In addition, applicantsmust have a minimum of four semes-ters of laboratory science (one semestermust be in organic chemistry) at thecollege level with grades of B or better.Qualied applicants are invited tomeet with a committee of conservationfaculty for an interview, during whichthey will be asked to present evidenceof their familiarity with a range ofartists' materials and techniques asdemonstrated by a portfolio.Candidates for the master's degree inart history at the Institute are encour-aged to apply for transfer to the conser-vation training program aftercompleting the requisite science andstudio preparation. The maximumnumber of students admitted per yearis eight. In addition, one or two self-supported students from abroad maybe accepted as special students orobservers. Course of Study: Sixty-nine (69) points are required for the combinedM.A. degree in art history andAdvanced Certicate in Conservation.Six art history courses (24 points) inthree major areas are required, includ-ing at least two seminars that must bein two different areas. Fifteen conserva-tion courses (45 points) are taken aswell, beginning with a two-year seriesof core courses that introduce studentsto the fundamentals of material sci-ence, conservation, and preventive care. With their second year of study, stu-dents choose to specialize in one of thefollowing primary areas of study: con-servation of paintings, objects, paperphotographs, or textiles. Upper-levelcourses in each of these areas, as well asindependent study under the directionof conservators in the New York Cityarea, are available. The internship iscompleted over two semesters in thefourth year in a conservation establish-ment either in this country or abroad,selected to afford the best possibletraining in the student's area of special-ization. Arrangements are made in con-sultation with the chairman of theConservation Center. For more infor-mation on the program of study, pleasevisit www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/neart/ifa/ index_chan.htm . All requirements for the Institute's M.A. degree, including languages, rst-term paper, timing, academic stan-dards, and two qualifying papers (oneof which may be supervised by a mem-ber of the full-time conservation fac-ulty), apply equally to students in theconservation training program. The arthistory requirements may be partiallyor completely satised by a previouslyearned M.A. A copy of the thesis oranother research paper should be sub-mitted to the director of graduate stud-ies in order to judge equivalency. The program may be taken only on a full-time basis and is normally com-pleted in four years. The program leadsto an M.A. degree in the history of artafter ve semesters and to an AdvancedCerticate in Conservation upon com-pletion of the program. Those studentsholding an M.A. in the history of artaccepted by the director of graduatestudies may complete the program forthe Advanced Certicate in Conservationin three years, including the internship. NONCREDIT SUMMER COURSES The Institute offers a limited summer program, including special coursesdesigned by the Conservation Center tointroduce museum professionals to thematerials of art and archaeology andtheir preservation.

While the traditional history of lit-erature focuses primarily on describ-ing, evaluating, and classifyingliterary phenomena in terms of theirnature, signicance, and order ofappearance, historical poetics seeksto dene the system in which thesephenomena function and which,though coherent, is subject to his-torical and generic variabilities. Aseach of these approaches to literaryhistory has its merits, the objectiveof this course is to examine litera-ture of the French Renaissance fromboth perspectives\u2014a panoramicview of French literature from thelate Middle Ages through the earlyBaroque and an investigation of thecorrelation between literary dis-course of the Renaissance era and literary discourse in general or,strictly speaking, between literatureand literariness.

Each M.A. student is advised bya member of the Institute faculty,while each doctoral candidate normallyhas two advisers: one from the Instituteand one from the department mostrelated to the student's dissertationeld (i.e., anthropology, French, his-tory, politics). THE MASTER'S PROGRAMS Master of Arts Program in French Studies The M.A. program is designed for stu- dents interested in careers in interna-tional business and banking, themedia, government, and culturalorganizations or in teaching Frenchcivilization in secondary schools ortwo-year colleges. The M.A. programoffered by the Institute can also com-plement work done toward a graduatedegree in French language and litera-ture. Full-time students can completethe M.A. degree in one calendar year ifthey attend the Institute's summer pro-gram in Paris. Those who do not par-ticipate in the summer programcomplete their M.A. requirements inthree semesters of study at NYU. Part-time students normally take two yearsto meet the course requirements. Course of Study: The program requires successful completion of eightcourses (32 points) and a comprehen-sive examination. The latter coversthree of the four basic elds in Frenchstudies: (1) French history since theAncien R\u00e9gime; (2) French society; andeither (3) French politics and the econ-omy since 1945 or (4) French culturein society. Of the eight courses, at leastfour must be chosen from Institutecore courses.

Thecourse(s) are offered at the NYU inParis facilities and are taught by fac-ulty appointed by the Institute.Students who take two courses in Pariscan complete all course work for theirM.A. degree in one year. Dual and Joint Degree Programs The dual and joint degree programs integrate the study of France with thetraining offered by the NYU School ofLaw, the Leonard N. Stern School of Business, and the Department ofJournalism. All of these programsenable students to complete therequirements of the dual and jointdegrees in less time than if they werepursued independently. Candidatesmust submit two applications: one tothe Institute and one to the respectiveschool or department. Applicants mustmeet the admission requirements ofboth the Institute and the otherdepartment or school, and admission issubject to approval by both. The abil-ity to read French and to understandthe spoken language is a prerequisite. Dual Degree Program with Business Administration: The dual degree master's program in Frenchstudies and business administrationoffered in cooperation with NYU'sLeonard N. Stern School of Business isthe rst degree program in the UnitedStates to combine training for corpo-rate management with an integratedcourse of social and cultural studiesfocused on a major European country.The dual degree M.A.-M.B.A. programis intended for students seeking careersin business and nance that mightrequire residence in and detailedknowledge of France. Students in this program can com- plete the requirements in two and ahalf years of full-time study. One of theve semesters may be taken in Paris,attending courses at French businessschools and other institutions. Studentsmay attempt the program on a part-time basis but must meet the require-ments for both degrees within six yearsof initial enrollment. For furtherdetails on the M.A.-M.B.A. program,see the GSAS application and also con-tact the Institute of French Studies. ForStern School application information,call the Ofce of Admissions at 212-998-0600 or visit the NYU LeonardN. Stern School of Business Web siteat www.stern.nyu.edu. Dual Degree Program with Law: The dual degree M.A.-J.D. program inFrench studies and law offered in coop-eration with the New York UniversitySchool of Law is of special interest tostudents who wish to continue anundergraduate interest in French soci-ety and culture while preparing for aprofessional career in law. The influ-ence of French law in Europe, in theEuropean Union, and in the developingworld makes the dual degrees usefulfor students who wish to work for pub-lic or private clients with business inthose areas. They are also useful forfuture scholars of comparative law,comparative jurisprudence, human rights, and legal philosophy. Candidates for the program typically have a strong knowledge of French anda desire to use the language in theirprofessional work. Students currentlyenrolled in the NYU School of Lawmay also apply. The program can becompleted in three to four years.Normally, the rst year of the programis spent at the law school; work towardthe M.A. degree in French studies typ-ically begins in the second year or dur-ing the summer between the rst andsecond years. Further details on theM.A.-J.D. program are available in theGSAS application and also from theInstitute. For School of Law applicationinformation, call the Ofce ofAdmissions at 212-998-6060 or visitthe NYU School of Law Web site atwww.law.nyu.edu . Joint Degree Program with Journalism: The joint master's degree in French studies and journalismoffered in cooperation with theDepartment of Journalism provideseducation and training at the master'slevel for students seeking careers asprofessional newspaper, magazine, orbroadcast journalists. Courses fromboth departments are combined to pro-vide the student with specializedknowledge of France and journalisticwriting and/or broadcasting skills. Thedegree is normally completed in twoyears, including a summer of study andresearch in Paris. It requires a compre-hensive examination and nal project,consisting of a feature article on a sub-ject related to contemporary France orFrench-speaking countries. Furtherdetails on the joint M.A. program withjournalism are available in the GSASapplication and also from the Institute. THE DOCTORAL PROGRAMS The Institute offers small, highly selec-tive doctoral programs that preparestudents for careers involving researchand teaching on contemporary France.The programs offer two kinds of Ph.D.degrees: (1) the Ph.D. degree in Frenchstudies, focusing on French society andculture; and (2) the joint Ph.D. degreein French studies and either anthropol-ogy, history, politics, or French litera-ture. In recent years the Institute hasstrongly encouraged applicants toapply to one of the joint Ph.D. pro-grams (rather than the Ph.D. programin French studies alone), and it contin-ues to do so. Admission: Students applying for a joint Ph.D. with anthropology, French,172 FRENCH STUDIEShistory, or politics submit a single application, which must then be approved by both the IFS and the part- ner department. In most cases, both approvals will be granted at the timeof acceptance to the IFS, but partnerdepartments will sometimes deferapproval until the second or third yearof study. (Students applying for the Ph.D. degree in French studies requireacceptance only by the IFS.) Studentsinitially admitted to an M.A. programwho wish to continue on to a Ph.D.must formally apply for the Ph.D. pro- gram of their choice. Only a few such applications are approved. Course of Study: The Ph.D. programs all require successful completion of 72 points of course work, a written and oral qualifying examination, and a doctoral dissertation. All students must rst com-plete the requirements for the master' s degree (see M.A. course requirementsdescribed above). Remaining coursework is chosen from Institute offerings and from courses offered by otherdepartments (mainly anthropology , French, history, or politics) according to the kind of doctorate pursued, the area of specialization, and career interests ofthe student. Full-time students usuallytake three courses per term and nish their course requirements in three years. Most doctoral students spend one or two semesters of their third year inParis, where they take courses at theFrench institutions with which theInstitute has formal exchange agree - ments: the Ecole des Hautes Etudes enSciences Sociales, the and the Ecole NormaleSup\u00e9rieure. Full New York Universitycourse credit is given for courses suc-cessfully completed in Paris. With theiradviser' spermission, students may work at other Paris institutions, such as the University of Paris. After returning to New York, Ph.D. candidates who have completed 72 points of course work design a disserta-tion research project and take the writ - ten and oral qualifying examination forthe Ph.D. After successfully completingthis examination and obtainingapproval of a dissertation proposal, stu - dents generally spend a year in France(normally their fth year of matricula - tion) conducting dissertation research.Sixth-year students typically have com - pleted their research and spend the year writing their dissertation. Once the dis- sertation has been accepted, all Ph.D.candidates must defend their work in anal oral examination. The Ph.D. therefore normally requires six to sevenyears of full-time study .Ph.D. Program in French Studies The Ph.D. program in French studies provides the student with a broadknowledge of French society and cul- ture as well as a concentration in a spe- cialized eld of interest to be denedin consultation with faculty advisers.This program prepares graduates forteaching French studies courses in French departments. Joint Ph.D. Programs The joint Ph.D. programs in French studies and anthropology, French, his-tory, and politics combine multidisci- plinary approaches to the study of contemporary France with rigorous dis-ciplinary training in one of the socialsciences, history, or literature. Jointdegree candidates normally pursue pro- grams supervised by advisers from boththe Institute and the disciplinarydepartment concerned. Joint degreesprepare students for teaching in historyor social science departments and/or inthe \"civilization\" track of Frenchdepartments. The joint degree with French prepares for teaching in both the civilization and literature tracks inFrench departments. Students in joint degree programs divide their 72 points of course workevenly between the Institute and thedisciplinary department, with mostInstitute course work being completedprior to receiving the M.A. degree andmost disciplinary work being com-pleted after receiving the M.A. degree.The Ph.D. qualifying examination foreach of the joint programs consists ofsections on French studies, on the dis - cipline in question, and on the integra - tion of the two. Examiners includefaculty from both the Institute and therelevant department. Similarly ,the dis - sertation defense committee includesfaculty from both units. For moredetails on the current regulations forthese joint programs, contact theInstitute of French Studies. THE CER TIFICA TE PROGRAM The Institute offers a Certicate of Achievement in French Studiesdesigned for (1) students in other doc - toral or professional programs having a research or career interest relating toFrance; (2) individuals teaching orplanning to teach French in universi-ties, colleges, or secondary schools who desire intensive training in French civi-lization to complement their educationin language and literature; and (3) pro - fessionals working in business, culturalorganizations, government, the media,and other areas requiring expert knowledge of contemporary Frenchculture and society.

Applicants must showa minimum undergraduate grade pointaverage of 3.3 to be considered, andGraduate Record Examination (GRE)scores are required. A complete appli-cation includes a sample of academicwriting, a personal statement, andthree letters of recommendation. To beconsidered for admission to one of thedepartment's specialized programs,write or call the director of that pro-gram when applying for admission tothe Department of History. Consultthe GSAS Application for Admission and Financial Aid for application deadline information. MASTER OF ARTS The program for the master's degree inhistory offers students graduate workthat serves a variety of needs and pur-poses. It can be an end in itself for stu-dents whose personal and/or professionalgoal is an M.A. degree. It can be com-bined with an advanced certicate inarchival management. The M.A. canalso be a preparatory graduate degree enroute to the doctorate. The Master of Arts degree requires the completion of 32 points, of which atleast 24 must be within the historydepartment. No more than 8 pointsmay be transferred from other graduateschools. A request for transfer creditsmust be made within the rst year ofenrollment. There is no area specializa-tion requirement at the master's level,but students must take at least one sem-inar in which a substantial researchpaper is completed. The student mustachieve a grade of B or better in theseminar. There is no general language requirement. However, a student spe-cializing in Middle Eastern history foran M.A. degree must demonstrate pro-ciency in Arabic, Persian, or Turkish bypassing, with a grade of B or better, atleast two courses at the advanced levelor beyond in one of those languages. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The program for the Ph.D. degree pro-vides a framework within which stu-dents can acquire the followingtraining and experience: (1) broadexposure to a general area of interestand to its current literature and contro-versies; (2) more intense training in thespecial eld in which the studentintends to conduct research and do hisor her primary teaching; (3) a sound but more limited introduction to a second eld; (4) training in researchprocedures and methods; (5) an appro-priate linguistic competence; and (6) the completion of a dissertationjudged to be a signicant piece of his-torical research and writing. To achieve these aims, the program is made up of the following compo-nents. (For a more complete discussion,see the Handbook for Graduate Students, available in the Department ofHistory.) Ph.D. Fields:1. Africa2. African Diaspora3. Europe6. Early Modern Europe7. Modern Europe8. Latin America and the Caribbean9. United States10. Hebrew and Judaic Studies (joint program) 11. Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies (joint program) 12. French Studies (joint program)Course of Study: Ph.D. students must complete 18 courses (72 points), whichis the equivalent of six full-time semes-ters. All students must take the one-semester course Approaches toHistorical Research and Writing intheir rst year and a dissertation-writ-ing seminar in their third year. Thereis no limit on the number of coursestaken within the consortium memberuniversities; nonetheless, each studentshould consult with his or her adviseron the appropriateness of the coursesand their relationship to the student'scourse of study. Such courses cannot betaken in a student's rst year of gradu-ate work without special permission.Doctoral students can transfer no morethan 40 points from outside thisdepartment. The request for transfer ofcredits must be made within one yearof enrollment. Foreign Language Requirement: Ph.D. students should satisfy the for-eign language requirement within therst year of graduate study; they mustdo so by the time they complete 48points of course work. The minimaldepartmental requirement is one for-eign language; additional languagesmay be required by the student's advi-sory committee. Students who choose the Middle East as their major eldmust fulll the language requirementsspecied for the joint Ph.D. programin history and Middle Eastern studies;for details, see the Department of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies section in this bulletin. Other areas requiring aforeign language for research may setparticular additional requirements.Students should consult their adviserabout what rules apply in their case. Students must demonstrate pro- ciency in a foreign language that hasdirect relevance to their area of study.The choice of language must beapproved by the student's adviser or bythe director of graduate studies.Students may satisfy prociency in oneof the following ways: (1) by passingthe prociency examination in the lan-guage given by the Graduate School ofArts and Science; (2) by having earneda grade of B+ or better in an interme-diate or advanced language course in acollege or university no more than twoyears prior to enrollment. Exceptionsmay be made for languages requiredfor primary research, by which a stu-dent's adviser may specify some otherprocedure as necessary to demonstratesufcient competence. The languageexamination is offered by the GraduateSchool three times a year. Qualifying Examination: Students must pass a written qualifying exami-nation in one of the department's des-ignated elds, as well as in a secondeld. Full-time students entering witha bachelor's degree take this examina-tion at the end of the second year ofstudy; other students take the examina-tion within one semester after the com-pletion of 12 courses (48 points). Thoseentering with an M.A. degree fromoutside the history department are nor-mally expected to take the qualifyingexamination directly after they havecompleted six courses, of which onemust be a \"literature of the eld\"course. Students who have done gradu-ate work elsewhere must, before sittingfor the exam, complete all work for thenumber of courses the director of grad-uate studies has determined to beappropriate in each case. A studentwho does not pass the examination hasthe right to retake it once. The qualifying examination is not a comprehensive examination. It isintended to test how well each studentunderstands and can explain historicalarguments and issues and bring to bearpertinent information and knowledgein discussing them.192 HISTORYProspectus Oral Examination: Each student must pass a 90-minute oralexamination after the language andcourse requirements have been com-pleted. Full-time students normallytake this examination at the end of thethird year of study. Those enteringwith a master's degree should take theexamination at the end of the secondyear. For other students, the precisetime is arranged with the director ofgraduate studies, but it must be assoon after the completion of coursework as is practicable. The student must submit a disser- tation prospectus prior to the examina-tion. The discussion of this proposal isa major component of the examination.The committee for the examinationconsists of three faculty members: oneis the student's major adviser; the othertwo are normally readers of the disser-tation. Where appropriate, one mem-ber of the committee may be fromoutside the department. No studentmay sit for the major eld examinationwithout the previous completion of thelanguage prociency specied for thateld. Students who fail the major eldexamination may sit for it one moretime, in the following fall term. Dissertation: Each student must write a dissertation under the supervision ofa member of the department (jointadvisers are permitted). The disserta-tion committee, including the adviser,has ve members; a minimum of threemust be GSAS full-time faculty. Program Plan: Ph.D. students should arrange their schedules so that they cancomplete the required \"literature of theeld\" courses and at least one seminarby the end of the rst year. The quali-fying examination is a major concern ofdoctoral students in the rst two years,but students should also ensure thatthey begin serious work in the majoreld during these years, for the sake oftheir overall professional development.A student's progress toward these goalsis taken into account during the evalu- ation the department undertakes foreach student following the qualifyingexamination. The third year should be devoted primarily to the student's major eld,including the planning of the disserta-tion project. It may also, if necessary,be used for completing the secondeld. Major Field: Each doctoral student must designate a major eld, withinwhich the subject of the student's dis-sertation falls and presumably the eldin which the student expects to beprincipally involved as a writer andteacher. Major elds should be broadenough so that they can prepare stu-dents to teach an upper-level under-graduate course or a graduatecolloquium, but narrow enough so thatstudents can develop professional com-petence in a body of literature, and eachstudent's own primary research can con-tribute to the preparation. Major eldsmay be dened in chronological andgeographical terms, or they may bepartly topical. In each case, a student'smajor eld should be worked out indiscussion with his or her adviser andwith one additional faculty memberwho has agreed to participate in exam-ining it. Each eld must be approvedby the director of graduate studies. Second Field: Each doctoral student must choose, by the end of the thirdsemester, a second eld and a secondeld adviser, who will examine the stu-dent in the qualifying exam. Normallythe program consists of three courses. A second eld may have the same dimensions as the major eld, or it maybe thematically dened. In every case,however, the second eld may not becontained within the student's majoreld but must introduce some signi-cant new area or dimension. Secondelds may also be arranged in someelds in which no major elds are avail-able and may be comparative. Archivalmanagement and historical editing also qualify as second elds, without respectto the major eld. Women's history andpublic history, if comparative, alsoqualify as second elds without respectto the major eld. Transnational Fields: Two transna- tional elds contribute to the distinc-tiveness of our program, servingstudents across various elds ofconcentration. The African diaspora eld focuses on the dispersal and activities of peopleof African descent, from antiquity tothe present, and incorporates Africa,South America, the Caribbean, NorthAmerica, and Europe. The Atlantic world eld incorpo- rates all of the continents that rim theAtlantic and spans early modern andmodern eras. FINANCIAL AID, ASSISTANT- SHIPS, AND EXTERNAL FUNDING All students admitted into the Ph.D. program receive a five-year fellowshipfrom New York University thatrequires students to work as teachingassistants for three years. Studentswho have outside fellowships are alsoconsidered. There is some nancial aid avail- able for full-time teachers studyingworld history but not for other M.A.students. Graduate students studying Arabic, Persian, or Turkish may be eligible fora Foreign Language and Area Studies(FLAS) Fellowship. Graduate students are encouraged to seek external sources of funding,whenever and wherever possible. Thegraduate administrator makes availableto graduate students an up-to-date listof grants and fellowships. Smallergrants for special purposes are alsoavailable. Specialized Programs and ProjectsHISTORY OF WOMEN AND GENDER The Department of History offers a spe- cialization or a second eld in the historyof women and gender. The eld exploresthe changing role of women in historyand the social construction of genderboth historically and theoretically. For the second eld in comparative women's history at the doctoral level,students are expected to take threecourses in areas other than the majoreld. The history of women and gender can satisfy the departmental require-ment for the doctoral second eld ifcourses are comparative or in a eldoutside the major or in some combina-tion thereof. WORLD HISTORY The M.A. program in world history isintended for students who seek a con-temporary approach to historical studythat combines inquiry into the meth-ods and approaches to world history with comparative and thematic workand concrete training in one or tworegions of the world. Among thosewhose needs it may serve are highschool or college teachers, peopleinvolved in international occupations,writers and others involved in the eldof communications, and those explor-ing their own interest in further study. Requirements for the program nor- mally include eight one-semester193 HISTORYcourses (32 credit points), consisting of three core courses, three courses in amajor eld of study, and two courses ina minor eld. Students must present amaster's essay, and they must demon-strate a reading knowledge of a foreignlanguage relevant to their work.Students may take cognate courses inworld history in the Draper Inter- disciplinary Master's Program inHumanities and Social Thought, and,with approval, up to two courses inanthropology, sociology, politics, eco-nomics, and literature. Students must undertake study of two regions of the world, one of whichwill be designated the major eld andone as the minor. The available regionsare Africa, East Asia, Europe, LatinAmerica, the Middle East, and NorthAmerica. Students must elect at leastone eld outside of Europe and NorthAmerica. PUBLIC HISTORY AND ARCHIVAL MANAGEMENT The study of public history provides graduate students with the opportunityto prepare for careers as historians inpublic and private institutions. Publichistory courses are open to all studentsin the graduate program. A two-semes-ter public history seminar provides anintroduction to the theoretical andmethodological issues that dene theeld. Supplementary courses addresssuch topics as oral history, media stud-ies, history museums, visual materials,new technologies, and archival manage-ment. Students are especially encour-aged to take advantage of carefullystructured internships and engagementwith the extraordinary array of publichistory venues throughout the NewYork metropolitan area. The facultyincludes distinguished historians andpublic scholars whose work has success-fully engaged diverse audiences.Graduates of the program work in abroad range of organizations and agen-cies, ranging from the Tenement HouseMuseum to the American SocialHistory Project to the New-YorkHistorical Society. New YorkUniversity itself, with its world-classlibrary facilities, premier archival andmanuscript collections, and numerouscollaborative relationships, providesstudents with an ideal public historylaboratory. Archival management prepares graduate students for careers asarchivists, historical editors, recordsadministrators, and manuscript cura- tors. This area of study provides stu-dents with a solid foundation in thetheory, methodology, and practice ofarchives. It also offers the broad human-istic training in history necessary forarchivists to develop a vision for theirwork. Course work in complementarydisciplines and new technologies isstressed, ensuring that program gradu-ates remain current with professionaltrends and developments. New YorkCity offers a unique setting for archivesstudents, and the program takes fulladvantage of the city's rich repositoriesin providing internships and practicumexperiences. Graduates work asarchivists in a wide variety of academic,nonprot, corporate, and governmentalvenues ranging from the New-YorkHistorical Society to Rolling Stone maga- zine. The program especially empha-sizes the ways in which historians andarchivists can disseminate and preserveinformation in both traditional andelectronic formats. An Advanced Certicate in Archival Management is also offered for studentswho already hold an M.A. degree in asocial science or humanities discipline.Students complete 20 credits of coursework in archives in order to earn thiscerticate. New programs in archives and pub- lic history are currently being devel-oped and will be available once statereview has been completed. JOINT AND DUAL DEGREE PROGRAMS Joint degree programs at the doctoral level are available with the Institute ofFrench Studies, the SkirballDepartment of Hebrew and JudaicStudies, and the Department of MiddleEastern and Islamic Studies. M.A.-J.D.and Ph.D.-J.D. dual degree programswith the School of Law are also avail-able. Admission to these joint and dualdegree programs must be granted byboth departments or institutes or pro-grams or schools upon entry or at thepoint of screening. Students in theseprograms normally are expected tocomplete the \"literature of the eld\"courses and take the history depart-ment's qualifying examination and amajor eld examination that maybridge the two disciplines. Joint anddual degree candidates are exemptfrom the departmental requirement fora second eld.SPECIAL PROJECTS The Margaret Sanger Papers Projectcollects, assembles, and publishesrecords documenting the life and careerof the founder of the American birthcontrol movement. Located in thedepartment since 1987, the SangerPapers Project microlmed the SmithCollege Collections Series, consisting ofalmost 45,000 documents; in 1995 anadditional 9,000 documents gatheredin an international search were micro-lmed as the Collected DocumentsSeries. Both microlmed series arebeing published by UniversityPublications of America, along with areel guide and index. The project ispreparing an electronic edition of themicrolmed documents for distribu-tion on CD-ROM or via the Internet.The project will then work on a four-volume book edition of selected Sangerletters. The project employs graduateassistants and other students.Documents from the Sanger Paperscollection are available for student andfaculty research and serve as practicalexamples for the course on historicalediting. For additional information, contact Dr. Esther Katz, codirector/editor ofthe Margaret Sanger Papers. The Papers of Jacob Leisler Project is collecting, transcribing, and translat-ing the entire extant public and privatecorrespondence of early New York gov-ernor Jacob Leisler (1640-1691) forpublication in microlm and the \"Father ofAmerican Democracy\" and best knownfor the 1689 New York uprising thatbears his name, Leisler played a promi-nent role in the economic and socialdevelopment of colonial New York andearly America. Housed in the depart-ment since 1988, the Leisler Paperscollection contains over 3,000 docu-ments in Dutch, French, German, andEnglish that provide a wealth of infor-mation on the Atlantic world in theearly modern era. The project employsgraduate and other students to assist inmaking the collection available toscholars and the public. For additional information, please contact Dr. David William Voorhees,director of the Papers of Jacob LeislerProject.194 HISTORYCoursesCourses are of several kinds: 1. Colloquia, based on common reading and discussion, in which students nor-mally write interpretive papers, bookcritiques and review essays, and/or bib-liographical essays. 2. Seminars, in which, after an initial period of common readings, studentswork primarily on a research project.(In certain cases students may also writeresearch papers in courses that are tech-nically \"colloquia.\") 3. \"Literature of the eld\" courses, designed to provide entry to a broadarea of history, through reading anddiscussion of a number of major issues,problems, and controversies that repre-sent traditional and contemporaryapproaches to the area as a whole. Thesecourses introduce students to the kindsof materials and issues that are testedon the qualifying examination and pro-vide a framework for preparing to takethe qualifying exam. M.A. studentsmay be admitted to these courses withthe instructor's permission. 4. Methodology courses, intended to introduce students to a wide spectrumof issues, theories, and research strate-gies. Ph.D. students are required totake a methodology course in their rstyear. 5. Independent study courses, devoted to reading, research, or some combina-tion, set up between a student, or asmall group of students, and a particu-lar faculty member. 6. Dissertation prospectus seminars. Ph.D. students are required to take thisseminar in their third year. Doctoral students may, with the approval of their advisers, enroll in upto four courses in other departments;M.A. students may enroll in up to two.Doctoral students may also, withapproval, prepare their second eldsoutside the history department.

Introduction to Art Worlds II G65.1116 Focuses on questions of reception andinterpretation, particularly on the dis-tinctions between \"high\" culture andother cultural designations. How haveavant-garde notions and systems con-tributed to the \"culture wars\"? Whatrole do class distinctions have in theevolution of cultural controversies?How do notions of good and poor\"taste\" emerge, and how are theydened? To what extent do debatesover cultural freedom serve as proxiesfor other political struggles? Cultural Policy and Cultural Patronage in the United StatesG65.1015Explores the vicissitudes of culturalpolicy and the development of publicand private arts patronage systems inthe United States. The course beginsby taking stock of current issues incultural policy and placing them inhistorical context. It explores the waysin which certain social ideals give riseto particular organizational forms.Finally, the course analyzes theexchange of economic, cultural, andsymbolic capital that characterizes allpatronage relationships, includingsometimes controversial cases of publicarts funding and of corporate philan- thropy. Readings in the sociology ofculture, anthropology, social history,art history, and organizational studiesinform this study of the economicdimensions of art worlds. Memoir and Manifesto: Artists in Their Own Words G65.1127 Examines how and why artists workingoutside of literary genres use languageas a supplement to their artworks.Interrogates the use of language in theconstruction of the self as artist and asa tool for challenging or strengtheningparticular art worlds. The coursebegins with early 20th-century writ-ings by artists such as Andre Bretonand Isadora Duncan and continueswith manifestos that wed artistic andsocial visions and with memoirs thatreflect on the context of specic artists'lives and work. Finally, the course con-siders the incursion of text into visualand performing arts from the 1960s tothe present day and examines genresincluding conceptual art, text-basedwork by visually trained artists, andfeminist and identity-based perform-ance art. THE CITY Introduction to the City I G65.1108 Introduces the complex nature of thecity and the local and global political,social, and economic forces that shapeit. As these forces manifest themselvesdifferently in different localities, stu-dents study various city types, includ-ing the global city, the modernmetropolis, and the informal city. NewYork City is the main platform forexploration, revealing as it does thecontinuities and congruencies in theforms and processes that characterizecontemporary cities. Garbage in Gotham: The Anthropology of Trash G65.1813 Traces changing denitions of value andworthlessness through Enlightenment,modern, and postmodern theory.Considers these through the perspec-tive of trash, which is read as a reflec-tion of contemporary social mores,time/space compression, and fragmen- tations of cultural identity, amongother themes. Uses New York City as acase study. The Contemporary City in Conflict: Militarization and Urban WarfareG65.2099Seminar about the contemporary cityin low- and high-intensity conflictssince the Cold War era. Focuses on twomain processes: militarization of urbanspace and urban warfare. As a site ofcivil, military, economic, and politicalimportance, the city can play a strate-gic role in either intensifying or reduc-ing conflict. Students develop anunderstanding of the contemporarycity as both a platform for and a targetin local and global contests for culturaldiversication, economic liberalization,political change, and militarization. First-World City/Third-World City G65.2018The cities of the Third World, hereto-fore understood as spaces of despair andtragedy, have now crowded theWestern imaginary as offering hope,dynamism, speed, and an unabashedcapitalist greed that surpasses that ofmost global megacities. Meanwhile,Western cities reveal more than evertheir own scabs of despair: the crushingreality of homelessness in SanFrancisco, immigrant ghettoes ofLondon, and the 2005 riots outsideParis have turned the First-World cityinside out; laid bare its skeletal ugli-ness; exposed its own Third-Worldcrevices. It is the inevitable collapse ofthis dichotomy between First Worldand Third World, the inltrationsbetween these geographies, that thiscourse seeks to uncover. Each theoretical debatesregarding urbanism and urbanizationthrough particular \"texts\"\u2014lm, c-tion, etc. Introduction to the City II G65.2108Students learn various approaches forstudying the city by transforming atopic of interest into a researchable ques-tion, developing a research design, and206 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL THOUGHTidentifying the most appropriate meth- ods for their chosen research project. Anoverview of qualitative research methodsis provided, both through the examina-tion of existing studies and the develop-ment of the students' own projects. GENDER POLITICS Introduction to Gender Politics IG65.1205 Investigates the relationship of theshape of the body to the shape of theself.

Popularizing Identity: Engendering Sexuality, Race, and Nation inCultural Studies G65.1214 Interrogates ongoing denitions of \"thepopular\" through the lens of recentnational, transnational, and global constructions of sexual identity.Examines how contemporary popularculture produces, enables, and delimitspersonal practices of sex and identity.Intersectional and culturally specicanalyses of gendered, ethnic, and sexualdissonance and dissidence engage thequestion of how the \"popular\" is con-structed over and through overtlyunpopular or unrecognized forms oferotic existence. Addressing both massmedia and marginal forms of personaland aesthetic expression, this courseinvestigates how the featured textsdene the conditions of social legibilityin myriad postmodern and transna-tional contexts. Introduction to Gender Politics II G65.1215 Focuses on Foucault's thinking aboutsexuality, power, knowledge, and thebody. Students read several of Foucault'smost influential works and discuss thecritical reception of his ideas and theirapplication by a range of scholars in thedecades since his death. GLOBAL HISTORIES Introduction to Global Histories IG65.1107Surveys world historical trends byexamining spaces and practices outsidethe normative expectations of nationalhistories. Students read accounts fromdifferent historical periods of humanencounters on and across the world'smajor seas and oceans\u2014\"contact zones\"that blur conventional territorial andcultural denitions\u2014and review related concepts, tools, and methodolo-gies adopted by world and global his-torians in their analyses.

History, Economy, Society, andDiaspora in the Indian OceanG65.2121The history of the Indian Ocean isunique in its intensive indigenous com-merce before the arrival of Europeansand in the coexistence of European andindigenous trade during the so-calledmodern era. This course explores thehistory of the peoples and societies whohave \"made\" the world of the IndianOcean over more than 5,000 years. Thecourse pays particular attention to thetransformations of economies and themovement of peoples and culturearound the ocean into modern times. Itconsiders the nature of littoral orcoastal societies, factors of unity anddisunity (is there such a thing as anIndian Ocean \"world\"?), and the legiti-macy of studying the Indian Ocean asthe rst \"globalized\" space.

Readingworks by Bergson, Husserl, Proust,Woolf, Faulkner, Heidegger, Nabokov,and others, students the con-nections among innovations in narra-tive technique, ction's increasedthematic focus on time, and nonc-tional explorations of the experience oftime during the last century. Introduction to Literary Cultures I G65.1301An intensive survey of foundationaltexts in contemporary literary theory.Reading literary works from antiquitythrough modernity, students investi-gate how language and the literarydetermine our various approaches, rela-tions, and commitments to the \"true\"and the \"real.\" Touchstones for discus-sion include imitation, representation,subjection, transformation, resistance,and freedom. Trauma and the Politics of Witnessing G65.1319 Investigates how recent theories oftrauma and testimony that focus on theHolocaust and European literaturemight be productive for reading litera-ture from other regions that stages dif-ferent historical events as traumas. Howmight these literary works in turnrevise, question, or displace theoreticalmodels that have developed largelyaround one specic traumatic event?Topics include formal versus thematicarticulations of the traumatic; testi-mony as crisis and event of translation;trauma as transnational and transcul-tural displacement; autobiographicalutterance as the supplement and theconfounding of collective memory; andattestation as a condition of possibilityand aporia of forgiveness. Introduction to Literary Cultures II G65.1321Investigates the ethical and politicaldimensions of contemporary critical the-ory. Also explores the ways in which lit-erary texts articulate and unfold theethical and political paradoxes that tradi-tional philosophical discourse too oftencharacterizes as simply forms of error,unreason, contradiction, or transgression.207 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL THOUGHTLaw and Mass Communication G65.2070 Identical to G54.0011. Acquaints students with basic protec-tions and restrictions of the law asapplied to the institutional press.Discusses First Amendment principlesand issues of libel, privacy, copyright,obscenity, fair trial, free press, reporter'sprivilege, and rules of broadcast. Heidegger and Wittgenstein G65.2192\"Philosophy is an age grasped inthought,\" Hegel once said, and if the20th century was grasped in thoughtat all, it was by Martin Heidegger andLudwig Wittgenstein. If their thoughtis elusive, no wonder\u2014for their agemade the very idea of comprehensionsuspect. In Heidegger andWittgenstein we meet two philoso-phers profoundly inclined toward theunity that metaphysics promises butforced to confront that promise as areceding possibility in an incompre-hensible historical moment.SCIENCE STUDIES Introduction to Science Studies IG65.1109Surveys science from a variety of philo-sophical, sociological, historical, lin-guistic, anthropological, and criticalperspectives. Explores debates overconstructivism, and the which scientic knowledge is put byexamining how cultural boundariesbetween science and nonscience areconstructed and maintained. Introduction to Science Studies II G65.1110Examines how new and emergingknowledges and technologies, such ascold fusion, genetics, cloning, organtransplantation, and assisted conception,are problematizing boundaries that areassumed to be natural and xed, whileat the same time remaking the socialstructures that support science.Modernism and the Alienation of Form G65.2190 Since the French Revolution, the ideaof progressive evolution gave Westernculture a unied sense of its place inthe great scheme of things, but thedecades leading up to World War I sawthe gradual decline of that paradigm.From the linguistic turn in philosophyto the professionalization of sociology,from symbolist poetry to cubism, fromBart\u00f3k to Bauhaus, from the NewCriticism to socialist realism, a preoc-cupation with form emerged as thedening characteristic of a modernismthat could no longer rely on naturaldesign. This course considers variousexamples of that preoccupation in asearch for the roots of dissolution.Italian StudiesDEPARTMENT OF FacultyMaria Luisa Ardizzone, Associate Professor.

We want to educatethose who agree. Opportunities abound in the media world, but the opportu-nity to do compelling work thatinforms, engages\u2014and mat-ters\u2014is what drives our faculty,motivates our students, andinforms our entire approach. Great journalism has always come from the great cities of theglobe, and there is no betterplace to learn the craft than thecity of New York\u2014where powerand wealth concentrate, newsand culture originate, and dailyevents located in Manhattan's Greenwich Village,the department immerses stu-dents in the richness and vitalityof the city, while attracting tocampus many of the leaders and thinkers in the journalism profes-sion. New York City is our labo-ratory\u2014and our inspiration. Thevery rst lesson we offer studentsis: Tap into it, with our help. NYU students study as interns in almost every major newsorganization in the city. Theyoften graduate to jobs in newspa-pers, magazines, broadcast out-lets, and online operationsheadquartered in New York,though some choose to go else-where. And every day, studentsmove outward from the class-room to the city, on assignmentsthat take them all over town. The full-time faculty is itself of national stature in the jour-nalism world. As writers,reporters, producers, and critics,NYU professors continue topractice the journalism theyteach and preach, holding theprofession to its highest stan-dards of public service. Theadjunct faculty, our teachingprofessionals, features workingjournalists from all the majornews media, who share theirwealth of experience and a com-mitment to craft. Each area of study pairs accom- plished faculty who have workedin the eld with students whoseek practical instruction andintellectual depth. Most classesare kept small (12 to 18 students)to allow for one-on-one instruc-tion. All of our graduate pro-grams focus on content as well as 20 COOPER SQUARE NEW YORK, NY 10003-7112 212-998-7980 WEB SITE: http://journalism.nyu.edu A213 JOURNALISMskills.

Theymay select a joint program injournalism and Latin Americanand Caribbean studies, journalismand Near Eastern studies, or jour-nalism and French studies. Course work begins with the basic skills of reporting, writing,and research, but simultaneouslystudents are taught what jour- nalism at its best can be\u2014andwhat it should accomplish in afree and democratic society.Students are also encouraged topublish their work, with assign-ments, internships, and onlineprojects geared to this end. Housed within the arts and sciences core of a leading univer-sity, the department sees journal-ism as an essential strand in theliberal arts tradition and a criti-cal factor in public culture. Butwe also recognize that newsthese days is a business. When our skilled graduates enter thatbusiness, they are prepared toimprove and enliven it. Department facilities include state-of-the-art computer and dig-ital equipment; a fully equippedbroadcast facility with a televisionand radio studio, nonlinear edit-ing, an Avid central server, anddigital video eld equipment.

Abercrombie he Center for Latin Americanand CaribbeanStudies (CLACS) at New York University is aninterdisciplinary teaching,research, and public informationprogram. It is a Title VINational Resource Center, offer-ing FLAS fellowship support forgraduate students and supportfor faculty and graduate studentresearch, a panoply of colloquiaand conferences, and outreachprograms focusing on primaryand secondary education in theNew York area. The Centeropens channels of communica-tion and encourages the sharingof ideas and observations acrossdisciplinary boundaries, to themutual benet of both facultymembers and students. Overfty NYU faculty members anda varying number of visiting andadjunct professors each semesterconstitute the directly associatedstaff of the Center. The Centerand its consortium partner, theInstitute for Latin AmericanStudies (ILAS) at ColumbiaUniversity, formed NYCCLAS,the City Consortiumfor Latin American Studies.Faculty afliated with CLACS work in many disciplines andmost of the countries of LatinAmerica and the Caribbean,with special strengths in the cir-cum-Caribbean, the Andes andCentral America, Brazil, and theSouthern Cone. The Center has aspecial interest in coordinating acomparative and relational hemi-spheric orientation toward LatinAmerican and Caribbean issuesof the past and present. It alsoseeks to promote transatlanticapproaches to the complex inter-play of European, African, andAmerindian social and culturalbackgrounds in the genesis ofthese regions' hybrid postcolo-nial realities. Areal scholarship atNYU is especially deep at theborder between the humanitiesand the social sciences, where lit-erature, music, the arts, andcommunicative media nd theircontext in embodied social expe-rience. Center faculty have spe-cial expertise in cultural policy,performance, memory and her-itage, narrative, indigenoussocial movements, race andnationalism, neoliberal policiesand movements opposing them,populism, migration and socialjustice, and the study of urbanlife. Within the region's citiesand across its diasporas, manystudy populations and widespread cosmopolitanism andavant-garde sensibilities, whichcan be found equally among thevery rich and the very poor.Rather than simply providing awindow through which NorthAmericans may observe LatinAmerica and the Caribbean, theCenter seeks to serve as a bridgeto them. This is especiallyappropriate for an institutionlocated in New York City, a cos-mopolitan hub of migration,communications, and decisionmaking involving and directlyaffecting Latin America and theCaribbean. CLACS offers a Master of Arts program in Latin American andCaribbean studies with veoptions: (1) Latin American andCaribbean studies; (2) LatinAmerican and Caribbean studieswith a concentration in museumstudies; (3) Latin American andCaribbean studies with anadvanced certicate in museumstudies; (4) a dual degree M.A.-J.D. program with the NYUSchool of Law; and (5) a jointM.A. program with theDepartment of Journalism.

Students are advised by thedirector of graduate studies during their rst year. After the rst year ofstudy, students select one of the lawand society core or afliated faculty astheir adviser. Students enrolled in thePh.D. program in law and society maytake up to 12 credits in the NYUSchool of Law after consultation withtheir adviser and with the permissionof the instructor. Ph.D. students mayalso take a maximum of 24 credits inreading and research. General Degree Requirements: To qualify for the doctorate, a studentmust satisfactorily complete graduatestudies totaling at least 72 graduatecredits, with a minimum of 32 creditsat the doctoral level in residence atNew York University and a cumulativeGPA of B (3.0) or better; pass compre- hensive qualifying examinations; andpresent an acceptable dissertation.Most graduate courses carry 4 credits.Students may petition that a limitednumber of law and society graduatecourses taken elsewhere be transferredand credited toward the degreerequirements, but only after complet-ing three courses at New YorkUniversity. Only relevant law and soci-ety courses approved by the director ofgraduate studies and GSAS may betransferred. Foreign Language Requirement: Prociency in at least one languageother than English is required of alldoctoral candidates. Foreign languageprociency examinations are at once anexamination of both the foreign lan- guage and English. Currently, a stu-dent may choose to demonstrateprociency in ancient Greek, Chinese,French, German, Hebrew, Italian,Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Russian,or Spanish. Students who use a foreignlanguage other than the above as anintegral part of their dissertationresearch may petition for a substitu-tion. Language prociency may bedemonstrated by any of the following:(1) passing the foreign language pro-ciency examination given by theGraduate School of Arts and Science(GSAS); (2) passing the departmentalexamination, if one is regularly sched-uled by the department in which thestudent is registered; or (3) complet-ing, or having completed, not morethan two years before matriculation,with a grade of B or better, a full ornal intermediate-level college coursein the language. Students who havemet the foreign language requirementin another graduate school not morethan two years before matriculation inGSAS may request that such creden-tials be accepted, with the approval ofthe dean. The foreign languagerequirement may be waived withapproval by the LSP director of gradu-ate studies and GSAS. Basic Law and Society Course Requirement: This requirement ensures that students receive a compre-hensive knowledge of the social sciencetheories and research in the interdisci-plinary eld of law and society. Tomeet this requirement, students musttake the two basic law and societycourses with a minimum grade of B intheir rst year of study: SociolegalSeminar (G62.1001), offered each fallsemester, and Law and Social Policy(G62.1002), offered each spring.Students should complete this require-ment by the end of the rst year ofPh.D. studies. Methods Course Requirement: To ensure that students receive adequatemethodological training for conductingresearch, they are required to take onequantitative methods course in statis-tics and one qualitative methods coursein historical, interviewing, or ethno-graphic methods. While not required,it is highly recommended that studentstake one advanced course in eitherquantitative or qualitative methods.The advanced methods course typicallyfocuses on the methods used for thedissertation research. Students shouldcomplete this requirement by the endof the second year of Ph.D. studies. Disciplinary Minor Course Requirement: All students are required to acquire a basic knowledgeof one of the social science disciplinesengaged in disciplinary research in lawand society. After selecting a discipline,each student is required to take threenon-methods courses offered by theselected disciplinary department. Agrade of B is the minimum graderequired for each of the three courses. Law and Society Colloquium and Workshop Requirement: Law and society Ph.D. students are required toattend the law and society colloquiumand workshops during their rst yearof Ph.D. studies. Law and Society Written Field Exam: The law and society eld exam requires that students demonstrate acomprehensive knowledge of the inter-disciplinary eld of law and society.The examination covers material fromthe two basic law and society coursesand supplemental readings from thelaw and society reading list. The lawand society written eld exam commit-tee is composed of the faculty teachingthe two required basic law and societycourses. The exam is a written 24-hourtake-home exam that is graded as passor fail; it is given twice a year. If stu-dents fail, they may take it again butare not permitted to retake it morethan once. Students should completethis exam by the end of the second yearof Ph.D. work. Law and Society Oral Subeld Exam: Each student is required to demonstrate an in-depth knowledge ofone of the subelds of law and society.Each student selects three NYU lawand society faculty to serve as the lawand society oral subeld exam commit-tee. Two of the three oral exam com-mittee members must be NYU GSASfaculty or NYU School of Law facultywith a Ph.D. These faculty assist thestudent in developing an appropriatereading list for the exam. The law andsociety subeld exam is given twice ayear. If students fail, they make take itagain but are not permitted to retake itmore than once. The exam is a two-hour oral exam graded as a pass or failby the three selected faculty. A passrequires that two of the three selectedfaculty pass the exam. Students shouldcomplete this exam by the end of thethird year of Ph.D. work. Dissertation: After the dissertation chair and two readers approve a disser-tation proposal and the chair submits adissertation proposal acceptance formsigned by the director of graduatestudies, the dissertation may be under- taken. Once the completed dissertationis approved by the dissertation chairand two readers, an oral defense form isled, and the oral dissertation defenseis scheduled. Of the chair and tworeaders, two must be GSAS full-timefaculty. The completed dissertation isdefended in a two-hour oral defensebefore a ve-member committee con-sisting of the dissertation chair, thetwo readers, and two additional mem-bers. Of the ve members, three mustbe full-time GSAS faculty. Any disser-tation members that are not full-timeGSAS faculty must be approved by thevice dean at least four months prior tothe defense. A successful defenserequires that four of the ve membersof the dissertation committee vote toapprove the dissertation. For rules con-cerning time to degree, refer to theGSAS Policies and Procedures Manual. DUAL JURIS DOCTOR AND DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Students with a special interest in law may wish to pursue the dual degreeprogram leading to the J.D. and Ph.D.degrees. Students who wish to enroll inthe dual degree program must applyseparately to the School of Law and tothe Graduate School of Arts andScience (GSAS). Students may apply toboth schools simultaneously or to oneschool while in the rst year of studyat the other. There are no specicadmission standards or applications fordual degree applicants at either school.Once admitted to both schools, thestudent qualies for the dual degreeprogram. General Degree Requirements: The School of Law requires the completionof 82 credits in six semesters of full-time study for the J.D. degree. Full-time study is dened as 12 or morecredit hours per semester, primarily incourses commencing prior to 6 p.m.One semester of full-time graduatestudy, or up to 12 credits, from theGraduate School of Arts and Science iscounted toward the J.D. degree. Thus,at least one of the student's semestersin GSAS must be full time and consistof a majority of credits in daytimecourses. For a complete description ofcourses required for the J.D. degree,consult the School of Law Bulletin . The Ph.D. degree requires 72 credits ofgraduate study with a cumulative GPAof B (3.0) or better, of which 12 creditsare accepted from the School of Law.The two degrees therefore require atotal of 130 credits (70 at the School ofLaw and 60 at the Graduate School of 226 LAW AND SOCIETY227 LAW AND SOCIETYArts and Science). Because some of the credits earned in each program arecounted toward the other degree, it ispossible to complete the courserequirements for both degrees in veyears of full-time study. Students pur-suing the dual degree program typi-cally spend their rst year in theGraduate School of Arts and Science,the second year in the School of Law,alternating years until the require-ments for both schools are satised.Students may also take up to a maxi-mum of 24 credits in reading andresearch. Students may petition for alimited number of law and societygraduate courses taken elsewhere to betransferred and credited toward thePh.D. degree requirements, but onlyafter completing three courses at NewYork University. Only relevant law andsociety courses approved by the direc-tor of graduate studies and GSAS maybe transferred.

DUAL JURIS DOCTOR AND MASTER OF ARTS Students who wish to enroll in the J.D.-M.A. dual degree program mustapply separately to the School of Lawand to the Graduate School of Arts andScience. Students may apply to bothschools simultaneously or to theGraduate School of Arts and Sciencewhen in the rst or second year ofstudy at the School of Law. Once228 LAW AND SOCIETYadmitted to both schools, the student qualies for the dual degree program.There are no specic admission stan-dards or applications for dual degreeapplicants at either school. Students areadvised by the director of graduatestudies during their rst year. After therst year of study, students select oneof the law and society core or afliatedfaculty as an adviser. Students pursuingthe dual degree program typicallyspend their rst year in the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science. General Degree Requirements: The School of Law requires 82 credits ofstudy for the J.D. degree; however, inthe dual degree program, 8 credits forcourses taken in the Graduate School ofArts and Science are applied to theJ.D. degree. For a complete descriptionof courses required for the J.D. degree,consult the School of Law Bulletin . The Graduate School requires 32 credits ofstudy for the M.A. degree with a cumulative GPA of B (3.0) or better;however, in the dual degree program, 8 credits for courses taken in theSchool of Law are applied to the M.A.degree. Students in this program arerequired to take a total of 98 creditsfor the two degrees (74 and 24 credits,respectively, for the J.D. and theM.A.). Law and Society Course Requirements: This requirement ensures that students receive a compre-hensive knowledge of the social sciencetheories and research in the interdisci-plinary eld of law and society.

Course numbers listed in the course descriptions below refer to thefollowing: Law and Society Course: Open to law and society (Ph.D., J.D.-Ph.D., J.D.-M.A.) and other GSAS students. Cross-Listed Law to law and society (Ph.D., J.D.-Ph.D., J.D.-M.A.) andSchool of Law students. Law law and society (Ph.D., J.D.-Ph.D., J.D.-M.A.) stu-dents with permission and School ofLaw students. Cross-Listed Law and Society/GSAS Course: and and School Seminar (Law and Society)/L06.3570 (Law)Merry.This seminar (1) surveys approaches forunderstanding the relationshipbetween social and legal thought and(2) examines their methodologies.Readings examine the extent to whichsocial science and law have commontheoretical and methodological founda-tions. Focus is on analytical, doctrinal,institutional, and philosophical per-spectives and approaches to the studyof law and society. The interfacebetween legal and social, cultural, eco-nomic, and political phenomena isstudied through critical debates as wellas from a historical and comparativeperspective. Law and Social Policy G62.1002 (Law and Society)/G93.3534(Sociology)/L06.3580 (Law) Dixon. Scholars have debated for centuries therelationship between law and social pol-icy and whether law leads or followssocial change. Regardless of one's posi-tion on these issues, most agree thatlaw and society are interwoven suchthat law constitutes a eld where socialpolicies are created, reinforced, andtransformed. This course utilizes thelens of the courts to examine the rela-tionship between law, social policies,and social change. The rst part of thecourse analyzes how social policies arecreated, reinforced, and transformed inconstitutional courts. Students begin byexamining the consequences of U.S.Supreme Court decisions in both creat- ing and eliminating race and gendersegregation. Next, they explore the roleof constitutional courts in transformingsocial welfare polices in transitionalsocieties such as postcommunistCentral Europe. The second part of thecourse analyzes how social policies arecreated, reinforced, and transformed intrial courts. Students consider the rela-tionship between social policy and thetransformation of criminal courts in theprogressive era; they then investigatethis relationship in the contemporarycontext. In particular, the relationshipbetween social policies and currentcriminal court transformations involv-ing plea bargaining, sentencing guide-lines, and the recent creation ofproblem-solving, specialized drug anddomestic violence courts is explored.The third and nal part of the courseexamines how social policies are cre-ated, reinforced, and transformed ininternational courts. In particular, stu-dents explore human rights policies andthe development of the InternationalCriminal Court. Introduction to Legal Philosophy G62.1003 (Law and Society)/L06.3005(Law) Murphy. Survey of 20th-century contributionsto legal philosophy. In addition to thecentral debate between H. L. A. Hartand Ronald Dworkin over the conceptof law, students discuss natural lawtheory, legal realism, critical legalstudies, feminist jurisprudence, critical229 LAW AND SOCIETYrace theory, and some aspects of post- modern legal theory. The course beginswith an introduction to the methods ofmoral and political theory. Sociology of Law G62.1103 (Law and Society)/G93.2434 (Sociology) Dixon, Garland, Greenberg.Designed to provide a broad theoreticalframework for analyzing and interpret-ing the interrelationships between law,politics, and society. This course beginswith a consideration of the intellectualand methodological differencesbetween law and social science; it thenexamines the interface between law andsocial science from two perspectives.First, the relationship between law andsociety is traced from the point of viewof the influence of norms and customs,social structure, and class and power onthe development, form procedure, andsubstance of law. Second, the impact oflaw on society is examined in the areasof rights and social movements, racediscrimination, gender discrimination,and crime and justice. Critical race the-ory and critical gender theory receivespecial attention here. A section onlaw, courts, and the administration ofjustice examines the institutionalstructure and transformation of theAmerican legal and judicial system,and a nal section on the legal profes-sion, legal education, and critical legaltheory deals with the contradictory roleof lawyers as agents of the status quoand of social change. Seminar in the Sociology of Law G93.3534 (Sociology) Dixon, Garland, Greenberg.This course is designed to allow stu-dents to conduct research on a topiccovered in G62.1103. Students arerequired to enter the course with awell-formulated research proposal. Law and Modern Society G62.1004 (Law and Society)/L06.3560 (Law)Garland.This seminar explores the changingforms and functions of law in modernsociety and the sociological theoriesthat seek to interpret these develop-ments. The concept of modernity formsthe background for the rst half of thecourse, in which the work ofDurkheim, Marx, and Weber arereviewed in some detail. Thereafter theclass addresses a body of work, by writ-ers such as Foucault, Selznick, andTeubner, that argues that the characterof modern law\u2014and modern society\u2014is changing in ways that require us torevise our understanding of the rela-tionship of \"law\" to \"society.\" Themes include the decline of the rule of law;the emergence of responsive or reflexivelaw; law in the welfare state; laws,norms, and discipline; the relationbetween law and other systems of regu-lation; and the idea of postmodernityas it applies to the legal sphere. Thecourse does not presuppose any priorknowledge of social theory. Classic Sociological Theory G93.2111 (Sociology) Garland, Lukes. Examines major gures of modern soci-ology, including Marx, Durkheim,Weber, Simmel, Mead, Freud, andParsons. Focuses on the conditions andassumptions of social theory, theprocess of concept formation and the-ory building, general methodologicalissues, and the present relevance of theauthors examined. An effort is made tospeculate on the nature of the growthof knowledge in sociology. Advanced Theory Seminar: Foucault G62.1010 (Law and Society)/ G93.3112 (Sociology) Garland. This seminar is concerned with devel-oping an in-depth understanding ofthe work of Michel Foucault and itsimplications for social and historicalresearch. The class studies several of hissubstantive historical studies ( Discipline and Punish, Madness and Civilization,The Birth of the Clinic, andThe History of Sexuality ) and explores key concepts in Foucault's work, such as genealogy, power/knowledge, gov-ernmentality, and subjectication.Critical to Foucault's are attempts by otherauthors to put Foucaultian concepts totheir own use. Law, Culture, and Power G62.1012 (Law and Society)/G14.3391(Anthropology)/L06.3701 (Law) Merry. Anthropologists view law as basic tosocial life but highly variable in differ-ent cultural and historical contexts.This course examines theoretical andmethodological issues in legal anthro-pology, looking at some of the classicsin the eld as well as contemporarywork concerning the cultural dimen-sions of law and their relationship toforms of power and governmentality. Itfocuses on ethnographic methods forstudying law and legal institutions.The rst part of the course examinesearly work that grappled with thequestion of dening law in contextsthat lacked formal legal systems. Thesecond part explores legal pluralism,law and the colonial process, law andculture, the relationship between law and discipline, and law and everydaylife. As students read ethnographicstudies of everyday legal phenomenon,they discuss how to carry out ethno-graphic research and experiment withmini-research projects. In each of thereadings, students consider ethno-graphic approaches to legal phenomenaand discuss how each author has donehis or her ethnographic research andthe techniques involved. Alternative Dispute Resolution L09.3523 (Law) Chase. This course concerns \"alternate\" meth-ods of dispute resolution. By this ismeant the processes used to resolve dis-putes that are different from, andtherefore alternative to, formal civil lit-igation. These \"alternate\" processesinclude arbitration, mediation, andnegotiation. This course focuses on thelegal rules that regulate the use andmethodology of these processes. It alsoexplores the policy justications andthe problems that are raised by thesealternatives: To what extent shouldsuch alternatives be permitted, encour-aged, or required by government?Further, the course tries to understandthe social forces that further or impedetheir adoption. State, Law, and Politics in Society G62.1102 (Law and Society)/L06.3565(Law)/G53.2356 (Politics) Chevigny, Harrington.Examines the relationship between lawand the state by asking whether andhow law is autonomous from the polit-ical powers of the state. Studies theinstitutional powers of the legal profes-sion and the judiciary, doctrinal, andlegal rights. Examines sociolegal theo-ries of interpretation. Investigates theideology of law in legal formalism,both contemporary and in the past; lawand society; and critical legal studies. Current Constitutional Issues G62.1201 (Law and Society)/L01.3536.01 (Law) Bell. Students learn best by doing, that is,by active participation in the subjectmatter. Using simulation models, stu-dents perform the functions of bothjustices of the U.S. Supreme Court andattorneys handling litigation beforethat Court. By simulating the Court'sperspective, on the litigation in whichit grants or denies remedies, studentsbetter understand the often opaque rea-soning the Court provides in adoptingor rejecting principles, doctrines, andstandards. This structure enables par-ticipants to gain a good understanding of how factors, neither stated nor evenrecognized, can influence the judicialprocess. Constitutional Theory of Emergency Powers L01.3533 (Law) Ferejohn, Pasquino.The seminar discusses from a historicalperspective models of constitutionaliza-tion of emergency power, specically:the Roman dictatorship; Machiavelli,Rousseau, and the revival of the consti-tutional emergency power in the repub-lican tradition; Locke and the king'sprerogative; Montesquieu, the \"veil onliberty,\" the \"suspension\" during the French Revolution(the Revolutionary government); Lincolnand the suspension of habeas corpus dur-ing the American Civil War; CarlSchmitt and the Diktaturgewalt ofArticle 48 of the Weimar Constitution;De Gaulle and Article 16 of the consti-tution of the French Fifth Republic;Article 115a of the Bonner Grundgesetz;emergency power in India, Israel,Northern Ireland, and Latin America.The seminar considers, moreover, therecent American debate: Guantanamoand after. State and Local Government G62.1105 (Law and Society)/L01.3016(Law) Jacobs, Viteritti. Explores the power that state and localgovernments have to regulate, providepublic services, redistribute wealth,spend, nance private projects, tax, andborrow, and ways in which law tries tokeep that power accountable. Some ofthe doctrinal issues considered includeconflicts between state and localauthority, controls imposed as condi-tions on federal or state grants, limitson borrowing and decit spending,direct democracy, nondiscriminatoryaccess to services, and local governmentliability for damages for violations ofcivil rights and antitrust law. Law and Economics G62.1024 (Law and Society)/L06.3020 (Law)Kornhauser.The rst part of this course is a surveyof intermediate microeconomic theory,with an emphasis on welfare econom-ics. It provides a framework for the sec-ond part of the course, which is aneconomic analysis of tort and propertyrules and consideration of similar prob-lems in law and economics. Voting, Game Theory, and the Law G62.1025 (Law and Society)/L06.3035(Law) Beno\u00eet. This course rst addresses the proper-ties of various voting methods and pro-cedures. It considers desirableproperties that a voting method mightpossess and determines which methods,if any, have these properties. The ideasdeveloped are used to analyze practicalproblems, such as voting in union elec-tions and the provision of minorityrepresentation within the context ofthe Voting Rights Act. Next, thecourse considers the concept of powerand examines the distribution of poweramong voters in different states andwithin voting bodies, such as theUnited Nations Security Council andcongressional committees. Finally, thecourse develops concepts related tostrategic thinking used in game theoryand applies these concepts to votingsituations and legal problems. Law and Social Science G62.1403 (Law and Society)/L06.3008 (Law)Tyler.Introduction to the interface betweenlaw and the social sciences. Exploresthe use of social science research nd-ings in a variety of areas of the law.These areas include jury decision mak-ing; the use of proles in identifyingsuspects; evidence such as lie detectors,eyewitnesses, and repressed memories;trademark confusion; psychologicalassumptions underlying constitutionallaw; citizen dissatisfaction with the lawand legal authorities; and a variety ofother topics.

Seminar in Sociology of Law: Gender Politics and Law G62.1021 (Law and Society)/G93.3534(Sociology) Dixon. More than statutes, rules, and courtcases, law constitutes a discursive eldwhere structured inequalities and sharedcultural understandings are dened,reinforced, and transformed. This coursefocuses on the development and changesin U.S. legal discourses and how thesedebates produce the context for thedevelopment, administration, and inter-pretation of gender relations. Studentsexplore the historical development ofthe liberal legal system in the UnitedStates as it relates to gender as well ascritiques of liberal legalism from thestandpoint of legal realism, critical legaltheory, and literary criticism. In addi-tion, students examine legal debates invarious substantive areas, such as consti-tutional law, abortion, reproduction,homosexuality, domestic and sexual vio-lence, employment discrimination,divorce, and custody. Gender Issues in Law and Culture G62.1028 (Law and Society)/L06.3567(Law) Bruner, Gilligan, Richards.

Its central topic is the terms of thestruggle to introduce unconventional,gender-subversive voices and topics intopublic discourse, criticizing culturalracism, sexism, and homophobia. Race and Legal Scholarship G62.1022 (Law and Society)/L06.3545(Law) Caldwell. This seminar considers how concepts ofprejudice and theoretical work on theoperation of racial ideology affectdevelopments in the law concerningthe protection against racial discrimi-nation afforded by specic constitu-tional and statutory laws as well asinterpretations of the impact of racegenerally in other substantive legalareas. Recent developments in thestudy of race in the social sciences areconsidered. Students examine contem-porary problems in race relations inlight of the theoretical foundations of 230 LAW AND SOCIETY231 LAW AND SOCIETYclassical legal scholarship, law and eco- nomics, critical legal scholarship, andthe emerging critical scholarship onrace\u2014much, but not all, of which iswritten by legal scholars of color. Race, Values, and the American Legal Process G62.1023 (Law and Society)/L06.3512 (Law) Higgenbotham Jr. This seminar examines the use of thelaw to both perpetuate and eradicateracial injustice in the United Statesfrom the inception and rise of slaveryduring the colonial period through theU.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. The major institutions studied are thecourts and the legislatures (predomi-nantly at the colony or state level). Thecourse explores both criminal and civillaw and focuses particularly on theirrole in the preclusion or allowance oftraditional family relations, educationoptions, due process in the courts, andother \"rights\" for blacks. Law and Literature L06.3510 (Law) Gillers, Stimpson.How does literature use law as a sourceof structure and theme? How does lit-erature view law and legal institutions?What can literature and literary imagi-nation bring to the performance oflegal tasks, including \"telling stories\"about cases? What different (or similar)interpretive rules do lawyers and liter-ary critics employ in construing a text?How are human passions and thehuman condition differently describedand treated in law and literature? Criminology G62.2021 (Law and Society)/G93.2503 (Sociology) Dixon, Garland, Greenberg.This course provides a critical evalua-tion of the historical development ofthe study of crime. The readings offer avariety of theoretical and methodologi-cal approaches to the analysis of variousareas of crime (violent\u2014property\u2014vic-timless\u2014white collar). The class pro-vides a forum for critically discussingthe variety of theoretical frameworks,issues, research methodologies, andndings used in examining the con-struction, violation, and punishment ofcrime. Seminar in Criminology G93.3513 (Sociology) Dixon, Garland, Greenberg. This course is designed to allow stu-dents to conduct research on a topiccovered in G62.2021. Students arerequired to enter the course with awell-formulated research proposal.Juvenile Justice L04.3019 (Law) Jacobs.This course covers the full range ofcriminal procedures applicable to juve-niles: searches and seizures, pretrialinterrogation, condentiality, diver-sion, pretrial detention, transfer toadult court, right to counsel, sentenc-ing, conditions of connement, etc. Inaddition, the casebook is augmentedwith some materials on juvenile crime,juvenile criminal records, and the han-dling of juvenile offenders in othercountries.

It is particularly con-cerned with developing a sociologicalaccount of contemporary patterns ofpenal practice in the United States andelsewhere. Criminal Sanctions G62.2022 (Law and Society)/L04.3525 (Law) Garland. This seminar examines current issuesin the sentencing and sanctioning ofoffenders. Using historical, sociologi-cal, and philosophical approaches, itaims to develop a critical understand-ing of contemporary policies and prac-tices of punishment. Readings dealwith policies such as incapacitation,just desserts, expressive justice, andretribution and look at the decisionmaking and practices of the institu-tions that implement them. The aim isto ground normative analysis (as devel-oped by the philosophical literature) ina more empirical knowledge of howpenal institutions actually work. Death Penalty G62.2028 (Law and Society)/L06.3577 (Law) Garland. The aim of this seminar is to developan in-depth analysis of the institutionof capital punishment and to address aseries of questions to which it gives rise. Using historical and sociologicalresearch, the seminar explores how theforms, functions, and social meaningsof capital punishment have changedover time and what social forces havedriven these changes. Thereafter, thecourse focuses on the modern Americandeath penalty and the specic charac-teristics of the institution that hastaken shape in the post-Furman era. Race, Poverty, and Criminal Justice G62.2027 (Law and Society)/L04.3512(Law) Stevenson. Examines the influence of race and vic-tim-offender economic status in theadministration of criminal justice.Conscious and unconscious racism aswell as overt and more complicatedmechanisms for creating bias againstthe poor are explored. Students studyracial disparities in charging, discre-tionary judgments in the prosecutionof criminal cases, sentencing, and theformulation of crime policy in theUnited States and discuss issues of raceand class in criminal case court deci-sions. Students assess the effectivenessof antidiscrimination law in the crimeand punishment area and review dataand empirical studies on a variety ofissues that impact the poor and peopleof color in the criminal justice system.Particular attention is paid to the roleof legislators, prosecutors, state andfederal judges, defense attorneys, andjurors, and litigation and other reformstrategies aimed at bias against racialminorities and the poor are discussed. Policing in Democratic Societies G62.2023 (Law and Society)/L04.3533(Law) Skolnick. What are the origins of democraticpolicing? How are police organized,and how do they function? Why dolaw enforcement ofcials act the waythey do, in patrolling, searching, seiz-ing, interrogating? What are the occa-sions, explanations, and remedies forpolice brutality, corruption, and per-jury? What kinds of rules, organiza-tions, and institutions are appropriateand effective for maintaining policeaccountability in a democratic society?Although students discuss some consti-tutional cases, this is not a systematicseminar in the doctrine of police prac-tices. Rather, the focus is on the his-tory, sociology, and politics of thepolice. Police accountability throughpolitics and law is a major concern.232 LAW AND SOCIETYGun Control G62.2025 (Law and Society)/L04.3525 (Law) Jacobs, Noble. This seminar examines the problemthat rearms and other weapons posefor contemporary society and the con-stitutional, statutory, administrative,and court-made laws relating to rearms a limitation regulation; federalismand the federal role in the regulating ofrearms; the role of the Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; theconflict between state and local govern-ment in regulating rearms; criminallaw issues (including aggravatedoffenses, prophylactic offenses, and pre-sumptions); sentencing law issues(bootstrapping and other enhancementsfor crimes committed with rearms);the prohibition and regulation of sub-categories of rearms (e.g., \"Saturdaynight specials\" and \"assault rifles\");products controls on lesslethal weaponry (knives, mace, andbrass knuckles); and controls on morelethal weaponry (explosives and mili-tary weapons). Regulation of Vice G62.2024 (Law and Society)/L04.3559 (Law) Skolnick. What is vice and how does it differfrom crime? If we criminalize it, canwe regulate it? And if we decriminalizeit, how shall we regulate it? This semi-nar discusses a range of \"vices\" andregulatory strategies that might beapplied. Because students need toknow much about the nature of the\"vice\" in order to sensibly discuss pol-icy options, there is considerable read-ing, some of it required, othersrecommended. Corruption and Corruption Control G62.2026 (Law and Society)/L04.3510(Law) Goldstock. This seminar examines the pervasiveproblem of ofcial corruption and thevarious bodies of law and legal institu-tions that exist to prevent, detect, andpunish corruption. Topics includebribery and antigratuity statutes; thefederal role in investigating and prose-cuting state and local corruption underthe Hobbes Act and mail enforcement strate-gies and sanctions. Deviance and Social Control G62.2020 (Law and Society)/G93.2160 (Sociology) Dixon, Duster, Greenberg, Horowitz.Broad, introductory course in the soci-ology of deviance and social control.Students read and analyze classical andcontemporary texts representing differ-ent theoretical and research traditions,dealing with the designation of sometypes of behavior and conditions asdeviant; ideologies and methods ofsocial control; the etiology of deviance;deviant subcultures; and the politics ofdeviance. An attempt is made to exam-ine a wide range of normative viola-tions, such as crime, mental illness,witchcraft, scientic deviance, alcoholand drug use, and various types of sex-ual deviance. Health Law G62.2002 (Law and Society)/L13.3525 (Law) Law. Considers how the law influences theavailability, quality, and cost of med-ical care and demands a sophisticatedunderstanding of many bodies of law,including the Constitution; state and not-for-prot); labor law; and more.However, the focus is not primarilylegal. Rather, the effort is to grapplewith dening life experiences and toexplore the political, philosophical, andpersonal values that shape these experi-ences. Statutes, regulations, and judi-cial decisions are primary sourcematerials, but these are placed in anempirical policy context. Empirical Issues in Land Use and Environmental Law G62.2004 (Law and Society)/L10.3501 (Law) Been. This seminar explores the empiricalassumptions that underlie leading the-oretical justications for various aspectsof land use and environmental law, sur-veys and critiques existing empiricalevidence bearing upon those assump-tions, and formulates research plans forfurther tests of the assumptions.Particular attention is given to theempirical bases for various theoriesregarding when compensation shouldbe paid for environmental and land userestrictions imposed upon property.The course does not assume statisticalor econometric knowledge, nor are stu-dents asked to conduct statistical tests.Instead, the emphasis is on learning toidentify often hidden empiricalassumptions, gaining rudimentary understanding of empirical methodolo-gies, and developing an ability to for-mulate research questions for persons(such as expert witnesses) who do havethe econometric skills necessary toactually execute the studies. Studentsprepare short critiques of existingempirical studies and present a pro-posal for an empirical study. Studentswho wish to use the seminar for a part A paper may use the proposal asthe springboard for a longer analysis.The seminar lays the groundwork fordeveloping a clinic in which studentsprovide empirical analyses necessary forinformed land use and environmentalpolicy discussions. Although a back-ground in land use or environmentallaw is not an absolute prerequisite,some familiarity with at least one ofthose areas is desirable. Land Use, Housing, and Community Development in NewYork City G62.1106 (Law and Society)/L10.3506 (Law) Schill, Upham.Overview of the theory and practice ofurban development in low- and moder-ate-income neighborhoods. Focus is onthree specic subject areas: land use,housing, and community development.Begins with background readings onthe growth of cities and urbaneconomies, the interaction of demo-graphics and markets, and the legalframework of local government in gen-eral. Then looks in detail at a series ofcase studies selected to illustrate thefundamental legal, political, and eco-nomic issues in land use and housing.The primary goal for the seminar is thefamiliarization of the students with thelegal and political frameworks withinwhich development takes place in low-and moderate-income neighborhoodsin New York City. A second goal is theexplication in several concrete settingsof the relationship between legal doc-trine\u2014the presentations of \"legalframeworks\" that begin the seminarand each case study\u2014and what actu-ally results from the interaction oflegal, political, and economic forces. Athird goal is the training of students inempirical eldwork and sociolegalmethodology. Fieldwork reports pro-vide an opportunity for students tointegrate empirical investigation withtheory building.233 LAW AND SOCIETYSex Discrimination Law (Law and Society)/L08.3508 (Law)Ellis, Goldscheid.Taught by feminist practitioners, thiscourse seeks to integrate feminist the-ory with the practice of women's rightslaw by examining a wide range of con-temporary women's rights legal issues.Beginning with the development ofconstitutional protection for genderdiscrimination, the course examinestopics such as reproductive rights, edu-cational equity, violence againstwomen, employment, and gender biasin the courts, with attention to howwomen's rights concerns intersect withissues of race, class, and sexual orienta-tion. The course discusses how litiga-tion, public policy, and legislativestrategies have and can be used toachieve feminist visions of equality. Sexuality and the Law G62.2007 (Law and Society)/L08.3509 (Law)Ettelbrick.Begins with the development of consti-tutional, medical, and theoretical con-structions of sexuality. The question ofhow state regulations and legal analysispromote or reflect certain views of sexu-ality, gender, and sexual orientation iscentral to discussion and study. The lat-ter part of the course applies this back-ground to three specic institutionalcontexts in which the social rules ofsexuality and gender are challenged andcharged through the legal process: themilitary, marriage and the family, andthe workplace. Intimate and Family Violence L08.3501 (Law) Mills. Lawyers and social workers are oftenunprepared for the unique emotional,legal, and cultural challenges posed byworking with survivors of intimateabuse. In part, the tension lies betweenthe public feminist discourse ondomestic violence and the individualrealities of battered women's lives.Drawing on legal and related socialwork research and methods, this inter-disciplinary course for law and socialwork students explores how to recon-cile cultural, political, mental health,and safety concerns as they are reflectedin the movement to address domesticviolence. Using empirical studies as aplatform for exploring diverseapproaches to working with batteredwomen, their batterers, and their chil-dren, this course develops a methodthat lawyers and social workers can useto traverse such issues as the batterer'srecidivism and the victim's autonomy.Developing a critique of feminist the-ory from the survivor's point of view is key to improving existing strategies foraddressing domestic abuse. Rights of the Mentally Disabled G62.2008 (Law and Society)/L08.3535(Law) Levy. Study of the delicate balance betweengovernment benevolence and individualautonomy. This seminar considers therights of persons with mental disabili-ties in institutional and community set-tings and explores issues involvingpsychiatric expertise, involuntary com-mitment, the right to treatment, theright to refuse treatment, discrimina-tion, the rights of newborns with men-tal disabilities (the \"Baby Doe\" cases)and medical decision making forincompetent persons (Cruzan, et. al.).Students examine the development ofcase law and statutes and the socialpolicies underlying them, analyze briefsand transcripts from selected cases, andattend a commitment hearing.

Explores the followingquestions: What are the roots of theimpulse to censor? What culturalassumptions are embedded in FirstAmendment law and theory? Howdoes censorship law reflect or reinforcecultural anxieties about certain sub-jects, such as gender and class, andabout certain forms of expression, suchas technology and art? In what waysdoes censorship law shape literature,art, and popular culture? Readingsinclude First Amendment case law andtheory as well as selections from otherdisciplines History and Theory of International Law L06.3539 (Law) Kingsbury. This course explores the intellectualfoundations of contemporary interna-tional law. The aim is to embed think-ing about international law in widerbodies of political and legal theory.The course considers the competingapproaches to international orderdeveloped by Grotius, Pufendorf,Hobbes, and some of their modern suc-cessors, including fundamental con-cepts of sovereignty, anarchy, andsociety, and rights and law in interna-tional relations; the approaches toimperialism and colonial expansiontaken by Vitoria, Gentili, Locke, and19th-century British and theinteraction of international law withcolonial and postcolonial projects; the vitality of alternative models of inter-national order and alternative historiesof international law; the theoreticalunderpinnings of the positivist-pro-gressivist mainstream of internationallaw in the 20th century, with a partic-ular focus on Oppenheim and on therelations of law to power; the imagina-tion and problems of international lawas law and as a discipline and of theroles of international lawyers. Indigenous Peoples in International Law L05.3547 (Law) Kingsbury. Issues concerning indigenous peoples(including descendants of precolonialinhabitants in the Americas andAustralasia and groups in Asia andelsewhere) are increasingly signicantin many countries and in the UnitedNations, the World Bank, theOrganization of American States, andother international institutions. Thisseminar discusses challenges to thestandard liberal concepts and to demo-cratic theory posed by such issues asthe meaning and problems of the con-cept of indigenous rights; the natureand meaning of the right to self-deter-mination (including native peoples'self-determination if Quebec secedesfrom Canada and important develop-ments in indigenous peoples' rights inLatin American states); tensionsbetween individual rights and grouprights in minority rights environ-mental law; peoples'rights under international trade andintellectual property regimes. Children's Rights in International Law L05.3563 (Law) Alston. This seminar focuses on the evolutionof children's human rights within thecontext of international law and theextent to which they have influencedthe content and institutional arrange-ments for the promotion of humanrights. The United Nations Conventionon the Rights of the Child, the mostwidely ratied human rights treaty inhistory, provides the framework for dis-cussions. The seminar considers thebackground drafting of the 1989Convention and ways in which thebroader international law frameworkimpacts upon children. It explores con-ceptual dilemmas involved in therecognition of these rights; the contentof the major principles enshrined inthe Convention (notably the principlesof nondiscrimination; the best interests234 LAW AND SOCIETYof the child; and children's right to participate). The focus is on key topicssuch as abortion, juvenile justice, cor-poral punishment, child soldiers, inter-country adoption, refugee children, andchild sexual exploitation. International Human Rights L05.3034 (Law) Alston. This course provides a general intro-duction to the role of human rights inthe 21st century. It examines the his-torical origins of the concept, its inter-national legal context, and itsnormative structure. Themes that runthroughout the course include culturalrelativism, the relationship betweenrights and duties, the \"public-private\"distinction, and the changing concep-tions of statehood and sovereignty. Thecourse concentrates on the UnitedNations system, dealing with bothcharter-based and treaty-based arrange-ments. In order to illustrate the func-tions and processes of institutions, thecourse looks at issues such as disap-pearances, arbitrary detention, femalecircumcision, homosexuality, politicalparticipation, and democratization.The role of nonstate actors, and corpo-rations in particular, is examined. Constitutional Justice and Comparative Perspective L01.3528 (Law) Kramer, Pasquino. This course focuses on the decision-making procedures, the type of deliber-ation, and the reasons-giving rhetoricof constitutional courts in differentcountries (notably France, Germany,Italy, Spain\u2014other national cases areconsidered according to the interest,the nationality, and the linguistic com-petencies of the students). More speci-cally, students read and discussopinions of the courts and analyze therole these institutions play in thestructure of constitutional govern-ments. The origins of judicial reviewand tensions between democraticaccountability and constitutional adju-dication are also discussed. Law and Development L06.3554 (Law) Holmes, Upham. This course examines the various theo-ries of the role that law and legal insti-tutions play in national economic,social, and political development anduse empirical evidence from selectedcountries to critique these theories.Approaches range from neoclassicaleconomics to cultural determinism toinstitutional sociology and include thework of authors like Douglas North,Amartya Sen, Chalmers Johnson, andHernando de Soto. The course consid- ers themes such as the denition of therule of law for developing societies; themeaning of development; the impactand influence of economic globaliza-tion; the role of external organizationssuch as the World Bank, the WTO(World Trade Organization), or USAID(U.S. Agency for InternationalDevelopment); and the role of factorssuch as culture, history, and race.

Law and Society in Japan G62.3004 (Law and Society)/L05.3006 (Law)Upham.Looks at the interaction of the legal sys-tem and legal institutions withJapanese society, politics, and econom-ics. The goal is to use Japan as a casestudy of the role that law can play incontemporary advanced democraciesand thereby test current social theory oflaw and society against a non-Westernexperience. Looks closely at several dif-ferent areas of law in Japan, includingenvironmental protection, patients'rights, freedom of religion, civil rightsissues in employment discriminationand afrmative action, criminal proce-dure and police practices, HIV/AIDS,and family law. Readings consist oftranslated cases, statutes, and othertypes of legal documents, and secondarymaterials. Evaluation is based primarilyon a take-home examination/essay,although in particular circumstancespermission is granted to students whowish to write a research paper instead.No particular background is required orrecommended, and students with noprevious interest or experience in Japanare welcome. Law and Society in China G62.3005 (Law and Society)/L05.3009 (Law)Cohen, Scogin.Deals with the development of theindigenous Chinese legal tradition,within the context of the Confucian,legalist, and Taoist philosophy; thereform of law in modern China; andthe emerging legal framework for for-eign investment in China. TheConfucian legal tradition is at the core of the legal cultures of East Asiaincluding Japan, Korea, and much ofSoutheast Asia. The rst part of thecourse serves as an introduction to thattradition. Contemporary China hasseen an effort to create a new legal sys-tem within the context of transforminga communist command economy into amarket system.

The aim of this seminar is to exposegraduate students to a variety of writ-ings in and on Islamic law. The rstreadings consist of introductory sur-veys. These are followed by recentstudies on the theoretical foundationsof Islamic law ( usul alqh ). Students then sample some substantive legalmaterial as it is presented in the classi-cal legal manuals. The aim here is togive a sense of the way in whichIslamic law was traditionally presentedand how these manuals were then usedby scholars. This is followed by anexamination of the methods and formsof transmission of Islamic legal knowl-edge and expertise. Students then lookat a number of studies that depictIslamic law as it was understood, prac-ticed, and enforced. Next, studentslook at the treatment of Islamic juristsof marginals and minorities in theoret-ical writings as well as historical expe-rience in order to explore how normswere established and enforced and howthose who did not fully t these wereconceived and treated by the law.Finally, students survey the attempts toreform Islamic law in modern times. Women and Islamic Law G62.3007 (Law and Society)/G77.1854 (MiddleEastern and Islamic Studies) Haykel. Acquaints students with the waysIslamic law has treated women in theoryand practice. Students are exposed tomedieval and modern texts regardingthe status of women as believers, daugh-ters, wives, mothers, and legal persons.Case studies from different periods ofIslamic history as well as writings fromcontemporary anthropology are read anddiscussed. The aim is to examine theways in which Islamic law has been var-iously dened, invoked, implemented,or not implemented, in different con-texts. Emphasis is on the strategieswomen have sought to transgress \"the235 LAW AND SOCIETYlaw\" in order to achieve a better out- come for themselves. In addition, stu-dents look at the ways in which modernlegislation in the Muslim world hastreated women and discuss the debatesover their rights and identity that havetaken place amongst feminists (bothMuslim and non-Muslim) and Islamistsand in international bodies such as theUnited Nations. Comparative Criminal Justice Clinic: Focus on Domestic ViolenceL02.2504 (Law) Das Dasgupta, Maguigan.Domestic violence occurs everywhere,with different resonances in differentcultures. Every country has a criminaljustice system, but the attempt to usearrest and prosecution as tools againstdomestic violence is far from universal.Within each nation where domesticviolence is prosecuted, there is debateabout whether a criminal-courtapproach will ever make more than amarginal difference. This debate,examined in a comparative and inter-disciplinary context, is the focus of theweekly seminar. Specic areas ofinquiry include mandatory arrest, pros-ecutorial discretion, no-drop policies,and mandatory reporting to lawenforcement by health care providers.The main points of comparison areIndia and the United States. Legal Changes After Communism L05.3522 (Law) Holmes. This yearlong seminar focuses on themain issues of postcommunist legaldevelopment, with an emphasis onRussia and the countries of EasternEurope, including problems of judicialreview, federalism, separation of powers,legislative oversight, rights enforce-ment, electoral law, and corruption. Transitional Justice in Times of Transition L05.3536 (Law) Boraine, Van Zyl.This course deals with the historical,political, social and, especially, legalquestions arising from transitions incountries emerging from dictatorshipor authoritarian governments to newforms of democracy. In particular, theemphasis is on how countries deal withtheir past in building a new future.Many countries have experienced graveviolations of human rights, and the course examines the various ways ofaddressing these violations. The focusis on tribunals and truth commissions.The course considers the period of theNuremberg Trials until the contempo-rary conflicts in the Balkans. Case Studies in Transitional Justice L05.3540 (Law) Prerequisite:L05.3536. Boraine, Van Zyl. Case studies, historical and contempo-rary, of countries experiencing transi-tion are discussed in this course. Ineach case study, documents related tothe specic country are made availableto the students prior to the class.Examples of some of the countries con-sidered include Peru, East Timor,Ghana, Sierra Leone, Mexico, NorthernIreland, Afghanistan, Burma, andZimbabwe. Students select one casestudy for their semester paper. Global Public Service Lawyering: Theory and Practice L05.4510 (Law) Maguigan, Upham.This seminar examines the history andtheory of public interest lawyeringfrom a global perspective. Topicsinclude the effectiveness of impact liti-gation versus other approaches to socialchange, the appropriateness of publicinterest law for non-Western societies,the impact of economic markets on thedeveloping world, the role of interna-tional legal and political norms ondomestic law, and the consideration ofthe role of lawyers and legal institu-tions in addressing these issues. The Empowered Self: Law and Society in the Age of IndividualismL06.3551 (Law) Franck. This seminar examines the gradualemancipation of the individual innational and international law, includ-ing the right to nationality, religion,choice of career, and name. These andother issues of personal emancipationare studied in the context of variouslegal systems and cultures. The emerg-ing rights pertaining to gender andpolitical participation are discussed byreference to the historic evolution ofhuman rights and civil rights.Topics in Law and Society G62.3300 (Law and Society) Staff.

The Long Island UniversityPalmer School provides an additionalapplication form for the dual degreeprogram, which also must be com-pleted. Applicants are reviewed by adual degree faculty admissions com-mittee comprised of representativesfrom the participating programs. Asingle response letter will be sent tothe student from the joint admissionscommittee. Inquiries about the dual degree program should be sent to PaulineRothstein, Program Coordinator, Bobst Library, 70 Washington SquareSouth, New York, NY 10012-1019,212-998-1516, pauline.rothstein@ nyu.edu . DUAL DEGREE PROGRAM Students must complete all require- ments of both degree programs, gener-ally between 32 and 40 points for theNYU master's program and 36 pointsfor the M.S. in library science. A totalof 8 points from each program's core courses may be transferred for credit inplace of elective courses toward theother degree. Also required is a credit-bearing internship in which the stu-dent undertakes a mentored workexperience in a research library. Tuitionis paid to New York University for allNYU courses and to Long IslandUniversity for the Palmer Schoolcourses. Further details of the M.S. inlibrary science degree requirements canbe found at www.liu.edu/palmernyc. 236 LIBRARY SCIENCEDIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM Professor Alice Flynn Palmer School of Library and InformationScience, Long Island University COORDINATOR OF THE PROGRAM Dr. Pauline Rothstein n this dual degree program, students maysimultaneously pursueany stand-alone master's degree (except in linguistics) inthe Graduate School of Arts andScience of New York Universityand a Master of Science inlibrary science with the PalmerSchool of Library and Infor- mation Science of Long IslandUniversity. The administrationofce and all of the instructionfor the M.S. program are locatedin Bobst Library, on the NYUWashington Square campus. Theprimary objective of the dualdegree program is to preparestudents for employment as\"subject specialists\" in researchlibraries at universities, researchand cultural institutes, privateindustry, and elsewhere. A holis-tic approach to integrating sub-ject expertise with education and training in library and informa-tion science provides dual degreegraduates with the skills andknowledge they need for a vari-ety of jobs in the informationeconomy. Students enrolled inthis program work individuallywith senior subject specialists(mentors) from the New YorkUniversity Libraries. In addition,there are opportunities to meetwith library and informationspecialists from cutting-edgeprojects.

The Graduate RecordExamination is required of all appli-cants. Admission is based on an evalua-tion of the full completed GSASapplication, including the applicant'sacademic record, writing sample, schol-arly recommendations, and required testscores. Applications are only acceptedfor admission in the fall semester. The graduate program in linguistics is a Ph.D. program, for students inter-ested in a career in research. All appli-cants must apply directly for thisprogram; applications are not acceptedfor a stand-alone M.A. degree. The M.A.degree may be awarded to students inthe Ph. D. program upon completion ofthe requirements outlined below. Transfer credits. The department does not normally transfer credits for previ-ous graduate course work. In excep-tional circumstances, a small number ofgraduate credits may be transferred.The student will be advised by thedirector of graduate studies concerningequivalencies. Requests for transfers ofcredits for particular courses must bemade within the student's rst year inthe department. MASTER OF ARTS While the graduate program in lin-guistics is a Ph.D. program, it offerscontinuing students the option ofreceiving a Master of Arts degree dur-ing their studies for the doctorate. Thedepartment does not admit studentsfor a stand-alone M.A. degree. Studentsin the Ph.D. program who completethe following requirements may, attheir option, apply for the M.A.degree, but are not required to do so asa prerequisite for the Ph.D. M.A. Degree Requirements: 1. Course work. Satisfactory completion of graduate studies totaling at least 32points of approved courses (at least 24in residence at New York University),including the four basic coursesrequired of all Ph.D. Reasonable pro- ciency in a foreign language of clearrelevance to the student's research, sub-ject to approval by the director ofgraduate studies (DGS). (For evaluationof language prociency, see belowunder Doctor of Philosophy.) 3. Qualifying paper. An article-quality paper in which the student demon-strates the ability to carry out originalresearch. This is the student's rstqualifying paper; the Ph.D. degreerequires a second one. The rules andtimetables for the two qualifyingpapers are spelled out together in item 3 of the Ph.D. requirements.(Students who are leaving the programwithout completing the Ph.D. may,with the approval of their adviser andthe director of graduate studies, substi-tute another substantial paper or awritten comprehensive examinationinstead of a qualifying paper.) DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Ph.D. Degree Requirements: 1.Course work. For the Ph.D., the stu- dent is required to complete a total of72 points of approved courses (ofwhich at least 32 must be completedin residence at NYU). Course work inrelated elds must be approved inadvance by the director of graduatestudies. The following 4-point courses are required of all students: Phonology I (G61.1210) Syntax I (G61.1310)Semantics I (G61.1340)Sociolinguistics (G61.1510) In addition, students must fulll breadth and area requirements, as fol-lows. Breadth requirements: All students are required to take three of the follow-ing four courses: Field Methods(G61.0044), Area requirements: For students wish- ing to specialize in syntax or semantics,the area requirements are Syntax II(G61.2310) and Semantics II(G61.2370); Semantics II must betaken in the same year as Semantics I.Area requirements for those wishing tospecialize in phonetics or phonology arePhonology II (G61.1220) in are requiredto take Sociolinguistic Field Methods(G61.2540) and Linguistic Variation(G61.2530); the department also rec-ommends that these students takeLinguistic Anthropology (G14.1040)and at least one other course in linguis-tic anthropology from the following:Ethnographic Methods (G14.2700),Identity and Language (G14.3392), orLinguistic Field Methods (G14.3394).For students wishing to specialize inneurolinguistics, the department rec-ommends the Seminar in Neuro-linguistics (G61.3710) and anotherappropriate course in this area. Students are not required to choose a specialization when they enter theprogram. When they choose, orchange, their specialization, the DGSwill advise them about how to complywith the area requirements. 239 LINGUISTICS2.Language prociency. For the Ph.D. degree, the student must demonstratereasonable prociency in two languagesother than English that are of clear rel-evance to the student's research, subjectto approval by the director of graduatestudies. (A language used to satisfy theM.A. language requirement may countas one of the two required for thePh.D.) Prociency can be demonstratedeither by earning a grade of B or betterin at least the fourth term of a collegeforeign language course completed notmore than two years before the stu-dent's admission to the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science, or by pass-ing the appropriate Graduate School ofArts and Science foreign language pro-ciency examination. When prociencyis demonstrated in some other way(e.g., when a student presents anundergraduate degree from a foreignuniversity where the language in ques-tion is the medium of instruction forthe student's course of study), thedirector of graduate studies may for-ward to GSAS a request for a waiver ofthe foreign language examination. 3. Qualifying papers . For the Ph.D. degree, students must submit qualify-ing papers in two different areas of lin-guistics. A qualifying paper (QP) iscalled \"qualifying\" because by it a stu-dent demonstrates that she or he isqualied to do a dissertation. It containsoriginal thought, a command of the lit-erature, sound linguistic analysis andargumentation, and clear presentation. Length of the paper . Each paper must be no more than 50 double-spacedpages in length (tables, charts, spectro-grams, footnotes, and bibliographyincluded). Qualifying-paper committee . Each qualifying-paper committee consists ofa committee chair and two other fac-ulty members. It is the student'sresponsibility to obtain the consent ofthe committee chair and members toparticipate on the committee. Thecommittee should be fully constitutedbefore the start of the semester inwhich work on the QP is to begin. Timetable for submission . The student submits the rst QP in the fourthsemester of the student's career and thesecond QP in the fth semester. If oneof the QPs contains an extensive exper-imental or eldwork component, onesemester is added to that QP'stimetable. Thus, if it is the rst QP , itis due in the fth semester (and hencethe second QP is due in the sixthsemester), while if it is the second QPthat adds an extensive experimental/eldwork component, it is due in thesixth rather than the fth semester. This alteration of timetable must beagreed upon by the student's adviser,QP committee chair, and the DGS nolater than the beginning of the semes-ter in which the QP would otherwisebe due. Proposals . Before undertaking a QP , students must prepare a two-page pro-posal of their QP consisting of anabstract and a reading list. For QPswith extensive experimental or eld-work content, this proposal mustinclude a timetable indicating whatwork is to be done and when, extend-ing across both semesters of work. Thestudent is then expected to adhere tothis timetable. For QPs conducted dur-ing the spring semester, the proposalsmust be delivered to the committeechair in the last week of the fall semes-ter; for QPs conducted during the fallsemester, they are due the rst week ofthe fall semester. Students receiveprompt feedback from the QP commit-tee members on the proposal. Deadlines . A substantial rst draft of the QP must be submitted by thebeginning of the tenth week of springsemester (ordinarily the rst week afterthe spring break), or the ninth week offall semester. The student's committeereviews the paper with the studentwithin three weeks of submission. Thisevaluation results in a nding that thepaper is either acceptable, acceptableupon revision, or unacceptable. If thepaper is found to be \"acceptable uponrevision,\" the student will have fourweeks to complete the revisions to thesatisfaction of the committee. Students are expected to submit acceptable QPs on time. If a student'spaper is either not submitted on timeor submitted but not deemed accept-able by the student's committee, or ifthe student fails to complete acceptablerevisions required by the committeewithin the prescribed time limits, thenthe student is placed on academic pro-bation. To be removed from probationand return to good academic standing,the student must submit an acceptableQP as soon as possible; when this hap-pens, the student's QP timetable isadjusted by one semester. However, astudent who fails to submit an accept-able QP by the end of the semester fol-lowing the one in which the QP wasoriginally due will be terminated.Probation in connection withQualifying Papers is only possible oncein the student's career. If a student isput on probation for any reason in con-nection with the rst QP , then for thesecond QP , failure to submit on timeor submission of a paper that is not ultimately passed by the committeewill be grounds for termination. Note also that the Graduate School requires completion of qualifyingrequirements for doctoral candidates bythe end of the third year of study,which means that students must com-plete and pass both QPs by the end ofthe third year. Failure to do so isgrounds for termination. Therefore, ifstudents have taken an extra semesterfor a QP with extensive experimentalwork or eld work, there is no room toalso have a semester of probation; con-versely, if they have taken an extrasemester on probation completing aQP , there will be no extra semestersremaining in which to do experimentalwork/eldwork. Changing topics . If a student's rst submission is not accepted, the studentis permitted to change the topic oreven the area of linguistics, providedthat the student's two acceptable quali-fying papers are in two different areasof linguistics. Changing the topic doesnot alter the student's timetable or thestudent's status relative to academicprobation or termination. If a studentchanges the topic or area after the rstsubmission is not accepted, the secondsubmission is precisely that, a secondsubmission of the rst QP . 4. Dissertation proposal . Choosing an adviser and a committee . After a student has completed the sec-ond qualifying paper, the studentbegins work on a dissertation proposal.Once the student has selected the areain which she or he wishes to write adissertation, the student should meetwith her or his potential dissertationadviser and obtain that faculty mem-ber's agreement to serve in that capac-ity. Together the student and thedissertation adviser will explore poten-tial topics for the dissertation. Students are expected to choose the dissertation adviser by the end of therst week of the seventh semester. Thisperson is responsible for working withthe student to make sure that the dis-sertation proposal is completed in atimely fashion. The student and the dissertation adviser will also work out the composi-tion of the student's dissertation com-mittee; in addition to the dissertationadviser, it will consist of four facultymembers, at least three of whom willcome from within the department. Afull committee for the dissertationshould be chosen by February 1 of theeighth semester.240 LINGUISTICSContent of the proposal. The disserta- tion proposal is to be a maximum of50 double-spaced pages, includingfootnotes, tables, charts, spectrograms,and bibliography. It should demon-strate a command of the literature, thesignicance of the dissertation (i.e., thecontribution that it will make to theeld), the structure of the proposeddissertation, and the student's abilityto carry out linguistic analysis of aquality appropriate for a dissertation.Students may incorporate one (or both)of the qualifying papers into the disser-tation proposal if appropriate.Similarly, it is fully expected that largesections of the dissertation proposalwill go directly into the dissertation. Timetable for submission. Students are expected to complete the dissertationproposal by the third Monday in Aprilof the eighth semester and defend theproposal by the end of the fourth year.A date for the defense will be deter-mined in conjunction with the commit-tee members. A proposal defense canhave three outcomes: \"accepted,\"\"accepted pending satisfactory revi-sions,\" and \"rejected.\" If the proposal isnot accepted (in either form) by the endof the fourth year, the student will beput on academic probation. It is expected that all students will submit their proposals no later thantheir eighth semester. However, if thestudent completed a QP that was givenan extension of one semester, then thedate of completion of the proposal andthe proposal defense may be extendedto the end of the ninth semester withpermission of the dissertation adviserand the DGS. If the proposal of a stu-dent who is given permission to takean extra semester is not accepted by the end of the ninth semester, he or shewill be put on academic probation.(But note that the timetable for disser-tation proposals is not adjusted for astudent who had earlier been on aca-demic probation for failure to have aQP accepted in the semester in whichit was due.) In either of these cases, if the stu- dent's proposal is not submitted andfully accepted (i.e., no further revisionsnecessary) by the end of the student'srst semester on academic probation,then the student will be terminated. Evaluation of the proposal. Once a student submits a proposal, it is evalu-ated by the student's committee. Therewill also be an oral defense scheduledin consultation with all of the commit-tee members. If the committee ndsthe proposal acceptable, then the stu-dent may proceed to work on the dis-sertation. If the committee does notnd the proposal acceptable, it willnotify the student as to what changesit recommends. The student may thensubmit a revised proposal in the fol-lowing semester. Completion of other requirements. Ordinarily a student whose dissertationproposal has been accepted has alreadycompleted the language requirementsand all course work for the Ph.D. otherthan the nal course taken in the fthyear. A student who has reached thislevel and has not yet met these require-ments is encouraged to do so at once. 5. Dissertation defense . Students with an approved dissertation proposal willproceed to write the dissertation underthe supervision of the dissertationadviser and with the advice of the members of the dissertation commit-tee. When the committee membersagree that the dissertation is ready tobe defended, a nal oral examinationwill be scheduled. The defense of thedissertation is during a nal oral exam-ination. Passing this defense andreceiving the committee's approval ofthe dissertation are the nal depart-mental requirements for the Ph.D. Full-Time Status: To qualify for full- time status, Ph.D. students enroll incourses according to the followingschedule. The three courses completedin the fourth and fth years should beseminars rather than reading courses. First Year: fall, 12 points; spring, 12 points. Second Year: fall, 12 points; spring, 8 points. Third Year: fall, 8 points; spring, 8 points. Fourth Year: fall, 4 points; spring, 4 points. Fifth Year: 4 points.

Stephen Childress CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Yuri Tschinkel DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Professor Fedor Bogomolov he Department of Mathematics ofthe CourantInstitute of Mathematical Sciences offers sev-eral degree programs. The Ph.D.programs offer research opportu-nities and instruction at thehighest level in a range of core,multidisciplinary, and computa-tional mathematics. In additionto the Ph.D. program in mathe-matics, the department offers aPh.D. program in atmosphereocean science. The programs computational scientic computing, as well as in traditional coreareas of mathematics. The philosophy of the Courant Institute, developed over severaldecades, has been to maintain abalanced interaction betweenpure and applied mathematics.The Institute has long been a leader in mathematical analysis,applied mathematics, and com-putational science. In core math-ematics, strengths includepartial equations,stochastic activities inmost ocean science,mathematical biology, nancialmodeling, and materials science.Much of the research is exter-nally funded and involves post-doctoral scientists. There is anactive program of research semi-nars, and participation by stu-dents is strongly encouraged. New York University is a member of the Inter-UniversityDoctoral Consortium, whosemembers include ColumbiaUniversity; CUNY students who are ingood standing and beyond therst year of study may cross- register for courses in these insti-tutions and thus have access to avery broad range of mathematicsand related elds. (See theAdmission section of this bulletin for details.) The Department of Mathematics is housed inWarren Weaver Hall, whichcontains a mathematical scienceslibrary of 70,000 volumes, over250 journal backles in paper,and an extensive array of elec-tronic resources, such as Web ofScience (ISI) and MathSciNet.Over 13,000 electronic journaltitles across all elds are avail-able at the University. EveryPh.D. student has a workstationon his or her desk. In addition,workstations and PCs are avail-able in public locations. TheApplied Mathematics Laboratoryis an experimental facility influid mechanics and otherapplied areas. The Center forAtmosphere Ocean Studies is thelocus for multidisciplinary stud-ies and research in critical envi-ronmental problems, such asglobal warming, ozone deple-tion, monsoon and El Ni\u00f1ocycles, and pollution of air andwater; it organizes a weekly col-loquium and brings togetherinterested faculty and studentsfrom different departments. 251 MERCER STREET NEW YORK, NY 10012-1110 WEB SITE: (mathematics), mathematics; in nance; probability.

As the artistic, nancial, andcultural center of the country, NewYork City has the largest concentrationof museums anywhere in the world.Thus, students may work at one of themore than 90 museums in the metro-politan area or elsewhere in the UnitedStates and abroad. Placements arebased on the student's museum careerand long-range goals, academic special-ization, experience, and skills. Inchoosing an internship, the studentand the internship coordinator giveprimacy to matching the goals set bythe student to the experience offered atthe museum. The program considers the intern- ship a catalyst in the workplace forsynthesizing academic studies andpractical skills and in preparing stu-dents for placement and advancementas museum professionals. SPECIAL PROJECTS Students may participate in specialprojects and exhibitions, colloquia, andsymposia organized by the programand/or by other institutes and academicunits at NYU. Students participated in the Annual Graduate Student Symposium \"VisiblePlayers in Civic Life: On CivicEngagement in Museums\" (December2003-2006), co-organized with theCCNY Graduate Program in ArtHistory and Museum Studies and theLower East Side Tenement Museum. Students assisted with installation of an exhibit for the public conference\"Art and Optics: An Evaluation ofDavid Hockney's New the Past 600 Years\"(December 1-2, 2001), organized bythe New York Institute for theHumanities at NYU. Other past activities have included student work on program contracts forthe collection, registration, and storageof historical collections at the Statue ofLiberty National Monument/EllisIsland (National Park Service) and onthe educational programming develop-ment for and stafng at the New YorkTransit Museum (Metropolitan TransitAuthority). 260 MUSEUM STUDIESCourses REQUIRED COURSES History and Theory of Museums G49.1500 Stampe , Trask. 4 points.

Topics in Museum Studies: Collecting and Exhibiting LatinAmerican Art in the United States,1931-Present G49.3330 Basilio. 4 points.Closely examines selected museum andprivate collections as well as exhibi-tions held in U.S. museums that have shaped the denition of \"LatinAmerican art.\" Is the transnational cat-egory \"Latin American art\" a productof survey exhibitions and museum col-lecting? If so, how does this affect theway in which artists' works and thehistory of art in countriesare regarded? Why does \"LatinAmerican art\" get \"rediscovered\" political and eco-nomic developments affect patronageand exhibitions? How has the Museumof Modern Art in particular played apivotal role in dening Latin Americanart since it began exhibiting and col-lecting in the 1930s? Topics in Museum Studies: Anthropology in and of MuseumsG49.3330 Geismar. 4 points. This course examines the history, struc-ture, and social life of anthropologymuseums and the study of museums byanthropologists, focusing on a broadrange of examples from the mid-19thcentury to the present. The courseexamines the relationships betweenanthropology and museums in two dif-ferent ways. First, it traces the geneal-ogy of anthropology in museums,looking at how museum principles ofclassication, practices of collectionand exhibition, media, technology, andarchiving have influenced the ways inwhich knowledge of human beings hasbeen formed, presented, and repre-sented. Second, the course looks atwhat taking a specically anthropolog-ical or ethnographic perspective can dofor our understanding of any kind ofmuseum from art to zoology. Topics include the place of anthro- pology in science museums; how museums embody and represent anthro-pological knowledge; how importantobjects are to anthropology; how muse-ums mediate the politics of culturalrepresentation; the contemporary roleof indigenous peoples in museums; andthe intersection of anthropology andmuseum technologies, including pho-tography and digitization projects.Class workshops are held at theAmerican Museum of Natural History,the New York Annex of the Museumof the American Indian, and theMetropolitan Museum, and we alsohave a number of guest speakers work-ing either as anthropologists in muse-ums or as anthropologists of museums.261 MUSEUM STUDIESTopics in Museum Studies: Heritage and Memory G49.3330 Staff. 4 points.Examines the controversial subject ofmuseums that represent heritage, his-tory, and memory. Considering cases asdiverse as Colonial Williamsburg,Mexican American heritage museums,slavery museums in Africa, Holocaustmuseums, and museums of NativeAmerican history, seeks out commonthemes and problems that denemuseum representations of the past.Topics covered include authenticity,race, cultural property, cultural bro-kers, nationalism, interpretation, mul-tivocality, photography, contact zones,context, multiculturalism, and com-munity outreach. The objective is toexamine the connections and distinc-tions between the theory and practiceof exhibiting history and to understandhow material culture, social process,and historical events converge in thesocial production of collections andinstitutions. The focus is on museumsnot merely as containers of history, butas social arenas that influence anddetermine the politics, value, and expe-rience of the past. Accordingly, stu-dents are expected to develop atheoretical toolkit for contextualizingand addressing controversies in theheritage industry. Topics in Museum Studies: Sacred on Display: Museums, Religion, andSociety G49.3330 Feldman. 4 points. This course examines the relationshipbetween religion and museums.Beginning with the premise that oneculture's exhibits are another culture'ssacred objects, the course explores thevarious ways that religious practicemakes use of the museum, as well asthe ways that museums have involvedthemselves with religion. Topics to becovered include relics, sacred sites, rit-ual, clergy, and syncretism. In addition,the course considers key moral and eth-ical questions that religion poses tomuseum practice in the modern world,and vice versa. How have museums cat-alyzed innovations in religious practice?How have the needs of religion influ-enced or determined museum practice?With the goal of moving beyond a the-oretical discussion, this course aims togenerate a critical discussion useful tounderstanding the place of the museumin a contemporary global environmentincreasingly marked by religious inno- vation, expansion, and conflict.Accordingly, while readings draw froma wide variety of religious and museumpractices, the syllabus focuses mainlyon the world religious movements(Judaism, Christianity, Islam,Hinduism, Buddhism) and the keyissues they frame for museum studies. Topics in Museum Studies: Cultural Property, Rights, and MuseumsG49.3330 Geismar. 4 points. What does it mean to own or have aculture? Are all cultures the same? Isowning your culture a basic humanright? This course investigates thegrowing discussions about culturalproperty rights that have emerged inthe context of museum practices, fromcollection and display to conservationand archiving. A general analysis ofconcepts of culture, property, andrights related to these material andsocial domains is offset by sessions thatexamine how different understandingof entitlements may be negotiatedwithin museum spaces and howmuseum objects (broadly dened) maybe understood as cultural resources.Special focus is on legislation, politicalevents such as war, indigenous rightsmovements, international conceptionsof intellectual and cultural property,and the commodity transaction and themarketplace, and their impact onmuseum practice. Research in Museum Studies G49.3915 1-4 points. Independent research on a topic deter-mined in consultation with the pro-gram director. Development, Fund-Raising, and Grantsmanship G49.2221 Lineker. 4 points.Overview of organizational develop-ment principles as they relate to thefund-raising and grantsmanshipprocess. Topics include sources of fund-ing, current trends, and fund-raisingtechniques; earned income; public rela-tions; volunteers; and membership.Includes a practicum in proposal writ-ing and work experience with an artsorganization in program developmentand fund-raising.Museum Conservation and Contemporary Culture G49.2222 Wharton. 4 points.An introduction to museum conserva-tion combining classroom discussionwith museum laboratory visits to pro-vide an understanding of how conser-vation functions in the context ofcontemporary culture. This seminar isdivided into three broad topics:museum collections care, the historyand philosophy of Western conserva-tion, and the conservation of modernand contemporary art. It provides tech-nical information about how artifactsage in the museum environment whileexamining conflicts that arise betweenprofessional and nonprofessional stake-holders. The seminar addresses con-cerns of living artists as well asindigenous groups and others withclaims to the disposition and care ofcultural materials. Local Museums, Historic Houses, and Sites G49.2223 Long, Trask. 4 points.This course examines the cultural poli-tics that influence reuse of historicspaces for museums and other publicpurposes. Through course readings, sitevisits, and individual archival research,students explore sites ranging fromhistoric houses and period rooms pre-sented as museum installations torestored villages and communities todramatic reuse of historic space for cul-tural tourism. Examining case studiesof various interpretations of historicspace, students pay particular attentionto the social and political context inwhich both original use and reuse tookplace by analyzing primary documentsthat illustrate both motivations andstrategy for interpreting historic space. Museum Education G49.2224 Barsky. 4 points.This seminar provides an overview of theeld of museum education in the contextof the institution's relationship with con-stituent communities and with applica-tion to a broad range of audiences. Amongthe topics considered are teaching fromobjects, learning strategies, working withdocents and volunteers, program plan-ning, and the educational use of interac-tive technologies.262 MUSEUM STUDIESMuseums and Interactive Technologies G49.2225 Staff. 4 points.This course presents a survey andanalysis of museum use of interactivetechnologies. Among the topics dis-cussed in detail are strategies and toolsfor collections management, exhibi-tions, educational resources and pro-grams, Web site design, digitizationprojects, and legal issues arising fromthe use of these technologies. Each stu-dent develops an interactive project in an area of special interest. Exhibition Planning and Design G49.3332 Gallagher. 4 points. This course focuses on the planning,development, and design of exhibi-tions, permanent, temporary, and trav-eling. It is a participatory class wherestudents learn basic exhibition designtechniques, including spatial layoutsand the use of graphics, audiovisualaids, lighting, colors, materials, and fabrication methods. Students gaininsight into exhibition planning anddevelopment and the roles played byvarious museum professionals. Thereare visits to designers to discuss theirwork and to museums and other ven-ues to analyze exhibition design tech-niques. Individual student projectsprovide hands-on experience.

Indeed, our students' workaddresses a wide range of musicaltraditions (such as jazz, lmmusic, various \"world,\"\"European art,\" and \"popular\"musics) from a variety of critical,analytical, ethnographic, and historical perspectives. Recentgraduates hold academic appoint-ments in some of the most pres-tigious universities in North America and make distinguishedcontributions to scholarship andmusical composition on both thenational and international levels.Deliberately small, the graduateprogram admits six to eight stu-dents per year. Through research-oriented seminars, independentstudy, and close work with fac-ulty advisers, the program pre-pares students for careers inwhich their scholarly and creativework will stretch and redenethe boundaries of current knowl-edge. Accordingly, students arestrongly encouraged to workwith faculty mentors to developscholarly papers or compositionsfor public presentation and publication. Located in one of the largest private universities in the worldand in one of the world's mostexciting cities for arts and cul-ture, the NYU Department ofMusic has access to unmatchedfacilities and resources. Thedepartment's Media Lab, usedextensively by students in theethnomusicology program, hasrecent and updated equipmentfor processing music and soundeld recordings. Further, thedepartment houses theWashington Square ComputerMusic Studio, which is a com-prehensive research and composi-tion lab for graduate students.The department also sponsorsthe Washington SquareContemporary Music Society, which presents professional con-certs each year devoted to themost recent music of our time.Finally, the department housesthe American Institute for VerdiStudies, containing perhaps thelargest collection of Verdi sourcematerials in the world, and theCenter for Early Music, commit-ted to the performance practiceof medieval, Renaissance, andearly baroque music and to com-bining academic study withresearch in a laboratory perform-ance setting. The University is rich in sup- porting resources, including theElmer Holmes Bobst Library,which houses an important col-lection of music, books, periodi-cals, and microlms of musicalsources. The Avery Fisher Centerin the Bobst Library has a lead-ing collection of videos andrecordings. Within Bobst, theFales arts scene inmid-20th-century New York,and the Tamiment Library andRobert F.

Students are admittedto the department's graduate programon the basis of a superior academicrecord (as evidenced by transcripts andletters of recommendation) and demon-stration of scholarly and/or creativepromise (as evidenced by samples ofscholarly writing or composition). Applicants must hold (or be in the process of receiving) a B.A., a B.M., oran equivalent degree, and their under-graduate careers should include astrong background in the liberal artsand a special emphasis on music.Applicants intending to specialize incomposition should submit two orthree musical works with their applica-tion, with accompanying tapes or CDsif possible. Applicants intending tospecialize in ethnomusicology or his-torical musicology should submit oneor two writing samples that demon-strate their analytical and writing abil-ities. All students must submitGraduate Record Examination (GRE)scores. Ph.D. students who transfer to the department with a master's degreefrom another university are required totake the general examination. Theymay, however, transfer some of theirprevious course credits with theapproval of the director of graduatestudies. All students registering for courses must have their choices approved bythe director of graduate studies.Students not enrolled in the depart-ment must have written approval ofthe instructor and the director of grad-uate studies to register for a depart-mental course. GRADUATE GUIDELINES The description in this bulletin repre-sents the Department of Music, itspolicies, its faculty, and its programs as of spring 2007. A major curricularoverhaul will be effected after this bulletin goes to print; for up-to-dateinformation on the requirements for the program and the coursesoffered, please consult the Web site atwww.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/music. MASTER OF ARTS AND DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY All graduate students in the Department of Music are enrolled forthe Ph.D. degree and take a total of 72points of course work. After complet-ing 36 points of credit and passing thegeneral examination and one languageexamination, however, students who do not already have an M.A. in musicfrom another university are eligible forthe M.A. as an interim degree. TheM.A. degree is not automaticallyawarded; students must apply for it.However, it is strongly recommendedthat qualied students take the degreeand that they apply for it as soon asthey are eligible. The applicationshould be made well in advance of thedate of the degree; the deadlines andprocedures are outlined in this bulletinand on the Graduate School of Artsand Science Web site. Graduate Program Requirements Full-time Status: All graduate stu- dents receiving funding through theMacCracken program are required tomaintain full-time status over theduration of support\u2014in mostcases for ve years. Full-time statusmeans the following: 1. While enrolled in classes, a student must be registered for 24 points ofcredit each year. Ordinarily, these 24points are distributed evenly over thefall and spring semesters. Foreign stu-dents holding student visas must regis-ter for 12 points each semester; if forsome reason they register for fewerpoints, the department must ofciallyconrm their full-time status to theOfce of International Students andScholars (OISS). 2. Although not encouraged to do so, a student may carry a reduced courseload of 8 points of course work duringthe semester preceding the generalexamination. 3. During the nal year of course work, a student may, if she or he no longerhas 24 points of work remaining, takea reduced load equal to the number ofpoints still to be completed for thePh.D. 4. A student who has completed all course work for the Ph.D. and who isno longer being supported under theMacCracken program must maintainmatriculation for each semester inorder to retain full-time status. Thisrequires formal registration, as thoughfor a course. Maintenance of matricula-tion is covered by the student'sMacCracken funding and for twosemesters immediately thereafter. Afterthat, a fee will be charged by theUniversity. It is crucial that students maintain their full-time status during theirMacCracken period, and that thereafterthey maintain matriculation until they complete their doctorate. Foreign stu-dents in residence on student visas risklosing their visa by not doing so.Students with outstanding studentloans risk having their loans recalled.Beyond that, back fees will quicklyaccumulate, placing a potentially crip-pling burden on students when theycome to graduate, since they will notbe permitted to receive their degreeuntil all fees have been paid. It is thestudent's responsibility to see that sheor he is properly registered as a full-time student, and later that she or hemaintains matriculation. Academic Standing: Students are expected to be in good academic stand-ing at all times. In the Department ofMusic, \"good academic standing\"means the following: (1) a grade pointaverage of 3.5 or better; (2) no morethan two grades lower than B over thecourse of the student's career, and nogrades of F or N; (3) no more than twogrades of Incomplete over the course ofthe student's career; (4) passage of thegeneral examination and satisfaction ofother degree requirements in a timelymanner, as described in this bulletinand on the department's Web site.Students who fail to meet the criteriafor good academic standing may beplaced on academic probation for up toone semester, during which time theycan work with the director of graduatestudies and other faculty to resolvetheir academic difculties. Students onprobation who do not return to goodacademic standing by the end of theprobationary semester risk terminationof their fellowship. Department of Music doctoral stu- dents in good standing who are beyondtheir rst year of doctoral study are eli-gible to take graduate courses throughthe Inter-University DoctoralConsortium at several distinguisheduniversities throughout the greaterNew York area. (See the Admission sec- tion of this bulletin for details.) Outside Work: In general, GSAS does not permit graduate students onMacCracken support to engage in out-side work. This is stated in theMacCracken award letter issued by theGraduate School at the time of admis-sion. Students wishing to work mustobtain the permission of the director ofgraduate studies; if this is obtained,the request must be forwarded to theassociate dean of graduate enrollmentservices by the department forapproval. The department will try to266 MUSICaccommodate student needs in this regard, but it is required to maintainstrict oversight of such activity. Language Examinations: Students must demonstrate reading competencyin one modern language by passing awritten examination administered bythe department before taking the gen-eral examination. Between the generaland special examinations, studentsmust demonstrate reading knowledgein a second language (students in com-position are exempted from thisrequirement). Students are expected toselect a second language appropriate totheir research topic. Ordinarily, stu-dents will have passed the second lan-guage examination by no later than thethird year of study. No student inmusicology or ethnomusicology mayadvance to candidacy without havingpassed the second language. General Examination: The general examination tests the student's knowl-edge of all major aspects of the eld.Students are expected to displaysophisticated skills in dealing withintellectual problems and should beable to create and support thoughtfullines of argument from a wide range ofevidence. Those specializing in histori-cal musicology should demonstrate athorough general knowledge ofWestern musical history, of Westernmusic's changing styles, and of currentissues in the discipline. Students areexpected to cite and discuss recentmusicological writing and to advanceand support coherent arguments aboutmajor issues in response to the ques-tions posed on the examination. Thosespecializing in ethnomusicology shoulddemonstrate an understanding of thehistory of the discipline, its theoriesand principal ethnographies, and majormusical cultures. Students specializingin composition and theory are expectedto be familiar with the principal com-posers and compositional models of thelast century and to be able to handleproblems of practical analysis.Whatever their eld of specialization,students are also expected to have abasic knowledge of the other elds ofmusic scholarship and to incorporatethis knowledge into their examinationresponses. Preparation for the examina-tion should therefore include inde-pendent study of both repertoire (withextensive listening and analysis asappropriate) and scholarly writingabout music. There are three possible outcomes of the examination:1. A student may pass the examination at a level deemed appropriate for con-tinued studies toward the Ph.D. and inso doing qualify for the M.A. in music. 2. A student may pass the examination at the M.A. level (and qualify for theM.A.) but not at a level consideredacceptable for further studies in thedepartment. Students may then retakethe examination only once, one yearafter the original, and may register forfurther study only provisionally untilthe examination is passed. 3. A student may fail the examination outright. Students who fail the exami-nation may repeat it only once, oneyear after the original, and may registerfor further study only provisionallyuntil the examination is passed. Special Examination, Dissertation Proposal, and Advancement toCandidacy: During the third or fourth year of study, students should select aprincipal adviser for the dissertationand, in consultation with their adviser,should select two other faculty to forma dissertation committee. One memberof the committee may come from out-side the department, or, more rarely,from outside the University. Studentsshould develop a dissertation project inclose consultation with the committeethey have chosen. Ordinarily, this workshould be sufciently developed toallow students to take the specialexamination by sometime in theirfourth year of study. The special exami-nation requirement may be met in oneof two ways, which students shouldchoose after close consultation withtheir adviser and committee, subject toapproval by the director of graduatestudies. Students must satisfy the spe-cial examination requirement beforethey will be advanced to candidacy. 1. Students may elect to ask their com- mittee to prepare an individualizedspecial examination that tests the stu-dent's competence in the planned eldof research, in related elds, and incurrent methodological and theoreticalapproaches to the dissertation subject.The examination may consist of writ-ten and oral components at the discre-tion of the committee. Students whosatisfy the special examination require-ment in this way will simultaneouslydevelop a dissertation proposal thatmust be submitted to the committeefor approval.2. Students may elect, instead, to develop a dissertation proposal in con-sultation with their committee and topresent it to that committee as thecentral text on which the committeewill conduct an oral examination.Lasting from one to two hours, thisexamination will probe the student'scompetence in the planned eld ofresearch, in related elds, and in cur-rent methodological and theoreticalapproaches to the dissertation topic.Students should expect that the com-mittee may require substantial revi-sions of their proposal and/oradditional work. Students who passthis oral examination on their disserta-tion proposal will be approved to beginwork immediately on the dissertation. Whether prepared after a special exam- ination or as the central text of a spe-cial examination, the dissertationproposal should succinctly state (1) theresearch question to be studied; (2)how the question relates to existingscholarship; (3) the methods to be used(e.g., approaches to eldwork, analyti-cal techniques, theoretical framework);(4) how the dissertation will contributeto knowledge of the eld; and (5) aworking bibliography. In some cases,chapter outlines will be required. Forstudents specializing in composition,the principal part of the dissertationwill be a composition of signicantproportions accompanied by a thesis ona topic in musical analysis or theory. Intheir dissertation proposal, composersmust include a brief description of theintended composition, and they mustdiscuss scoring, any texts to be set, andthe planned structure and size.Additionally, they should discuss thethesis as described above. Students who fulll all the require- ments for the Ph.D. and who declineto complete a dissertation may requestthat the department award the M.Phil.(Master of Philosophy) degree. Dissertation Defense: The completed dissertation will be defended in a pub-lic oral examination to be administeredby a committee of ve faculty. Thisdefense will follow rules established bythe Graduate School of Arts andScience. Ordinarily, the examiningcommittee will consist of the three-member committee that advised thedissertation and two additional facultywho are appointed by the director ofgraduate studies in consultation withthe student and principal adviser. Theexamining committee must include at 267 MUSICleast three members of the GSAS fac- ulty. At least three committee mem-bers must approve the dissertationprior to the scheduling of the defense.The dissertation must be distributed toall members of the committee at least amonth before the scheduled defense. Atleast four of the ve members of theexamining committee must vote toapprove the dissertation's oral defense. Fields of Specialization and Their Course Requirements Historical Musicology: The special- ization in historical musicology isintended to familiarize students withthe modes of thought and researchtechniques in that discipline. Studentsshould expect to develop skills in doc-ument study, archival research, analy-sis, editing, the study of performanceand performance practices, historiogra-phy, and recent critical approaches suchas genre, gender, and reception studies. The 36 points of course work before the general examination include thefollowing minimum requirements: 1. Introduction to Musicology (G71.2101) 2. Ethnomusicology: Theory and History (G71.2136) 3. a course in musical analysisStudents should choose other courses from a range of repertoires and criticalperspectives.

Applicantsmust meet all Graduate School of Artsand Science admissions deadlines.Applications for entry are accepted forthe fall semester; applications forspring entry are considered only inexceptional circumstances and cannotbe considered for nancial aid. MASTER OF ARTS The program has three elements: (1) acoherent sequence of courses on theregion, totaling 40 points; (2) a demon-strated ability in one modern languageof the area; and (3) a master's thesis orreport written under the supervision ofan adviser. The program includes anoptional internship course. The degreecan be completed in two years (foursemesters) of full-time study; studentsmay also study part time. Course of Study: The 40 points of course work include two requiredcourses and a distribution requirement.The required courses are (1) the corecourse, Problems and Methods inMiddle Eastern and Islamic Studies(G77.1687), and (2) History of theMiddle East, 1750-Present (G77.1642)or, with the approval of the director, anadvanced history seminar. Studentsselect the remaining eight coursesaccording to their individual researchinterests, in consultation with thedirector of graduate studies. The distri-bution requirement consists of at leastone course each from two of the follow-ing disciplines: anthropology, econom-ics, politics, and sociology (e.g., two ofthe following courses: Anthropologyfor Middle Eastern Studies[G14.1322]; Economics of the MiddleEast [G31.1608]; Middle EastGovernment and Politics [G53.2590];and Sociology of the Middle East[G68.2785]). Language Requirement: To complete the degree, students must demonstrateprociency at the upper-intermediatelevel in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, orTurkish. (Other languages may be con-sidered as meeting this requirementwith the approval of the director of theprogram.) Students with no languagebackground may satisfy the require-ment by completing four semesters (16points) of language training at NYU;however, only two of those semesters (8points of undergraduate language cred-its) may be counted toward the degree.Students who have prior language training or who take an intensive lan-guage course in the summer followingtheir rst year may satisfy the require-ment by testing at an upper intermedi-ate level of prociency or by enrollingin an advanced class. Native speakerswith fluency in reading, writing, lis-tening, and speaking may waive thisrequirement with the permission of thedirector. The program encourages allstudents to pursue language trainingthrough the advanced (graduate) level. Master's Thesis or Report: The mas- ter's thesis should generally have theformat, style, and length of a substan-tial scholarly article in a Middle Easternstudies eld. Alternatively, it can havethe format and style of a professionalreport, with a length and substancesimilar to a scholarly article. In eithercase, it must present the author's ownresearch and relate this to existingscholarly understandings of the topic oreld. Students should begin discussingpossible topics for the thesis or reportby the end of their rst year and shouldselect a topic and an adviser, in consul-tation with the director of graduatestudies, before the end of their thirdsemester. Students are encouraged toconduct research on their topic duringthe summer following their rst year. Internships: The internship program draws on the resources of New YorkCity as a center of international politicsand culture. Internships provide practi-cal training in the kinds of researchand report writing required for careersin public and nongovernmental service,policy research, cultural affairs, andpolitical advocacy. The internship pro-gram enables students to make profes-sional contacts in elds they areinterested in joining and to share theirskills with organizations as theyexplore a particular eld or issue.Organizations providing internshipsinclude (but are not limited to) humanrights organizations, United Nationsagencies and missions, media organiza-tions, policy research groups, and othernongovernmental organizations. Theinternship involves 10-15 hours ofwork per week during one semester.Students receive up to 4 points towardthe degree by registering for Internship(G68.2997). They must submit weeklyprogress reports on their internshipproject as well as mid- and end-of-semester reports. MASTER OF ARTS PROGRAM IN JOURNALISM AND NEAREASTERN STUDIES The joint degree program gives stu- dents professional training for careersas newspaper, magazine, or broadcastjournalists, combined with study of thepolitics, history, and cultures of theMiddle East. Students must complete 42 points of course work, including 20 points ofjournalism courses, 20 points ofMiddle Eastern courses, and a 2-pointnal project that consists of a profes-sional journalism assignment focusingon a Middle Eastern subject. The nalproject may be completed in conjunc-tion with an approved internship.Requirements consist of the tworequired Middle East courses and theMiddle East distribution requirement(see above); (G54.1023); andtwo journalism skills courses, chosenwith the advice of the director of grad-uate studies in the Department ofJournalism. Although there is no lan-guage requirement for this degree pro-gram, students are encouraged todevelop a competence in a MiddleEastern language and can apply forForeign Language and Area StudiesFellowships.

MIDDLE EASTERN HISTORY Gender, Empire, and the Nation inthe Middle East and South AsiaG68.1999 Balaghi. 4 points. Examines the shifting paradigms ofgender in the Middle East and SouthAsia throughout the process of build-ing, imposing, resisting, and disman-tling empire. The ruptures ofcolonialism recast gender relations, andthe alchemy of race, gender, eth-nicity gured prominently in the for-mation of anticolonial nationalisms.The historical memory of empire con-tinues to play an important role in thediscourses of postcolonial antifeministmovements. Examines the history ofwomen in Iran, India, and Algeria inthe 19th and 20th centuries. History and Memory in the Middle East and South Asia G68.2000 Balaghi. 4 points.Examines the contentious politics ofmemory at moments of rupture, dislo-cation, and displacement in the con-struction of nationalism in the MiddleEast and South Asia. Nations createand recall memories as a means ofarticulating communalism, coalescingdistinct identities, and justifying polit-ical positions. Popular memory canserve as an effective means of resistanceto the national canon and its erasuresby groups who are marginalized in the national narrative. Movements of peo-ples, advances in transportation, anddevelopments in the new media in the19th and 20th centuries gave rise toparticular expressions of national mem-ories with commensurate modes ofpolitical behavior.

Anthony Movshon DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Nava Rubin eural science is a collection ofdisciplines uni-ed by a con- cern for the function of thebrain. Experimental approachesin neural science vary fromanalyses of molecular and cellu-lar mechanisms in nerve cellsand groups of nerve cells tobehavioral and psychologicalstudies of whole organisms.Theoretical tools include mathe-matical and computational mod-eling approaches that have proved useful in other areas ofscience. Experimental questionsinclude issues related to biophys-ical and neurochemical mecha-nisms within single nerve cells,functional neural circuits con-sisting of small numbers of neu-rons, the behavior of largesystems of neurons, and the rela-tionship between the activity ofelements of the nervous systemand the behavior of organisms. The doctoral program in neu- ral science provides advancedtraining for research careers inneural science. Opportunitiesexist for study in both experi-mental and theoretical aspects ofthe eld. Areas of specialization computationalneuroscience, robotics and arti-cial intelligence, and cognitivescience. The curriculum of thePh.D. program is designed toprovide research training of thehighest caliber to a small groupof full-time students with variedbackgrounds and interests.

Program and RequirementsAdmission: Admission to the program is limited to qualied students, usuallydocumented by high scores on theGraduate Record Examination (GRE),superior undergraduate grades, andexcellent letters of recommendation. Students seeking admission to the Center for Neural Science should havea strong background in one or more ofthe academic areas involved, such asbiology, chemistry, computer science,experimental psychology, engineeringscience, mathematics, or physics. Aclear statement of the student's careergoals and reason for applying to theCenter is required. An interview ordi-narily is scheduled before a nal deci-sion on admission is made. International students must demon- strate their command of written andspoken English by their performanceon the Test of English as a ForeignLanguage (TOEFL) or its equivalentand by an interview. Special arrange-ments are made to interview interna- tional students before acceptance. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Center accepts students only forthe degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Degree Requirements: A minimum of 72 points is required, at least 36 ofwhich must be taken in residence atNew York University. This includesthe required rst-year core curriculum(see below). The student is expected tofulll the course requirements, com-plete the doctoral research, and defendthe thesis within ve years. Curriculum Planning, Advisement, and Examining Committees: An adviser and two other members of thefaculty guide the student in the selec-tion of formal courses until the thesisproposal has been submitted. At thistime a dissertation committee isselected, consisting of three membersof the faculty whose research interests are appropriate to help the student inthe planning and execution of the pro-posed doctoral research. Examinations: The student's general knowledge of the eld of neural scienceis documented by satisfactory perform-ance in the rst-year core curriculumtaught by the staff of the Center.Completion of this requirement quali-es the student as a candidate for thedoctoral degree. Specic knowledge related to the area of the doctoral thesis is examinedorally at the time of the presentation ofthe thesis proposal to the dissertationcommittee. The formal presentation ofthe dissertation proposal must be ledat least six months before the defenseof the thesis. The nal examination consists of the oral defense of the doctoral thesis.The examination committee usuallyconsists of the three members of thedissertation committee plus two addi- tional members. Passage of the thesisdefense is contingent on all but one ofthe examiners voting to accept the the-sis and its defense. If there is a dissent,the dissenter shall provide a writtenreport detailing the grounds for thedissent. Research and Sponsorship: Many students may have already selected aresearch area and made arrangementsfor research sponsorship at the time ofadmission. Others do not make thisdecision until they have completed thecore courses described below, including rotations through the research labora-tories of the staff of the Center, whichexpose the student to the interests andtechniques of neuroscience. The naldecision on the doctoral research to beundertaken depends on a mutual agree-ment between the student and theappropriate sponsor for the research. DEPARTMENTAL FELLOW- SHIPS, PRIZES, AND AWARDS Financial support is provided for stu- dents in the program throughUniversity fellowships, research assis- tantships, research traineeships, andteaching assistantships, to per-mit students to devote their full timeto the pursuit of their studies.

Advisement: At orientation, students are assigned an adviser based on theirareas of interest and meet with thisadviser during the registration periodeach semester to plan their course workand review their progress. Individualizedprograms of study are encouraged. MASTER OF ARTS Degree Requirements: The M.A. program begins during the summersemester, and students graduate thefollowing May. Students must com-plete 36 points of courses in thedepartment with a grade of B or better,primarily with the permanent faculty. There are two required courses for master's students: Introduction toPerformance Studies (H42.1000),taken in the rst semester, and Projectsin Performance Studies (H42.2000),taken during the nal semester. Master's students are permitted to take only one practical workshop as partof their course work. The only practicalworkshop course that is counted towardan M.A. in performance studies is thedepartment's Performance Composition(H42.2730) or a course otherwise desig-nated as practical. Up to 4 points of aca-demic course work may be takenoutside the department or transferred from another institution, with permis-sion of the chair. A master's studentmay appeal to the chair to register for asecond Performance Composition work-shop in lieu of taking 4 points outsidethe department. PERMISSION TO PROCEED TO THE PH.D. Students enrolled in the M.A. program who are interested in continuingimmediately into the Ph.D. programshould submit an application dossier tothe department at the start of thespring semester. An internal applica-tion dossier includes the following: 1. A list of all courses taken in per- formance studies and grades earned. 2. A substantial paper previously writ- ten for a course. 3. A description of the projected dis- sertation topic and how specic coursework taken will enable clarication anddeepening of the topic. 4. Names of three faculty members the student proposes to serve as possibledissertation directors. Applicants to the Ph.D. program are evaluated on the following basis: 1. Academic record to date.2. Quality of academic writing as evi- denced in submitted paper. 3. Proposed topic and compatibility with departmental plans. 4. Predilection of faculty to direct the student's Ph.D. course work anddissertation.282 PERFORMANCE STUDIESDOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Degree Requirements: Students must complete 72 points of course work with a grade of B or better, satisfy the foreign language requirement, pass the area examination, and write and orally defend a dissertation. Students admit-ted with an M.A. degree should note that previous graduate work is not automatically applied to the Ph.D. degree. Each student's record is exam-ined by the department chair to deter- mine allowable transfer credit.Students who have received an M.A.degree in performance studies at NewYork University and who have beengiven permission to proceed to thePh.D. must complete an additional 36 points for the doctorate. There are three required courses for Ph.D. students: Advanced Readings inPerformance Studies (H42.2201) andResources and Methods in Performance Studies (H42.2616), taken during the rst year of doctoral course work, andDissertation Proposal Advising(H42.2301), taken upon completion ofthe language requirement, 72 points ofcourse work, and the area examination. The department' sPerformance Composition (H42.2730) workshops are the only practical workshopscounted toward the degree. Ph.D. stu- dents are permitted to take twoPerformance Composition courses aspart of their course work. Up to 12 points of academic course work maybe taken outside the department orthrough the Inter-University DoctoralConsortium with permission of thechair. Adoctoral candidate must com- plete all degree requirements no laterthan ten years after entering the M.A.program or seven years after enteringthe Ph.D. program. For details regard-ing degree conferral, see the Degree Requirements section of this bulletin. Foreign Language Prociency: A candidate for the doctorate must demonstrate prociency in at least one foreign language. Students are ur ged to fulll the language requirement before they have completed course work. Forfurther information, see the Degree Requirements section of this bulletin. Area Examination: The area examina - tion is offered every spring semester .At ameeting during the registration period each semester ,the policies and procedures of the area examination areoutlined in detail. Students must takethe area examination the rst time it isoffered after they have fullled the for- eign language requirement and com-pleted 72 points of course work.The area examination consists of three sets of take-home questions to beanswered within a period of 12 days.Students are examined in one generalarea and two areas of their design. Theareas are developed in consultation with the students' adviser and must beapproved by a faculty committee two semesters prior to the examinationsemester. The two topic areas may be(1) a theory area, (2) a history area, (3) a genre of performance, or (4) a geo- graphical or cultural area's performance.Students prepare preliminary and nalreading lists for their advising commit-tee's review. The advising committeesdraft each student's examination ques-tions according to the approved readinglists and topic area statements. Studentsmust answer one question in each area. If a student fails a question, the student must take the question again the fol - lowing year. The student may berequired to complete additional coursework before taking the examinationagain. A student who fails one or morequestions twice cannot continue in thePh.D. program. Students should con - sult the department of ce regarding deadlines and procedures. Admission to Candidacy: Formal candidacy is granted only after a stu - dent has been in residence for a year, demonstrated foreign language pro- ciency, passed the area examination,and received approval of the disserta - tion proposal. Doctoral Dissertation: Dissertation Proposal Advising (H42.2301) is required the semester after the student has passed the area examination. When the dissertation proposal is completed, it must be reviewed and approved by a three-member faculty committee. Consult the department for the pro- cedures for defending the dissertation. Any reader who is not a member of theNew York University GSAS facultymust be approved in advance by GSAS.All ve members of the dissertationcommittee must be present when thestudent publicly defends the disserta- tion. Three of the ve readers must be faculty of the Department ofPerformance Studies or approved fac - ulty from another NYU department.

DEPARTMENTAL PUBLICATIONS TDR: The Journal of Performance Studies is edited by Richard Schechner; associ-ate editor is Mariellen R. Sandford.Most issues are eclectic, dealing withlive performance, media, and perform-ance theory. Topics range from experi-mental performance to ethnographicstudies. Articles are published detail-ing performances in a variety of cul-tures from all over the world. TDR invites opinions, debates, letters fromreaders and contributors, and reportson performances, books, conferences,and festivals. About one issue in six isa \"theme issue,\" devoted to a singletopic. In addition to the editor andassociate editor, two graduate studentswork on TDR, one as managing editor. Women & Performance: A Journal of Feminist Theory is a semiannual publica- tion produced independently by stu-dents, faculty, alumnae, and alumni ofthe Department of PerformanceStudies. It is the rst ongoing publica-tion of its kind devoted to a feministinvestigation of performance. The jour-nal encourages dialogue among per-formers, theorists, and spectators byproviding a forum for feminist criticaltheory in theatre, dance, lm, video,music, and ritual. It discusses feministaesthetics and includes performancedocumentation, articles on women inhistorical performance, reviews, scripts,and resource listings. Students on staffwork in various phases of production,including writing, copyediting, proof-reading, layout, paste-up, advertising, circulation, and distribution. CURRICULUM To make performance a primary con-cern is to blur radically the boundariesof disciplines, to subvert the hierar-chies and exclusions of the canon, andto examine cultures for the diversity ofperformance modes and concepts. As adiscipline of \"inclusions,\" performancestudies provides an integrating, com-parative perspective on the entire con-tinuum of human action from \"lifeevents,\" sports, public ceremonies, andritual to aesthetic theatre and dance. Courses in theory and methodology, while developing a distinctive body ofconcepts and approaches, explore theo-ries of performance indigenous to Asia,Africa, Europe, Latin America, andother parts of the world and draw fromvarious disciplines\u2014anthropology,sociology, history, literary theory, semi-otics, feminist and queer theory,Marxism, psychoanalysis, the study ofcolonial discourse, movement analysis,aesthetics, and theatrical theory. Although well established as a dis- cipline, the study of Western theatrehas tended to emphasize a historicalapproach to a canon of dramatic litera-ture. In contrast, the performance stud-ies curriculum focuses on extraliteraryor nonliterary aspects of performance. In keeping with the integrated per- spective on performance, courses dealwith dance not only as a performingart in its own right but also as a vitalconstituent of theatre, ritual, and sociallife. Courses train students to identifythe basic components of movement; tosee, discriminate, and describe move-ment behavior in all its forms and con- texts; and to apply knowledge of move-ment style to studies of dance andculture. Dance history is studied as anaspect of cultural history and in rela-tion to the other arts. Folk performance and popular entertainment (including the modernmedia) have constituted a culturallyand artistically vital alternative theatreand important influence on contempo-rary performance. The forms of popularentertainment, their internal logic andaesthetics, are studied in relation totheir historical formation and culturalsetting. The study of folk performancefocuses on how people in their every-day lives shape deeply felt values intomeaningful form\u2014for example, con-versational humor and storytelling,improvised play and traditional games,competitive street dance, domestic rit-uals, and neighborhood and commu-nity celebrations. A major concern isthe nature of tradition, which is seen asa process rooted in social life as well asin time and space. Courses in performance studies are also developed in order to explore thepolitical and ideological implicationsof performance. Postcolonial, feminist,and queer theory are employed asframes to investigate how artistic formssubvert and uphold particular ideologi-cal forms. While performance studies is not a studio-based program, students areencouraged to take at least one course(but not more than three) in perfor-mance practice. Each semester, coursesin performance composition and move-ment are offered. CoursesThe following list includes coursesoffered in the recent past and ones pro-jected for the near future. Approxi-mately 35 courses are offered eachyear, many of them new. As a result,only a portion of the courses listed inthe bulletin can actually be scheduledduring any academic year. Coursestaught on a regular basis are indicatedwith an asterisk (*). Healing and Performance H42.1026 Barbara Browning. 4 points. An exploration of the ways in whichperformance theory and practice haveinformed the eld of medical anthro-pology and the ways in which medicalanthropology can in turn amplify andinform the creation and analysis of per-formance. Examines seminal texts inboth elds (including Artaud, L\u00e9vi- Strauss, Turner, Kleinman, Taussig,Scheper-Hughes and Lock, andCsordas) to nd points of contact andconfluence. Also explores a variety ofperformances (in diverse cultural con-texts) that take on the issue of healing. Tourist Productions H42.1041* Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett. 4 points.How tourist settings, events, and arti-facts are produced, interpreted, andconsumed; the \"production of culture\"for the consumption of the \"other\"(guest, stranger, tourist, expatriate, pil-grim); tradition and authenticity andthe synthetic nature of culture; theprocess of aestheticizing and commodi-tizing history, politics, and aestheticsof cultural production.Theories of Directing H42.1060 Richard Schechner. 4 points.Starts with a brief theoretical-historicaloverview of directing. Then examinesfour directorial approaches to texts\u2014realization, interpretation, adaptation,and deconstruction. Next looks at thedirector-actor relationship in terms ofactor training. Finally, considers howdirectors deal with interculturalism.Uses as examples the works ofStanislavsky, Meyerhold, Brecht,Grotowski, Brook, Schechner, LeCompte, Mnouchkine, Suzuki, andOng. Students give classroom reportsand stage short scenes. 284 PERFORMANCE STUDIESPerforming Cultures in the Middle East and North Africa H42.1065 Deborah Anne Kapchan. 4 points. Focuses on the expressive culture of theMiddle East and North Africa, lookingat both sacred (religious) practices andmore popular forms of cultural per-formance, such as music, poetry, lm,festivals, novels, and dance. Analyzesall these practices in their historicalcontext as well as their place in thehistory of scholarship in and about theMiddle East and North Africa.Explores the many and various forms ofbeing and knowing extant in contem-porary cultures of the Arab-Islamicworld. Draws heavily on ethnographictexts but also draws inspiration fromreadings in philosophy, literature, andhistory. History of the Body H42.1095 Tavia Nyong'o. 4 of embodiment thatseek leverage against the and idealizing tendencies oftheory. Such investments in \"the body,\"however, risk repeating the very processof abstraction, totalization, and ideal-ization that they seek to counter, par-ticularly when a unitary \"body\" with nofurther specication is called on to doall the heavy lifting. Can we produce arhetoric of embodiment that does notimmediately reinvest itself, throughsuch lack of specication, in thebody/mind dualism? This course takesa historical route to answering thatquestion, examining the emergence ofthe body as a site of knowledge forhumanism, while at the same timeattending carefully to humanism's gen-dered racialized of \"the body\"produce hierarchizing and marginaliz-ing effects, in terms of which flesh canand cannot access its pains and privi-leges. We explore how sentience andaffect are gured through shifting lay-ers of historical knowledge that unsettleany unitary or stable concept of \"thehuman.\" And we conclude with a con-sideration of the range of claims\u2014tech-nical, philosophical, and political\u2014thathave been made recently on behalf Haraway, Hayles,Kuriyama, Sedgwick. Projects in Performance Studies H42.2000* Required course for all M.A. students. Resident faculty. 4 points.The nal course in master's programsin performance studies. The coursehelps students develop and present a nal culminating project. Topics in Critical Theory: Critical Race Theory H42.2100* Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz. 4 points. This course offers students methodolo-gies to think critically about race andethnicity. Fundamental phenomenolog-ical questions about the relationshipbetween \"self\" and \"other\" launch theinquiry. Early materialist and psycho-logical investigations into the nature ofracialization are also pursued. Readingsand lectures challenge ontologicalclaims about the nature of race andethnicity by proposing theories ofracial and ethnic performativity.Critical legal theories are also consid-ered. Intersectional methodologies thatconsider the relationship betweenracialization and other major rubrics ofdifference like class, gender, and sexu-ality are emphasized as students surveyrecent works in the eld of critical racetheory. This section of the course bibli-ography includes read in conjunctionwith performances as well as literaryand cinematic texts. Bibliography and Research: Advanced Readings in PerformanceStudies H42.2201* Required course for rst-year Ph.D. students. Resident faculty.4 points.Readings are balanced between founda-tional texts in the eld of performancestudies as well as new interventionsthat propel the discourse forward.Readings examine the performancestudies project's intersections with dif-ferent lines of thought that includeanthropology, philosophy, feminism,critical race theory, legal theory,Marxism, and queer critique. Studentsare expected to assemble an annotatedbibilography on some aspect of the eldas well as writing a nal research paper. Seminar on Antonin Artaud H42.2202* Allen Weiss. 4 points. Dissertation Proposal Advising H42.2301* Required for doctoral stu- dents. Prerequisite: 72 points of completedcourse work. Resident faculty. 0 points.Emphasis is on problems and opportu-nities of research, writing, and editingas they apply to the doctoral disserta-tion. Each student prepares a disserta-tion proposal as a class project.Political Performance H42.2406 Diana Taylor. 4 points. This course examines the use of per-formance\u2014by the State, by opposi-tional groups, and by theatre andperformance practitioners\u2014to solidifyor challenge structures of power. Thecourse looks at specic examples ofhow public spectacles have been usedin the 20th and 21st centuries\u2014fromNazi rallies to antiwar demonstrations,AIDS activism, and \"escraches\" (acts ofpublic shaming by the children of the\"disappeared\" in Argentina), to thecurrent use of stagecraft by the Bushadministration. Following the lead ofGuy Debord, students examine howthe \"concentrated spectacle\" of fascismand military blends with\"diffuse\" spectacles capitalismresulting in the \"integrated spectacle\"of the current U.S. administration.Students are asked to develop theirown sites of analysis. Readings includeGuy Debord, Walter Benjamin,Bertold Brecht, Adorno, Augusto Boal,and others. The course includes Studies in Dance: Still Acts H42.2504* Andr\u00e9 Lepecki. 4 points. Perception has a social structure\u2014itoperates by erasing certain acts from itscognitive eld and dismissing thoseacts as being either in/signicant orim/perceptible. In those leftover zoneslled with canceled meanings andmicroscopic perceptions, we nd tracesof the deep ideological imbricationsbetween sensory and signication.However, the \"insignicant\" and the\"imperceptible\" also constitute manyshady areas for unruly creativity, sub-version, and resistance. In the develop-ment of Western choreographicimagination and ideologies, one act hasbeen particularly accused of lacking insignication, purpose, and value: thestill act. However, one can trace indance's uses of stillness not onlyextraordinary challenges to hegemonicstructures of perception but to the verydenition of dance. This seminar exam-ines the epistemological, political, andperformative challenges brought byuses of stillness within Western chore-ography. The seminar contextualizesstillness in dance historically, theoreti-cally, and aesthetically by tracing itsuses in the visual arts, performance art,and lm. Students read closely seminaltexts in the Corbin, Foucault), Mark285 PERFORMANCE STUDIESFranko, Jacques Riviere) to assess how stillness, by challenging ideologies ofperception, challenges not only dance'sontology but, more ambitiously, under-mines the very notion of Being. Performance Theory: Performance, Identity, and the Law H42.2602 Ann Pellegrini. 4 examination of the \"the law\" (inboth its regulatory and generativemodes) with a focus on the U.S. con-text. Engages selected federal and statecourt decisions (e.g., Reynolds v. U.S. [1878], Plessy v. Ferguson [1896], Bowers v. Hardwick [1986], R.A.V . v. St. Paul [1991]) through the critical resources of performance studies, criti-cal race theory, and feminist and queertheories. Special attention is given tolaw's reliance on \"the precedent\" andanalogy (the precedent as analogy?) toconstruct identity and difference. Methods in Performance Studies H42.2616* Required course for rst-year Ph.D. students. Resident faculty. 4 points.The development of performance stud-ies methodologies based on interdisci-plinary research oral reading andanalysis of exemplary studies.Considers the conceptualization anddesign of research projects in the con-text of theoretical and ethical issuesand in relation to particular researchmethods and writing strategies.Develops practical skills related toarchival and library research; ethno-graphic approaches, including partici-pant observation and interviewing;documentation and analysis of live per-formance; and analysis of documents ofvarious kinds, including visual mate-rial. Readings address the history ofideas, practices, and images of objectiv- ity, as well as of reflexive and interpre-tive approaches, relationships betweenscience and art, and research perspec-tives arising from minoritarian andpostcolonial experiences. Assignmentsinclude weekly readings, writtenresponses to the readings, and exer-cises. Students are encouraged to bringprojects to the course, especially onesthat might develop into dissertations. Drama, Theatre, and Performance: Theories of Spectatorship H42.2746 Diana Taylor. 4 points. An exploration of the many ways inwhich theorists and theatre practition-ers have thought about the ways inwhich staged action (whether in lm,theatre, or politics) pacies, activates,interpolates, and manipulates Vuh Performance H42.2860 Karen Shimakawa. 4 points. This course locates the genre of (con-temporary) \"intercultural performance\"within the context of the rise oftransnational and/or \"global\" capital-ism. How might the former term beseen as a materialization of, catalyst for,or commentary on, the latter\u2014or viceversa? The course considers currenttheories of the bases of transnational-ism, its current formations (its legal,corporate, labor, and representationalmanifestations), as well as concurrentdevelopments examination of the challenges andpossibilities of cross-cultural danceanalysis. Begins with a brief overviewof the history of the eld and a consid-eration of the advantages and disadvan-tages of a variety of methods andapproaches. Then alternates close read-ings of recent dance ethnographieswith the workshopping of students'own writing. Student projects may bebased on previously performed eld-work or on research conducted speci-cally for the class. The course includesweekly readings, written responses tothe readings, and exercises. Studentsare encouraged to bring projects to thecourse, especially ones that mightdevelop into dissertations. Topics in Music and Performance: Critical Readings in World Musicand Dance H42.2960 Deborah Anne Kapchan. 4 points. How do contemporary musical anddance forms restructure public spacesand public imaginaries? What doesworld music contribute to theories ofglobalization? How do racial and gen-der identities take shape in the realmof the aesthetic? How is the sacredconstructed in new media? This coursebegins by interrogating the concepts ofpublic culture, globalization, and theimagination. It then moves on toexplore theories of sound, temporality,affect, and aesthetics as they relate togenres of music and dance.

Programs and RequirementsMASTER OF ARTS The Department of Philosophy offers a program leading to the degree ofMaster of Arts. The department'srequirements are (1) 32 points of grad-uate study, at least 24 in residence atNew York University and 24 in thedepartment (courses taken outside thedepartment, as well as transfer credits,must receive departmental approval);(2) a substantial research paper ofappropriate quality, which may bewritten either in connection with aseminar or under the supervision of adepartmental adviser and which mustreceive a grade of B+ or better. A stu-dent's academic performance and statusin the program are subject to periodicreview by the department. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Requirements The Department of Philosophy also offers a program leading to the degreeof Doctor of Philosophy. The require-ments are as follows: Courses : The University requires 72 points. The department requiresthat 44 points (the \"basic points\") beas specied below. The remaining 28 points may all be in dissertationresearch, although the student mayinclude other courses toward the total as well. The required 44 basic pointsconsist of the following: 1. Proseminar (8 points). Each year, the department offers a full-yearProseminar required for all rst-yearPh.D. students. It is open to rst-yearPh.D. students only. It includes fre-quent short writing assignments, andthe mode of instruction emphasizesdiscussion rather than lecture. The top-ics are determined by the instructorsbut include basic texts and ideas inanalytic philosophy. 2. Basic course work (28 points; typi- cally seven 4-point courses) drawnfrom advanced introduction courses,intermediate-level courses, topics oradvanced seminar courses, and researchseminar courses. These must include atleast one course in value theory (ethics,aesthetics, philosophy of law, or politi-cal philosophy); at least one course inmetaphysics, epistemology, philosophyof language, or philosophy of mind;and at least one course in the history ofphilosophy (ancient, medieval, modern,or 19th century). At least three of thecourses must be outside value theory.Of these 28 points, no more than 8 points may be in advanced introduc-tion courses.3. Two Associated Writing courses (8 points). Third-Year Review : By the rst day of the fth semester in the program,students must submit three papers(normally the product of courses in therst two years). To satisfy the require-ment, papers should be substantialpieces of work of 15-30 pages inlength and should demonstrate thatthe student is able to take his or herphilosophical research and writing tothe high level appropriate for writing adissertation. Students should also be ingood standing at the time of thereview. Third-Year Thesis Prospectus Examination : By the 10th week of their sixth term in the program, stu-dents must submit to the director ofgraduate studies a proposal for a thesis.The prospectus should be between 5and a strict maximum of 15 pages long(double spaced). It should not be a phi-losophy paper, but rather a thesis planthat (1) clearly articulates an interest-ing philosophical problem in a waythat (2) displays the student's knowl-edge of the problem's place in thespace of philosophical ideas and, inparticular, of the leading attempts toresolve the problem, and (3) gives asclear an indication as the student can288 PHILOSOPHYgive at this early stage of how he or she intends to organize the thesis, and ofwhat he or she expects her contributionto be, that is, of what he or she can addto the existing literature. (Studentswriting a thesis consisting of threelinked papers should apply theseguidelines to each of their topics.) Thedirector of graduate studies thenappoints a committee, of at least twofaculty members, but normally threefaculty members, who meet with thecandidate about the proposal. Thismeeting is the oral thesis prospectusexamination. Although the prospectusdefense takes the form of an oral exam-ination, its principal purpose is toreach an agreement with prospectivefuture members of the student's thesiscommittee as to the shape and sub-stance of the project. This meeting must take place by the end of the third year in order forthe student to maintain good standing.Once it takes place, the studentremains in good standing even thoughthe committee may require him or herto revise the thesis proposal and meetto discuss it further. The student mustpass the examination by the end of theseventh term in the program. The the-sis prospectus examination should sat-isfy the committee that the candidatecan write a passing thesis meeting thedescription in the candidate's submit-ted prospectus. Logic Requirement : Students should satisfy the department of their compe-tence in the language; basic metalogical tools,including the use-mention distinction,the concept of rigor, and proof and def-inition by mathematical induction; statement and proof of basic metalogi-cal results, including the deductiontheorem, soundness and completenessfor sentential and predicate logic, andcompleteness for predicate logic. Thedirector of graduate studies will countthe student as having passed therequirement when presented withappropriate evidence (e.g., of a pass ina relevant course at NYU or else-where). Language Requirement : There is a University requirement of prociencyin one language other than English.Knowledge of a formal language can beused to satisfy this requirement. Thesis and Oral Examination : The dissertation can consist of a monographor, alternatively, of three outstandingpapers. The department envisions that, in most cases, the dissertation will grow out of work done for the topics or advancedseminar and Associated Writing coursesand that there will be no sharp distinc-tion between years of course work andyears of dissertation writing. Students areexpected to complete all degree require-ments, including the dissertation, withinve years. Special permission from thedepartment is required to extend work onthe dissertation beyond the seventh year. Further Requirements A minimum of 36 of the 44 basic points must be taken in the NYUDepartment of Philosophy. In addition,in order to receive the Ph.D., a studentmust be in residence as a full-time stu-dent for two full years at NYU. Each term's program must be approved by the student's adviser andthe director of graduate studies in therst week of classes.Transfer Credit Transfer credit is apportioned on a case-by-case basis and is normallyrestricted to courses taken in philoso-phy Ph.D. programs. Normally, creditfor a maximum of 12 basic points and12 nonbasic points is allowed for workdone elsewhere. DUAL DEGREE PROGRAMS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES Students at the New York University School of Law may pursue an M.A.-J.D. or Ph.D.-J.D. dual degree pro-gram in philosophy and law. Studentsat the School of Medicine may pursuean M.A.-M.D. dual degree program inphilosophy and medicine. In each case,students must meet the admissionrequirements of both schools. Graduatestudents in the Department ofPhilosophy may enroll in pertinentSchool of Law classes, and, if qualied,may attend classes under the auspicesof the law school's Program in Law,Philosophy, and Social Theory. In addi-tion, the Department of Philosophysponsors frequent colloquia, at whichthe research of faculty or invited speak-ers is presented.

Programs and RequirementsAdmission: Applicants considered for admission have usually completed theequivalent of an undergraduate majorin physics and maintained an averageof at least B or better in physics and inmathematics. Calculus and ordinarydifferential equations are prerequisiteto all courses. Special consideration isgiven to applicants with an undergrad-uate major in mathematics, engineer-ing, or another science. Such studentsordinarily take remedial work to makeup undergraduate deciencies inphysics before they proceed in the reg-ular degree program. Applicants are required to submit scores from the general and subjecttests of the Graduate RecordExamination (GRE). Applicants whosenative language is not English mustalso submit scores from the Test ofEnglish as a Foreign Language(TOEFL). Colloquia and Seminars: Faculty and students attend the weekly departmentalcolloquia, which highlight progress incutting-edge research areas of broad andgeneral interest. The department holdsweekly seminars in astrophysics, particlephysics, atomic optical and molecularphysics, nonlinear dynamics, condensed matter physics, theoretical physics, rela-tivity, and cosmology. Distinguished lec-tures endowed by the James Arthur andStanley H. Klosk Funds are held period-ically. Informal interactions and \"journalclubs\"\u2014where students, postdoctoralresearchers, and faculty discuss researchin progress\u2014promote collaborationwithin and across subelds. Interactionis also fostered with programs at theCourant Institute of MathematicalSciences, the Center for Neuroscience(program for theoretical neuroscience),the School of Medicine, and theDepartments of Chemistry and Biology. Special Notes: Although students may be admitted at midyear, many coursesare full-year courses, so it may not bepossible for those students to enroll fora full-time program. Full-time stu-dents are expected to carry either threecourses per semester or the equivalentin approved research. MASTER OF SCIENCE All candidates for the M.S. degreemust complete 32 points of credit (atleast 24 in residence at the GraduateSchool and at least 16 in theDepartment of Physics) and achieve a grade point average (GPA) of B (3.0) orbetter. They are further required topass at least ve of the following sevencourses: Dynamics (G85.2001) Statistical Mechanics (G85.2002)Electromagnetism I (G85.2005)Computational Physics I (G85.2011)Quantum Mechanics II (G85.2012)Experimental Physics (G85.2075) M.S. candidates are permitted to take at most two courses outside the depart-ment, with permission of the directorof graduate studies. In addition to the above course requirements, M.S. candidates com-plete their degree requirements via oneof three options. Option A: Report The report is essentially a comprehen- sive review article based on the litera-ture in a specialized eld of physics,prepared under the supervision of a fac-ulty adviser. In addition to submittingthe report, students choosing thisoption must receive credit for nine reg-293 PHYSICSular courses (one-semester, 4-point courses, not including reading andresearch). Option B: Thesis The thesis is based on physics research (experimental or theoretical) supervisedby a faculty adviser, at a level of origi-nality and comprehensiveness less thanthat of Ph.D. research. In addition tothe standard course requirements, thestudent is expected to enroll in onesemester (4 points) of a research course(G85.2091 or G85.3301). Option C: Examination In addition to receiving credit for eight regular courses (one-semester, 4-pointcourses, not including reading andresearch), a student choosing thisoption must pass the core courses withan average grade of B or better. Foreach course, the student has the option of 1. enrolling in the course; 2. taking the midterm and nal exami-nation of the course if the student isnot enrolled; or 3. taking the relevant preliminaryexamination given just before the startof the fall term. MASTER OF PROFESSIONAL STUDIES The two-year Master of Professional Studies program prepares students forscientic/technical careers in non-academic economic sectors. The pro-gram provides students with an inten-sive focus on physics, while at the sametime incorporating ancillary elementsthat are designed specically to preparestudents for challenges they will con-front in industrial and business settings. The degree requires 36 points of course work to be completed on a full-time or part-time basis, an internship,and a master's thesis or special super-vised project. Course Requirements The following three courses: Computational Physics (G85.2000)Electromagnetism (G85.2005)Quantum Mechanics I (G85.2011) At least one of the following courses: Statistical Mechanics (G85.2002)Dynamics (G85.2001)Quantum Mechanics II (G85.2012) Two advanced physics courses beyond the above core courses.Three of the following four courses offered at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business: Managing Organizations (B01.1302) Competitive Advantages fromOperations (B01.2314)Marketing (B01.2310)Firms and Markets (B01.1303) Additional Requirements Mandatory attendance at regular collo- quium series: During both years, each student must attend colloquium seriessponsored by the program. Internship: Internship opportunities are available to students in the summer ofthe rst year. The internships areselected to complement the student'scareer and academic interests. Theinternships are primarily sited in indus-trial settings but may also be appropri-ate in academic research settings. Thesis or nal report: Students are required to submit either a master'sthesis supervised by an NYU facultymember or a special project, which canbe an elaboration of an internshipexperience. Special projects must besupervised by an NYU faculty memberbut may be jointly supervised by aproperly qualied person in an indus-trial setting. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Ph.D. program is aimed atenabling a student to prepare for andcarry out research in physics at thefrontier of knowledge. The departmentencourages entry into dissertationresearch under the supervision of a fac-ulty member as soon as one hasattained sufcient mastery of the fun-damental principles and techniques ofphysics. Depth and breadth within thelarger context of contemporary physicsare promoted by a flexible set of courserequirements. Numerous seminars andthe weekly Physics Colloquium pro-vide an excellent opportunity for stu-dents to keep abreast of recentdevelopments across the full spectrumof physics research. Special talks by fac-ulty members describing their researchprograms help students learn aboutresearch activities in the department. Entering students who qualify for admission to the Ph.D. program areoffered a departmental nancial aidpackage with a commitment of at leasttwo semesters of part-time teachingduties. Departmental support may bewithdrawn if a student is deemed to benot making adequate progress towardfullling the degree requirements.Students may apply for research assis-tantships and fellowships without teaching duties at any time. Core Course Requirements The aim of the Ph.D. program is to certify the student's mastery of a tradi-tional body of basic principles andproblem-solving techniques generallyconsidered to be an essential part of aresearch physicist's training. To thisend, a student in the program isrequired to get a B or better in eachpart of ve core subjects: Dynamics Statistical Mechanics Electromagnetism Quantum Mechanics (Parts I and II) Computational Physics Other Options for Satisfying Core Course Requirements A student who has taken a course else- where that is equivalent to one of thecore courses need not enroll in thatcourse; instead, he or she may satisfythe relevant requirement by achievinga grade of B or better on the relevantpreliminary examination given justbefore the start of the fall term. Eachexamination is designed to be com-pleted in two hours (three hours areallowed to avoid time pressure) andcovers the material of the correspond-ing course at the level of midterm andnal examinations. Deadline for Core Course Requirements In order to make satisfactory progress toward the Ph.D., a student must com-plete all core course requirements bythe beginning of his or her second year.If a student fails to get a B or better ina core course (or in one of the alterna-tive options) during his or her rst aca-demic year, the student is obliged totake the relevant preliminary examina-tion just prior to his or her second year.If one or more of the core courserequirements are not satised at thestart of the student's second thePh.D. qualication committee willreview the student's entire record anddecide what action to take. Such actionmight include a recommendation tothe faculty that the student be discon-tinued from the Ph.D. program.Termination of a student from the pro-gram requires a vote of the faculty. Experimental Physics Requirement Students are required to have experi- ence in experimental physics. Thisrequirement may be satised by taking294 PHYSICSthe course Experimental Physics (G85.2075). Alternatively, a studentmay conduct an independent experi-mental project under physics facultysupervision. Course Requirements Beyond the Core A student is required to take at least six courses beyond the core level (notincluding reading and research coursesor Practicum in the Teaching ofPhysics [G85.2090]) in theDepartment of Physics. At least two ofthese courses must be outside the stu-dent's research area. Requirements of the Graduate School A student must also satisfy the follow- ing requirements of the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science: completionof 72 points of graduate credit (at least32 in residence at the Graduate School)and a cumulative GPA of B (3.0) orbetter. Formation of a Thesis Committee By the beginning of May of the stu- dent's second year, the student isexpected to have arranged for thesissupervision with a member of thephysics faculty. A four-person thesis committee, chaired by the thesis adviser, is set upat this time. The membership of thethesis committee is proposed by theadviser in consultation with the stu-dent and must be approved in writingby the director of graduate studies toensure breadth and level of expertise. At the time of its formation, the thesis committee meets with the stu-dent and discusses the student's course of study, preliminary research plans,and the timing and scope of the oralqualifying examination (see below).The committee conducts an annualreview of the student's progress, nor-mally in January. Oral Qualifying Examination The qualifying examination marks the student's formal entry into dissertationresearch under the supervision of a par-ticular faculty member. It takes placeafter the student has already embarkedon some sort of preliminary researchwith his or her adviser and is adminis-tered by the student's thesis commit-tee. The deadline for taking the oralqualifying examination is January of astudent's third year, prior to the annualreview. The examination itself consists of a prepared talk by the candidate fol-lowed by a question period. The aim isto examine the student's mastery notonly of the specic area of the student'sintended research, but also of relatedareas of physics and of (relevant) gen-eral principles of physics. The commit-tee decides whether the evidence, takenall together, presents a convincing pic-ture of a person with the preparationand skills needed to do original scien-tic research in the proposed area. Annual Review, Progress Report, Thesis Proposal There is an annual review of each stu- dent's progress toward the Ph.D. Thisincludes a progress report submittedby the student. Prior to the formationof a thesis committee, the review isconducted by the Ph.D. qualicationcommittee. Afterward, the student's thesis committee conducts the review.The rst annual progress report follow-ing the qualifying examinationincludes a formal proposal for the stu-dent's thesis research. Subsequentprogress reports inform the committeeon progress toward completion of thethesis, as well as on any signicantmodications of the original proposal. Oral Thesis Defense The nal approval of the student's the- sis and the oral thesis defense is con-ducted by the student's thesiscommittee, augmented by one addi-tional faculty member. Three membersof the examining committee, includingthe student's adviser, serve as readers ofthe dissertation. DEPARTMENTAL FINANCIAL AID A number of nancial aid programs are available for qualied graduate stu-dents in physics. Further informationcan be obtained by writing to thedepartment in care of the graduate sec-retary. Note: Financial aid is generally awarded only to students in the doc-toral program.

By offering anintegrated approach to theoreti-cal concerns in the humanities,it responds to frequently voiceddesires for a theory initiativeacross the disciplines. Ratherthan pure theorizing, the pro-gram focuses on sharing theoret-ical approaches and fostersinterdisciplinary and interna-tional collaboration. The program traces a historical progression from the ancient prac-tices of poetics and rhetoric totheir modern theoretical heirs.The intimate but vexed relationsbetween aesthetics and hermeneu-tics, philosophy and literature, andsocial institutions and the work ofart form the core of study. The transdisciplinary orientation of the certicate program comple-ments disciplinary study andsharpens students' career proles. 10003-6790 212-998-8597 WEB SITE: www.nyu.edu/fas/program/poeticsandtheory T Program and RequirementsEligibility: All students enrolled in Ph.D. and M.A. programs in theGraduate School of Arts and Scienceare eligible. Students funded throughthe MacCracken program pay no addi-tional tuition or fees. Admission: Students already enrolled in a Ph.D. or an M.A. program at NewYork University should submit a state-ment of purpose, a letter of recommen-dation, clearance from the departmentaldirector of graduate studies, and therst two pages of the regular GSASapplication form to the codirector. For those not already enrolled at NYU, admission to the advanced cer-ticate program is by application tothe Graduate School of Arts andScience.ADVANCED CERTIFICATE A total of 20 points of course work isrequired (a maximum of 8 points mayoverlap with the credits required forthe M.A. or Ph.D.): (G40.2002); and threeadditional courses, of which one mustcover either philosophy or rhetoric orbe a theory survey, and two must belisted outside the student's homedepartment (cross-listing in the homedepartment is allowed). In addition to the ve courses, stu- dents seeking the advanced certicatemust present a paper at least once atone of the yearly workshops or confer-ences offered by the Program in Poeticsand Theory. Students planning on par- ticipating in a conference or workshopdevelop a paper in the context of thePoetics and Theory Seminar, whichfocuses on a topic leading to the con-ference. This paper may be a chapter ofthe dissertation. CONFERENCES The Program in Poetics and Theoryruns annual workshops with a largeconference every three years, organizedin cooperation with the Kleist Instituteat European an POETICS AND THEORYEXCHANGE PROGRAM AND TRAVEL Ph.D. students may take advantage of an exchange between New YorkUniversity and the Kleist Institute atthe European University Viadrina in Frankfurt an der Oder (Berlin). Thetiming of the exchange is subject toapproval by the student's departmentand by the directors of the advancedcerticate program. Students may taketheir MacCracken funding abroad dur- ing a year in which they have no teach-ing responsibilities. Qualied studentsmay also apply for stipends from theDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft for asixth year of funding. CoursesProseminar in Poetics and theOrigins of Literary TheoryG40.2001Introduces students to the most impor-tant developments in the Western his-tory of theorizing literature, itsproduction, and its interpretation.Since many courses at NYU survey20th-century literary theory, thiscourse offers some historical back-ground: it brings into conjunction pre-and post-18th-century traditions thatrarely come into contact in the curricu- lum and are unlikely to be taught inone course. Issues include the deni-tion of literary genres, differences inregisters of style, the relation of pleas-ure to morality, of the practical to theaesthetic, and the transformation ofthese issues in post-Kantian theories ofinterpretation.Poetics and Theory Seminar G40.2002 One course every year is identied asthe Poetics and Theory Seminar, whichfocuses on the subject matter of theconference so that students have a cur-ricular framework for preparing a paperfor the conference. This course is meantfor students who are already at anadvanced stage in their research.PoliticsDEPARTMENT OF FacultyNathaniel Beck, Professor; Chair, Department of Politics.

FACULTY EMERITI Rita W. Cooley, Roelofs. Programs and RequirementsMASTER OF ARTS Admission: Admission to the M.A. program in politics is granted for thefall semester only. Admission is limitedto students whose academic recordsand letters of recommendation indicateexceptional promise of success in theadvanced study of political science.This means an outstanding undergrad-uate record or other related evidence.Applicants with lower averages may beadmitted where there is indication of aparticular strength in political scienceand clear aptitude for graduate work.The general test of the GraduateRecord Examination (GRE) is requiredof all students, including all interna-tional students applying from countriesin which the GRE is offered. All inter-national students who are not nativeEnglish speakers are also required tosubmit scores from the Test of Englishas a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Course of Study: Six departmental elds of study are offered: political phi-losophy and theory, political methodol-ogy, American politics, politicaleconomy, comparative politics, andinternational relations. Students arerequired to complete eight courses (32points), of which at least six must be inthe department and four must be inone departmental eld. Courses in themajor eld must include the eld corecourse. This core course and one addi-tional core course are required and areusually the rst courses taken in thedepartment.Students must also complete a major project. The M.A. project con-sists of a seminar paper, which shoulddemonstrate breadth in the conceptionand mastery of political analysis.Students are required to notify thedirector of graduate studies at the ini-tiation of research for the master's proj-ect. The director of graduate studiesmust be notied in all cases, whetherthe paper is to be written in conjunc-tion with, or independent of, a course.The director of graduate studies mustapprove the project and designate anadviser to be the rst reader, with writ-ten notice to both student and adviser.If the paper is written in conjunctionwith a course, the adviser would alsobe the course instructor. The director'sapproval relates only to M.A.-projectstatus and would in no way interferewith assignment or evaluation of theessay for course credit. Once an M.A.-project topic and adviser are desig-nated, the director of graduate studiesmust approve changes to them. Oncethe adviser has read and approved adraft, an M.A.-project evaluations com-mittee, appointed annually by the chairto read all M.A. papers, will evaluateit. If the evaluations committeeapproves the essay, it is accepted as themajor project. Students are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 (on a 4.0scale) in work for the master's degree.Each student should meet with his orher adviser every semester to discussand agree on a course of study. Thedirector of graduate studies will assignan adviser prior to the start of the stu- dent's rst semester. Foreign Language Requirement: Students must demonstrate prociencyin one language other than English or,with permission of the director ofgraduate studies, in statistics. Studentsdemonstrate prociency in a foreignlanguage by the GSAS foreignlanguage prociency examination or bycompleting an intermediate-level foreign language course with a grade ofB or better. Students demonstrate pro-ciency in statistics by completingQuantitative Analysis II (G53.2127)with a grade of B or better. Concentration in International Politics and International Business Students complete up to nine courses, four of which must be in the interna-tional relations eld, including theinternational relations core course. Theother courses are taken from a desig-nated group in other disciplines in theLeonard N. Stern School of Business.Each student is also expected to writean M.A. major project on a topicrelated to his or her program work. Inaddition, students in this concentrationregister for a 1-point reading andresearch course (G53.3991), in whichthey produce a paper detailing howthey will apply the methods, skills, orknowledge they obtain in their busi-ness courses to political science. 302 POLITICSDOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The goal of the Ph.D. program is to prepare students to conduct research,to teach, or to work in applied settingsat the best institutions in the UnitedStates and abroad. To achieve this goal,the program species the distributionof courses, the substance and timing ofrequirements, the forms of facultysupervision, and the criteria foradvancement within the program. Admission: The general test of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE)is required of all students, including allinternational students applying fromcountries in which the GRE is offered.All international students who are notnative English speakers are alsorequired to submit the Test of Englishas a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores.Letters of recommendation mustclearly indicate that an applicant iscapable of successfully pursuing thedoctorate. The applicant is alsorequired to submit a writing sampleand statement of educational back-ground and objectives. A bachelor'sdegree is required for admission to thePh.D. program. A Master of Artsdegree is not a requirement for admis-sion to the Ph.D. program. Course Requirements: Students must complete 72 points (18 courses)beyond the B.A. degree. There are nodepartment-wide course requirements.To guard against excessive specializa-tion, students must take at least threecourses (12 points) in each of at leasttwo elds. Course credits transferredfrom another institution may counttoward the fulllment of this require-ment. The elds presently recognizedby the department include (1) politicalphilosophy and theory, (2) politicalmethodology, (3) American politics, (4)political economy, (5) comparative pol-itics, and (6) international relations. Inconsultation with their adviser, stu-dents may petition the director ofgraduate studies (DGS) to create a eldof their own making. Such a eld maybe interdisciplinary. Doctoral studentsare expected to maintain a 3.5 gradepoint average. When entering the program, stu- dents should declare their intendedmajor, which can be changed at anytime in consultation with the student'sadviser. A student specializing in anyrecognized eld may have to satisfycourse requirements established by fac-ulty in this eld. Admission to someadvanced courses may be conditional onstudents having taken some other courses or having an equivalent back-ground. In all cases, students must con-sult their adviser to plan acomprehensive program of courses andinform their adviser of any changes. There are no limits on courses taken in other departments or other univer-sity members of the Inter-UniversityDoctoral Consortium (see the Admission section of this bulletin for details) otherthan those specied by GSAS. Studentsare encouraged to develop knowledgeand acquire methodological skills insister disciplines. To train themselves in academic research and writing, students areencouraged to write research papers,typically by applying or developing thework of a particular course in subse-quent reading and research courses.The two required papers, the M.A.paper and the Ph.D. qualifying paper(see below), are normally prepared inthis way. Students who have satised all the requirements of a particular course otherthan the nal examination or paper andwho present a written proposal for aresearch paper related to this course mayask the instructor for a research inprogress (RIP) grade. Students whoreceive this grade are expected to take areading and research course during thesubsequent semester(s) to research andwrite the paper. This grade is reported tothe registrar as IP (Incomplete Pass) butis distinguished by the department fromIncomplete grades for all other purposes,including nancial decisions. On com-pleting the research paper, the studentreceives nal grades for the courses. M.A. Paper: Students who enter the program without an M.A. degree mustpresent a written M.A. paper by nolater than the beginning of their secondyear. The specic requirements for thepaper depend on the eld, but the gen-eral rule is that it should have the for-mat of an article in this eld. The topicof the M.A. paper should be chosen inconsultation with faculty members. Oncompletion, the paper is submitted forreading by two faculty members chosenby the director of graduate studies(DGS), no later than within twomonths after submission. The paper canreceive a high pass, a low pass, or a fail-ing grade. If the paper does not receivea unanimous high pass, the studentmay revise and resubmit it by no laterthan the beginning of the fourth semes-ter of residence. If the paper receives a low pass and the student maintains at least a 3.0grade point average, the student isgranted the M.A. degree but mustleave the program. If the paper receivesa failing grade or if the student's gradepoint average is below 3.0, no degree isgranted. If the revised paper receivesdifferent grades from the two readers,the DGS appoints a third reader andthe expanded committee will decidethe grade. A student whose M.A. paperand grade record are satisfactory is con-sidered to have advanced toward thePh.D. M.A. Waiver: Students entering with an M.A. degree from an equivalentinstitution may petition for a waiver ofup to one year of course requirements(equivalent of 24 points). For this pur-pose, a copy of the M.A. thesis must besubmitted to the director of graduatestudies (DGS) when the student entersthe program. The DGS appoints twofaculty members as readers to decidewhether the thesis is equivalent instandards and quality to the depart-ment's requirements. If the M.A. thesisis approved, the student submits thewaiver petition to the DGS at the endof the rst year of residence. In consul-tation with the readers, the DGSdecides whether or not to waive resi-dence requirements on the basis of theM.A. thesis and the grade record of thestudent during the rst year at NewYork University. Please note that if astudent is granted a waiver of 24points, he or she is required to waiveone year of academic funding. Communications Requirement: Doctoral students must demonstrateprociency in a language other thanEnglish. The Graduate School of Artsand Science determines which lan-guages qualify, but another languagecan be substituted on recommendationof the student's adviser and the directorof graduate studies and with approvalof the language coordinator. A studentwhose native language is not Englishshould consult the director of graduatestudies regarding fulllment of thecommunications requirement. Ph.D. Qualifying Examination: No later than the end of the fth semesterin residence (third semester for stu-dents who receive an M.A. waiver),students must complete the Ph.D.qualifying examination, which consistsof the submission of a qualifying paper(QP) and the oral defense of a syllabus. 303 POLITICSThe QP is a research paper of pub- lishable quality, satisfying all formalrequirements for an article in a giveneld. Before writing the paper, stu-dents should submit a brief proposal toat least two faculty members, whobecome \"readers\" on approving thisproposal. The topic (but not necessarilythe eld) of the QP must differ fromthat of the M.A. paper, and the twopapers must be read by at least fourdifferent readers. The work on the QPcan be and should be assisted by fac-ulty. Readers evaluate this paperwithin two months of submission. Thereaders have the option of acceptingthe paper, suggesting revisions, orrejecting the paper. If invited to do so,the student may revise the paper andresubmit it within six months. If therevision is not accepted by both read-ers, the student is considered to havefailed this requirement. Students must also submit an origi- nal syllabus for a graduate introductionto a eld. This syllabus should attest tothe understanding of the structure ofthe eld, as well as to the knowledge ofthe primary and secondary literature.This syllabus is presented at an oralhearing to two faculty members, whothen pass or fail the syllabus and itsdefense. Students who successfullycomplete both of these requirementsqualify as candidates for the Ph.D.degree. Students who do not satisfyboth requirements by the end of thethird year (second year for studentswho receive an M.A. waiver) arerequired by the department to leavethe program, save for exceptional cir-cumstances. Dissertation: After completing the qualifying examination, students mustpresent a Ph.D. dissertation proposal.The proposal ordinarily should be pre-sented before the end of the third yearin residence (second year for studentswho receive an M.A. waiver). Studentswho do not present a proposal withinone calendar year of passing their qual-ifying examination must petition theDGS to be allowed to do so. The proposal should specify the problem to be researched, summarizethe current state of knowledge,describe research procedures, and iden-tify the bodies of relevant information.It should be no more than 15 single-spaced pages, plus a bibliography. Adissertation committee (see below)must approve the proposal. When allmembers are satised with the pro-posal, the committee meets with the student in an advisory hearing.Acceptance of the proposal signals thatthe student has satised all the require-ments for the Ph.D. degree other thanthe dissertation. The dissertation must constitute a substantial body of original research ofpublishable quality. Except by theexpressed permission of the chair of thedepartment, the dissertation should notexceed 100,000 words. Once membersof the committee approve the disserta-tion, an oral defense is scheduled. After the student's thesis director approves the dissertation and the dis-sertation committee agrees that it isready for defense, a nal oral defense isscheduled before a panel of ve facultymembers appointed by the chair of thedepartment or the director of graduatestudies. The GSAS regulates the proce-dures for this defense. The department expects students to complete the dissertation and itsdefense within four years after nishingcourse requirements. GSAS regulationsrequire students to complete themwithin ten years from entering thegraduate program (seven years for thoseentering with an M.A. from anotheruniversity). Advisory Committees: Before begin- ning to work on the qualifying paper,students must form a QP committeeconsisting of two readers (see above).Students should keep this committeeinformed about the progress of theirresearch. Before beginning to work on the Ph.D. dissertation, students must forma thesis committee, comprising at leastthree faculty members (the committeechair and two members), of whom atleast two must be members of thedepartment. Students should consultwith the committee while preparingthe proposal and working on the thesis. The Graduate Ofce maintains a progress checklist for each student,showing the adviser, major and minorelds, M.A. paper topic and readers,QP topic and committee, and disserta-tion topic and committee. The fellow-ship evaluation and progress (FEP)committee uses this checklist to over-see the progress of all students in theprogram. Regular Progress: A student is con- sidered to be making satisfactoryprogress as long as she or he does thefollowing: 1. Submits a previously written M.A. thesis on entering the program or con-sults with faculty about writing theM.A. paper during the rst semester inthe program. 2. Submits the M.A. paper by the beginning of the third semester or, ifinvited to do so, resubmits it by thebeginning of the fourth semester. 3. Submits the QP and the syllabus and defends the syllabus by the end ofthe fth semester (third for studentsentering with an equivalent M.A.degree) or, if invited to do so, resub-mits the QP and defends the syllabusby the end of the sixth semester. 4. Defends the Ph.D. proposal within six months of passing the Ph.D. quali-fying examination. Students who are not making satisfac- tory progress are notied by the DGSand must petition the fellowship evalu-ation and progress (FEP) committee tobe allowed to continue in the program.With regard to points 1 through 3above, this request is granted only ifthe delay is caused by exceptional cir-cumstances. With regard to point 4, itis sufcient that the student demon-strates reasonable progress. All references to time are based on a calendar of effective semesters (nor-mally 12 points). Hence, part-timestudents may take a longer period tosatisfy the requirements. Nonmatriculated Students: Under special circumstances, nonmatriculants(students who are not working toward adegree) may enroll for one course persemester with permission of the directorof graduate studies. Nonmatriculantscan earn cumulatively no more than 12points in the Graduate School of Artsand Science.

Landy; Social Psychology, Professor Susan Andersen he Department of Psychology atNew YorkUniversity approaches the study of thehuman mind and human behav-ior from many perspectives.Psychologists in the cognitionand perception program focus on perception, action, memory,attention, language, and think-ing. Social psychologists studypersuasion and attitude change,stereotyping and prejudice,judgment and decision making,and how relationships form anddevelop. Graduate students in the department have the opportu-nity to obtain sophisticatedtraining from these perspectivesand to integrate the approachesin novel ways. At the doctorallevel, students select one of thethree specialty areas but candeclare a minor specialty in asecond area or in quantitativepsychology. In addition, studentsfrom all programs have theopportunity to focus on develop-mental psychology, which is across-cutting concentrationrather than a separate program.Developmental psychologists examine both cognitive andsocial functioning as it changesover the life span. At the master's level, students have the opportunity to samplegraduate courses in a wide vari-ety of topics and may participatein tracks in either industrial/organizational psychology or ingeneral psychology. The department takes advan- tage of its location in thenation's premier city by collabo-rating with important scienticinstitutions, community agen-cies, and corporations. New Yorkprovides access to almost anypopulation or cultural grouppsychologists might choose tostudy. Experiences in this stimu-lating context supplement thedepartment's emphasis on basicpsychological research.

Programs and RequirementsThe Department of Psychology offers courses of study leading to the Masterof Arts and Doctor of Philosophydegrees, with opportunities to special-ize in various areas. Admission to grad-uate study in psychology is based onacademic records, Graduate RecordExamination scores, and letters of rec-ommendation. A limited number ofnonmatriculants may be accepted foradmission to the Master of Arts pro-gram (see Nondegree Status, below). Each student is responsible for complying with all rules, regulations,requirements, and policies of theUniversity, the Graduate School of Artsand Science, the Department ofPsychology, and the program in whichhe or she is studying. MASTER OF ARTS The Master of Arts degree in psychol-ogy is offered to students wishing toimprove their status in a psychology-related occupation or to strengthentheir background in the eld. ManyM.A. students plan for later pursuit of the Ph.D. degree. It should be empha-sized, however, that the M.A. programoffers a terminal degree. All studentswho wish to obtain a Ph.D. degreemust apply directly to their program ofchoice during the Ph.D. applicationperiod (see under Doctor of Philosophy ). Admission: Applicants seeking admis- sion to a Master of Arts program inpsychology should have graduatedfrom college with an average of B orbetter. All applicants must have com-pleted courses in introductory psychol-ogy and in introductory statistics withgrades of B or better to be eligible foradmission. All applicants must providea report from the general test of theGraduate Record Examination (GRE)and achieve scores of at least 530 in theverbal and at least 580 in the quantita-tive sections as well as a score of 4.5 orabove in the analytical writing section.In addition, international applicantswho are not native English speakersmust achieve a score of at least 600(250 for the computerized version) on the Test of English as a ForeignLanguage (TOEFL). Applications areaccepted for fall, spring, or summeradmission. Programs of Study: Two programs of study are offered to M.A. degree candi-dates: (1) general psychology, for stu-dents who wish to shape their course ofstudy to t special interests and needs,and (2) industrial/organizational (I/O)psychology, for those wishing toexpand their knowledge of the psycho-logical principles and methods usefulin employee relations and humanresources elds. Degree Requirements: Formal requirements for the M.A. degree inpsychology are the satisfactory comple-tion of 36 points (at least 24 in resi-dence in the Graduate School of Artsand Science) and either a written com-prehensive examination or a master'sthesis. All students must passIntermediate Master's Statistics(G89.2016) or the equivalent. Students312 PSYCHOLOGYmust pass substantive core courses with a grade of B or better and must main-tain an overall B average. The specicrequirements within each program arelisted below. General Program Requirements: Satisfactory completion of four corecourses chosen from three core groups,as follows: a total of three from core A(G89.2010, andG89.2025) and core B (G89.2014,G89.2015, G89.2020, and G89.2034),such that each core is sampled, and onefrom core C (research: G89.2066,G89.2067, and G89.2126). Note: Students who are admitted without having majored in psychologyas undergraduates are required to com-plete a total of four courses from coreA and core B, such that each core issampled. I/O Psychology Requirements: Satisfactory completion of G89.2032,two courses from core I (G89.2070,G89.2071, and G89.2073), twocourses from core O (G89.2072,G89.2074, and G89.2076), and aresearch course (normally G89.2067). Master's students are required to register for courses, request an ofcialleave of absence, or maintain matricu-lation each semester from the start oftheir academic career until graduation. The Master of Arts degree is also granted to students matriculated in thedoctoral program when they have metthe requirements for the degree asdened by their program and by theGraduate School of Arts and Science. Courses at the M.A. level usually commence no earlier than 4:20 p.m.and no later than 6:20 p.m. The pro-gram may be completed on a part-timeor full-time basis, providing that allcourse work and either a comprehen-sive exam or thesis are completedwithin a ve-year period. NONDEGREE STATUS An applicant with an undergraduateaverage of B or better may apply foradmission as a nonmatriculated stu-dent, eligible to take 12 points ofM.A.-level courses in general psychol-ogy. Nondegree status is not availablefor I/O students. A should submit the applicationform and required subsections, copiesof all transcripts, and at least one letterof recommendation. All materialshould be sent to the Graduate Schoolof Arts and Science Ofce of GraduateEnrollment Services. Nondegree students who wish to petition for admission to the M.A. pro-gram must satisfy any conditions set by the department and provide a reportfrom the general test of the GraduateRecord Examination that reflects ascore of at least 530 in the verbal and580 in the quantitative section.Address inquiries to the Department ofPsychology, New York University, 6Washington Place, New York, NY10003-6634; 212-998-7900. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Doctor of Philosophy is a research-oriented degree. It signies that therecipient is able to conduct independentresearch and has a broad basic knowl-edge of psychology and a comprehensiveknowledge of a special area. Specialtyprograms include cognition and percep-tion, and social psychology. Studentsmay also choose to concentrate in devel-opmental psychology in conjunctionwith one of the other programs. Admission: Applicants to programs of study leading to the Ph.D. degreeshould have graduated from collegewith an outstanding undergraduaterecord. An undergraduate major inpsychology is not required. The cogni-tion and perception program places aparticular emphasis on research experi-ence. The Graduate RecordExamination (GRE) general test isrequired of all applicants. The GREpsychology test is not required.Matriculants are admitted only in thefall term and only on a full-time basis.See also the Degree Requirements section of this bulletin. International appli-cants who are not native Englishspeakers are also required to take theTest of English as a Foreign Language(TOEFL), including the writing test. Degree Requirements: Formal requirements for the doctorate in psy-chology include the satisfactory com-pletion of 72 points (at least 32 inresidence at New York University); twoterms of statistics (either G89.2229, or courses approved bythe student's program); satisfactorycompletion of an oral or written com-prehensive examination, or thesis(requirements vary by program); andpresentation of an acceptable disserta-tion. After completion of the requirednumber of points, doctoral studentsmaintain matriculation by fee eachsemester until completion of the disser-tation. Information regarding require-ments of the doctoral specializationprograms additional to the precedingdepartment requirements should beobtained from the Department ofPsychology, New York University, 6 Washington Place, Room 550, New York, NY 10003-6634; 212-998-7900. Five years of postbaccalaureate study are usually required to completethe Ph.D. degree; however, no morethan seven years may elapse betweenmatriculation and the completion of alldegree requirements. Continuation as amatriculant is contingent on thedemonstration of satisfactory progresstoward the doctorate. It cannot beoveremphasized that the accumulationof high grades in formal courses, whileimportant, is secondary to the comple-tion of research that contributes signif-icantly to the eld and is effectivelypresented in the dissertation. The Graduate School's foreign lan- guage requirement has been waived forthe Department of Psychology. DEPARTMENTAL PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH Cognition and Perception: Research programs in cognition and (4) physiologi-cal devel-opment (Adolph, Johnson, Marcus);and (7) perception and action (Adolph,Landy, Maloney). Research in perception and atten- tion deals with the perception ofdepth, pattern, form, motion, color,and attentional processes to variousdimensions. Psychophysical methodsand computer modeling of are employed. Research inmemory and cognition deals with rea-soning, categorization, verbal and audi-tory information processing, short- andlong-term memory, conscious andunconscious processes in memory, andvisual cognition. and percep-tion program benet from the fact thatmany of its faculty are also members ofNew York University's Center forNeural Science (CNS) and Center forBrain Imaging (CBI). projects involve both operantprocedures with animals and behavioraltechniques in human learning. Currentresearch in human developmentincludes the development of visuomo-tor skills, conceptual development,perception, and acquisition of lan-guage. Current research in perceptionand action concerns movement plan-ning in adults and children. Training for research begins when students enter the program and culmi-nates in the doctoral thesis. Studentsbecome active members of one of theproductive research laboratories associ-ated with the program, facilitating con-tact with faculty members, advancedstudents, and postdoctoral scientists.Teaching experience is gained throughassistantships that supplement researchtraining. Recent graduates have takenpositions in a variety of academic, pureresearch, and applied research settings.The Center for Neural Science offersopportunities to students in the cogni-tion and perception program to partici-pate in neural science courses alongwith students of the Center and, insome cases, to work with faculty of the Center as well as afliated facultyfrom the Departments of Biology,Chemistry, Computer Science,Mathematics, and Physics. There are weekly area seminars with prominent speakers in cognitionand perception, developmental psy-chology, and neural science. Social Psychology: The social psychol- ogy offers research trainingwithin a social-cognition andsocial-interaction ensuresextensive training in techniques; opportuni-ties for active collaboration withcognitive, developmental, and organi-zational psychologists. Research in theprogram is funded in part by govern-ment grants, which contribute to thecomputerized laboratory environmentas well as provide support for manystudents for their rst four years in theprogram. All faculty are on editorialboards of major journals in social,developmental, and personality psy-chology, and all have served as editorsof these journals as well. The program encourages faculty- student interaction, and students regu-larly present papers at regional andnational psychology association meet-ings. Recent graduates have joined thefaculty of major universities and havetaken positions in both public (e.g., medical schools) and private sectors.An active colloquium series regularlyfeatures leading gures from aroundthe world. Visiting faculty and post-doctoral students also contribute tostudents' training. Faculty research interests include attitudes and persuasion; automaticprocesses in social perception, motiva-tion, and behavior; affect and cogni-tion; developmental social cognition,sex roles, and social comparisonprocesses; judgment and decision mak-ing; relationships, health psychology,and stress; stereotyping and trait infer-ences; sex bias in work settings,dynamics of stereotyping, and conse-quences of preferential selection proce-dures; conflict and negotiation,mediation; and social justice, organiza-tional/social psychology, psychology ofauthority, legal psychology, and surveyresearch/eld research. The social psy-chology laboratories provide computer-based experimental facilities to studycognitive, affective, and motivationalresponses to social stimuli in a con-trolled environment; a place for socialinteraction (either in person or over theInternet); rooms for small groups andpersonality research; and extensivecomputer facilities for data analysis andexperiment preparation. There is also alarge subject pool of undergraduateseach semester, and diverse subject pop-ulations are available off-site. See also Developmental Concentration, below. Developmental Concentration: The Department of Psychology at NewYork University offers a unique concen-tration in developmental psychology.Students who participate in the devel-opmental concentration do so withinone of the department's core programs(cognition and perception, or socialpsychology). They engage in advanced-level seminars and research with facultyafliated with both developmental psy-chology and their other chosen eld ofinterest. Therefore, students becomeexperts in both developmental psychol-ogy and a specic content area. The factthat the concentration cuts across dif-ferent areas of psychology assures thatstudents receive broad exposure to theo-ries of development and methods ofstudying developmental change across arange of content areas. The link with acore psychology program ensures depthof knowledge and expertise in a partic-ular content area. This approach offersstudents considerable flexibility as wellas advantages when they enter the jobmarket. The department's interdisciplinary approach enables students to pursuebasic or applied programs. State-of-the-art lab facilities include powerful newtechnologies for observing, recording,and analyzing behaviors on a nelydetailed or global basis. The University'slocation in lower Manhattan provides aunique opportunity to study develop-mental changes in a range of populationsand communities. Faculty study devel-opment in infants, children, adolescents,and adults. They use a variety of metho-dological approaches, from experimentallab studies and computational modelingto intervention studies and epidemiolog-ical surveys to diary studies and natura-listic eld research. Areas of researchinclude adolescent development, behav-ior regulation, cognition, computationalmodeling, culture and cognition, perceptual exploration, gender and eth-nic identity, immigrant children, psy-chopathology, homelessness and familyfunctioning, language acquisition, motorskill acquisition, racial socialization, andsocial referencing. Students can alsoreceive training in advanced methodsand statistics relevant to studying devel-opmental processes. Students pursue a specic course of study in developmental psychologywithin the required curriculum of theircore psychology program. They attendand present their research at a weeklyseminar in developmental psychology.This seminar provides a stimulatingforum in which both faculty and stu-dents discuss their research. Nationallyrenowned scholars are also invited topresent their research at the seminar,and students have the opportunity todiscuss their work with them. Thedevelopmental concentration at NewYork University is certied by NewYork State and will therefore be regis-tered on the student's transcript. Quantitative Psychology: Quantitative psychology involvesmathematical representations of behav-ioral data, using statistical analysis andmathematical models of psychologicalphenomena. All areas of psychologycan be approached from a quantitativeperspective, so it is possible to pursue aquantitative specialization from any ofthe doctoral specialty programs. To qualify for the quantitative spe- cialization, students take electivecourses in advanced statistical and/ormathematical topics and demonstratean ability to communicate mathemati-cal approaches clearly. 314 PSYCHOLOGYSUMMER TEACHING PRACTICUM Advanced doctoral graduate students are invited to apply to participate inthis supervised teaching experience.Selected students serve as adjunctinstructors for undergraduate summerschool courses. Applicants are admittedto the program on the basis of theirseniority in their doctoral training pro-grams, their relevant experience asteaching assistants, the appropriatenessof the training for their career objec-tives, and their standing in their grad-uate programs. FACILITIES The Department of Psychology main-tains laboratories, classrooms, projectrooms, and a magnetic resonance (MR)neuroimaging facility in an 11-storybuilding near Washington SquarePark. Modern laboratories are continu-ally improved through grants fromfoundations and federal agencies. The Center for Brain Imaging houses a dedicated 3-tesla SiemensAllegra MR system for the use of fac-ulty and students interested in researchusing functional brain imaging. Thecenter includes faculty members from both the Department of Psychologyand the Center for Neural Science. The department maintains com- puter classrooms and laboratories.Faculty laboratories are equipped withspecialized computer equipmentwithin each of the graduate programs.The department collaborates closelywith the Center for Neural Science inmaintaining a technical shop for com-puter and network support as well asthe development of specialized elec-tronics. There is also a fully equippedmachine shop. DEPARTMENTAL FINANCIAL AID Students admitted to the doctoral pro- gram are funded through a combina-tion of fellowships, research andteaching assistantships, and traininggrants. These funding mechanismscover tuition, fees, and NYU studenthealth insurance and provide a stipend.Doctoral students in good standing aresupported for ve years (typically fouryears with a master's in psychology). Inaddition, summer research stipends areavailable.In conjunction with nancial aid packages, doctoral students are askedto serve as teaching assistants to facultywho teach undergraduate psychologycourses or graduate statistics courses.Workshops on effective teaching meth-ods and support for rst-time assistantsare provided. Depending on the sourcesof nancial aid, doctoral students havetwo to ve semesters of teaching expe-rience over the rst ten semesters. Advanced students who have com- pleted at least 12 points in the Masterof Arts programs may request teachingassistant assignments, which providestipends. These assignments are madeon a competitive basis. Departmentalfellowship and scholarship support isnot available to students in the Masterof Arts programs. A comprehensive list of University, Graduate School, and departmental fel-lowships, prizes, and awards appears inthe Financing Graduate Education section of the GSAS Application for Admission and Financial Aid. This information is also available on the GSAS Web site athttp://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.nancialaid.

A doctoral degree from a program in clinical psychology or a related area ofstudy. 2. Two years of supervised experience in individual adult psychotherapy. 3. Eligibility for state certication/ licensing in a mental health discipline. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS Personal Analysis: Candidates are required to complete 300 hours of per-sonal analysis at a minimum of threesessions per week. This analysis mustbegin prior to initiating work with aclinic patient, and it must be concurrentwith at least one year of the treatmentof a clinic patient. The candidate's train-ing analyst must have had, at the com-mencement of the candidate's analysis,ve years of experience following gradu-ation from an analytic training program.Moderate-cost psychoanalysis is madeavailable to students by many membersof the faculty. For further informationregarding moderate-cost analysis, candi-dates may speak with the programdirector, Dr. Lewis Aron.Curriculum: Candidates must satisfac- torily complete 36 points of coursework, chosen with the guidance of fac-ulty from among the program's diverseareas of study. Enrollment in a mini-mum of 3 points per semester isrequired. The program begins with atwo-semester sequence covering themajor psychoanalytic orientations, anintroduction to clinical psychoanalysis,and principles of ethics. The centralthrust of the program is to afford candi-dates the opportunity to study with fac-ulty representing major orientations inpsychoanalytic theory and practice.Students are therefore encouraged totake courses reflecting differing pointsof view and to work with supervisorswho have diverse theoretical approaches.However, since some individuals applyto the program so that they may workwithin one orientation, the programprovides several options. The studentmay select a systematic course of studyin a modern Freudian, an interpersonal,or a relational orientation. Alternatively,the student may choose to combinecourses from the three orientations, aswell as courses not aligned with anyparticular one (independent). The cur-riculum thus fosters an intellectualcommunity in which theoretical diver-sity may thrive and a rigorous compara-tive psychoanalysis is encouraged. Clinical Requirements: The candi- date is required to conduct psycho-analysis for 400 hours under thesupervision of the Postdoctoral Clinic.The candidate is expected to work withat least three clinical supervisors, for aminimum total of 160 hours; eachsupervisor must be seen for at least 40hours. Candidates are to begin workwith a clinic patient by the beginningof their second year in the program,and they are to continue clinic workuntil the requirement of work withtwo patients at 200 hours each is met.In performing the clinic requirement,students are expected to follow allguidelines outlined in the PostdoctoralClinic's policy and procedures manual,which is updated regularly. Studentswrite progress reports on their clinicpatients toward the end of each aca-demic year. Evaluation: Candidates are evaluated by faculty following completion ofeach course and by supervisors follow-ing each supervisory experience.Candidates' progress is monitored bythe Progression Committee, which mayrequire additional course work, super-vision, clinical experience, or personalanalysis. Postdoctoral Clinic: The Postdoctoral Clinic is the clinical facility for the 320 PSYCHOTHERAPY AND PSYCHOANALYSISDIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM: Lewis Aron, Ph.D. he New York UniversityPostdoctoralProgram in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysisis designed to provide advancededucation of postdoctoral mentalhealth professionals in the theoryand practice of psychotherapy andpsychoanalysis. Established in1961 for psychologists who at that time found it difcult toobtain formal training in psycho-analysis, the program was therst psychoanalytic training pro-gram sponsored by a universitygraduate school of arts and sci-ence. It is now the largest psycho-analytic training program in thecountry. The program offers a diverse curriculum, comprising modernFreudian, interpersonal, rela-tional, and independent orienta- tions, and it is unique in offeringcomprehensive training in thesevarious schools. Each orientationhas an internationally knownteaching faculty and and practitionershas made a signicant contribu-tion to the eld. 240 GREENE STREET, 3RD FLOOR NEW YORK, NY 10003-6675 212-998-7890 E-MAIL: gsas.postdoc@nyu.edu WEB SITE: www.nyu.edu/fas/program/postdoctoral T321 PSYCHOTHERAPY AND program.

Selected Courses FREUDIAN AREA OF STUDY This curriculum encompasses the fun-damental discoveries of Sigmund Freudand the diversity of viewpoints in the-ory and technique that characterizesFreudian psychoanalysis as it is prac-ticed today. This diversity arises bothfrom the proliferation of ideas withinego psychology and from the increas-ing influence of studies of child devel-opment, of self psychology, and oftheories of the self in relationship tothe object world. The program is suchthat one can take Freudian training inany desired proportion in relation tothe overall postdoctoral program. It isalso possible to participate in a struc-tured Freudian program, with guaran-teed access to a planned sequence ofcourses. Candidates are welcome tocontact the chair of the faculty in theFreudian area of study, Dr. Jo Lang(jpjlw@aol.com ), to discuss individual questions and planning.

Interpersonaltheory posits a variety of influencesthat produce diverse and individualiz-ing effects upon the person. However,no assumptions are made about anypreordained event or constellation ofevents as being primary determinantsof experience. In this way, the unique-ness of each patient, each therapist, andeach analytic dyad is emphasized.Great importance is placed on anunderstanding of character formationthrough an exploration of the interplayof interpersonal interaction with thesocial and cultural factors that providethe context in which this interaction isembedded.

This multidisciplinaryprogram seeks to prepare stu-dents with both knowledge of a religious world and the tools tostudy that world, including lan-guage training where appropri-ate. It should be stressed that theM.A. Program in ReligiousStudies is oriented toward theacademic analysis of religiousphenomena and is not intendedto promote or endorse either reli-gious belief itself or the viewsand practices of any particularreligious tradition. The program utilizes resources from several areas of study in theGraduate School of Arts andScience (including theDepartments of Anthropology,Classics, English, Hebrew andJudaic Studies, History, MiddleEastern and Islamic Studies, and Philosophy, as well as theProgram in Medieval andRenaissance Studies) and in theTisch School of the Arts (theDepartment of PerformanceStudies). The program also hasclose ties to the Center forReligion and Media. Courses thatoriginate in these programs anddepartments are made available tograduate religious studies stu-dents through cross-listing ordepartmental permission. Mostcourses are offered during the dayor early evening hours. Studentswho pursue the graduate programon a full-time basis (12 points persemester) complete the programin one and a half to two years. 726 BROADWAY , SUITE 554 NEW YORK, Mathews, Fine Arts; Gabriel Moran, Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and HumanDevelopment; Lawrence H.

Program and RequirementsAdmission: Decisions on admission to the graduate Program in ReligiousStudies are based on several factorsincluding undergraduate transcripts,Graduate Record Examination (GRE)test results, letters of recommendation,a writing sample, and a personal state-ment. Although it is advantageous tohave previous course work in the eldof religious studies, it is not required. MASTER OF ARTS Course of Study: This multidiscipli- nary program seeks to prepare studentswith both knowledge of a religiousworld and the tools to study thatworld, including language trainingwhere appropriate. The program foreach candidate for the Master of Artsdegree in religious studies consists of36 points of course work (nine courses)in addition to either a thesis project or an exam: 1. Required course G90.1001, Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion(4 points). 2. Eight courses (32 points) on reli- gious life and practice that combine adisciplinary anda cultural focus. Courses often speak to both areas of study (e.g., History of 19th-CenturyAmerican Christianity uses a historicalapproach to cover religious life in theUnited States). Therefore, a student'scourse trajectory will be worked outwith close faculty advice. By gradua-tion, students should have a grasp ofthe tools of at least one disciplinaryfocus and a working knowledge of atleast one cultural area. Disciplinary Focus : During the rst semester of study, students are intro-duced to a number of theoreticalapproaches to religion and the historyof the ongoing public and academicconversations about religion. Urged toemploy a multidisciplinary approach inthe program, students benet fromchoosing for themselves the discipli-nary approach they nd most useful forthinking about religion. Disciplinaryfoci include history; anthropology of Study: Religion and Journalism,below). Cultural Focus : Instead of focusing on one specic religious tradition, stu-dents are encouraged to structure theirstudy around a chosen cultural andgeographic area. This allows them toemploy the diverse resources of NewYork University and compels them toengage with religion in its concretesocial, economic, political, and histori-cal contexts. When it is grounded inempirical study within a specic con-text, \"religion\" serves as a complexheuristic tool in the analysis of othersocial processes and rhetorical forma-tions in which it is embedded. Culturalfoci include ancient Mediterranean;East Asia; Latin America; modernEurope; modern and medieval MiddleEast; Western Middle Ages; and reli-gious life in the United States. 3. Where language study is deemed necessary, students may use two courses(8 points) for intermediate or advanced- levellanguage study, reducing the above requirement to six courses (24points) in addition to Theories andMethods in the Study of Religion (4points). Furthermore, students areencouraged to employ the numerousUniversity and local resources to pur-sue informal language study. Area of Study: Religion and Journalism As religion appears with growing force in the political, economic, social, andcultural life of a globalizing world, itsrepresentation in various media, elec-tronic and print, likewise grows inimportance. The Program in ReligiousStudies has joined forces with theDepartment of Journalism to providean area of study within the graduateprogram that provides education andtraining for students seeking careers asprofessional newspaper, magazine, or broadcast journalists with an expertiseon religion. This area of study draws oncourses offered by both the Program inReligious Studies and the Departmentof Journalism. The requirementsinclude a nal project in long-formjournalism, an article aimed at a sophis-ticated general readership in expository,explanatory, or investigative form on asubject related to religious life.Admission to this area of study shall bemade at the discretion of the admis-sions committee. The requirements forthe area of study in religion and jour-nalism include 36 points of course work(nine courses), distributed as follows: Required courses in religious studies (16 points total): 1. Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion, G90.1001 (4 points). 2. Religion as Media, G90.3397 (4 points). 3. Two elective courses focusing on the study of religion (8 points). Required courses in journalism (20 points total): 1. Writing, Research, and Reporting Workshop I and II, G90.1021-1022 (8 points). 2. Press Ethics, G54.0012 (4 points).3.

At least 48 of the pointsrequired for the Ph.D. degree must bein regular sociology courses. Up to 12 ofthe remaining 24 points may be readingor dissertation courses that involve indi-vidual work with a member of the fac-ulty. The acceptability of courses outsidesociology depends on the relevance ofthe work to sociology as judged by thedepartment. Credit for work done else-where requires the approval of the direc-tor of graduate studies. In addition, a minimum of 4 points in a regular, listedseminar (any 3000-level course exceptreading and dissertation courses) mustbe included among the 72 points for thePh.D. degree. Methods and Statistics Requirement: Ph.D. students must pass with a B or better two semestersof the Methods and Statistics sequenceand one course satisfying the \"secondmethods course requirement.\" Transferstudents should see the director ofgraduate studies when rst registeringin order to determine what coursesmay be required of them.

This training facilitates students'abilities to engage in research in thearea and aids them as they prepare theirareas for the Ph.D. comprehensiveexamination. To meet this requirement,students must achieve a B or better ineach of two departmental 2000-levelCoursesAll courses carry 4 points per term, unless otherwise indicated. T wo-Part Courses: A hyphen indi- cates a for completing bothterms. A comma indicates credit isgranted for completing each term.

Focuses on theconditions and assumptions of socialtheory, the process of concept formationand theory building, general method-ological issues, and the present relevanceof the authors examined. An effort ismade to speculate on the nature of thegrowth of knowledge in sociology. Contemporary Sociological Theory G93.2115Reviews major trends in sociologicaltheory since World War II, includingstructural functionalism, interpretiveapproaches, rational choice theory,Marxism, and recent European developments.Advanced Seminar in Selected Sociological Traditions G93.3112 Prerequisite: one basic (2000-level) theorycourse.Advanced analysis of one or two socio-logical theorists or traditions, consider-ing the origins, major claims, andcurrent debates over their status (e.g.,Marxism, Foucault, Merton, Bourdieu,Habermas). Advanced Seminar in Selected Themes in Sociological TheoryG93.3113 Prerequisite: one basic (2000- level) theory course.Advanced analysis of a particular theo-retical question, looking at how vary-ing authors and traditions haveattempted to answer it; reviews histori-cal and contemporary debates. Advanced Seminar in Contemporary Sociological TheoryG93.3115 Prerequisite: one basic (2000- level) theory course.Topics in sociological theory sinceWorld War II, including structuralfunctionalism, interpretive approaches,rational choice theory, Marxism, criticaltheory, European developments, and thetheoretical eclecticism of the discipline. METHODS OF INQUIRY Courses marked with an asterisk (*)following the course number satisfy thesecond methods requirement for thePh.D. degree. Methods and Statistics I, II, III G93.2331, 2332, 2333* Prerequisite: G93.2331 or G93.2332 into G93.2332 orG93.2333, respectively.This three-semester sequence providesan introduction to quantitative researchin sociology, integrating the study ofresearch methods and statistics. Therst semester introduces basic method-ological issues and basic statistics. Thesecond semester introduces multivariatetechniques, emphasizing applicationthrough the study of one social sciencedata set. While offering some moreadvanced techniques, the optional thirdsemester stresses the application of theskills learned in the rst two courses,guiding students through a completesecondary analysis of data. Qualitative Methods G93.2303* Supervised experience in activities andtechniques of qualitative, naturalisticeld methods like observation, inter-viewing, and participant observation. 332 SOCIOLOGYcourses, excluding those 2000-levelcourses in theory and methods. Research Paper Requirement: This requirement aims to ensure that allstudents gain research experience earlyin their graduate student career. Thepaper is written, ordinarily during thesecond year of study, under the guid-ance of a faculty supervisor and mustbe approved as well by a second reader. Ph.D. Comprehensive Examination: The required two written examinationsare organized around areas that the stu-dent has studied in consultation withmembers of the faculty. These twowritten examinations should be takenby the end of the third year of full-time study. The examination processtests the student's knowledge of thesetwo areas of study and his or her abil-ity to draw on the discipline as a wholein applying both theory and researchmethodology to social problems. Dissertation: The proposal for the dis- sertation and the dissertation itself areresearched and written in consultationwith a committee of at least threeadvisers. Upon approval of the advisers,the dissertation is defended before anexamining committee of ve faculty members (including the three disserta-tion advisers). At least four afrmativevotes are required for passing a disser-tation defense. Time Limits: All requirements must be completed within ten years of theinception of graduate study, or sevenyears from return to graduate study ifthe candidate holds the master's degreeat the time of readmission. Extensionsof this time limit, if granted, are usu-ally conditional. It cannot be overemphasized that the accumulation of high grades in formalcourses, while important, is secondaryto the demonstration of the capacity fororiginal thinking and to the completionof research that contributes signicantlyto the eld and is effectively presentedin publications and the dissertation. RESEARCH APPRENTICESHIPS The Department of Sociology has a sys-tem of research apprenticeships forgraduate students. Students takingthese apprenticeships work profes-sors' research usually for twosemesters. These apprenticeships offerstudents intensive research experienceand often lead to coauthorship of pub- lished work. Students may receive upto 24 points of credit toward Ph.D.course requirements for apprentice-ships. The rst 8 points of credit(G93.2321, 2322) can count as part ofthe 48 points students need in regularsociology courses. Additional appren-ticeship credit (G93.2323, 2324,2325, 2326) must count against the 24points allowed toward the doctoraldegree from the combination ofapprenticeship, reading, dissertation,and outside courses. The departmentencourages students to take researchapprenticeships. See the department'sofcial statement on research appren-ticeships for more details.

MASTER OF ARTS The Master of Arts program provides astrong foundation in both the theoreti-cal and the clinical components ofdoing work concerned with trauma andviolence. The transdisciplinary natureof the program creates a space for criti-cal inquiry and research that gatherstogether all of the theoretical, critical,and clinical aspects of the analysis andtreatment of trauma, violence, and their aftermath that have previously been dispersed across the disciplines. The M.A. program consists of the four-course core curriculum and fourelectives (32 points). The core curricu-lum exposes students to the entirespectrum of clinical and theoreticalwork, with an eye toward integratingthese different elds through collabora-tive seminars and colloquia. In addi-tion to these core courses, students takefour elective courses in order to deepentheir studies in preparation for writingthe master's thesis. Elective coursesmay be directly or obliquely related totrauma and violence, but must begraduate-level courses approved by theprogram's associate director. The stu-dent must be able to provide a ratio-nale for their elective courses if theyare not directly about trauma and vio-lence. For example, a student inter-ested in domestic violence may elect totake a feminist theory course from theDepartment of English or a course inpsychology of women from theSteinhardt School of Culture,Education, and Human Development.With special permission, independent study or a practicum may count for oneor more of the electives.

INTERNATIONAL GRADUATE STUDENT EDUCATIONALDEVELOPMENT PROGRAM International students with teaching appointments participate in theInternational Graduate StudentEducational Development Program.This required program provides theopportunity for (1) the developmentand testing of English language com-petencies in the classroom environmentand (2) the exploration of cultural dif-ferences in the United States and thenature of NYU's exceptional multicul-tural base. Participants explore com-munications strategies that will enablethem to successfully manage the class-room and interact with students. Theprogram is usually scheduled for sev-eral days at the end of August, beforefall-term classes begin, and if deter-mined by language testing, continueswith language course or tutorial workduring the fall semester. Students whodo not successfully complete the pro-gram may be required to completeadditional work on language beforebeing permitted to assume teachingresponsibilities. Questions about theprogram should be directed to thedirector of graduate studies in the stu-dent's department or to Neil Williams,American Language Institute, 212-998-7058 or 212-995-4135 (fax); e-mail: neil.williams@nyu.edu. READMISSION DEFERMENT In all departments, an offer of admis- sion to the Graduate School permits astudent to enroll for the rst time onlyin the term of entry for which she orhe was specically admitted. If a student declines an offer of admission or does not register for theexpected term, the Graduate Schoolrequires a new application. In somedepartments, the director of graduatestudies (DGS) will grant an extension to the student with the approval of the Graduate School. As additional credentials may be required by theGraduate School in such cases, studentsshould consult with GraduateEnrollment Services. ADMISSION FOR SPECIAL STUDENT STATUS Occasionally an applicant will demon- strate a particular need to study at theGraduate School without entering adegree program. A few special studentsare permitted to register in GSAS eachyear as nondegree students, auditors, orvisiting students. Applicants should contact the department of interest before applying,to conrm that special students are con-sidered for admission into the program.International applicants should consultwith an adviser in Graduate EnrollmentServices before making the decision toapply to be sure that the planned courseof study will be appropriate for theissuance of a visa. Applicants for special student status must complete the application foradmission, including academic tran-scripts that conrm he or she holds abaccalaureate degree. Applicants mustmeet the same application deadlines asstudents who seek degrees. Studentsmay enroll for a maximum of 12 pointsof credit over not more than three con-secutive semesters. If an applicantattended an international college oruniversity, the Graduate School willevaluate the credentials for equivalencybefore granting permission to register. Nondegree Students The Graduate School recognizes that students occasionally choose to studywithout seeking admission to a degreeprogram. If a nonmatriculant ulti-mately enrolls in a degree program,courses taken at the Graduate Schoolmay sometimes, but not always, becredited toward the degree. Auditors Students may register as auditors in some of the departments of theGraduate School. Auditing requires thepermission of the instructor and thedirector of graduate studies (DGS) ofthe program. Auditors pay full tuitionfor courses; no academic credit isawarded, and the work can never beapplied toward a degree.Visiting Students Visiting students in the Graduate School of Arts and Science must be eli-gible to register in a master's or doc-toral degree program at their homeinstitution. In order to register as a visiting student, applicants must secure theapproval of the dean of their homeinstitution and of the appropriatedepartment in the Graduate School ofArts and Science. Visiting students arenot eligible for any form of nancialaid. New York University awards fullcredit for all satisfactorily completedcourses. Students eligible for the Inter- University Doctoral Consortium do notneed to apply as visiting students; seethe Inter-University Doctoral Consortium paragraphs below. Visiting studentsattending during the summer shouldrefer to the New York University Summer Sessions paragraphs below. INTER-UNIVERSITY DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM New York University is a member of the Inter-University DoctoralConsortium, an association of universi-ties in the metropolitan area whosemembers include the graduate arts andscience divisions of the City Universityof New York Graduate Columbia University. The con-sortium members have recently agreedto a limited expansion, allowing stu-dents to enroll in the graduate schoolsof education at member schools. As amember of the doctoral consortium, theGraduate School can provide fullymatriculated, advanced doctoral stu-dents the opportunity to take coursesthat are not otherwise available to themat NYU. Participation is not open tostudents at the master's level. With theapproval of the student's programadviser, the course instructor, the vicedean of the Graduate School of Arts andScience, and the dean's ofce of the hostinstitution, students may register forcourses within the graduate arts andscience and graduate education schoolsat any of the above member institu-tions.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE PROGRAMS A key component of the University's global commitment to education is theGraduate School's internationalexchange program. In the New YorkUniversity Institutes for AdvancedStudy, distinguished visiting facultyfrom throughout the world join spe-cialists from NYU to research topics of increasing importance to all nations of the world. Together with graduate stu-dents, the visitors form an active coreof intellectuals engaged in studyingglobal issues. Graduate students may study at New York University's Italian researchcenter, La Pietra, a Tuscan estate of vemagnicent villas on the outskirts ofFlorence. Other exchange programs sup-port research at the Charles Universityof Prague and the Universities ofAmsterdam, Bonn, Cape Town,Copenhagen, Ghana, Singapore,Stockholm, and Vienna, among others.These unique programs give New YorkUniversity students access to interna-tional university laboratories, archives,and libraries and encourage them toparticipate in international city andregional life. GRADUATE FORUMS The Graduate Forum is an innovativeprogram for graduate students acrossNew York University. Launched inJanuary 2001, the Graduate Forum wasestablished to encourage interdiscipli-nary inquiry into intellectual andmoral problems, to question the foun-dations of the disciplines, and to exper-iment in translating basic research intoa language accessible to a variety ofaudiences without oversimplication. The ten members of the forum are graduate students drawn from master'sand doctoral programs throughoutNew York University. Graduate stu-dents may either nominate themselvesor be nominated by the chair of theirdepartment. Criteria for selectioninclude a promising academic record,the capacity for innovative thinking,the ability to contribute to interdisci-plinary inquiry, and an interest in the new technologies of education. Studentmembership in the forum is for a termof two academic years (unless a studentgraduates earlier). The Graduate Forum usually meets on the last Wednesday evening of eachmonth during the academic year.Student members are expected to makeformal presentations of their work toeach other in ways that further theaims of the forum, including the circu-lation of their papers or other materialsprior to discussion at meetings and theposting of edited forum proceedingsand related resources on the Web. Themembers of the forum also contributeto the regular evaluation and redesignof the forum's format. Starting in 2005, a second group, the IFA-GSAS Forum, was establishedby the Institute of Fine Arts and theGraduate School to enable interdisci-plinary inquiry into \"forms of seeing.\"With support from the Provost's Ofceand the IFA Alumni Association, thisforum also has ten members, ve fromthe IFA and ve from other graduateprograms throughout New YorkUniversity, and meets monthly. TheIFA-GSAS Forum culminates in a year-end symposium at which all studentparticipants present their research tothe wider University community andpublic. The great public servant John W . Gardner contrasts two forms of institu-tional behavior, the nurturing of\"seedbeds\" versus the intolerance of\"dead wood.\" The Graduate Schoolhopes its Graduate Forums will estab-lish, nurture, and cultivate a seedbedthat will in turn foster innovative andcreative thinkers.Financing Graduate Education Instructions for Financial Aid ApplicantsThe application for admission is also the application for all Graduate Schoolfellowships and assistantships for newstudents.

Other Financial Aid\u2014Federal, State, and Private ProgramsELIGIBILITY Tobe considered for nancial aid, stu - dents must be ofcially admitted to NYU or matriculated in a degree pro- gram and making satisfactory academicprogress toward degree requirements.Generally, University-administeredfederal and state nancial aid programsare awarded to full-time students. Half-time students (fewer than 12 butat least 6 points of credit per semester)may be eligible for a Federal StaffordStudent Loan or a Federal PLUS Loan,but they must also maintain satisfac-tory academic progress. A full descrip-tion of the NYU academic progress requirements is available at www.nyu .edu/nancial.aid/progress_grad.html. University-administered federal and state awards are not automatically renewed each year. Continuing studentsmust submit a Renewal FAFSA each year by the NYU deadline. Renewaldepends on the annual reevaluation of astudent' sneed, the availability of funds, the successful completion of the previousyear, and satisfactory progress toward thecompletion of degree requirements. In order to be eligible for aid from federal and state government sources,students must be classied either as U.S.citizens or as eligible noncitizens (asdened by the U.S. Department of Education). It is the student's responsibility to supply true, accurate, and complete information on the FAFSA and tonotify the Ofce of Financial Aid immediately of any changes or correc-tions in his or her housing status ornancial situation, including tuitionremission benets or outside grants, once the application has been made.Determination of nancial need is also based on the number of courses forwhich the student registers. A changein registration therefore may necessi - tate an adjustment in nancial aid. NEW YORK STATE TUITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (TAP) Legal residents of the state of New York who are enrolled in a full-time degreeprogram of at least 12 credit points a term, or the equivalent, may be eligible for awards under this program. TheGraduate School requires all eligiblenancial aid applicants to apply for thisgrant. The TAP award replaces a por- tion of the tuition fellowship amountfor students who receive full tuitiongrants. Students applying for T AP must do so via a F AFSA application. 353 FINANCING GRADUATE EDUCATIONVETERANS BENEFITS Various Department of Veterans Affairs programs provide educational benetsfor sons, daughters, and spouses ofdeceased or permanently disabled vet-erans as well as for veterans and in-service personnel who served on activeduty in the U.S. Armed Forces afterJanuary 1, 1955. In these programs,the amount of benets varies. Since interpretation of regulations governing veterans benets is subjectto change, veterans and their depend-ents should keep in touch with theDepartment of Veterans Affairs.

FEDERAL LOANS Subsidized Stafford Student Loan (SSL) Program The Federal Subsidized Stafford Student Loan Program provides low-interest student loans using the capitalof lending institutions and the admin-istrative facilities of state agencies.These loans are made by independentbanks or lending institutions and aregenerally insured by both the state andfederal governments. A graduate student may borrow up to a maximum of $8,500 per year with atotal aggregate borrowing limit (includ-ing undergraduate loans) of $65,500.Within these limits, students may bor-row up to the difference between thecost of education, the family contribu-tion, and the total of all nancial aidawards. For graduate students, familycontribution is based on the incomes ofthe student and spouse (if married). The subsidized Stafford Student Loan interest rate for all students isxed at 6.8 percent. Interest does notaccrue, however, nor does repaymentbegin, until six months after the bor-rower ceases to enroll at least half time.An insurance premium of up to 1 per-cent as well as an origination fee of upto 3 percent will generally be deductedfrom the loan funds. Stafford loan disbursements are copayable to NYU and the student, andfunds are applied rst to any outstand-ing balance on the student's account. Unsubsidized Stafford Student Loan Program The Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Student Loan Program provides addi-tional loan eligibility beyond any subsi-dized Stafford amounts. Students mustrst apply for the regular (subsidized)Stafford program, and if they meet eligi- bility criteria they will be automaticallyconsidered for the unsubsidized program.Terms and conditions are essentially thesame as for the regular Stafford loan,except the federal government does notpay the interest on the unsubsidized loanwhile the student is in school. Studentsmust begin to repay interest and princi-pal 60 days after the rst loan funds areissued. Payment of the principal may bedeferred if the student is enrolled at leasthalf time for the period of the loan. Also,the interest can be \"capitalized\" (addedto the principal) if desired. Graduate students may borrow up to $12,000 (a total of $20,500 in com-bined subsidized and unsubsidizedStafford loans) each academic year. Thetotal amount of unsubsidized Staffordloan in any academic year may notexceed the cost of education minus thetotal family contribution and minus allother nancial aid (including subsi-dized Stafford loans) received that year. Stafford loan disbursements are copayable to NYU and the student, andfunds are applied rst to any outstand-ing balance on the student's account. Stafford Loan Limits Generally, the total debt a graduate student can have outstanding from allStafford loans combined is $138,500(only $65,500 of this amount may bein subsidized loans). The graduate debtlimit includes any Stafford loansreceived for undergraduate study. PLUS Loan Program The Federal PLUS Loan Program enables creditworthy parents of depend-ent students and qualifying independ-ent graduate students to borrow up toan amount equal to the cost of educa-tion minus all other nancial aid. Noaggregate borrowing limits apply. The annual interest rate is xed at 8.5 percent. For this reason, eligibleindividuals are strongly encouraged tochoose a federal PLUS loan beforeapplying for a private educational loan.Repayment of the PLUS loan typicallybegins within 60 days after funds aredisbursed and may extend up to 10years. An origination fee of up to 3 per-cent will generally be deducted at thetime of disbursement. PRIVATE LOANS A variety of private student loan pro-grams are available to both U.S. andinternational students attending NYU.Created to supplement federal andinstitutional aid, they feature attractiveterms and interest rates, and all credit-worthy families facing college expensesare eligible. There are no maximum income limits. Loans are made throughbanks, savings and loan organizations,and other lenders. For more informa-tion, contact the Ofce of FinancialAid or visit their Web site. EMPLOYEE EDUCATION PLANS Many companies pay all or part of thetuition of their employees under tuitionrefund plans. Employed students attend-ing the University should ask their per-sonnel ofcers or training directors aboutthe existence of a company tuition plan.Students who receive tuition reimburse-ment and NYU employees who receivetuition remission from NYU mustnotify the Ofce of Financial Aid if theyreceive this benet. EMPLOYMENT Students considering employment thatwould require a signicant portion oftheir time should discuss their plans witha Graduate Enrollment Services coun-selor. Students on full-funding supportmust obtain the permission of a depart-mental representative and the dean of theGraduate School if they wish to secureemployment beyond the requirements oftheir nancial aid award. Students who study at the Graduate School on temporary visas should fullyunderstand the regulations concerningpermissible employment under thosevisas.

The traditional University billing cycle consists of one large lump sumpayment due at the beginning of eachsemester. TuitionPay is a budget planthat enables a family to spread pay-ments over the course of the academicyear. By enrolling in this plan, studentscan spread the fall semester tuition pay-ment over a four-month period (Junethrough September) and the springsemester tuition payment over anotherfour-month period (November throughFebruary). With this plan, students budget the cost of tuition and/or housing, afterdeducting any nancial aid they will bereceiving and/or any payments theyhave made directly to NYU. A nonrefundable enrollment fee of $45.00 is required when applying forthe fall/spring TuitionPay Plan.Students must enroll in both the falland spring plans. Monthly statementswill be mailed by TuitionPay, and allpayments should be made directly toTuitionPay. For additional information,contact TuitionPay at 800-635-0120 or visit the NYU Bursar Web site atwww.nyu.edu/bursar. ARREARS POLICY The University reserves the right todeny registration and withhold allinformation regarding the record ofany student who is in arrears in thepayment of tuition, fees, loans, or othercharges (including charges for housing,dining, or other activities or services)for as long as any arrears remain. DIPLOMA ARREARS POLICY Diplomas of students in arrears will behelduntil their nancial obligations to the University are fullled and theyhave been cleared by the Bursar.Graduates with a diploma hold maycontact the Ofce of the Bursar at 212-998-2806 to clear arrears or to discusstheir nancial status at the University. WITHDRAWAL AND REFUND OF TUITION A refund of tuition will be made by the Ofce of the Bursar after presenta-tion of a withdrawal (Change ofProgram) form signed by a departmen-tal adviser and approved for refund bythe dean of the Graduate School ofArts and Science through GraduateEnrollment Services, provided suchwithdrawal is led within the sched-uled refund period for the term, whichis stated below. Withdrawal does not necessarily entitle the student to arefund of tuition paid or a cancellationof tuition still due. An application for refund may be led in person or by mail and must bemade in writing on the Change ofProgram form, obtainable in thedepartmental ofces of the school. An ofcial withdrawal must be led if a course has been canceled and, inthis case, the student is entitled to arefund of tuition and fees. Ceasing to attend a class does not constitute ofcial withdrawal, nor doesnotication to the instructor. A stoppayment of a check presented fortuition does not constitute withdrawal,and it does not reduce the nancialobligation to the University. The non-returnable registration fee and apenalty fee of $20.00 for a stoppedpayment will be charged in addition toany tuition not canceled. The date on which the Change of Program form is led, not the last date of attendance in class, is considered the of- cial date of the student's withdrawal. It is this date that serves as the basisfor computing any refund granted thestudent. The refund period (see schedule below) is dened as the rst four calen-dar weeks of the term for which theapplication for withdrawal is led. Noapplication led after the fourth weekwill be considered. The processing ofrefunds takes approximately twoweeks. Refund Schedule (fall and spring terms only) This schedule is based on the total applicable charge for tuition excludingnonreturnable fees and deposits. Withdrawal on or before the ofcial opening date of the term 100%(100% of tuition and fees)* Withdrawal on the second day after the ofcial opening date of the term through the end of the rst calendar week 100%(100% of tuition only) The rst calendar week consists of the rst seven (7) calendar days beginning with theofcial opening date of the term. ( Note: notthe rst day of the class meeting.) Withdrawal within the second calendar week from the opening date of the term 70% Withdrawal within the third calendar week from the opening date of the term 55%Withdrawal within the fourth calendar week from the opening date of the term 25% Withdrawal after completion of the fourth calendar week of the term NONE *After the ofcial opening date of the term, the registration and services fee is notreturnable.Note: A student may not withdraw from a class the last three weeks of thefall or spring semester or the last threedays of each summer session. It should be noted that the registration and services fee is not returnable. Exceptions to the published refund schedule may be appealed in writing tothe dean of the Graduate School ofArts and Science through GraduateEnrollment Services and should be sup-ported by appropriate documentationregarding the circumstances that war-rant consideration of an exception,including approval by the departmen-tal director of graduate studies. Students who withdraw should review the \"REFUNDS\" pages on theOfce of the Bursar Web site atwww.nyu.edu/bursar. Federal regulations require adjust- ments reducing nancial aid if a stu-dent withdraws even after the NYUrefund period. Financial aid amountswill be adjusted for students who with-draw through the ninth week of thesemester and have received any federalgrants or loans. This adjustment mayresult in the student's bill not beingfully paid. NYU will bill the studentfor this difference. The student will beresponsible for payment of this billbefore returning to NYU and willremain responsible for payment even ifhe or she does not return to NYU. Any semester during which a stu- dent is charged even a single dollar intuition will be taken into accountwhen calculating the student's progresstoward his or her degree. This mayrequire the student to make up creditsbefore receiving any further aid.Students should review the \"satisfac-tory academic progress\" standard for their program so they do not jeopardize future semesters of aid(www.nyu.edu/nancial.aid/progress_grad.html). 355 FINANCING GRADUATE EDUCATIONServices and Programs 356 SERVICES AND PROGRAMSGraduate School Services andProgramsGraduate Enrollment Services Applicants for admission who seek advice about programs of study at theGraduate School of Arts and Science orwho need assistance with admissionrequirements for specic departmentsmay obtain information and guidancefrom Graduate Enrollment Services,One-half Fifth Avenue.

Through NYU's nity Service students vol-unteer ofnot-for-prot New York City.Some begin their volunteeractivities even before classesbegin in the fall. They are partof NYU's OutReach program. Divided into teams, studentswork with nine different organi-zations. They help out in soupkitchens, visit elderly peoplewith Alzheimer's disease, anddeliver meals to homeboundAIDS patients. E ActivitiesOver 250 students are members of the President's C-Team, donating theirtime to six preschool and after-schoolprograms in the neighborhood.

CHANCE (Concern and Help for the Advancement of Needy Childrenthrough Education) is a national non-prot organization designed to helpinner-city high school students by giv-ing them special tutoring and theopportunity to socialize with collegestudents. Two nights a week, high school students come to NYU for an English lesson, an optional SAT prepa-ration class, and dinner donated by alocal restaurant. Each teenager isassigned an NYU big brother or sisterwho also spends time with him or herapart from the weekly tutoring session. Project SafetyNet is NYU's AmeriCorps program. Volunteers workwith New York City high schools tocreate \"safe harbor\" rooms where stu-dents trained in conflict resolution helpdefuse volatile situations and teachways to solve problems peacefully. AsAmeriCorps volunteers, studentsreceive educational grants in exchangefor their service.NYU students are involved in many other activities on and off campus.They collect canned goods, conduct toydrives, and distribute bag lunches tothe homeless. They work in dropoutprevention programs that encouragehigh school students to stay in school.They renovate houses and make themlivable again. Whether their involve-ment is with the sick, the poor, or thosewho simply need a helping hand, stu-dent volunteers give of themselvesfreely. They all agree that they get backmuch more than they give.University Directory University AdministrationJohn Sexton, B.A., Ph.D., J.D.
