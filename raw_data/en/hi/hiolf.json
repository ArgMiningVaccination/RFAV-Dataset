These components of the natural environment, by their very nature, were considered common property and could not, therefore, be predisposed to being alienated into private owne rship for commercial or other reasons. Res omnium communes (the trust entity) differs from res publica , in that the latter is considered commonly held property which may be alienated to become res privatae by way of a person or persons being granted lawful possession. By way of contrast, res nullius describes that component of the environment that is not owned by anyone \u2014 but may be owned through a person or persons simply taking physical possession of it. In the context of this thesis, an impala would be considered res nullius , but biodiversity (of which the impala is a component) would be considered both res omnium communes and res extra commercium . The public tru st doctrine was codified in the Justinian Institutes of Roman law,1 and was subsequently incorporated into the Magna Carta and became part of English common law by way of the Crown holding land for the benefit of its subjects.2 This led to the public trust doctrine being inherited by those countries that have an Anglo -Saxon -based legal system. In many of these countries the principle has evolved, to varying degrees, to cover a much wider environmental range than originally envisaged. This evolutionary proce ss has included, by way of legal and philosophical argument (e.g. in the United States of America (U.S.) ) 1 Redmond, P., 'The Public Trust in Wildlife: Two Steps Forward, Two Steps Back' (2009) 49 Natural Resources Journal 249, at 250. 2 Conway, T.J., 'National Audubon Society v.

Sax described the doctrine as the 'princip al purpose of government to promote the interests of the general public rather than to redistribute public goods from broad public uses to restricted private benefit ,' 5 arguing that the 'central substantive thought' in public trust litigation is that '[w]hen a state holds a resource which is available for the free use of the general public, a court will look with considerable scepticism upon any government 3 Blumm, M.C., & Guthrie, R.D., Internationalizing the public trust doc trine: Natural law and constitutional and statutory approaches to fulfilling the Saxion vision (2011) UCDL Rev., 45, 741. 4 Blackmore, A., 2017a.

The trusteeship position carries with it the responsibility to look after the environment'.9 While the scope of the public trust doctrine generally is applied to the broader natural environment a nd the cultural heritage therein, it has in some instances been tightly applied to a component of the environment , for instance 'the wildlife trust.'10 In South Africa , for example, reference is made to 6 Joseph L Sax 'The Public Trust Doctrine in Natural Resources Law: Effective Judicial Intervention' (1970) Mich. L. Rev. at 471. 7 Waweru v Republic (2007) AHRLR 149 (KeHC 2006) para 40. 8 Section 2(4)(o) of the National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998. 9 Fuel Retailers Association of Southern Africa v Director -General Environmental Management (2007) . 10 Blumm M.C., and Paulsen A., 'The Public Trust in Wildlife' (2013) Utah Law Review 68 at 1437; Hare, D., Decker, D.J., Smith, C.A., Forstchen A.B., and Jacobson C.A., 'Applying Public Trust Thinking to Wildlife Governance in the United States: Challenge s and Potential Solutions' (2017) Human Dimensions of Wildlife 22(6) at 506. 5 custodianship of minerals ,11 and public trusteeship of water resources ,12 biodiversity13 and protected areas.14 Irrespective of its characterisation and scope , the public trust doctrine has remained wholly unchanged from its Roman origins, this being that the environment (the public trust asset) is inalienable a nd is to be safeguarded in the interests of current and future generations. 1.2 THE SOUTH AFRICAN BIODIVERSITY CONTEXT Land-use change , and the concomitant loss in natural areas , has been ubiquitously recognised as the principle driver in the loss of biodiversity and the extinction of species and habitats.15 Despite this recognition, the rate of loss of global biodiversity remains high and hence un sustainable.16 In addition, the current loss of biodiversity is predicted to be accelerated by the direct and indirect impacts of climate change.17 This observation was mirrored by the findings of Jewitt et al. and others in South Africa. Using the province of KwaZulu -Natal as a 11 Preamble to the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act 28 or 2002. 12 Section 3 of National Water Act 36 of 1998. 13 Section 3 of the National Environmental Management Bi odiversity Act 10 of 2004. 14 Section 3 of the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act 57 of 2003. 15 Souza, D.M., Teixeira, R.F., & Ostermann, O.P., Assessing biodiversity loss due to land use with Life Cycle Assessment: Are we there yet? ( 2015) R.E., Baillie, J.E., Bomhard, B., Brown, C., Bruno, J., & Carpenter, K.E., Global biodiversity: Indicators of recent decli nes cover change in KwaZulu -Natal, South Africa: Implications for biodiversity (2015) South African Journal of Science, 111 (9-10), 1 -9, http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/sajs.2015/20150019 at 1. 16 R.E., Baillie, J.E., Bomhard, B., Brown, C., Bruno, J., & Carpenter, K.E., Global biodiversity: Indicators of recent declines (2010) Science T.M., & Brook, B.W., Predicting and mitigating future biodiversity loss using long -term ecological proxies (2016) Nature Climate Change 6(10), 909 -916, at 910. 6 case study, Jewi tt et al. found that for the period 2005 to 2011, 7.6% of the province's natural habitat had been lost due to 'anthropogenic transformation of the landscape'.18 By 2011, Jewitt et al. observed that a total of 46.4% of the natural landscape had been transfor med. This places the province precariously close to the 50% biodiversity persistence threshold identified by Flather and Bevers \u2014 beyond which there is a rapid decline in the integrity of biological systems.19 Under these circumstances, it is questioned whe ther the natural environment in this province is being sustainably used, conserved, and kept in trust for future generations. While it is recognised that biodiversity is eroded through displacement (i.e. physical transformation) or un sustainable consumpti ve use (i.e. harvesting) , a significant proportion of the land -cover change, either directly or cumulatively, was regulated and hence actively authorised by an official representing the government , or alternatively occurred through non -compliance with Sout h Africa's environmental laws. Given this circumstance, it is understandable why Jewitt et al. concluded that a revision of South Africa's policy and legal environment is urgently required.20 The circumstance, as well as this particular conclusion, is stark when contrasted with the provisions and intent of South Africa's post -1994 environmental law. Furthermore, the explicit embedding of the public trust doctrine into the various statutes comprising this law, highlights the incongruence between what is ubiqu itously understood (at least in those countries that have Anglo -Saxon -based legal systems) as the principle of purpose of the public trust \u2014 and the state of biodiversity conservation in the country. 1.3 THE CONUNDRUM The adoption of the new Constitution in 1996 provided South Africa with the mechanism to explicitly incorporate the public trust doctrine into the country's environmental legislation. These trust provisions have largely gone unnoticed in 18 Jewitt et al. n15 at 1. 19 Flather, C.H., & Bevers, M., Patchy reaction -diffusion and population abundance: The relative importance of habitat amount and arrangement (2002) Am. Nat. 159(1), 40 -56. http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/324120 , quoted in Jewitt et al. n15 at 8. 20 Ibid., n15 at 8. 7 the academic analy sis of the country's environmental legislation, however, and importantly have fundamentally escaped consideration in South Africa's courts. This circumstance has largely persisted for over 20 years, with only three academic legal publications recognising t he existence and significance of the inclusion of the doctrine in South Africa's environmental legislation. Furthermore, many authors have argued or implied that the inclusion of the doctrine in South Africa's environmental law was a direct import from the United States,21 and in particular from the writings on and characterisation of the doctrine by the late Professor Sax.22 Given (a) the prominence of the doctrine in South Africa's environmental law, (b) the doctrine's reputation as being a powerful legal tool to safeguard the natural environment from un sustainable use,23 and (c) the growing concern that South Africa's natural resources, and in particular its biodiversity, are under significant unsustainable pressure from exploitation or land transformation ,24 it is perplexing why such an internationally well understood and influential principle has been 21 See, for example, Sand, P.H. 2014, The concept of Public Trusteeship in the transboundary governance of biodiversity, in: Kotze, L.J., & Marauhn, T. (eds), Transboundary governance (Leiden/Boston: Brill Nijhoff) at 40 and 63; Takacs, D., The Public Trust Doctrine, environmental human rights, and the future of private property (2008) New York University Environmental Law Jo urnal 16 , at 711 and 715; Treves, A., Chapron, J.V., Shoemaker, C., Goeckner, A.R., & Bruskotter, J.T., Predators and the public trust (2017) Biological Reviews , 92(1), 248 -270. 22 Documentaries on the late Professor Sax suggest that his writ ings and arguments on the public trust doctrine played a major role in the incorporation of the doctrine into at least nine countries \u2014 including South Africa and several other African countries. See: Martin, D. 'Joseph Sax, who pioneered environmental law , dies at 78' New York Times (10 March 2014) < https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/11/us/joseph -l-sax-who-pioneered - legal-protections -for-natural -resources -dies-at-78.html?_r=2 > accessed 8 December 2016; Interview with Professor Sax by The Force of Nature: Environmental Elders Speak <http://theforcesofnature .com/movies/joseph -sax-2/> accessed 8 December 2016. 23 Babcock 2009 n 3 at 393; Sax, J.L. 'The Public Trust Doctrine in natural resource law: Effecti ve judicial intervention' (1970) Mich. L. Rev. 68, at 473 and 474. 24 See, generally, Jewitt et al. 2015 n33. 8 overlooked in the interpretation of South African law.25 In view of this conundrum, it is understandable that some authors have described the application of th e public trust provisions in South African law as a 'journey into foreign territory'.26 It is however , questioned, particularly given the accelerated loss of biodiversity described by Jewitt et al. and other authors,27 whether the doctrine is an intractable concept entrenched in Western ideology. It is furthermore questioned whether the doctrine offers little value in the South African environmental context , or is an unknown or misunderstood concept awaiting rediscovery . 1.4 THE RESEARCH QUESTION Drawing on the biodiversity conservation circumstances in Kwa Zulu-Natal province, the approach of this thesis is to unpack this conundrum, and in so doing develop an understanding of the significance, scope and potential application of the public trust doctrine, within the arena of biodiversity conservation in South Africa. The central question that this thesis is framed upon is: What is the nature and scope of the public trust doctrine in South African environmental law, and what is its importance in the conservation of biodiversity in South Africa? This question is posed as an overarching question which is answered by way of an array of subordinate questions, which are posed from the perspectives of theoretical and practical application of the doctrine. These perspect ives are presented in a series of independent chapters that represent a systematic analysis of the theoretical and applied conservation arenas of the doctrine. The chapters therefore strive, both individually and collectively, to provide insights into 25 See, generally, Van der Schyff, E., Unpacking the public trust doctrine: A journey into foreign territory (2010) Regsblad , 13(5), 122 -159; Feris, L., The public trust doctrine and liability for historic water pollution in South Africa (2012) 8 Law Env't & Dev. J. 8, 1. 26 Van der Schyff op cit. 27 Jewitt et al. 2015 n33. 9 answering the central question. The subordinate questions addressed in the thesis are: 1.4.1 Theoretical Framework What is the origin of the public trust doctrine in South African law? How has the doctrine been included in South Africa's Constitution? How has the doctrine been incorporated into South Africa's environmental legislation, and how is the doctrine included in and underpinned vis -\u00e0-vis the country's environmental management principles? How has the public trust doctrine been incorporated into other South African environmental laws (e.g. water, minerals and heritage), and how does this compare to the legislation focused on the regulation of the use of biodiversity? Has the doctrine been solely imported from the United States, bringing with it a 'Saxion' int erpretation of its scope and application, or was the South African legislature influenced by other countries' application of the doctrine? How is the South African public empowered to ensure that the government exercises its fiduciary duties in a manner th at ensures that the public trust is safeguarded? What is the anatomy of the public trust doctrine? Is there a set of criteria that may be used to guide the application or effective use of the doctrine, with respect to safeguarding biodiversity? 1.4.2 Applied Fr amework What is the relationship between the government, the public, users of biodiversity, researchers, and research institutions in upholding the public trust principle? What role could the public trust doctrine play in the development of wildlife use po licy in a developing African country? 10 What is the role and nature of the application of the public trust doctrine, at protected area and species conservation levels? 1.5 SCOPE OF RESEARCH AND METHODOLOGY USED 1.5.1 SCOPE OF RESEARCH This thesis is arranged in two overlapping parts. The first concentrates solely on theory that investigates the potential origins of the public trust in South African environmental law and the legal foundation for its use in environmental decision - making by bureaucrats. The second investigate s the relevance and application of the public trust doctrine in a series of practical case studies. The primary purpose of the case studies, while drawing on the theoretical and legal framework of the doctrine , is to expound on the significance of the doctrine in decision -making within the array of circumstances and challenges facing the conservation of biodiversity. The case studies that were selected strive to highlight this purpose 'semi-hierarchically' within the landscape of South Africa's domestic policy and relevant multilateral agreement frameworks , and protected area and species arenas. 1.5.1.1 Theoretical Analysis Chapter 2 investigates the possible influence of the rooting and evolution of the doctrine within a n African context . As alluded to above, this aspect of public trust theory has not been researched . Its influence on, at least, South Africa's environmental statute law remains uninvestigated . This chapter also tests the assumption that the provisions of the doctrine in this country's statute law were purely an import of the concept f rom an U.S/European context. In so doing this theoretical analysis goes beyond the field of biodiversity conservation and into the domains o f air quality, the coastal zone, culture, mining, waste, and water . In addition to investigating the origin of the doctrine in these domains, this analysis strove to gain insights into the direction its application may take in the future . The application of the public trust doctrine in environmental decision -making by, at least, government officials is operationalised through the provisions of the National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998 , and , in particular , its 11 framework of environmental manageme nt principles .28 The application of the principles, and therein the public trust doctrine, are binding on all organs of state when decisions are taken that may affect the environment. A theoretical analysis of these principles ( Chapter 3 ) is thus paramount to (a) developing an understanding of the role the public trust doctrine plays in environmental decision - making , (b) understanding the complementary role the remaining principles play in achieving sustainable use of the natural environment and therein preserving the public trust entity , and (c) being able to identify those circumstances when the public trust is at risk of being compromised . 1.5.1.2 Case Study Analysis While drawing on a newly encountered potential threat to South Africa's wildlife , Chapter 4 extends the theoretical analysis of the National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998 to consider the provisions that empower the public to hold the South African government accountable for environmental deci sions taken, particularly where the public trust doctrine has not been upheld and the integrity of the country's biodiversity is brought into question. This chapter also examine s both the theoretical and practical public trust roles and responsibilities of the users of biodiversity , as well as those that may be attributed to researchers and research institutions. In so doing, this chapter investigate s the complex legal and practical territory of the public trust doctrine as it applies to the relationship between the government, the public, use rs of biodiversity, and researchers and research instructions. From a biodiversity perspective, protected areas are ultimately set in place to safeguard biodiversity and hence form the core of the biodiversity public trust entity. Despite the status of protected areas , at least in South Africa, being entrenched in law, they are continuously subjected to human -induced treats which, inter alia , may threaten their integrity. Chapters 5 & 6 explore the role the public trust doctrine plays in decision -making aimed at safeguarding an affected protected area. Chapter 5 investigates the role of the doctrine in preventing an activity that is considered unauthorised and incompatible with the purpo se for which the protected area was established . Chapter 6 explores the role of the public 28 Section 2 of the Act. 12 trust doctrine in safeguarding the integrity of a protected area that has been subjected to a natural perturbation result ing in the loss of the flow of a river past a neighbouring community. Unlike Chapter 5, this chapter is set within a R amsar site and on the border with Mozambique, and thus investigates the applicability of the doctrine from the perspective of a multilateral agreement and of South African sovereignt y. The final two case studies (Chapters 7 & 8) focus on the application of the public trust doctrine at a species level. The first, Chapter 7, investigates the role of the doctrine in a circumstance where inter -presidential co -operation between South Africa and its neighbouring subtropical states led to an agreement to exterminate an indigenous species \u2014 the tsetse fly. The second, Chapter 8, focus es on analysing South Africa's norms and standards on the management of elephant , and the relevance to this th esis lies in the separation between government's public sovereign and public trust role , and property ownership. The necessity for the original publications that constitute the body of this thesis to be independent and to be able to stand alone, has naturally resulted in some unfortunate overlap between the chapters . 1.5.2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY The research methodology of this thesis was based primarily on relevant statutes and other subsidiary legislation, policy documents, court judgments, published ar ticles, and global and African multilateral environmental agreements. The thesis is loosely divided into three parts. The first serves as a theoretical analysis (Chapters 2 and 3) of the public trust doctrine. The second (Chapters 4 to 8) is a theoretical analysis of the potential application of the doctrine in a variety of contemporary practical circumstances (case studies) that cover key components of biodiversity conservation, and which include wildlife in general, protected areas and vulnerable species, as well as the legislative frameworks that regulate these. Finally, the third part (Chapter 9) is a framework review of the first and second parts of the thesis. The integrity of biodiversity and protected areas is challenged by an increasing number of po tential threats \u2014 many of which have an unclear or unknown impact 13 on these resources. In applying a cautious approach, decision -makers often discover that their environmental laws are ill -equipped or lack the specificity to (a) significantly constrain new (previously unconceived) potentially harmful uses of biodiversity or (b) safeguard the integrity of protected areas, when challenged. It is under these circumstances that greater reliance may be placed on the public trust doctrine and the concomitant fiduc iary duties that are binding on government. Despite the public trust doctrine being generously catered for in South African legislation, there has been little, if any, meaningful reliance on the doctrine to underpin decisions in relation to protecting the integrity of the country's biodiversity and protected areas. 1.5.3 Methodology \u2014 Chapter 2 The publication \"Rediscovering the Origins and Inclusion of the Public Trust Doctrine in South African Environmental Law: A Speculative Analysis\" (Chapter 2) explores the likely origin of the public trust doctrine in South African environmental law. The aims of this investigation were threefold. The first was to determine whether the South African legislature imported the application and understanding of the do ctrine wholesale into the country's environmental legislation. The second was to determin e whether the inclusion of the doctrine into South Africa's legislation is uniform across the various disciplines comprising the environment. The third aim was to determine whether an investigation into the origins of the doctrine would provide insights into its application , as well as the direction in which it is likely to evolve, at least within South Africa's jurisprudence. In addition to these aims, this chapter see ks to identify any incongruence in the application of the doctrine and its codification between and within the various statutes that constitute South Africa's environmental legislation. Resolving this would provide insights into whether the tenets of the d octrine were universally understood by the drafters of the statutes and the South African legislature on the adoption of such \u2014 and in so doing this will provide further insights into the uniformity (if any) of the doctrine in South Africa's jurisprudence. The methodology followed in this Chapter involved a conceptual analysis of South Africa's environmental legislation, relevant literature and case law, and also various current and outdated multilateral agreements. The prime focus of this analysis was to extract reference s to the public trust doctrine and those provisions 14 providing for the achievement of its princip al purpose. The analysis was interpreted within a contemporary understanding of the doctrine documented in published literature and case histor y. For the latter, while most case history on the doctrine resides in the U.S., particular emphasis was placed on African case history, given the geographical context of South Africa. The point of departure of this chapter is to evaluat e whether South Afri ca hermetically imported the understanding and application of the doctrine from the U.S. \u2014 or whether there is a plausible African or other origin. 1.5.4 Methodology \u2014 Chapter 3 \"The Relationship between the NEMA and the Public Trust Doctrine: The Importance of the NEMA Principles in Safeguarding South Africa's Biodiversity\" is a theoretical analysis of the relationship between South Africa's environmental management principles housed in the National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998 and the public trust doctrine. The nature of the principles are, in the main, fundamental for ensuring that the environment is used sustainably. Included in the array of principles is the principle that characterises the public trust doctrine. The theory behind the nature of t he environmental management principles has not been previously explored \u2014 particularly their synergistic relationship with the doctrine. While organs of the South African government must apply these principles in all decision -making that may affect the en vironment and its biodiversity, the application of the principles is particularly relevant in inter alia the realm of development and land -use change and transformation (a key threat to biodiversity), the evaluation of environmental impact assessments, and consideration of biodiversity offsets. This chapter analyses South Africa's environmental management p rinciples with a view to developing an understanding of their relevance and application within the realm of the public trust doctrine. The chapter further investigates whether the fiduciary trust duties of government are retrospective in terms of making go od previous damage to the biodiversity trust entity. The ultimate purpose of this chapter is to inform and stimulate the critical thinking of bureaucrats making decisions on potential land -use change and development in South Africa . 15 The methodology used to generate this chapter was limited to undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the environmental management principles housed in the National Environmental Management Act ,29 in order to evaluate the extent to which the doctrine, as embraced in the Constituti on of the Republic of South Africa,30 was incorporated into this overarching environmental statute. The methodology also included an assessment of the liability of the South African government, should it fail to fulfil its fiduciary duties to safeguard the environment and its biodiversity. Recognising that there is little South African case law in this field, this chapter included a cursory analysis \u2014 drawing predominantly on case law in the health sector \u2014 of how the courts would likely treat a dereliction of fiducial duties. These analyses naturally included a review of the relevant published legal and environmental literature, as well an assessment of South Africa's environmental policies. 1.5.5 Methodology \u2014 Chapter 4 The point of departure of Chapter 4 is framed around selective and intensive breeding of antelope and predators, and the role of the doctrine in decision -making at species level. Selective and intensive breeding of wildlife has become common on an increasi ng number of private game farms in South Africa. Although the potential direct and indirect negative impacts on the environment and broader wildlife populations are largely unknown, preliminary consideration of this use has raised concern within various co nservation agencies and conservation -orientated non-governmental organisations.31 The paper , \"The Public Trust Doctrine, Research and Responsible Wildlife Management in South Africa\", investigates the relationship between the 29 Act 107 of 1998. 30 Act 108 of 1996. 31 Taylor, A., Lindsey, P.A., Davies -Mostert, H., & Goodman, P. 2015.

The overriding aim of this chapter is a theoretical examin ation and characterisation of the interdependence between the above role -players \u2014 to ensure that the integrity of the public trust entity (wildlife and the natural environment) is not compromised by what is seen by many to be an emerging threat to biodive rsity conservation. In so doing, this chapter extends the analysis and understanding of the public trust doctrine beyond the traditional focus on the role of the government and its decision -making, as the trustee of the trust entity , to the potential role of the public, researchers and research institutions, and the users of biodiversity . The methodology followed in this chapter was primarily focused on an analysis of: (a) South African statutes that have been promulgated to protect and conserve the countr y's environment and its biodiversity, and (b) relevant published literature and case history. This chapter also schematically characteris ed, from a public trust perspective, the dynamic relationship between the government, the private sector, researchers and research institutions, and the users of biodiversity. 1.5.6 Methodology \u2014 Chapters 5 and 6 These chapters are focused on biodiversity conservation at the level of protected areas . Chapter 5 \u2014 'The Interplay between the Public Tru st Doctrine and Biodiversity and Cultural Resource Legislation in South Africa: The Case of the Shembe Church Worship Site in Tembe Elephant Park in KwaZulu -Natal' \u2014 analyses the role the public trust doctrine should play in managing a potential threat to a protected area , which is seated on the actions of people who have a parochial interest outside of conservation. This chapter recognises that protected areas are increasingly being viewed as repositories for activities that may not necessarily be in keepi ng with the purpose for which they were declared. Such human -induced activities, either sing ularly or cumulatively, may present a threat to the integrity of the protected area concerned, and also protected areas in general. The methodology of this chapter involved an analysis of: (a) South Africa's legislation pertaining to biodiversity protected areas and cultural heritage, (b) 17 relevant policies, (c) published literature, (d) pertinent case history, and (e) relevant multilateral environmental agreements t hat pertain to the international boundary separating Tembe Elephant Park from Mozambique. In addition, this chapter unpacks and characterises the public trust doctrine in relation to the need to establish and safeguard protected areas, and in terms of this investigates various models that describe how the integrity of protected areas can be eroded over time. Chapter 6 \u2014 'Legal and Public Trust Considerations for the Ndumo Game Reserve and South Africa -Mozambique border, following the migration of the Usuth u River' \u2014 analyses the role of the public trust doctrine in decisions following a natural disturbance and concomitant threat to the integrity of the protected area. This chapter examines the role and application of the public trust doctrine in decision -making that may arise out of South Africa's environmental legislation, and various Southern African Development Community (SADC) based multilateral agreements set in place to normalise management of trans -boundary water courses and the conservation of biodiv ersity. Given the transboundary circumstance of this practical application of the doctrine, greater emphasis is placed on analysis of relevant global and African multilateral agreements. This analysis incorporates a detailed investigation of the history le ading to the establishment of the international boundary separating Ndumo Game Reserve from Mozambique in the north. In addition, the methodology of this chapter includes analysis of the relevance of the findings of the International Court of Justice on so vereignty, in respect of the migration of a river regarded as the boundary between South Africa and Mozambique. 1.5.7 Methodology \u2014 Chapters 7 and 8 Chapters 7 and 8 analyse the application of the public trust doctrine at a species level.32 Chapter 8 \u2014 'Tsetse Flies Should Remain in Protected Areas in KwaZulu - Natal' \u2014 considers a proposal to eradicate and exterminate this species in South Africa , based on the health and welfare of people and agriculture . This chapter 32 These two chapters were co -authored. While the methodology described in this section of the thesis may apply generically to these chapters , it specifically represents the methodology used by this author. 18 investigates the legality of such an action, a nd the potential consequence of such from a biodiversity impact perspective. From this foundation, the paper evaluates the relevance and role of the public trust doctrine in safeguarding the targeted species and the prevention of the unintended consequence s the eradication of the tsetse flies would have on biodiversity. This investigation analyses both the South African biodiversity and environmental legislation, as well as those (global and African) multilateral environmental agreements that act as potenti al conduits for the South African government to exercise and uphold its fiduciary duties. Chapter 8 \u2014 'Who Owns and is Responsible for the Elephant in the Room? Management Plans for Free -Roaming Elephant in South Africa' \u2014 investigates the South African g overnment's trusteeship role in safeguarding free -ranging, unowned elephant in terms of the application of national norms and standards for the management of elephants. Given that South Africa has a sizeable population of resident free -ranging elephant tha t are not owned by the state or private or communal landowners, or are ephemeral in that they migrate across the country's borders , it is questioned whether the norms and standards apply to these elephant. While analysing the applicability of the norms and standards to unowned elephant populations, this chapter investigates whether , under exceptional circumstances , both or either sovereignty and trusteeship may be extended in to the realm of 'ownership', so enabling the norms and standards to be applied to this sub -population of the country's ephemeral elephant population. The methodology used in drafting this chapter involved a critical review of the 'National Norms and Standards for the Management of Elephants in South Africa' in relation to the National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act33 and the Regulations thereto, and also the Game Theft Act.34 This chapter also includes a review of relevant literature, and an analysis of various current and historical multilateral agreements that were aimed at o r contributed to bringing greater protection to wild African elephant. Relevant case history relating to the ownership of wildlife is also interrogated. 33 Act 10 of 2004. 34 Act 105 of 1991. 19 1.5.8 Methodology \u2014 Chapter 9 The ninth chapter serves as a conclusion to this PhD thesis. This chapter dra ws on the findings of the preceding chapters and therein provides insights into \u2014 if not answers to \u2014 the central question, and summarises the various discussions which emanated from investigating the sub -questions. 1.6 CONCLUSION The answer to the central question of this thesis \u2014 'What is the nature and scope of the public trust doctrine in South African environmental law and what is its importance in the conservation of biodiversity in South Africa?' \u2014 in part lies in the explicit provision of the doctrin e (in various forms ) in South Africa 's environmental law. Its immediate roots are undoubtedly founded in the environmental right in the Bill of Rights of the country's constitution. It is speculated that the ultimate origin of the doctrine is not just a si mple import of Western ideology \u2014 and in particular that fashioned in the U.S. In this, the development of the doctrine in an African context and the influence of this thinking on the South African legislature \u2014 particularly in the biodiversity and protect ed area arenas \u2014 cannot be overlooked. Thus , the recognition of the importance and understanding (and hence application) of the doctrine, may need to consider its African context. While many scholars have argued that the doctrine is the ultimate, powerful tool, it is not infallible in terms of safeguarding biodiversity. The strength of the doctrine lies in government's knowledge of its existence in South African environmental law \u2014 and subsequently it s application in environmental decision - making. In this, during circumstances of a high degree of uncertain ty, particularly when faced with emerging and previously unconceived uses of biodiversity, the public trust doctrine presents as a prevailing counterbalance to parochial and persuasive economic and social arguments. The strength of the doctrine in protecting and safeguarding biodiversity also depends on the public's surveillance role and, with the assistance of the courts, holding the government accountable for unsustainable decisions (or indecisions) taken . Finally, the strength of the doctrine lies in an understanding of what the trust entity constitutes, its conservation status, as well as how a particular consumptive use ( singularly and 20 cumulatively) will impact on the quantity and quality of biodiversit y. In this, the role of research and research institutions is emphasised , as is the need for a framework of probing questions that guide the decision -maker, questioning public or researcher, to ensure that the country's biodiversity is safeguarded over tim e. In order for the power of the doctrine to be realised \u2014 and therein its infallibility avoided \u2014 all these sectors need to be active and operating synergistically. Where such synergy is not in place, the power of the public trust doctrine to safeguard biodiversity cannot be assured. The 'scope' of the public trust doctrine has been effectively defined by its explicit incorporation into South Africa's environmental statutes. In this, the South African government is specifically enjoined to exercise its fiduciary duties to safeguard the integrity of, at least, its natural environment, biodiversity, coastal zone, water, and cultural heritage. The South African legislature, therefore, in promulgating its current environmental laws, has reinforced the notion that the government will resolve what constitutes the public trust entity, and what does not. As a result, not all aspects of the environment, e.g. the electromagnetic spectrum, would be subject to the public trust doctrine in that they are seen to be res publica (that commonly held comp onent of the environment that can be privately owned) and not res omnium communes or res extra commercium (that commonly held component of the environment that cannot be alienated into private ownership). The anatomy of the public trust from a South Africa n perspective is essentially the same as elsewhere, and hence the crux lies in how it is applied to safeguard biodiversity. It is concluded that the 'nature' of the application of the public trust doctrine in South Africa remains an enigma, and that furthe r development and refinement of this jurisprudence is required. Despite its existence in the Constitution and its subsequent inclusion in the statutes that comprise the country's environmental law, there has been little in the way of academic debate \u2014 at least from a biodiversity conservation perspective \u2014 and less reference to its existence in judicial arguments and judgments. This suggests that the nature and application of the doctrine is in its infancy. Likewise, the variable, and, in places, conflictin g wording of the trust -related provisions in a number of South Africa's environmental statutes, suggests that the doctrine and hence the nature of its application was not fully understood by the drafters of the statutes, and 21 certainly not by the legislatur e adopting those statutes into law. The role and importance of the doctrine in South African environmental law and environmental decision -making, is therefore still to be realised. The public trust doctrine in South African environmental law, beyond the ve il of the country's constitution, appears to have multiple bloodlines, which dispels the notion that South Africa hermetically imported the concept from a single source. The interpretation , and hence the nature of the application of the doctrine in South Africa, is likely to be influenced by its heritage, and is thus likely to vary between the disciplines that constitute South Africa's environmental law. Finally, the couching of the ecological reserve in South Africa's National Water Act, as a right of the environment to water, may suggest a direction in which future emphasis or interpretation of the doctrine is likely to be placed. Should this observation hold, the environmental right in the Constitution's Bill of Rights may place the natural environment a nd its biodiversity on an equal footing relative to rights conferred to people. 22 CHAPTER 2: REDISCOVERING THE ORIGINS AND INCLUSION OF THE PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE IN SOUTH AFRICAN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW: A SPECULATIVE ANALYSIS 23 SUBMITTED: Review of European, Comparative & International Environmental Law REDISCOVERING THE ORIGINS AND INCLUSION OF THE PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE IN SOUTH AFRICAN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW: A SPECULATIVE ANALYSIS Andrew Blackmore1 2.1 ABSTRACT The inclusion of the public trust doctrine into South African environmental legislation was seen to be significant as it empowers its citizens to ensure that the government safeguards the country's natural and cultural environment in their and the future g eneration's best interest. This paper examines South Africa's environmental law as a means to derive an understanding of the origins and potential application of the doctrine. While the prima facie origin of the doctrine is the Bill of Rights right in Sout h Africa's 1996 Constitution, multilateral environmental agreements in Africa appear to have had a significant influence on how the doctrine was conceptualised and embraced.

KEY WORDS : Conservation of bio diversity, environmental right, multilateral environmental agreements, Public Trust Doctrine. 2.2 INTRODUCTION South Africa is one of several countries that have incorporated the public trust doctrine directly into its environmental law \u2014 as opposed to relying solely on the common law principle and the interpretation thereof in the courts as has the United States of America, for example.2 The doctrine arose primarily from the Roman common law notion of res omnium communes and res extra commercium where an array of natural resources \u2014 e.g. air, fisheries and waterways \u2014 were essential for trade and hence common to all, and which may not be alienated into private use and thus is insusceptible to being traded. This is distinct from res publica which is commonly held property, but which may be appropriated to become res privatae or res singulorum , or res nullius in which an object belonging to no one, but could be owned by way of possession.3 The doctrine has been succinctly described by the Ken yan Justices Nyamu, Ibrahim and Emukule as the 'State, as trustee, is under a fiduciary duty to deal with the trust property, being the common natural resources, in a manner that is in the interests of the general public'.4 Sax described that doctrine as t he 'principle purpose of government to promote the interests of the general public rather than to redistribute public goods from broad public uses to restricted private benefit'.5 In essence, the doctrine seeks to ensure that the natural and cultural envir onments are beneficially used in the public 2 See, for example, Patrick Redmond, 'The public trust in wildlife: Two steps forward, two steps back' (2009) 49 Natural Resources Journal 249-311. 3 Loretta Feris, 'The Public Trust Doctrine and liability for historic water pollution in South Africa' 8/1 (2012) Law, Environment and Development Journal 3, 5. 4 Waweru v Republic (2007) AHRLR 149 (KeHC 2006) para 40. 5 Joseph L Sax Defending the environment: A strategy for citizen action (Knopf 1970) 165, quoted in Redmond n 2 at 250. 25 interest, and that the integrity of this trust entity remains secure from one generation to the next. This doctrine was incorporated into the Magna Carta and the English common law.6 In so doing, the Crown assum ed the responsibility of holding public property for the benefit of its people.7 Consequently, the public trust doctrine was inherited by countries that adopted an Anglo -Saxon legal system \u2014 as the basis for the protection of the above -mentioned components of the environment. In other countries, particularly the United States8 and to a lesser extent the United Kingdom, the interpretation of the doctrine has evolved through academic debate and various judicial judgments to include biodiversity and other aspe cts of the natural environment. Clarification and application of the public trust doctrine by way of the courts appear to have been a difficult and protracted. In many respects, it has carried a stark uncertainty for the litigant, respondent and ultimately the state (the government as the trustee, and the people as the beneficiaries of the trust entity) in the short to medium term. The unfolding of case law in these countries has, however, defined the 6 T J Conway 'National Audubon Society v.

While this incorporation has been argued to be an effective mechanism to accelerate the applica tion of the doctrine in environmental decision -making in these countries,11 it also embeds \u2014 according to some \u2014 an interpretation that is aligned with Joseph Sax's understanding of the doctrine in a predominantly U.S. context.12 This perception has been bor ne out in the writings of various scholars13 who have suggested that the doctrine was a simple import of the concept into, at least, South Africa's environmental jurisprudence and law from case law in the U.S. and the 'Saxion' understanding thereof. If so, the question arises: why is such a profound environmental principle has been likened to 'a journey into foreign 9 See, generally, Patrick Redmond, 'The public trust in wildlife: Two steps forward, two steps back.

This observation by Van der Schyff suggests, at lea st from a South African perspective, that the application of the doctrine in this country is ambiguous and, hence, challenging. The application of the public trust doctrine in many countries has been observed as being a powerful tool to protect the natural environment from unsustainable exploitation.15 In a country where the natural resources are increasingly coming under pressure through exploitation and transformation of the landscape,16 the effective application of the public trust provisions in South Africa's environmental jurisprudence and law is becoming increasingly important \u2014 if not crucial.17 Confirming the origin of the public trust doctrine in South African environmental law is, therefore, seen as a fundamental step towards an understanding of its n ature and scope of the application. Further from an application perspective, it is equally important to determine whether the application of the doctrine is uniform across the various statutes that constitute South Africa's environmental law \u2014 namely biodi versity and protected areas, the coastal zone, air quality, waste management, water use, and mining and cultural heritage \u2014 or whether the application assumes nuances peculiar to the specific component of environmental law. The origin of the public trust d octrine in South Africa's environmental law is, therefore, seen as being paramount in terms of developing an understanding of its application in this country. Despite this need and the prevalence of the doctrine in South Africa's environmental law, a broad analysis of its potential origin, with 14 Elmarie van der Schyff, 'Unpacking the Public Trust Doctrine: A journey into foreign territory' (2010) 13 PER/PELJ 122-159. 15 Hope M Babcock 'The Public Trust Doctrine: What a tall tale they tell' (2009) 61 S.C.

Likewise, the development of concepts emulating the public trust doctrine in African multilateral environmenta l jurisprudence and its potential influence on South African legal system has also been overlooked. Through analysing the statutes that constitute South Africa's environmental law, together with relevant national policy and international law that may have given rise to or influenced these laws \u2014 this article aims to investigate the probable origin of the public trust doctrine in South Africa's environmental legislation. This is in order to gain a firmer understanding of the nature and scope of its application in South Africa, and to determine why the application doctrine is seen, by some, as being indeter minate and challenging. This understanding is germane to, at least, administrative decisions and legal arguments aimed to safeguarding this country's natural and cultural environments as well as empowering the public to hold government officials to uphold and apply the public trust principles in environmental decision -making. To achieve this, this paper examines the multilateral evolution of the doctrine in Africa and thereafter its entrenchment into South Africa's environmental statute law. 2.3 ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION The National Environmental Management Act18 (NEMA) serves as a framework Act for the regulation of the use of the natural environment and gives rise to specific environmental legislation that regulates biodiversity, protected areas, the coastal z one, waste, and air and water quality. While subject to the provisions of NEMA and the mineral resources and cultural heritage legislation were drafted separately, and hence are considered independent of this Act. For the purposes of completeness, all thes e statutes are considered to comprise the core of South Africa's environmental law. 18 Act 107 of 1998. 29 2.3.1 Framework for Environmental Management Section 24 of the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa19 requires the state 'to have the environment pro tected, for the benefit of present and future generations'.20 This is the foundation for South Africa's environmental civil rights, and the incorporation of the public trust doctrine into the country's environmental legislation.21 NEMA was derived to give ef fect to this environmental right, and further embodies the doctrine by expressly defining it and embedding it in a series of environmental principles.22 This Act states the public trust principle as: 'The environment is held in public trust for the people, the beneficial use of environmental resources must serve the public interest and the environment must be protected as the people's common heritage.'23 The generic environmental management principles, in NEMA, must be considered by the state in all decision s that concern the environment,24 and 19 Act 108 of 1996. He reafter 'the Constitution'. 20 Section 24. 21 See: Andrew Blackmore, 'The relationship between the NEMA and the Public Trust Doctrine: The importance of the NEMA principles in safeguarding South Africa's biodiversity' (2015) 20 SAJELP 89-118; and Andrew Blac kmore, 'Public trust doctrine, research wildlife management in South Africa', Bothalia 47(1), a2217. https://doi.org/10.4102/abc.v47i1.2217. 22 A comprehensive discussion of the public trust doctrine in relation to the environmental principl es is given in Andrew Blackmore, 'The interplay between the Public Trust Doctrine and biodiversity and cultural resource legislation in South Africa: The case of the Shembe Church worship site in Tembe Elephant Park in KwaZulu -Natal' (2014) 10/1 Law, Envir onment and Development Journal 1, <http://www.lead - journal.org/content/14001.pdf>. 23 Section 2(4)(o). 24 Section 2 of the NEMA defines the environment as the 'surroundings within which humans exist and that are made up of - (i) the land, water and atmosphere of the earth; (ii) micro -organisms, plant and animal life; (iii) any part or combination of (i) and (i i) and the interrelationships among and between them; and (iv) the physical, 30 include actions that may arise out of any South African legislation concerning the protection, use or management of the environment.25 The origins of this public trust duty in NEMA may be linked to its founding policy - the White Paper on Environmental Management26 which was has been recorded to have been profoundly influenced by, inter alia , the Brundtland Report,27 the 1992 the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and the Convention on Biological Diversity.28,29 The Report and this international law brought into consideration the pressing need for sustainable development that meets the needs of the present \u2014 without compromising the ability of the environment to service the needs of future generations. This White Paper pursued acceptance and implementation of sustainable development to give effect to environmental sustainability, to secure health and safety of people, and ensure the integrity of both natural and cultural resources.30 In essence, the Brundtland Repo rt, together with these multilateral agreements, reinforced the acceptance of the public trust doctrine into at least South Africa's environmental policy. chemical, aesthetic and cultural properties and conditions of the foregoing that influence human health and well -being; 25 Section 2(1). 26 SA - White Paper on Environmental Managem ent - Policy for South Africa, Ministry of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (1998) at 14, 19, and under 'Custodianship' at 21.

Further to this notion, NEMA replaced the Environment Conservation Act (ECA)31 that included provisions that determined the then environmental policy for South Africa. The ECA attempted to bring into pre -1994 law, relevant global multilateral environmental agreements on the environment to achieve, inter alia , the protection of ecolo gical processes, natural systems and natural beauty \u2014 as well as the preservation of biotic diversity and the promotion of the sustainable utilisation of species and ecosystems.32 The ECA also provides for protection of the environment against disturbance, deterioration, defacement, poisoning, pollution or destruction resulting from the construction of man -made structures and installations, processes or products or human activities,33 all of which stand to threaten and erode the public trust entity. At that t ime, South Africa's isolation and its profound dependence on raw materials meant that the ECA represented a landmark statute for the then apartheid government. This included establishing a national responsibility for the environment,34 but also, while not e xplicitly stated in the Act, represented the earliest statement recognising the state's fiducial responsibility to act as a trustee of the environment on behalf of South Africa's citizens.35 The ECA could, therefore, be seen as the original omnibus establis hing a national environment responsibility, and bringing South Africa's environmental law in line with the then well developed and growing international environmental law. Given the political isolation of South Africa by predominantly southern and central African countries, it is unlikely that the apartheid -aligned legislature drafting the ECA would have specifically considered and incorporated African philosophies over those pertaining to the international (non -African) community. In view of this, 31 Act No 73 of 1989. 32 Section 2(1). 33 Ibid. 34 Following the formation of the Union of South Africa on 31 May 1910 from the Cape Colony, Natal Colony, Transvaal Colony and Orange River Colony, matters pertaining to the environment were exclusively the domain of the newly formed provinces. 35 Du Plessis , 2015 (n 17) at 280. 32 it may b e deduced that the origin of the public trust doctrine in South Africa's law was more likely to have its roots in, or to have been significantly influenced by, the western developed world. From a colonial -African context, as discussed below, elements of th e doctrine may be traced back to the 19th Century and the drafting of the Convention of the Preservation of Wild Animals, Birds and Fish in Africa (the 1900 London Convention) \u2014 in which concern was raised about the loss of key wildlife from the continent. The earliest African reference to the public trust doctrine embracing the broader environment (in addition to wildlife and the establishment of protected areas to conserve wildlife) was the drafting \u2014 by the colonial powers following the First World War \u2014 of the 1933 London Convention: The Convention Relative to the Preservation of Fauna and Flora in their Natural State. While retaining a wildlife and protected area focus, this Convention's trademark (from a public trust -perspective) was the extension of the scope of the trust entity to include 'objects of aesthetic, geological, prehistoric, historical, archaeological, or other scientific interest', which were to be conserved and protected for the 'benefit, advantage, and enjoyment of the general public'.36 The key landmark in the process of setting in place an African approach to biodiversity conservation was the Arusha Manifesto. This Manifesto underpinned the development of the 1968 African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (th e Algiers Convention), which replaced the 1933 London Convention. The Algiers Convention introduced the requirement for states to cooperate to conserve regionally significant biodiversity, and extended this cooperation to include edaphic and hydrological considerations.37 The Algiers Convention broadened the scope and solidified the foundation of the fiducial duty of the signatories to act as a trustee of the entire natural environment, as opposed to a limited focus on wildlife and protected areas. The Algie rs Convention is to be superseded by the (revised) African Convention on Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, which 36 Ibid. 37 See Articles IV and V. 33 was signed in Maputo in 2003 (the Maputo Convention).38 By this stage, South Africa had already incorporated the public trust role i nto its Constitution and environmental statutes. Any influence these African multilateral agreements may have had on South Africa's understanding of the public trust doctrine would thus be limited to the dialog running up to the ratification and implementa tion of the Algiers Convention. Given the significant role the SADC39 countries played in the liberation of South Africa and South Africa adopting the Treaty of the Southern African Development Community in 1994, it is likely that the newly formed democrati c government would have been deeply influenced by the African multilateral environmental agreements and law in place at that time \u2014 as a means to integrate South Africa into the broader African community. Consequently, given the need to be integrated back into at least a Southern African context, it stands to reason that the incorporation of the public trust doctrine into South Africa's environmental law may have been influenced by an African perspective.40 The conjecture that the origins of the doctrine in South Africa were solely as a result of an indiscriminate import from 1500 years of Western and European common law, two centuries of American case law, and the 38 The African Convention on Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, revised 11 July 200 3, is not in force, < http://www.au.int/en/treaties/african -convention - conservation -nature -and-natural -resources -revised -version > (accessed 8 December 2016). 39 Southern African Development Community. 40 Interestingly, other SADC countries have included the Public Trust Doctrine in their respective environmental jurisprudence by way of environmental principles \u2014 which is not overly dissimi lar to those housed in NEMA. For example, it is incorporated in Section 3 (Principles of Environmental Management) of the Namibian Environmental Management Act 7 of 2007, and Section 5 (Environmental Principles) of Swaziland's Environment Management Act 5 of 2002. 34 writings of Professor Sax41 \u2014 as suggested by some scholars in this field42 \u2014 may not be entirely correct. Following the promulgation of NEMA into South African environmental law in 1998, the evolution of the public trust doctrine, in at least the SADC countries, continued. The Maputo Convention retained and enhanced, inter alia , the scope and signif icance of the public trust duties by the state parties.43 These modifications included the requirement of Parties to the Convention to establish, maintain and expand an integrated network of terrestrial and marine protected areas \u2014 to ensure the protection and conservation of biodiversity in the long term.44 A key multilateral statement embracing the public trust doctrine in an African context was the SADC Protocol on Wildlife Conservation and Law Enforcement.45 The aim of this Protocol was to set in place a cooperative foundation for the conservation and sustainable use of wildlife in the SADC region, which not only required each SADC country to apply the public trust principle to its own sovereign, but bound its signatories from 'causing damage 41 Documentaries of the late Professor Sax suggest that his writings and arguments on the public trust doctrine played a major role in the incorporation of the doctrine into at least nine countries \u2014 including South Africa and a number of other Af rican countries. See D Martin 'Joseph Sax, who pioneered environmental law, dies at 78' New York Times (10 March 2014) < https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/11/us/joseph -l-sax- -legal-protections -for-natural -resources interview of Professor Sax by The Force of Nature: Environmental Elders Speak < http://theforcesofnature.com/movies/joseph -sax-2/> accessed 8 December 2016. 42 See, for example, David Takacs 'The Public Trust Doctrine, environmental human rights, and the future of private property' (2008) 16 New York University Environmental Law Journal 711, 715; and generally Sand (n 21). 43 The Maputo Convention was expanded from 'wildlife' to a broader environmental focus, and includes conservation of soil and water. 44 Article XII. 45 Derived from Article 5(1)(g) of the SADC Treaty, and brought into force on 30 November 2003. 35 to the wildli fe resources of other states or in areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction'.46 The Protocol therefore requires each SADC country to have due regard for and to avoid, mitigate, or ameliorate47 impacts that may manifest outside their jurisdiction. In so doing, the Protocol unhinges the public doctrine from being constrained to beneficiary interests of each country's citizens48 \u2014 and applies to a regional or multilateral application of the doctrine. Despite the profound history of the development of a pu blic trust consciousness for the natural environment in Africa, South Africa's White Paper on Environmental Management Policy places substantial emphasis on the relevance of global environmental agreements49 and the Brundtland Report50 \u2014 with meagre if not t acit reference being made to African -based multilateral agreements.51 This imbalance in the founding of the White Paper on the Environment from both a global and African perspective, may suggest a slightly stronger emphasis on a Western comprehension of the public trust doctrine. The environmental policy for South Africa places the public trust (the 'constitutional duty to protect the environment for the benefit of current and future generations of South Africans') under the banner of 'custodianship'.52 In so doing, this policy sets in place a platform for the South African government to take immediate care of, and to maintain and secure its natural environment. 46 Ibid. 47 Following the polluter -pays principle. 48 It appears to be a common notion that the public trust duty is limited to providing protective custody of wildlife for the citizens of each country in isolation \u2014 with little consideration, outside of transboundary pollu tion and climate change, of the trust being applied in a multilateral context. See, for example, John F Organ, Daniel J Decker, Sadie S Stevens, Tanya M Lama and Catherine Doyle -Capitman, 'Public trust principles and trust administration functions in the N orth American model of wildlife conservation: Contributions of human dimensions research', (2014) 19:5 Human Dimensions of Wildlife: An International Journal 407, 410. 49 Ibid., Chapter 2. 50 Brundtland (n 27). 51 White Paper on Environmental Management Policy for South Africa. Government Gazette 1889 Notice 749 OF 1998 at 51 and 61. 52 Ibid., at 18 and 21. 36 It also requires the South African government to manage human -induced impacts on the environment, a nd to ensure that all spheres of government manage the environment in an integrated and coordinated manner.53 The Policy further states that the public trust encompasses the duty to ensure, inter alia, that the: Environmental resources are beneficially use d in the public interest; People's common heritage is protected; and Public's reasonable access to the environment and natural resources is ensured.54 The Policy is, however, silent on the fundamental fiduciary duties that comprise the core of the customa ry law of the public trust. The question as to the nature of the public trust, and how it is applied beyond the above three tenets, remains both unguided and unexplored. The promulgation of NEMA into South African environmental law empowered the South Afri can legislature to adopt additional legislation that regulated the use of specific domains of the country's environment: biodiversity and protected areas,55 the coastal zone,56 air quality,57 and waste management.58 In addition to and independently of NEMA and the specific Acts thereto, the 53 Ibid., at 18. 54 Ibid., at 21. 55 National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act 10 of 2004 (NEM:BA) and National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act 57 of 2003 (NEM:PA) respectively. 56 National Environmental Management: Integrated Coastal Management Act 24 of 2008 (NEM:ICA) . 57 National Environmental Management: Air Quality Act 39 of 2004 (NEM:AQA). 58 National Environmental Management: Waste Act 59 of 2008 (NEM:WA). 37 public trust is also specifically catered for in South Africa's water,59 mineral60 and heritage61 legislation. 2.3.2 Biodiversity and Protected Areas The public trust doctrine is explicitly stated \u2014 in Section 3 of both the NEM:BA and NEM:PA \u2014 to be a means to achieve the environmental right in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution. In many respects, it may thus be argued that this right in the Constitution is effectively the origin of the biodiversity and protected area component of the public trust duties of the South African government. The draft White Paper on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of South Africa's Biodiversity from which these two statutes are derived,62,63 draws on the Convention of Biological Diversity64 as the prevailing international policy. This White Paper is, however, silent on the historical context of the African -generated multilateral agreements that moulded conservation thinking in Africa, and particularly the SADC region in which South Africa is located . This again, if anything, suggests that the application of the public trust doctrine in South Africa's biodiversity legislation may be rooted in a more Western philosophy than an African one. The White Paper on Biodiversity was gazetted for public comment in 1997 \u2014 six years prior to the Maputo Convention and the Wildlife Protocol. However, NEM:BA and NEM:PA were promulgated after the conclusion of these multilateral agreements. Furthermore, these agreements place a fundamental obligation on signatories to adopt and 59 For a discussion on the origins and incorporation of the public trust into the National Water Act 36 of 1998 , see, generally Van der Schyff (n 14). 60 Mineral And Petroleum Resources Development Act 28 of 2002. 61 National Heritage Resources Act 25 of 1999. 62 White Paper on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of South Africa's Biodiversity (1997). Published in GN 1095 GG No.18163, dated 28 July 1997. 63 This White Paper appears not to have progressed beyond the public consultation phase, and hence was not fi nalised prior to the promulgation of the NEM:BA and NEM:PA. Thus, this analysis is limited to the draft version. Hereon, this draft policy is referred to as the 'White Paper.' 64 White Paper on Biodiversity (n 62) Section 1.1.2 at 11. 38 implement their provisions.65 In addition, South Africa actively participated in their drafting.66 It is, therefore, plausible that South Africa had an opportunity to include the provisions of the Maputo Convention and the Protocol into NEM:BA and NEM:PA. Should this be the case, it would explain the striking similarity between the provisions of NEM:PA and NEM:BA, and the Protocol and the Maputo Convention. This, in turn, suggests that there may have been, and certainly a reasonable opportunity for , an African influence with respect to the incorporation of the doctrine into these two statutes. The White Paper on Biodiversity brings to the fore two concepts inherently associated with the application of the public trust doctrine. The first is the con cept of biodiversity being a public heritage asset underpinning the wealth and wellbeing of the country.67 The contextualising of biodiversity, as an object of heritage, entrenches the concept that biodiversity is held in trust and is handed, by tradition, from one generation to the next as an object of intrinsic value. This value, it is argued, transcends those values accrued from genes, species, ecosystems and ecological processes. These heritage values also conceivably include those associated with cultur al and metaphysical attributes created by, inter alia , the viewscapes generated by the complex relationships between biodiversity, geology and topography.68 By associating biodiversity with heritage, the White Paper on Biodiversity brings into consideration a concept of 'sense of place' and other intrinsic or existence values of biodiversity. In so doing, this association opens the door for the inclusion of such concepts into the broader and growing understanding of the public trust doctrine, and the inextri cable link that 'sense of place' and 'existence' values have with the wellbeing (and hence health) of people. This relationship is emphasised in the White Paper, by way of quoting from the inauguration speech of the first democratic president of South Afri ca, Dr Nelson Mandela . In his inaugural speech, Dr Mandela stated that '[e] ach one of us is intimately attached to the soil of this beautiful country. Each time one of us 65 Article IV of the Convention, and Article 7(1) of the Wildlife Protocol. 66 See: Preambles to the Convention and Protocol. 67 White Paper on Biodiversity (n 62) Section 1.2 at 12. 68 Ibid. 39 touches the soil of this land, we feel a sense of personal renewal '.69 Unfortunately t his policy, the White Paper on Biodiversity, is silent on how the conservation and protection of these values of biodiversity are to be effected. Concomitantly, NEM:BA and NEM:PA are also silent on the intrinsic values of biodiversity, together with the me asures which need to be applied to conserve such. The incorporation of these two concepts into the public trust doctrine is seen as a novel concept \u2014 particularly in the eyes of Western/American legal scholars.70 While these scholars argue this is tantamou nt to 'doctrinal creep',71 it may be well placed and acceptable in a country like South Africa where the limits of the application of the doctrine are yet to be defined and tested. In this, the litmus test for South Africa would be whether the interpretatio n and use of the doctrine in this regard would pass constitutional muster, and specifically whether it is in keeping with the provisions of the environmental right in the Bill of Rights. The White Paper on Biodiversity also recognises that previous decisi ons taken by government, allowing, inter alia , unsustainable mining, agriculture and development, have had a negative impact on the country's biodiversity. This policy further recognises the duty of government to make good on these unsustainable decisions, and therein prioritise the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems, the breeding and reintroduction of threatened species, and the promotion of the recovery of these.72 In effect, this policy has embraced the retrospective application of the public trust dut y of government. The duty of government to make good on previous harm has been embraced in the public trust responsibilities built into the principles guiding environmental decision - making in NEMA.73 69 White Paper on Biodiversity (n 62) Section 1. 2 at 15. 70 Hope M Babcock, 'Is using the Public Trust Doctrine to protect public parkland from visual pollution justifiable doctrinal creep?'

See: Hope M Babcock (n23) at 18. 72 White Paper on Biodiversity (n 62) Section 1. 5 at 35. 73 Blackmore (n 21) at 89, 102, 103 and 118. 40 From a colonial -African context, as mentioned above, elem ents of the doctrine may be traced back, by way of a wildlife consciousness, to the 19th Century. At this time, concern was raised about the loss of wildlife as a result of what was termed the 'indiscriminate slaughter' of free -ranging wildlife and the rea lisation that a collective effort was needed to enable the colonial powers to instil a mechanism to protect and sustainably use Africa's wildlife. This concept of empowering the colonies to undertake a 'public trust' approach to African wildlife was codifi ed in the Convention of the Preservation of Wild Animals, Birds and Fish in Africa (the 1900 London Convention). This Convention was aimed at protecting useful or harmless, or rare and endangered wild animal species \u2014 while reducing the density of what was considered 'pest' species.74 This Convention included a prohibition of consumptive use of those species that were considered rare or which were threatened by extinction.75 For the remainder of the 'useful' species, the Convention set in place specific categories of restrictions that would allow certain species to be hunted without challenging the viability of the population concerned. The Convention also introduced and enco uraged the colonial signatories to establish wildlife -protected areas or 'reserves' within which it was to be 'unlawful to hunt, capture, or kill any bird or other wild animal except those which were specially exempted from protection by the local authorit ies'.76 Notwithstanding that the Convention never entered into force, it is seen to be a landmark in raising the awareness of the fact that wildlife was under threat from indiscriminate hunting and habitat loss. This realisation was the foundation for a num ber of signatories enacting domestic legislation that enabled them to perform an active trusteeship role through the implementation of licencing systems to regulate hunting of wildlife, and establishing protected area networks for the protection of free -ranging wild animals. It is thus argued that the 1900 London Convention set in place the foundation for the realisation of the need for, and the incorporation of, the public trust doctrine into African law. 74 Articles II(1), II(13) and II(15) of the Convention. 75 Listed in Schedule I. 76 Article II(5). 41 As mentioned above, the 1900 London Convention was replaced by the 1933 London Convention, with the latter founded on three profoundly important domains.77 The first was the prescribing of the enabling framework and principles for the signatories to undertake, implement and enhance those elements of the pub lic trust duty contemplated in the earlier 1900 Convention. This included the establishment of the 'national park' for the general enjoyment of the public, and also the establishment of 'strict natural reserves.'78 It was the intention of the 1933 Conventio n that these protected areas, and in particular the strict natural reserves, were to function as wildlife refugia in a near pristine natural state. To achieve this, the Convention required the colonial powers to, inter alia , set in place a prohibition (sav e under exceptional circumstances) preventing the alienation of any component of the reserves.79 The Convention represents a confirmation that the state had an inalienable obligation to take into trust and regulate the use of biodiversity for current and future generations. This superseded \u2014 at least within the network of protected areas \u2014 parochial consumptive use (hunting, killing or capturing, or the destruction) of biodiversity.80 Collectively, these hallmarks represented a watershed in African conservati on, in that, in many respects, the Convention negated the need to derive and contextualise the public trust doctrine in case law as it was followed elsewhere. The establishment of African states independent of their colonial masters opened the door for th e conservation of wildlife from an African perspective. Central to this consideration was the Arusha Manifesto of 1961. This Manifesto encapsulated the overriding concern regarding the deterioration of natural resources in Africa, and the understanding tha t this deterioration was undermining the health and wellbeing of people.81 At the launch of the 77 See: Edward I Steinhart, Black poachers, white hunters: A social hi story of hunting in colonial Kenya (Oxford 2006) 180. 78 Article 2(1). 79 Article 2(1). 80 Ibid. 81 G G Watterson An international review of forestry and forest products: The Arusha Conservation Conference Unasylva (1961) 15, 42 Manifesto, the first prime minister of the then Tanganyika (now Tanzania), Julius Nyerere, expressed the critical role and responsibility that the state plays as a trustee of the natural environment. In his opening speech in Arusha, Nyerere declared that: 'The survival of our wildlife is a matter of grave concern to all of us in Africa. These Wild creatures amid the wild places they inhabit are not only important as a source of wonder and inspiration but are an integral part of our natural resources and of our future livelihood and well -being. In accepting the trusteeship of our wildlife, we solemnly declare that we will do everything in our power to make sure that our children's grandchildren will be able to enjoy this rich and precious inheritance. The conservation of wildlife and wild places calls for specialist knowledge, trained manpower and money and we look to other nations to co -operate in this important ta sk \u2014 the success or failure of which not only affects the continent of Africa but the rest of the world as well.'82 In so doing, both Nyerere and, importantly, the Manifesto, made the inextricable link between biodiversity and human health and wellbeing an d the need for the state parties, as the ultimate trustee, to conserve biodiversity for current and future generations. This trusteeship was extended to identifying key areas and habitats for inclusion into a network of protected areas, as well as identify ing and addressing threats to biodiversity and the sustainable use thereof.83 <http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5401e/x5401e06.htm#the arusha conservation conference > accessed on 16 March 2015. 82 Quoted from Conservation of nature and natura l resources in modern African States , IUCN Publications new series No 1, Report of a symposium organized by CCTA and IUCN and held under the auspices of FAO and UNESCO at Arusha, Tanganyika (1961). 83 Ibid. 43 In view of the foregoing, it appears that South Africa was in a position to be influenced by both Western and African derivations of the public trust doctrine. Unfortunately, the country's policies on the environment and biodiversity as well as the African multilateral agreements \u2014 other than the inclusion of sense of place are silent on the scope of the doctrine. It, therefore, remains for robust academic debate and the generatio n of case law to tease out the scope of application of the public trust doctrine in environmental decision -making. 2.3.3 Coastal Zone South Africa inherited from its colonial predecessor the concept of an 'Admiralty Reserve' along a portion of its coastline. Thi s Reserve served as development restriction zone that varied between 120 feet (36 .58 m) and 200 feet wide (60.95 m) inland from the marine high -water mark.84 The intention of the Reserve is unknown and it has been widely speculated that it was to be for mil itary purposes 85 and not necessarily for the general enjoyment of the public. Following the formation of the Republic of South Africa from the Union of South Africa, ownership of the Admiralty Reserve was transferred to the State President. This action eff ectively protected a significant proportion of the South African coastline abutting the high -water mark from privatisation.86 The implementation of the Admiralty Reserve, however, was limited to the 84 Property Law - Admiralty Reserve, Surveyor Gener al Information Report <https://www.lawsoc.co.za/upload/files/sgo_admiraltyreserve.pdf > accessed 2 November 2015. 85 Adam Gunn, 'The Admiralty Reserve and the Coastal Management A ct', Legal Magazine (2009 <http://www.legalcity.net/Index.cfm?fuseaction=MAGAZINE.article&ArticleID=64279 18> accessed on 31 August 2015; J I Glazewski, 'The Ad miralty Reserve - An historical anachronism or a bonus for conservation in the coastal zone' (1986) Acta Juridica 195; and Beverley Ellis, 'White settler impact on the environment of Durban 1845 -1870' in S Dovers, R Edgecombe and B.

Consequently, a significant proportion of the South African coastline could be legally held in private ownership. Further, in a number of instances, for example in the province of KwaZulu -Natal, parts of the Admiralty Reserve and importantly areas traditionally considered 'sea' such as estuaries and lagoons,88 were also alienated.89 By this, it may be reasonable to assume that the Roman, Roman -Dutch or English law prescripts of res publica did not fully apply dur ing South Africa's colonial period and during the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910 and subsequently the Republic of South Africa in 1961. The same may be argued for the import of the Roman concept of the public trust doctrine, in that it may not have been resolutely accepted into South African colonial common law. The arbitrary alienation of the seashore was effectively halted through the promulgation of the Seashore Act in 1935.90 This Act conferred de jure possession of the seashore and the s ea, save any portion thereof, which was lawfully alienated prior to the commencement of the Act \u2014 to the State President of South Africa.91 Van Der Merwe92 and others have argued that such action conferred to the 'general public' the use and enjoyment of thi s land. Within apartheid South Africa, such conclusion could not have been entirely 87 The Cape and Natal were the only provinces that implemented the Admiralty Reserve. See: Hendrik Andries Strydom and N D King (eds), Environmental management in South Africa (Juta and Co 2009) 915. 88 Section 1 of the Sea Shore Act 21 of 1935 deemed the water and bed tidal rivers and lagoons (which estuaries form the majority of) to be part of the sea. Portions of these areas have been alienated into private ownership. 89 For example: Durban City Council v Minister of Agriculture & Another , 1982(2) SA 361(D) confirmed that portions of the Umgeni River Estuary were alienated by freehold title; and the Durban Corporation was granted \u2014 by way of Deed of Grant No. 9792 of 12 November 1920 \u2014 freehold title to the beach -front reserve down to the low -water mark. 90 Act 21 of 1935. 91 Section 2 of the Sea Shore Act (n 88). 92 J van Der Merwe, 'Things' in J A Faris (ed.) The Law of South Africa. Cumulative Supplement Volume 27 (Butterworths 1999) at 843. 45 correct, in that the legal system underpinning apartheid largely excluded the majority of citizens from accessing and enjoying the seashore. This area of the country could not, therefore, meaningfully be considered to be held in trust and in the 'general public's' interest. It was only with the abolishment of apartheid in 1994 and the adoption of the democratically -aligned (interim) Constitution in that year, that the Admira lty Reserve could be considered to be truly public property. Furthermore, the promulgation of the National Environmental Management: Integrated Coastal Management Act93 (NEM:ICMA) resuscitated the coastal zone, and the Admiralty Reserve therein, as 'coastal public property'. This required that coastal public property be held in trust by the state on behalf of all South Africans, including future generations.94 Furthermore, in order to correct the consequence of restricted access and the alienation of the seas hore, NEM:ICMA grants the government the necessary powers to expropriate privately owned land and re -incorporate such into the coastal zone as part of the public trust entity. The aim of such a provision was to remove apartheid -introduced barriers (includi ng private land ownership) preventing all South Africans from having unrestricted access to the seashore and sea. In essence, prior to 1935 the holding of South Africa's seashore in public trust had an uncertain history with only small portions (i.e. Admir alty Reserve) arguably set aside for the public good. The promulgation of the Seashore Act in 1935 did introduce a uniform 'public trust' approach to the country's coastline. Notwithstanding the uncertain origins and application of the trust duties by the South African government along its coastline, the adoption into law of NEM:ICMA in 2008 introduced a stronger application of the public trust duty \u2014 paralleling that of Roman customary law.95 93 Act 24 of 2008. 94 Section 2(d). 95 Joseph L Sax, 'The Public Trust Doctrine in natura l resource law: Effective judicial intervention' (1970) 68 Mich. L. Rev. 471, 485. 46 2.3.4 Air Quality As with the sea and coast, Roman customary law recognised that the air was considered res communis , in that it could not be alienated and is to be held in trust for the public good. The government, therefore, has an independent responsibility to safeguard this resource for the benefit of current and future generations. The public trust is not explicitly stated in NEM:AQA, but does, however, indirectly establish the role of the state as the trustee through restating the environmental right in the Constituti on.96 In this, the primary focus of the Act is the threat of air pollution to the health and wellbeing of people.97 It further reinforces the fundamental link between air quality and the ecological integrity of the natural environment.98 It is thus the fiduci ary duty of the state to apply NEM:AQA in order to safeguard and enhance the quality of ambient air for all people.99 The atmosphere is, however, in many respects dissimilar to other natural resources (e.g. biodiversity and water) in that it cannot be easi ly captured, owned or conserved, or its general use managed.100 It could, therefore be argued that, except for pollution \u2014 and hence the reference to the environmental right in the Act \u2014 the ambient air may fall outside the traditional understanding of a pub lic trust entity. 96 See, generally: Andrew Blackmore, 'The relationship between NEMA and the Public Trust Doctrine' (2015) 20(2) South African Journal of Environmental Law and Policy 89-118; and Andrew Blackmore, 'The Public Trust Doctrine, research and responsible wildlife management in South Africa' (2017) Journal of African Biodiversity Conservation (forthcoming). 97 Preamble to the Act. 98 Section 2. 99 Section 3. 100 Jeff Civins, 'Do states ha ve an independent, fiduciary obligation under the \"Public Trust Doctrine\" to protect air quality and to do so by regulating greenhouse gases (GHGs)?' (2012) American College of Environmental Lawyers blogsite <http://ww w.acoel.org/ > accessed 11 November 2015. 47 A number of scholars of the public trust doctrine have, however, argued that the ambient air, particularly in relation to climate change (in terms of at least CO 2 emissions), falls squarely in the public trust domain.101 While this notion is being tested elsewhere, the scope of the public trust doctrine in South Africa is generally, and particularly, within a climate change context is on the whole \u2014 unexplored and certainly untested. Further to this uncertainty, components of the atmosphere have been 'captured' and thus owned, with the general use regulated \u2014 but are not treated as a traditional public trust entity. For example, the electromagnetic spectrum for communication which is considered a public resource used for public benefit. Comp onents of the spectrum (communication frequencies), however, are stringently licensed to individual parties for their exclusive use. This, in effect, constitutes an alienation of a public resource and thus the electromagnetic spectrum is not treated as ' res communis' (common property that cannot be alienated into private ownership) but rather ' res publica ' \u2014 in which commonly held property can be appropriated into private ownership. This is either res privatae (owned by private persons) or res singulorum (belonging to a single person) for the duration of the communication licence. The application of the licensing system prohibits general access to this public resource.102 Unlike other natural resources where the use is finite, the spectrum is an anomaly in tha t cannot be depleted or degraded through use. It is thus always available in its original form from one user to the next, and from one generation to the next, irrespective of the type and intensity of use. As with ambient air, the spectrum is, however, vul nerable to, inter alia , pollution by electronic machinery or 101 See, for example: An\u00e9l du Plessis, 'Climate change, public trusteeship and the tomorrows of the unborn (2015) 31 South African Journal on Human Rights , 269-293; Tim Eichenberg, Sean Bothwell and Darcy Vaughn, 'Climate change and the Public Trust Doctrine: Using an ancient doctrine to adapt to rising sea levels in San Francisco Bay' (2001) 3 Golden Gate U.

The South African government thus has an obligation to regulate and, in so doing, prevent the pollution of this resourc e for the licensed users \u2014 if not the public's best interest. The relevance of this observation lies in the role government may play in determining which components of the environment are included or excluded, by way of statutory intervention, from the cus tomary public trust law irrespective of the origin of this law. 2.3.5 Waste NEMA also provides for the National Environmental Management: Waste Act 59 of 2008 (NEM:WA). This Act, replacing the waste management sections in the ECA, refers solely to the environme ntal right in the Constitution. The concern of waste (as with pollution in general) is centred on the health risks waste may pose to people. It is thus the government's prima facie responsibility to manage waste in a manner that avoids this risk in both th e short (current generation) and long term (future generations). It is, therefore, questionable whether this duty of government constitutes a fiduciary public trust duty in that a res publica resource is not evidently alienated into private ownership, nor is the quality and quantity of a resource depleted over time at the prejudice of future generations. It is when waste becomes litter or the storage and processing thereof becomes objectionable to society and the sense of place of the natural environment is concomitantly degraded, that it would possibly become a public trust concern. That said, NEM:WA unfortunately provides few insights into the origin of the public trust doctrine in South African law or its scope of application. 2.3.6 Water Quality and Quantity The prime objective of the National Water Act (NWA)103 was to correct the imbalance in access to water and its ownership set in place by the pre - 1994 apartheid government \u2014 by giving effect to the water right in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution. This b eing '[e]veryone has the right to have access 103 Act 36 of 1998. 49 to sufficient water'. The National Policy on water104 re-establishes the common law principle that South Africa's water resources are an indivisible national asset, and that the government is to treat this asset as a public trust entity.105 This policy seeks to set aside the previous dispensation where private ownership of water was achieved through exercising a private riparian right, and where ownership of the water was inextricably tied to the land adjacent to the water body. In addition to a water right for people by way of a 'human needs reserve', this policy also proposes an 'environmental right' in which the natural environment is guaranteed water to 'maintain environmental sustainability'.106 Jointly, the 'huma n needs reserve', and the 'ecological reserve' are defined as the 'environmental reserve'.107 Any volume of water over and above the environmental reserve is considered surplus and may be allocated in a manner that is in the public interest, and which promot es equitable and sustainable economic and social development.108 Interestingly, the ecological reserve appears to confer a direct right to the natural environment as opposed to an implied right by way of promoting the health and wellbeing of people. The imposition of the ecological reserve would not be considered an ab solute right (as that afforded to the human needs reserve), in that the calculation of the water requirements for a water resource would be undertaken progressively based on priority and the availability of funds.109 Such a circumstance is not dissimilar to, for example, the Constitutional derived right to housing which is subject to progressive realisation as and when public resources become available.110 The derivation of the ecological reserve, where necessary, must therefore be undertaken by the state in a proactive and 104 White Paper on a National Water Policy for Sout h Africa (Water Policy). 105 National Water Policy (n 104) at 4. 106 National Water Policy (n 104) at 4. 107 Preamble to Part 3 and the National Water Policy (n 104) at 4 108 National Water Policy (n 104) at 4, and Section 3(2) of the Act. 109 See, generally: E van Wyk, C M Breen, D J Roux, K H Rogers, T Sherwill and B W van Wilgen, 'The Ecological Reserve: Towards a common understanding for river manage ment in South Africa' (2006) 32(3) Water SA 403-409. 110 See, generally: Government of the Republic of South Africa and Others v Grootboom and Others 2001 1 SA 46 (CC). 50 progressive manner to ensure that the minimum requirements of this provision are met for those resources that are under unsustainable pressure from development and commercial use.111 The ecological reserve brings an added dimension to the fidu ciary trust duties to be exercised by the South African government. This is an apparent conferring of a 'right' to natural water resources, in that the ecological reserve recognises an intrinsic value to the environment irrespective of the value of these r esources to humans. Intuitively, this reasoning suggests that that the environmental right in the Constitution may well be bimodal in nature, in that it may be both founded on both an anthropocentric and ecocentric footing in that the protection of the env ironment112 may have equivalent weight to people's 'health or well -being.'113 Should such reasoning hold, it would naturally precipitate a greater emphasis, by the South African government as well as the users of the environment, on the existence, as opposed t o purely a service, value on the natural environment.114 The essence of this conjecture highlights the need for further critical analysis of South Africa's environmental right and its relationship with how this country conserves and protects its natural reso urces. Interestingly, notwithstanding the incorporation of the environmental reserve into the Act as a pre -requisite, the scope of the public trust provided in section 3 of the Act115 does not take into consideration the relationship between the public trus t duties and the ecological reserve. This section limits the scope of the trust duties of the South African government to the benefits of the trust accruing solely to people, and in which environmental values are simply 'promoted'.116 This incongruence betwe en these two provisions of the Act is perplexing as it is inconceivable, taking into consideration its purpose, 111 Ibid., at para 29. 112 Section 24(b) of the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of the Rep ublic of South Africa. 113 Ibid., Section 24(a). 114 See generally Christopher D Stone Should Trees Have Standing?: Law, Morality, and the Environment . (Oxford University Press 2010). 115 Section 3. 116 Section 3(2). 51 that the environmental reserve could be considered to fall outside of a conventional or contemporary understanding of the public trust doctrine. It is thus surmised that insufficient attention was given by the legislature to (re)defining the scope of the public trust in the Act (as seen in section 3) \u2014 to reflect the conferring of a right to the environment by way of the environmental reserve. The author of this article was advised that the attorneys of the then Department of Water met with and solicited the advice of the late Professor Joseph Sax,117 Professor Joseph Dellapenna, and others118 on the content and wording of the NWA. Such discussions re portedly included the role of the public trust and the related natural flow doctrine \u2014 but also included prior appropriation and regulated riparianism.119 Such engagements would enable an import or at least an influence of a Western, and in particular an Ame rican, understanding of these legal doctrines into the NWA. This considered, the incoherence and the concomitant misunderstanding of the public trust doctrine and its application in the Act is puzzling. The discovery of this incongruity underscores the not ion that the scope and application of the public trust doctrine may not have been fully understood by either the drafters of the Act or, ultimately, the legislature adopting the same. Despite this incongruence, there is an obvious overlap of the applicatio n of the doctrine with NEMA, in that the environmental principles housed in the Act apply to decisions taken in terms of the NWA. Notwithstanding this overlap, the NWA extends the potential scope of the doctrine beyond NEMA into the realm an environmental right. 117 Prof. Elmarie van Der Schyff, Mineral and Wa ter Rights \u2014 North West University, South Africa, personal communication (22 November 2016). 118 Prof. Joseph Dellapenna personal communication (22 November 2016), Villanova University School of Law, United States of America. 119 Van Der Schyff and Dellapenna , personal communication (n 117and 118). 52 2.3.7 Mining The Mineral and Petroleum Resource Development Act120 (MPRDA) places the South African government as the custodian of the country's mineral resources.121 Such custodianship is to ensure this common heritage is used in a manner that benefits all citizens of the country, through setting in place a number of regulatory mechanisms for each phase of mining activity.122 The use of the term 'common heritage' may suggest that the mineral resources of the country will be passed intact from one generation to the next, and, as such, these resources are held in trust by the state in a manner not unlike that of biodiversity or cultural heritage artefacts.123 The non -renewable nature of mineral resources understandably diminishes this resource base with each mining operation undertaken. Each successive generation would therefore inherit appreciably fewer mining opportunities than previous generations. The depletion of mineral resources does not, therefore, equate with the traditional understanding of a public trust entity \u2014 in which the quantity and quality of the trust entity is safeguarded from one generation to the next. This concept of custodianship is limited, therefore, to the overseeing role in which access to mineral resources is allocated to the current gene ration in an equitable manner, and, as such, the next generation will inherit only that which remains. Notwithstanding the obligation of the Minster for Mining to ensure sustainable development of South Africa's minerals, the finite nature of minerals rend ers the mining thereof ultimately an unsustainable activity \u2014 and thus minerals cannot be subject to the public trust doctrine. Should, however, the role of custodianship be equated to a public trust duty, such duty cannot 120 Act 28 of 2002. 121 Section 3(1). 122 Section 3(2)(a). 123 See, generally, Andrew Blackmore, 'The interplay between the Public Trust Doctrine and biodiversity and cultural resource legislation in South Africa: The case of the Shembe Church worship site in Tembe Elephant Park in KwaZulu -Natal' (2014) 10/1 Law, Environment and Development Journal 1, < http://www.lead - journal.org/content/ 14001.pdf >. 53 go beyond safeguarding unexploite d minerals for future generations or the natural environment in which the raw minerals occur. The concept of sustainability, therefore, cannot be narrowly applied to mineral resources \u2014 but rather to the maintenance and safeguarding of the environmental tr ust entity when a mining right is executed. It is for this reason, the Minister appointed to the mining portfolio is to ensure that all mining -related decisions are taken within the framework of the national environmental policy124 and the 'no go' option is exercised where there is uncertainty or significant risk to the environment.125 In keeping with this provision, the Mineral and Petroleum Resource Development Act empowers the Minister to 'sterilise' an area of minerals by denying the issuing of prospecting or mining permits in that area.126 These provisions, therefore, would form the foundation for the application of the public trust doctrine in respect to the mining of mineral resources. As such, the nature and scope of the doctrine in the MPRDA would assume that prescribed in NEMA. 2.3.8 Cultural Heritage The use and protection of South Africa's cultural heritage is regulated via the National Heritage Resources Act127 (NHRA). This Act embraces the notion that heritage is to be conserved for the benefit and enjoyment of all the people of South Africa. While this tenet is underpinned by the public trust doctrine, the Act appears to confuse the trusteeship role of the government with that of the beneficiaries. For example, section 5(1)(b)128 appears to conflate the role of the beneficiaries with the role of government as the fiduciary trustee of heritage phenomena \u2014 by assigning such trusteeship role 124 Section 3(2), White Paper: A Minerals and Mining Policy for South Africa (1998) at para 4.3 and 4.4. 125 Ibid., at para 4.4(ii). 126 Section 20. 127 Act 25 of 1999. 128 '[E]very generation has a moral responsibility to act as trustee of the national heritage for succeeding generations and the State has an obligation to manage heritage resources in the interests of all South Africans' (own emphasis). 54 to 'every generation' by way of a 'moral responsibility'.129 The question therefore arises as to whether the transferring of th e role of trustee from the government (the conventional trustee) to the beneficiaries (the people) is in keeping with the concept of the public trust doctrine and the principle of purpose of common law trusts. Notwithstanding this conflation, the state, by way of the South African Heritage Agency and the provincial heritage authorities, retains the powers to regulate the use of heritage resources, and, in so doing, reaffirms the separation of duties and responsibilities between the trustee and the beneficia ries of the trust. Therefore, the legislator's intention of conferring an undefined moral trust responsibility onto the people of South Africa is difficult to understand. Unlike the provision of the environmental reserve in the Water Act, it is uncertain w hether the legislature, in the absence of specific duties associated with moral obligations in the Act, intended to 'expand' or 'modify' the scope of the doctrine with respect to cultural heritage resources in South Africa. Should this be the case, such sp eculation could extend no further than requesting the people of South Africa to conserve and safeguard those potentially important cultural phenomena currently not recognised or regulated by the Act.130 Alternatively, it could be speculated that the Act reco gnises that the people, through the democratic process that sets political leaders and governments in place, are the ultimate trustee of cultural heritage. As such, people have at least a moral obligation, though exercising their newly gained democracy \u2014 to ensure that government exercises its fiduciary duties in a fit and proper manner.131 Be this as it may, the prima facie setting and use of the term 'public trust' within the NHRA is confusing, and 129 See discussion in: Andrew Blackmore, 'The interplay between the Public Trust Doctrine and biodiversi ty and cultural resource legislation in South Africa: The case of the Shembe Church worship site in Tembe Elephant Park in KwaZulu -Natal' (2014) 10/1 Law, Environment and Development Journal 1, 11. 130 See, for example, sections 13 and 24 of the Act. 131 Such interpretation would be in keeping with the sentiments and provisions of the 1955 Freedom Charter adopted by the Congress of the People at Kliptown, Johannesburg, on 25 and 26 June, in which power to govern is vested in the people and the government is set in place to service the people. The 1955 Freedom Charter was one the cornerstone documents that informed development of the Interim and 1996 Constitution. 55 suggests a misunderstanding of the doctrine by the drafter of the Act and the adopting legislature. The NHRA, therefore, provides neither insight into the nature and character of the public trust doctrine within a South African cultural heritage context, nor into the possible origins thereof. The Act is silent on the relationship of its public trust provisions with those in the Constitution. It would thus be conjecture to assume that the Constitution, as with much of South Africa's environmental legislation, was the source of the public trust provisions in the NHRA . 2.4 CONCLUSION The public trust doctrine enjoins the government to exercise its fiduciary duties to ensure that the natural environment is sustainably used \u2014 and in a manner that insures inter and intra -generational equity. As a means to guarantee such, the trust doctrine has been incorporated into various forms in an array of statutes that form the backbone and body of South African environmental law. The rap id loss of natural habitat and concomitant increase in the number of species facing extinction is of growing concern. This loss raises disquiet over whether the public trust doctrine has been overlooked or not fully understood. While the environmental rig ht in the Bill of Rights in the Constitution is the ultimate origin of the doctrine in South African environmental law, analysis of law indicates possible divergent trust ancestries that stand to dispel the notion of a uniform and hermetic import from a We stern, African or other origin, of the doctrine, into the county's law. Although the potential sway of global multilateral agreements and Western centred international soft -law is evident in NEMA, the same cannot be said for the specific environmental legislation this Act provides for. The timing of the drafting of NEMA and NEM:PA allowed for a significant influence of African derived origins of the public trust doctrine. By way of contrast, however, it was discovered that the drafting NWA, at least with re spect to the role of the public trust doctrine in water resource management, had a profound American influence. Analysis of the country's waste and air legislation rendered little information beyond a reference to the environmental right in the Constitutio n. The same was observed in the country's mining and cultural legislation. Finally, the provisions for the 56 management of South Africa's coastal zone in ICMA appear to be more aligned with Roman common law. Despite these observations, an analysis of South Africa's environmental legislation suggests a number of incongruences in the codification of the doctrine. This further entrenches the notion that South Africa did not import, wholesale, the doctrine into its legal system. It would be common cause, therefo re, that each sector of the environment would apply and develop the doctrine in a manner characteristic to that sector. The magnitude in the variation of the codification of the doctrine in the varied environmental legislation is substantial \u2014 particularly when comparing that captured in the NWA and the NHRA. This dissimilarity goes beyond mere distinguishing refinements. This perceived inconsistency between various provisions within and between statutes and the contemporary understanding of the doctrine, may also suggest that the concept was not fully, or consistently understood \u2014 most particularly in the water, mineral and heritage sectors of the environment. This may mean that the journey of unpacking the significance of the doctrine in these sectors may indeed be foreign and troublesome. South Africa's environmental legislation is generally silent on the nature and scope of the South African government's fiduciary duties. The exception, however, is the NWA. By conferring to a natural water resource a rig ht to adequate water to ensure continuance of ecological processes (the ecological reserve), this Act appears to have been very bold in providing possible direction as to the nature and scope of the public trust doctrine. The consequences of conferring thi s right suggest that the environment right in the Bill of Rights may well be bimodal in which equal weight is given to human health and wellbeing and the protection of the environment. In this, a general legal right (in addition to a specific right in the NWA) may be conferred to the elements of the natural environment \u2014 individually and collectively \u2014 based solely on their existence value. Such a conclusion would be naturally subject to further debate and analysis of the country's environmental law. With the increasing pressure being placed on the natural environment through use and physical loss, together with the impacts of climate change, greater emphasis needs to be placed on the provisions of the public trust 57 doctrine in South African environment al law, to ensure that the government proactively exercises its fiduciary duties to safeguard the natural environment. Such emphasis should draw on but not be limited by the origins of the doctrine, in order to achieve the doctrine's ultimate objective: th e protection of the natural environment for enjoyment by current and future generations. 58 CHAPTER 3: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NEMA AND THE PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE: THE IMPORTANCE OF THE NEMA PRINCIPLES IN SAFEGUARDING SOUTH AFRICA'S BIODIVERSITY 59 SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW AND POLICY VOLUME 20 PART 2 OF 2015 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NEMA AND THE PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE: THE IMPORTANCE OF THE NEMA PRINCIPLES IN SAFEGUARDING SOUTH AFRICA'S BIODIVERSITY Andrew Blackmore 3.1 ABSTRACT Land-use transformation and development are seen to make a significant and overriding contribution to the loss of South Africa's biodiversity. The National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998 provides a framework of principles that must be applied to all decision -making that may affect the environment and its biodiversity. An analysis of the environmental principles reveals that application of the public trust doctrine by the government \u2014 to safeguard biodiversity \u2014 is paramount. The application of the doctrine is also retrospective in that the government has a proactive duty to restore that which has previously been lost. This has a significant bearing on regulating negative incidental and cumulative impacts on biodiversity, as well as the consideratio n of biodiversity offsets. The doctrine provides the raison d'\u00eatre for conservation superseding individual rights to destroy biodiversity, as well as to prevent government operating outside the rule of law to achieve parochial or partisan objectives. Final ly, a nine -point test is proposed to ensure biodiversity is safeguarded in environmental decision -making.

This paper forms part of a series of papers forming a PhD which is focused on exploring the significance and scope of the Public Trust Doctrine in the conservation of biodiversity, and the management of protected areas in South Africa.

It places an ever increasing and cumul ative pressure on natural resources and ecosystem services. This pressure arises from two domains that give rise to primary short - to medium -term impacts on biodiversity. The first is the consumptive use of biodiversity (e.g. commercial fishing)1, and the second is the competition for physical space required for development (landscape transformation) that may be required for the conservation of biodiversity. These pressures on biodiversity naturally pressure the ecosystem services that underpin and enhance the health and wellbeing of humanity.2 The realisation of this intrinsic relationship led to the establishment and development of the 'sustainable development paradigm', which made its debut in 'Our Common Future' - a report by the World Commission on Environment and Development, commonly known as the Brundtland report. In this report, sustainable development was defined as a point in the use of natural resources where the 'needs of the present [are met] without compromising the ability of future generation s to meet their own needs.'3 Brundtland further argued that sustainable development 'requires meeting the basic needs of all and extending to all the opportunity to fulfil their aspirations for a better life.'4 This extension is not limited to access to na tural resources and the common interest, but also to mechanisms for the disadvantaged (i.e. the poor and marginalised) to ensure that resources are safeguarded in their 1 J W Henquinet and T Dobson 'The Public Trust Doctrine and Sustainable Ecosystems: A Great Lakes Fisheries Case Study' (2006) 14 NYU Envtl LJ at 322. 2 See, general ly: Millennium Ecosystem Assessment - Ecosystems and Human Well - being: Biodiversity Synthesis (2005); and Peter Bridgewater, R\u00e9gnier Mathieu and Wang Zhen Healthy Planet, Healthy People A Guide to Human Health and Biodiversity (2012). 3 Our Common Futur e, Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, World Commission on Environment and Development at 15.

Although not expressly stated, the application of the public trust doctrine is primarily brought into South Africa's jurisprudence by way of the 'environmental right'6 in section 24 of the Bill of Rights in the country's Constitution.7 This section grants to everyone a right to, inter alia , have the 'environment protected for the benefit of present and future generations through reasonable legislative and other measures', by 'preventing pollution and ecological degradation, promoting conservation', and finally, securing 'ecologically sustainable development and use of natural resources while promoting justifiable economic and social developm ent.' The White Paper forming South Africa's policy on the management of the environment unpacks this environmental right into the duties binding the government to the public trust/environmental custodianship obligation.8 This obligation includes 'the duty to act as custodian of the nation's resources; to protect the public interest in, and to ensure equitable access to, such resources and generally to ensure that all South Africans enjoy an environment of acceptable quality', and to ensure that sustainable development is practiced within all spheres of government.9 This policy formed the foundation on which the National Environmental Management Act10 was drafted to, inter alia, ensure sound and sustainable environmental management decision -making and the ach ievement of the environmental right discussed hereinabove.11 The NEMA achieves this 5 Brundtland n3 at para 27 to 30 and, generally, Chapter 2. 6 This term does not necessarily imply that the 'environment' has rights, but serves , however, to describe a fundamental human right t o have a safe environment. 7 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act 108 of 1996.

Herein referred to as 'NEMA.' 11 Michael Kidd Environmental Law (2008) at 32. 62 objective, in part, through the application of a series of fundamental principles that govern all decisions taken on the environment by any organ of the South African government.12 The NEMA, therefore, reinforces the obvious implication that government is subject to this law and is 'supposed not only to observe [it] in general terms, but to comply meticulously with every constitutional and legal duty imposed on it.'13 Despite this duty, Justice Madala14 in the Nyathi v MEC for Department of Health judgment ,15 observed that an 'assessment of the cases that have dealt with the [application of legislation] and the liability of the government or its negligent actions have revea led that courts have been facing immense challenges in this area of the law.'16 Justice Madala further observed that the government's failure to fulfil its constitutional and legal duties was an increasingly common occurrence.17 In view of this observation , and the plethora of other similar cases cited by Malherbe and Van Eck,18 it stands to reason that principled environmental decision -making is vulnerable to inappropriate application of the law by government and its various decision makers.19 This failure, ge nerally, may be due to instances where the See, also, Fuel Retailers Association of Southern Africa v Director -General Environmental Management, Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Environment, Mpumalanga Province, and Others 2007 (6) SA 4 (CC).

This 'imagined power' may take the form where the government incorrectly believes that it has the authority to act in a certain manner, or where it exercises or assumes mala fide approach to decision - making, knowing that it is operating outside of the rule of law21 or other empowering provision conferred on it.22 Whether a decision was based on a misinterpretation of the law or outside the rule of law,23 such decision may be subject to review, in that the government must act in accordance within the Association and Others v Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism 72/10, 29 Novemb er 2010 (SCA), where the Department of Environmental Affairs was found to have strayed beyond its mandate when making a decision on the hunting of captive - bred lions. Further Couzens and Dent concluded that the competent of government adjudicating the appl ication (and the appeals thereto) to establish the De Hoop Dam on the Olifants River apparently either failed to appropriately apply or failed to consider the environmental principles in NEMA, exceeded their powers in dealing with matters relating to SANPa rks, and were in in breach of various constitutional obligations \u2014 See Couzens E. and M.

The principles also require consistency in their (and therein the doctrine's) application \u2014 so as to strengthen the public's confidence in their use a nd, importantly, to avoid any inconsistency in their employment in decision -making28 and a potential concomitant legal challenge.29 Furthermore, the effective application of the principles and the doctrine therein must be 'cohesive, consistent, and predictab le.'30 The application of the NEMA provides government with almost unlimited authority to regulate the use and destruction of the natural environment by 24 See Bel Porto School Governing Body and Others v Premier, Western Cape, and Another 2002 (3) SA 265 (CC) at para 87. 25 Act 107 of 1998. 26 The Promotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000 broadly defines an administrative decision as whenever government makes or fails a decision that affects a person's rights. 27 Section 2(1). 28 See, for example, Lucas Bento 'Searching for Intergenerati onal Green Solutions: The Relevance of the Public Trust Doctrine to Environmental Preservation' (2009) Common Law Review 11 at 7, available from http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.c fm?abstract_id=1709104 (accessed 1 October 2014). 29 See, generally, Elmarie van der Schyff 'South African natural resources, property rights and public trusteeship: transformation in progress' in D Grinlinton and P Taylor (eds), Property rights and sustain ability: toward a new vision of property (2011). 30 Harry R Bader 'Antaeus and the Public Trust Doctrine: A New Approach to Substantive Environmental Protection in the Common Law' (1992) Boston Collage Environmental Law Review 19 at 759. 65 private interests.31 These regulatory powers (enacted here via the environmental impact -assessment permit ting process)32 were intended to ensure sustainable use of the environment by way of conditions that provide for avoidance, mitigation and amelioration of negative impacts on the environment. At least cumulatively, however, this permitting system has contri buted to the continued destruction of biodiversity,33 threat of ecological bankruptcy,34 as well as contributing to global environmental concerns such as climate change. The public trust doctrine is argued to provide the government with a legal vehicle to no t only recognise that unprincipled decision -making within permitting systems35,36 represents a significant threat to the environment and its biodiversity, but also to continually reassess the cumulative impacts of development and land -use change on the envir onment 31 It is also recogn ised that the South African government may cause significant transformation and destruction to the natural environment for the establishment of state infrastructure.

This is in order to safeguard biodiversity when administrative decisions or actions relating to the environment are taken by government. 3.3 USE OF THE PRINCIPLES IN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND DECISION -MAKING Prior to analysing the environmental principles in the NEMA, an understanding of the context of their application in decision -making is needed. The NEMA mandates all organs of state to apply the p rinciples to their decision - making \u2014 particularly when such affect the environment and its biodiversity.38 The NEMA further requires the relevant organs of state to consider four founding conditions when considering matters that concern the environment.39 The first reinforces the requirement that it is the role of government to, inter alia, protect, promote and fulfil the social rights in Chapter 2 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa,40,41 and with this reinforce achievement of the environmental right discussed above. The second and third conditions create the necessary separation between the application of the principles for general 'environmental management'42 and specific 'decision -making.'43 The former represents the collection of the applicati on of, inter alia , plans and operational 37 Adapted from Robin Kundis Craig 'Adapting to Climate Change: The Potential Role of State Common -Law Public Trust Doctrines' (2010) Vermont Law Review 34 at 781. 38 Section 2 of the Act. 39 Section 2. This section also includes a fifth guiding reference which applies to conciliation which falls outside the scope of this analysis. 40 Section 2(1)(a) of NEMA. 41 Act 108 of 1996. 42 Section 2(1)(b) of NEMA. 43 Section 2(1)(c). 67 frameworks44 that operate at a broad or landscape scale, as well as the accretion of decisions taken by the government on individual aspects of the environment. The recognition by the NEMA of the separation of these two domains implies that the application of the listed principles by the government, is context specific and application or emphasis may vary depending on scale and circumstance. The prediction of the consequences of development or land use changes on biod iversity, requires a recognition that environmental impacts manifest differently at different scales of space and time.45 Confusing the two not only risks generating flawed conclusions \u2014 particularly in cause and effect relationships46 \u2014 but importantly risk s negating the original intent, and hence the effectiveness of the principle to safeguard natural components of the environment, or it could prejudice people's health or wellbeing. It is, therefore, paramount \u2014 as will be seen in the analysis below \u2014 that decision -making does not confuse these two scales when interpreting and applying the principles. The final founding condition ensures that the application of the principles \u2014 both individually and, in particular, collectively \u2014 must serve both the interpre tation and implementation of the Act, and all other legislation that may involve the use and protection of the environment. This condition thus ensures that the public trust duties are applied without limitation and uniformly by organs of state \u2014 in exerci sing any administrative action regarding the environment and its biodiversity.47 The environmental principles, therefore, 44 NEMA provides for an array of decision -making frameworks. For example: environmental implementation plans and management plans in section 11; environmental management cooperation agreements (section 35); environmental management framewor ks, strategic environmental assessments; and environmental risk assessments, norms or standards (see section 24(5)(bA)). 45 Simon A. Levin 'The Problem of Pattern and Scale in Ecology' (1992) Ecology 73(6) at 1943. 46 See, for example, S M Smarta, PA Henrysa , B V Purseb, J M Murphy, M J Baileyd, R H Marrse 'Clarity or confusion? \u2014 Problems in attributing large -scale ecological changes to anthropogenic drivers' (2012) Ecological Indicators 20 at 51. 47 Similar arguments are provided in Elmarie van der Schyff 'S tewardship Doctrines of Public Trust: Has the Eagle of Public Trust landed on South African Soil?' (2013) SALJ at 385. 68 provide a foundation that seeks not to second -guess government decisions, but attempts to ensure that environmental values are appropri ately considered and, where necessary, safeguarded in the decision -making process.48 The NEMA principles serve as a general framework for environmental management,49 and importantly a guide to environmental decision making50 and hence their application is not binding on the state. Generally with respect to guidelines, they are to be used for general guidance within the realm of the state applying and open and unbiased mind to any application that may result in damage to biodiversity. The guideline, therefore, may not be used as 'hard and fast rule when being applied.'51 The corollary, however, is that the guideline ought to be applied in decision making unless there is particular and reasonable circumstances that render its application in appropriate. The NEMA reinforces this approach by prescribing that the environmental principles 'serve as guidelines by reference to which any organ of state must exercise any function when taking any decision in terms of this Act or any statutory provision concerning the protec tion of the environment.'52 Any organ of state undertaking or contemplating a decision that may result in the degradation of the public trust entity (the biodiversity), therefore, must apply all the environmental principles both individually and collectivel y. Only in those exceptional circumstances, however, may a principle be set aside. The setting aside of one or more of the principles would thus be justifiable in terms of those exceptional circumstances. 48 William Araiza 'Democracy, Distrust, and the Public Trust: Process -based Constitutional Theory, the Public Trust Doctrine, and the Sear ch for a Substantive Environmental Value' (2003) Issues in Legal Scholarship 3(1) at 1539, available from http://dx.doi.org/10.2202/1539 -8323.1046 (accessed 12 September 2014). 49 Section 2(1)(b). 50 Section 2(1)(c). 51 Computer Investors Group Inc and Another v Minister of Finance 1979 (1) SA 879 (T) at 898C -E quoted in MEC for Agriculture, Conservation, Environment and Land Affairs , Gauteng v Sasol Oil and Another 368/2004, 16 September 2005 (SCA) at p ara 19. 52 Section 2(1)(c) own emphasis. 69 3.4 THE PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE AND THE NEMA PRINCIPLES 3.4.1 Principle of Public Trust The founding principle of the public trust doctrine within NEMA is encapsulated in: 'The environment is held in public trust for the people, the beneficial use of environmental resources must serve the public interest and the env ironment must be protected as the people's common heritage'.53 Following from the Environmental Right in the Constitution, and in keeping with the provisions of White Paper on Environmental Management,54 this inclusion of the doctrine entrenches into South A frican environmental law the common law duty placed on government that the environment is to be held in trust for all people. Thus, the government \u2014 represented by the various organs of state \u2014 is obligated to act as a trustee and therein ensure that the e nvironment and its biodiversity55,56 are safeguarded by its decisions.57 To achieve this, a thorough understanding of the public trust doctrine is required.58 53 Section 2(4)(o). 54 SA -White Paper on Environmental Management - Policy for South Africa, Ministry of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (1998) at 19, and under 'Custodianship' at 21. Hereon referred to as the 'White Paper'. 55 The environment definition in Section 1 of NEMA embraces the notion that biodiversity, as described in the Convention on Biodiversity, forms corpus of the environment. This premise is also applied by Marry Wood using the terms 'crucial natural assets' and 'nature's trust'. See Mary Christina Wood 'Natur e's Trust: Environmental Law for a New Ecological Age (Cambridge University Press 2013) at 14. Thus, any interpretation of the provisions of this Act must primarily recognise the prominence of biodiversity in environmental decision -making. Given the focus and purpose of this paper, unless expressed otherwise the term 'environment' will be replaced by the term 'biodiversity'. 56 Peter H Sand 'The Concept of Public Trusteeship in the Transboundary Governance of Biodiversity' in Louis J Kotze, Thilo Marauhn (e ds) Transboundary Governance of Biodiversity at 64. 57 Ibid., at 21. 70 The public trust doctrine has its roots the ancient Roman common law, with its origin based on fishe rmen using the seashore to dry their nets. The seashore, therefore, could not become private property as this would deny the fishermen the opportunity to undertake their trade.59 This concept of public property and the rights thereto, was later incorporated into the 'Institutes of Justinian', the body of Roman civil law made by the Roman Emperor Justinian in 530 A.D. These laws stated that rivers and the sea \u2014 and consequently the shores thereof \u2014 were common to all, and that no one was forbidden from approa ching or making use of the seashores and waterways . Thereafter, the doctrine was incorporated into both the Magna Carta and the English common law \u2014 with the Crown, not the people, holding the public property for the benefit of its subjects.60 A contempora ry understanding of the importance of the doctrine is provided in Joseph Sax's seminal article 'The Public Trust Doctrine in Natural Resource Law: Effective Judicial Intervention.' This describes the public trust doctrine as the legal foundation for the pr otection of natural resources (biodiversity), by arguing that the 'central substantive thought' in public trust litigation is '[w]hen a state holds a resource which is available for the free use of the general public, a court will look with considerable sc epticism upon any government conduct which is calculated either to reallocate that resource to more restricted uses or 58 The case law emanating from U.S. state and federal courts and the associated academic arguments, provide particular insights into the nature and scope of the public trust doctrine in biodiversity conservation. These formed, in part, the foundation that provided for the inclusion of the doctrine into the South Africa's jurisprudence, and in the absence of domestic case law, therefore, guidance on the application of the doctrine may be drawn from such. 59 Shari M Blecher and Shawn M La Tourette 'Environmenta l Law: Whose Beach Is It, Anyway?

Envtl Aff L Rev 19 at 749 -751. 71 to subject public uses to the self -interest of private parties.'61 Sax further reasoned that the public trusteeship rests upon three relat ed principles. First, 'those certain [environmental] interests [...] have such importance to the citizenry as a whole that it would be unwise to make them the subject of private ownership. Second, that 'they [the public] partake so much of the bounty of nature, rather than of individual enterprise, that they should be made freely available to the entire citizenry without regard to economic status.' And, finally, 'that it is a principle purpose of government to promote the interests of the general public rat her than to redistribute public goods from broad public uses to restricted private benefit.'62 Simply expressed, the doctrine requires that natural resources \u2014 irrespective of their ownership \u2014 are considered as part of an inalienable public trust of which the government (and in particular certain designated authorities therein) is the public trustee on behalf of every citizen \u2014 to protect those resources. Furthermore, each citizen \u2014 as the beneficiary of the trust \u2014 may invoke its terms to hold the trustees accountable and petition the courts to prevent damages or to obtain compensation.63 The public trust doctrine is thus an intrinsic 'legal receptacle for the government's long - term duty [...] to manage and perpetuate the public enjoyment of natural resources'64 \u2014 ensuring that the natural environment flourishes and continues to flourish as a healthy and diverse human habitat.65 The application of the doctrine is, therefore, perpetual. It thus not only requires precaution ary or 61 Joseph L Sax 'The Public Trust Doctrine in Natural Resources Law: Effective Judicial Intervention' (1970) Mich L Rev at 471. 62 Joseph L Sax Defending the Environment: A Strategy for Citizen Action (1970) at 165. 63 R D Sagarin and M Turnipseed 'The Public Trust Doctrine: Where Ecology Meets Natural Resources Manage ment' (2012) Annual Review of Environment and Resources 37 at 474. 64 Peter Manus 'To Candidates in Search of an Environmental Theme: The Public Trust' (2000) Stanford Environmental Law Journal 19 at 322. 65 Peter Manus 'To a Candidate in Search of an Enviro nmental Theme: Promote the Public Trust' (2000) 19 Stan. Envtl L J at 319. 72 preventative measures66 to protect biodiversity67 and the benefits to people, but also requires remedial measures that need to be employed where past behaviour or decision -making has disregarded the trust obligation.68,69 The cornerstone of the doctrine thus rests on the authority of the government to exercise continuous control over the natural resources which are subject to the trust70 \u2014 to ensure that, on behalf of current and future generations, they are not degraded and if they are damaged, they are restored. Thus, this principle not only provides for public right to use and enjoy the public trust entity (jus publicum ), but also expressly obligates government to prevent any individual or minority group from unsustainably exploiting the environment (th e people's common heritage or communes ) for private profit or exclusive benefit. Furthermore, the government may convey or grant jus privatum to private owners, but this private right is subservient to res omnium communes71 \u2014 which is the government's inali enable role to safeguard biodiversity. The trust obligations enshrined in trusteeship cannot be alienated or relinquished.72 66 See the White Paper on Environmental Management Policy (n8) at 70. 67 Loretta Feris, 'The Public Trust Doctrine and Liability for Historic Water Pollution in South Africa Law' (2012) Environment and Development Journal at 6. 68 Manus ibid (n65) at 318. 69 The White Paper on Environmental Management (n8) recognises that the post -1994 South African public have inherited a legacy of environmental degradation and pollution (p. 62), and th at redress and rehabilitation is required to repair the negative consequences of previous sustainable use (p. 34). 70 Patrick Redmond 'The Public Trust in Wildlife: Two Steps Forward, Two Steps Back' (2009) Natural Resources Journal 49 at 264. 71 As opposed to res publica which commonly held property but may be appropriated to become res privatae or res singulorum. 72 The concept of the inability of the government to relinquish trusteeship of the natural environment has its English roots in the case of Gann v Free Fishers of Whitstable, House of Lords , 3 March 1865, 11 E.R. 1305 11 H.L (Cas) 192, which held that navigable rivers and estuaries and seashore was vested in the Crown. See: Patricia Kameri -Mbote 'The use of the Public Trust Doctrine in Environmental Law' (2007) Law, Environment and Development Journal at 198. Later, the Supreme Court case of Illinois Central Railroad v. Illinois, 146 U.S. 387, 453, 13 S Ct 110 (1892) decided that the Illinois legislature did not have the power to transfer title of the shore and lakebed of 73 The government, therefore, has a fiduciary duty to uphold the common law trust principles, as a trustee of the trust objects (biodiv ersity) \u2014 for the public (the beneficiaries). Thus the government must act in the best interest of the trust to ensure the objects of the trust remain protected over space (intra - generational interests) and time (inter -generational interests).73 In acting a s the trustee, the government is obligated to compare environmental conditions before and after a proposed administrative action or an environmental -related decision is taken \u2014 to ensure, where feasible, that there is no -net loss in the integrity of biodiv ersity.74 In this, a distinction needs to be drawn between what is vested in in the rights of the landowner and the rights retained by the government to ensure use of the trust objects is undertaken in a sustainable manner. It stands to reason that whilst b iodiversity may be in 'private ownership' this ownership is not absolute in that the owner is obligated to obtain permission to undertake certain activities that may result in significant damage to biodiversity. It is for this reason that permission is req uired from government, giving the latter an opportunity to exercise its fiduciary duty and therein ensure that biodiversity and the public interest therein is safeguarded.75 Lake Michigan and that the state had the obligation to preserve the resources subject to the trust for use by the public. See, generally Redmond op cit (n70). 73 Michael C Blumm and Mary Christina Wood (eds) The public trust doctrine i n environmental and natural resources law (2013) at 3. 74 It is recognised that circumstances may arise where development or landuse transformation is in the overriding economic interests of the state, and the granting thereof may unavoidably harm the publi c trust. In these singular cases, the government has an affirmative duty to consider the effect the decision may have on, and wherever feasible safeguard, the public trust entity. See Redmond (n70) at 265 - 266. 75 See for example the requirement for environm ental authorisations in Chapter 5 of NEMA, and permit requirements to undertake various activities in terms of the National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act 10 of 2004. 74 3.5 NEMA PRINCIPLES EMBRACING THE PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE Environmental management must place people and their needs at the forefront of its concern, and serve their physical, psychological, developmental, cultural and social interests equitably.76 This principle not only embraces the anthropogenic persuasion of the Constitution, but also emph asises the focus of broad -scale or holistic management (through both environmental planning and cumulative decision - making) on the health and wellbeing of people. It further requires that environmental management must consider people's physical, psychologi cal, developmental, cultural and social interests equally, and without bias. In so doing, this principle embraces the foundation of the public trust doctrine, in that the environment is held in trust by the government for all people. It would thus be inapp ropriate for the government to narrowly apply this principle solely to the needs of an individual, organisation or a limited group of people \u2014 at the expense of any component of biodiversity (the trust entity) or the basic needs and aspirations of people f or a better life77 in the broader society. The preamble to the NEMA provides for the Act to be applied in a manner that serves both present and future generations. It thus follows that use of the term 'people' in its general form in this principle, embrace s both present and future generations and in therein brings to the fore inter - and intra - generational equity in decision -making. Inter -generational applies the notion that access to natural resources is balanced between current and future members of societ y. Decision -making by government must, therefore, strive to achieve a reasonable balance between satisfying current people's needs and ensuring that sufficient biodiversity resources remain to provide for \u2014 potentially greater \u2014 future needs.78 Furthermore, members of society are likely to have similar, and potentially competing, needs which are required to be taken into account by government. Thus, spatial access to natural resources 76 Section 2(2) of Act 107 of 1998. 77 Brundtland n3 at para 27. 78 See, generally, Edith Brown Weiss 'In Fairness to Future Generations and Sustainable Development' (1992) American University International Law Review 8 at 19 -26. 75 must be just and equitable among the present society. In this, a person or a select group should not be afforded a right that may prejudice other's rights to fair enjoyment of that resource.79 This principle, as with the other principles in the NEMA, therefore, purposefully places a constraint on a person's perceived right to dev elopment \u2014 so as to ensure that both current and future needs of people are not compromised. Development must be socially, environmentally and economically sustainable.80 This principle sets in place the 'three pillars' that comprise sustainability.81 Any development that is considered must ensure that all three pillars remain 79 Fuel Retailers v Director -General Environmental Management, Department of Agriculture, Cons ervation and Environment (n11) at 51 \u2014 citing Alan Boyle and David Freestone (eds) International Law and Sustainable Development: Past Achievements and Future Challenges (1999) at 8 -16. 80 Section 2(3) of NEMA. 81 It is recognised that the 'three pillars' approach to sustainably has been heavily criticised in the literature because the pillars are not equal. For example, the 'environment' is the physical reality on which all life, and hence all use (economics) depends. Furthermore, economics is, in reality, a subset of the social dimension.* Thus, in this theoretical construct, emphasis would naturally be placed on conserving the environment, and thus by employing the three -pillar model, the status of the environmen t is either reduced or compromised. Further, concerns arise from an unequal treatment of the three pillars. For example, economic arguments often tend to be more convincing, particularly within a decision -making or political context \u2014 than an environmental argument. In this, Winter** argues that 'prevailing short -term economic or social interests' are likely to be held with greater gravity in decision - making, even if they would be detrimental to the environment and ultimately detrimental to both society and the economy in the medium - to long -term. Whilst these concerns are relevant in understanding sustainable development and the shortfalls of the three -pillar approach, they fall outside the scope of this analysis. * See, for example: David Griggs, Mark Sta fford-Smith, Owen Gaffney, Noble 'Supplementary information to: Sustainable development goals for people and planet' (2013) Nature 495, 305 -307. 76 unchallenged. Thus, the objective principle is to ensure that one dimension or pillar is not prejudiced or over emphasised when the government is concerned or considering potenti al damage to biodiversity; the pillars are thus to be treated equally in decision -making. Drawing on the notion that that sustainability is measured against avoiding impacts manifesting in the environment or if this cannot be achieved, following mitigatio n and remediation, it is common cause that all three pillars cannot be 'trimmed'82 to provide for a specific development \u2014 particularly where such development would continue to have significant,83 though less, impact on biodiversity. This principle, and ther ein the doctrine, also dispels the notion that the environment could be significantly compromised in favour of a ** Se e G Winter 'A Fundament and Two Pillars: The Concept of sustainable development 20 years after the Brundtland Report' in H Bugge and C Voigt (eds) Sustainable Development in International and National Law (2008), cited in L.A.

In such circumstance, it is not inconceivable that a 'developer' may initially motivate for a significantly more substantial development and then concede or compromise to a highly desirable, but furtive position. Such a compromise may not necessarily ensure that the development is sustainable and may place biodiversity at risk. In such circumstances, or where there is uncertainty, the proposed activity would result in significant damage to biodiversity, and the government is required to exerci se the cautious or risk -averse principle and favour safeguarding trust entity over any potential economic or social gains. 83 The terms 'significant', 'serious' or 'irreversible harm' are interrelated but have been reflected as separate considerations in bo th the literature and European and African legislation, and several judicial challenges.* The threat of significant or irreversible harm to biodiversity should bring to the fore the consideration of the fiducial public trust duties as well as (as Trouwbors t argues) precautionary or risk -averse considerations in decision -making. For the purposes of this paper, 'significant' will encompass serious or irreversible harm to biodiversity. * Arie Trouwborst 'Precautionary Rights and Duties of States', Nova et Vete ra Iuris Gentium (2006) at 56. 77 parochial economic interest or the person wanting to damage the biodiversity for a 'national' or 'partisan' interest. This notion was reinforce d in the Fuel Retailers Association of Southern Africa v Director -General Environmental Management, Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Environment, Mpumalanga Province where Justice Ngcobo stated that the concept of 'sustainable development will e nsure that socio -economic developments remain firmly attached to their ecological roots and these roots are protected and nurtured so that they may support future socio -economic developments.'84 Correspondingly, therefore, where development or land transfo rmation involves significant impacts on important species, habitats or ecosystem services,85,86 the overriding reasons for public interest should be in favour of the environment (and therein public health and wellbeing).87 Where no such 84 Fuel Retailers v Director -General Environmental Management, Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Environment n11 at para 57. 85 The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment defines ecosystem services as 'the benefits people de rive from ecosystems'. See www.maweb.org (accessed on 1 October 2014). 86 Important components of biodiversity with respect to the public trust doctrine, are those that may be adversely impacted on by development and lan d transformation, and include Red List taxa in threatened or conservation -concern categories* and the equivalent being applied to ecosystems and vegetation types; locally threatened taxa, and taxa cannot adequately conserved; animal taxa that may underg o behavioural changes, benchmark taxa and ecosystems donating environmental health; and any ecosystem services that provide for the health and wellbeing of people and the environment. * See IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria Version 3.1, 2nd ED (2012). 87 This notion was tested in two founding cases. The first was the Californian 'Mono Lake decision' which 'is widely viewed as a seminal public trust doctrine case and as an environmental law classic'*. Here, at the turn of the century, the Los Angeles Department of Water Supply formulated plans for the Los Angeles Aqueduct, which deprived the Mono and Owens Lakes of water supply. In 1989 a California Supreme Court judge ordered the halt to all diversions until the environmental impacts were reversed and th e ecosystems had recovered. The second case was the Lafarge Redland Aggregates Ltd in the Harris Superquarry at Lingerbay - Western Isles Island, Scotland.** The Lafarge proposal was to establish a quarry to generate an estimated 78 components of biodiver sity are present, the government could consider reasons of economic or a social nature.88 The organ of state, therefore, adjudicating any application in which mitigation and remediation fails to clearly counterbalance or adequately compensate for the destru ction of significant biodiversity, may not have the administrative power to grant such application in favour of the social, economic or other considerations. Further to this argument, there is a shift in international understanding away from conservation o f biodiversity being an inconsiderable resource and a competitor to economic and social growth \u2014 to one of biodiversity being recognised as the inextricable foundation of social and economic growth and wellbeing.89 It stands to reason, therefore, that conse rvation of biodiversity \u2014 and where appropriate restoration \u2014 is vital in order to provide for and promote social and economic growth. Finally, this principle places a duty on government to ensure that all development and land transformation, both individu ally and cumulatively, is sustainable. It is thus conceivable that this principle \u2014 given the dependence of social and economic growth on biodiversity90 \u2014 places a retrospective duty on government to make good those previous decisions (or indecisions) that have resulted in harm to biodiversity to ensure the overall achievement of 550 million tonnes of igne ous rock (anorthosite) for construction aggregate over a period of 60 years. Here the Scottish Ministers overturned a previous authorisation on the grounds that the superlative natural environmental qualities of Lingerbay far outweighed the transient socia l or economic benefits of national importance. In so doing this established support for arguments for expanded reliance on retaining the 'environment pillar' of sustainability and the public trust doctrine in environmental decision -making. 88 Christopher R odgers 'Planning and Nature Conservation: Law in service of biodiversity?' in Chris Mille (ed) Planning and Environmental Protection: A Review of Law and Policy (2001) at 113. 89 See, generally, Walter V. Reid and Jos\u00e9 Sarukh\u00e1n Millennium Ecosystem Assessme nt: Ecosystems and Human Well -being: Biodiversity Synthesis (2005). 90 Department of Environmental Affairs People -Planet -Prosperity: A National Framework for Sustainable Development in South Africa (2008) at 15. 79 sustainable use and no -net loss of biodiversity. The notion of the retrospective application of the public trust doctrine is discussed in detail below. The disturbance of ecosystems and loss of biological diversity are avoided, or, where they cannot be altogether avoided, are minimised and remedied.91 This principle forms one of the founding principles that entrenches the public trust obligation \u2014 and therein all decisions regarding the use and protection of biodiversity. Here, the government is precluded from applying a laissez -faire approach to biodiversity in that this principle requires the government to actively engage in the anticipation of p otential disturbance to biodiversity \u2014 as opposed to purely reacting to events as they emerge. The purpose of this principle sets in place the platform for the environmental impact -assessment process, to ensure that damage to biodiversity occurs only under exceptional circumstances; that is, disturbance and loss are to be avoided. In those exceptional circumstances where the disturbance or loss cannot be avoided, the government must ensure that the disturbance or loss is managed to a minimum.92 As a general rule, the more serious or significant the impact on biodiversity, and therein the people's rights to have it protected, the more persuasive or compelling the justification by the proponent of the damage, must be. 93 Finally, this principle recognises that a residual disturbance or loss \u2014 which may persist post mitigation \u2014 must be remedied. Remediation is not defined in the Act and thus the common meaning of the term prevails. It embodies the notion of 'making good' or 'counteracting or eliminating'94 the res idual damage or loss of biodiversity. This principle thus provides for the concept of a 'no -net loss' of biodiversity to ensure that the status and wellbeing of the public trust entity is retained, while providing for physical development or transformation 91 Section 2(4)(a)( i) of Act 107 of 1998. 92 This forms the basis for the mitigation required in the environmental impact - assessment procedures contemplated in Chapter 3 of the Act. 93 S v Manamela and others 2000 3 SA 1 (CC) 1 at para 33, where Justices Madala, Sachs and Yacoob JJ dealt with the pro tection people's rights. 94 Oxford Dictionary of English , Third Edition (2010). 80 of the natural environment.95 It stands to reason, therefore, that in circumstances where significant degradation and loss of biodiversity has taken place, it remains government's duty to make good that degradation or loss from the trust entity. It further stands to reason that residual impacts are ongoing, and thus it is conceivable application of this principle in terms of the public trust doctrine is retrospective and hence would need to be applied to historical damage. Here, disturbance of ecosystems an d loss of biological diversity as a result of the state's previous decisions (or indecision) would need to be remedied in order to restore the trust objects that have been lost or eroded.96 The same argument applies to future potential impacts, particularly where the disturbance has taken place but the residual impact on biodiversity remains to become fully apparent \u2014 as is the case with climate change, landscape transformation and fragmentation and pollution. These impacts are seen to be emerging as the key long-term threats to biodiversity and human health and wellbeing.97 95 'No-net loss [...] refers to the point where biodiversity gains from targeted conservation activities match the losses of biodiversity due to the impacts of a specific developme nt project, so that there is no -net reduction overall in the type, amount and condition (or quality) of biodiversity over space and time - No-net Loss and Loss Gain Calculations in Biodiversity Offsets - Resource Paper , (2012) http://bbop.forest trends.org at 2. 96 See, for example, Jewitt Op. cit. (n33). Here Jewitt demonstrates a progressive loss in natural land cover (surrogate for biodiversity and ecosystems) in KwaZulu -Natal, a province of South Africa, and concludes that 22% of the province will remain in a natural state in 2050, with connectivity, persistence and fragmentation thresholds. These thresholds ultimately determine the status of biodiversity and whether, in this case, the province will be facing accelerated habitat and species extinction. 97 Barbara Lausche, David Farrier, Jonathan Verschuuren, Antonio G M Lavia, Arie Trouwborst, Charles -Hubert Born, Lawrence Aug The legal aspects of Connectivity in Conservation.

This principle requires the government to ensure that the right to exploit a non -renewable resour ce is granted in a fair and impartial manner. The timeless and non -spatial manner in which this principle is phrased, ensures that the responsible use of these resources must be fairly distributed over space and time. Thus, it is paramount that future gene rations \u2014 in keeping with the public trust doctrine and the intentions of the White Paper on the Environment99 \u2014 should be afforded an equal or reasonable access to these resources as did the foregoing generation. Furthermore, this principle requires the go vernment to reasonably understand the full significance of the impact on the environment and the health and wellbeing of current and future generations. This is so that these consequences can be taken into account when determining whether it is in the publ ic's (as the beneficiaries of the trust) best interest and to ensure that the use is spatially and temporally equitable. Failure to do so by the government, or a person responsible for the exploitation, would be considered negligent100 and in conflict with t his principle and the doctrine as a whole. While this principle traditionally refers to mineral resources,101 it may include other natural resources that may be limiting within the context for which a 98 Section 2(4)(a)( v) of NEMA. 99 See n69. 100 See, for example, Harmony Gold Mining Company Ltd v Regional Director: Free State Department of Wat er Affairs and Others 68161/2008 29 June 2012 (FS). 101 The term 'non -renewable resources' is not defined in NEMA. Section 2 of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act 28 of 2002 defines minerals as 'any substance, whether in solid, liquid or gas eous form, occurring naturally in or on the earth or in or under water and which was formed by or subjected to a geological process, and includes sand, stone, rock, gravel, clay, soil and any mineral occurring in residue stockpiles or in residue deposits, but excludes - (a) water, other than water taken from land or sea for the extraction of any mineral from such water; (b) 82 decision by the government is required. Although biodiver sity is generally considered a renewable resource, there are components that do not comply with this supposition. In particular, those resources that are threatened or approaching extinction (see Figure 1) , are in themselves unique and hence irreplaceable.102,103 These resources, therefore, could be considered as 'non - renewable resources' in that the depletion would not be easily reversed, mitigated or remedied. As such, any consideration of consumptive use would unquestionably risk being unsustainable and in d irect conflict with the mandate of the government's fiduciary duty to safeguard the country's biodiversity.104 The development, use and exploitation of renewable resources and the ecosystems of which they are part do not exceed the level beyond which their integrity is jeopardised.105 This principle recognises that the ability of the environment to absorb the impacts of human activities, is finite.106 Should human pressures (exploitation), petroleum; or (c) peat'. The term is also commonly defined as a resource that is 'existing in finite quantity; not capable of being repl enished' ( The Oxford dictionary www.oxforddictionaries.com , accessed 29 January 2014). 102 This concept is also in line with section 5(a) of the National Heritage Resources Act 25 of 1999, which describes cul tural heritage as non -renewable and irreplaceable. 103 The characterisation of threatened biodiversity elements as non -renewable resources is new, and is only recently being considered for limited biological elements and products \u2014 for example, the harvesting of coral. See, for example, Terms of Reference for the IUCN Working Group on Extractive Industries and Biodiversity (see http://cmsdata.iucn.org , accessed 29 January 2014). 104 An economic analysis by Helm and Hepburn* rendered a similar conclusion, with increasing rarity of biodiversity through consumptive loss, in that the economic models used to describe natural wealth produced similar outcomes as those employed (for example, cost benefit analyses) for characterising the use of non -renewable resources. *See, generally, Dieter Helm and Cameron Hepburn 'The economic analysis of biodiversity: an assessment' (2012) Oxford Review of Economic Policy 28(1). Van der Schyff Op. cit. (n 47) at 387. 105 Section 2(4) a)(vi) of NEMA. 106 Brundtland strangely confounded the finite capacity of the environment to 'absorb the effects of human activities' with the 'limitations imposed by the present state of technology' \u2014 to minimise those effects (Br undtland n 3 at para 27). In so doing, 83 therefore, approach the absorptive ability of the natural environment, th e integrity of that system would be placed in jeopardy. The challenge this principle poses to government is to: (a) safely identify what those tipping points are in a dynamic or changing natural environment, and (b) to determine whether the proposed exploi tation either singularly or cumulatively (when viewed together with the residual impacts of other developments or uses) approach or exceed the tipping -point between sustainable and unsustainable use. A further challenge is that the effect of the transgress ion could be sudden and dramatic (i.e. within the lifetime of the proposed development) or, importantly, and from a cumulative perspective, could be gradual, so creating the inappropriate perception that the use was benign and with insignificant residual i mpacts on biodiversity.107 The existence of this progressive and gradual change in biodiversity not only risks being 'easy to deny or ignore',108 but also risks being exploited for arbitrary or partisan reasons or for convenience decision -making following a pa th of least political, social or administrative conflict. From a trust entity and the NEMA principles perspective, it is argued that it is a requirement of government to 'do everything [reasonably] necessary' to conserve and protect biodiversity as oppose d to simply avoiding significant Brundtland created the impression that the environmental capacity to absorb human impacts is limitless. Lee, however, reasoned that this conclusion was an incorrect interpretation of Brundtland's intent. Lee further stated that Brundtland's limitless statement should be interpreted to mean that the impacts of humans 'imposed by the present state of technology on environmental resources are relative, but that the ability of the biosphere to absorb the effects of human activities is absolute'.* *Keekok Lee 'Global Sustainable Development: Its intellectual roots' in Keekok Lee, Desmond McNeill, Alan Holland (eds) Global Sustainable Development in the Twenty - first Century (2000) at 41. 107 Terry P Hughes, Cristina Linares, Vasilis Dakos, Ingrid A van de Leemput and Egbert H van Nes 'Living dangerously on borrowed time during slow, unrecognized regime shifts' (2013) Trends Ecol Evol 28 at 149. 108 Ibid. at 151. 84 threats to biodiversity by 'stopping short of species extinction.'109 The identification of and safeguarding against traversing the sustainable -use threshold or tipping point (also characterised as a Limit to Acceptable Chang e)110 is, therefore, fundamental to applying this principle and therein the public trust doctrine. The LAC thus represents the tipping point or threshold that \u2014 once exceeded \u2014 would result in deterioration of that natural entity.111 For example, a LAC for a s pecies would be the minimum number required to ensure a viable population and below which the species would spiral into extinction. Once the limit is approached, the species or ecosystem would be considered to be 'critically endangered' (Figure 1).112 109 Redmond Op. cit.

The change in state may thus result in a change in the ecological, social and economic values of the system. *D J Roux, P L Kempster, C J Kleynhans, H R van Vliet and H H du Preez ' Integrating stressor and response monitoring into a resource -based water -quality assessment framework' (1999) Environmental Ma nagement 23 at 25; L Godfrey and C Todd 'Defining thresholds for freshwater sustainability indicators wit hin the context of South African water resource management ', Presentation to the 2nd WARFA/Waternet Symposium: Integrated Water Resources Management: Theory, Practice, Cases, Cape Town (2001) at 2. 112 Amanda Driver, Kristal Maze, Mathieu Rouget, Amanda T Lo mbard, Jeanne Nel, Jane K Turpie, Richard M Cowling, Philip Desmet, Peter Goodman, Jean Harris, Zuziwe 85 The i dentification of the LAC is often vexed by limitations in the understanding of absorptive capacity of ecosystems complexed with, for example, the uncertainty of the stochasticy of the natural dynamics of the environment,113 cumulative impacts, seasonal varia tion, catastrophic events, and accelerated climate change. This principle must therefore be applied in conjunction with the 'risk averse' principle discussed below. 114 This may be achieved by setting in place a 'Threshold of Potential Concern' (TPC)115 which is considered to be an early warning sign that unacceptable environmental change or use is being approached.116 This 'threshold' would be considered commensurate to the sustainable use threshold. TPCs are thus specified limits of ecological change which shou ld not be indiscriminately exceeded (Figure 1) , and may be based on \u2014 either singularly or a combination: the availability of both scientific data and subjective policy criteria; a degree of professional judgement; an understanding of processes, systems an d cycles; identification of specific resources within the system; understanding of the rate of recovery of the system or the reversibility of the disturbance; or an understanding of the extent or significance of environmental impacts on a system.117 In the absence of the above, TPCs may be cautiously set \u2014 by government as the trustee \u2014 using best available knowledge and following conventional Jonas, Belinda Reyers, Kerry Sink, Taniia Strauss 'National Biodiversity Assessment 2004: priorities for biodiversity conservation in South Africa' (2005 ) Strelitzia 17 at 14. 113 See, generally: Leadley, Pereira, R Alkemade, J F Fernandez P W Scharlemann, M J Walpole 'Biodiversity Scenarios: Projections of 21st century change in biodiversity and associated ecosystem services' Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (2010) Montreal Technical Series no. 50. 114 See Point VI below. Herein, this sustainable use threshold or tipping point is referred to as a 'TPC'. 115 See, for example, Max A Moritz, Matthew D Hurteau, Kat harine N Suding, Carla M.

Ibid., at 98. 117 Godfrey op cit., n111 at 2. 86 reasoning. In setting a TPC, the uncertainty emanating from unpredictable ecosystem dynamics, or the absence of imperial information, is overcome. Figure 1: A diagrammatic characterisation of the relationship between a Sustainable Use Threshold (Threshold of Potential Concern or TPC) and Limits of Acceptable Change (LAC). In striving to achieve this principle, decision -making by government should be made only within either an empirical context or a cautious framework118 \u2014 within which TPCs are set and the impacts of the decision on the natural system is monitored. It is, therefore, incumbent on governme nt \u2014 in order to fulfil the requirement of this principle and the public trust duties therein \u2014 to adopt cautious but reasonable TPCs.119 As a TPC is approached, the government may (a) limit further loss of biodiversity on the grounds of continued uncertaint y or the emergence of supportive evidence that the TPC was appropriately set, (b) revise the TPC to a stricter position and set in place a concomitant rehabilitation 118 Such c aution is exercised in accordance with the risk -averse and cautious -approach principle which is discussed hereunder at listed item VI. 119 Justices Madala, Sachs and Yacoob JJ concurred* that there was no absolute standard for determining reasonableness, but such has to be guided by the key factors that need to be considered as to whether the limitation is reasonable and justifiable in compliance with Section 36(1) of the Constitution. See S v Manamela and Another (Director -General of Justice Intervening) 2000 (5) BCLR 491 (CC) at paras 32 and 33. 87 and restoration programme,120 or (c) adjust the TPC where it is found to be overly conservat ive and where the cumulative use or damage to the biodiversity is deemed to be negligible and the person wishing to further damage biodiversity is able to reliably demonstrate that there remains sufficient ecological capacity for this, and that the trust e ntity will remain intact in accordance with the trust doctrine.121 That a risk -averse and cautious approach is applied, which takes into account the limits of current knowledge about the consequences of decisions and actions.122 The risk -averse and cautious a pproach principle introduces the precautionary principle to environmental decision -making. The purpose of this principle is to anticipate and prevent environmental harm123 when there is a significant degree of uncertainty regarding the potential impact on bi odiversity. The origin of this principle is rooted in the 1972 Declaration of the UN Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm Declaration), and, in particular, within the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development124 and 120 A similar route was followed for the Mediterranean coastline to curb and reverse the impacts accruing adversely from, inter alia , poorly planned mass -tourism development. This revision of the TPC (if not a LAC) inv olved setting in place appropriate legislation to bring about the necessary reversal of the impacts on biodiversity and the broader environment. See, generally, Council of Europe - Parliamentary Assembly Report - Erosion of the Mediterranean coastline: imp lications for tourism, Document 9981 of 16 October 2003. 121 Such revision of the TPC is expected to be commensurate with an iterative adaptive management approach which is traditionally applied to biodiversity use and management (particularly where there is uncertainty) over geographical scales (TPC may vary in respect to other edaphic variables) and time.

(n83) at 37. 124 Principle 15. 88 the Convention on Biologica l Diversity \u2014 both of which formed the foundation on which the NEMA Principles were based. Subsequently, the precautionary principle has been applied in differing political and legal contexts, and has been moulded to be context specific. As a result, the p rinciple has taken on slightly different meanings \u2014 each giving a slightly different emphasis to a particular aspect of the principle. They all, however, provide for a cautious approach in a context of uncertainty.125 For the purposes of this paper, the defi nition within the preamble to the Convention on Biodiversity \u2014 namely 'Noting also that where there is significant reduction or loss of biodiversity, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minim ise such threat' \u2014 is used. In the instance where there is the potential of significant harm to the environment, the government must ensure that precautionary or risk -averse measures are applied in decision -making.126 Within this scenario, the decision may v ary from restricted use that would rely on monitoring the impacts \u2014 to delaying the action by way of moratoria127 or a 'no go' or 'no destruction of biodiversity' option.128 The core concept of the risk -averse principle may be viewed as an instrument to deter the government from favouring a presumption which favours the development and erosion of biodiversity, where there is an absence of clear evidence of, or investigation into, its impacts.129 125 See, generally, Chapter 2 of Rajendra Ramlogan 'Sustainable Development: Towards a Judicial Interpretation' (Martinus Nijhoff 2011). 126 See Justice J Murphy HTF Developers ( Pty) Ltd v Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism , 2006 (5) SA 512 (T) at para 16, quoted in T homas v Head of the Department of Agriculture Conservation Environment & Tourism North West Province and Others ; M J Thomas t/a Elandskraal Garage v Gouvei a and Others 27858/2006, 36972/2006 24 October 2007 (GPHC) 242, 392 (T) at 71. 127 Anne Ingeborg Myhr and Terje Traavik 'The Precautionary Principle: Scientific uncertainty and omitted research in the context of GMO use and release' (2002) Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics 15 at 73. 128 White Paper on Environmental Management - Policy for South Africa (n8) at 24. 129 Rosie Cooney 'The Precautionary Principle in Biodiversity Conservation and Natural Resource Management: An issues paper for po licy-makers, researchers and practitioners' (2004) IUCN Policy and Global Change Series 2 at ix. 89 Two key elements are fundamental to the risk -averse or precautionary approach to decision -making. The first is the expression of need to anticipate significant harm at the threshold of decision -making. At this threshold \u2014 in keeping with the long -established rule of the common law on the burden of proof \u2014 the onus lies wit h the proponent of the activity that advocates destruction of the trust entity, to demonstrate negligible harm will arise.130 It is not, however, the duty of the public or the government to demonstrate the likelihood of harm to the trust entity. In other wor ds, the onus is on the proponents to prove that an activity is safe \u2014 rather than for its opponents to prove that it is unsafe. This approach to decision -making empowers the government, as a trustee, to ensure that at least the biodiversity trust entity is safeguarded, and that such fiducial duty is not weakened through a lack of understanding of the consequence of the decision taken. Where there is insufficient evidence that the impacts of an activity would not harm the trust entity, this principle empower s the government to assume a risk -averse or precautionary approach and to refuse the application. To exercise the risk - averse approach, the government, however, requires 'anticipatory, forward - 130 The notion that the burden of proof is inextricably associated with the principle of precaution has received an extraordinary amount of attention from academ ics, jurists and the like. See, for example: Andrew Jordan and Timothy O'Riordan 'The precautionary principle: a legal and policy history' in Marco Martuzzi and Joel A Tickner (eds) The precautionary principle: protecting public health, the environment and the future of our children (World Health Organization 2004) at 57; Michael Blumm and Rachel Guthrie 'Internationalizing the Public Trust Doctrine: Natural Law and Constitutional and Statutory Approaches to Fulfilling the Saxion Vision (2012) 45 U.C.

Arie Trouwborst, however, in chapter 8 of 'Precautionary Rights and Duties of States', Nova et Vetera Iuris Gentium Series 25 (2006) highlights that this link, although widely accepted, may not be explicit in all uses and interpretations of the principle. In the South African context, the principle when read with the polluter -pays principle (see section 28 of NEMA) ensures the burden of proof is placed on the proponent of the activity. 90 looking action rather than reactive impeding of progress.'131 In keeping with its fiduciary duty, the government is required to exercise an 'affirmative duty'132 in respect of harm in general,133 and not necessarily limited to considering serious or irreversible harm.134 This observation, as discussed above, is particularly relevant to natural complex systems where there is a high degree of uncertainty as to the consequence of the impacts \u2014 when thresholds are 131 J A Tickner, D Kriebel and S Wright 'A compass for health: rethinking precaution and its role in science and public health' International Journal of E pidemiology 32 489 - 492, quoted in Neil Peace 'Public health and the precautionary principle' at 58, in Marco Martuzzi and Joel A Tickner (eds) The precautionary principle: protecting public health, the environment and the future of our children (2004). 132 Many scholars of the public trust doctrine, both in South Africa and abroad, have drawn on and reinforced this finding of Justice Broussard with Justices Bird, Mosk, Kaus and Reynoso concurring in the Mono Lake case \u2014 that the government has 'an affirmative duty to take the public trust into account [...] and to protect public trust uses whenever feasible'.* See, for example: Elmarie van Der Schyff, 'Unpacking the Public Trust Doctrine: A Journey into Foreign Territory' (2010) 41 PER/PELJ (13)5 at 19; Michael C.

As a tr ustee of the natural environment and the biodiversity therein, this principle mandates the government to investigate and understand the potential negative impacts on the environment \u2014 which will enable them to be able to reasonably foresee the consequences thereof and set in place suitable measures to prevent the impacts taking place. Should the harm to the natural environment not be avoidable \u2014 either spatially or temporally or through the application of alternative methods \u2014 it is incumbent on the governm ent to ensure that impacts are investigated to determine whether they may be reasonably managed to an absolute minimum.139 In 135 A P Kinzig, P Ryan, M Etienne, H Allison, T Elmqvist and B H Walker 'Resilience and regime shifts: assessing cascading effects' (2006) Ecology and Society 11 at and B H Walker, S R Carpenter, J Rockstrom, A S Cr\u00e9pin, an d G D Peterson 'Drivers, \"slow\" variables, \"fast\" variables, shocks, and resilience' (2012) Ecology and Society 17(3) at 30, available from http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ES -05063 -170330 (accessed September 2014). 136A Dan Tarlock 'Defending the Environment: A Strategy for Citizen Action, by Joseph L.

Sax 'The Public Trust Doctrine in Natural Resource Law: Effective Judicial Intervention (1970) 6 8 Mich L Rev . 471 at 49. 137 The notion that the South African government is required to exercise a burden of justification is underscored by section 5 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000, in which the organ of state is required to provi de adequate reasons for the administrative action (the decision) taken. 138 Section 2(4)(a)( viii) of NEMA. 139 It stands to reason that in order for the state to anticipate potential harm to the environment, two conditions must be in place. The first is that t he state must have 92 accordance with the doctrine, this principle mandates the government to ensure that the residual harm is repaired and that the trust entity be returned to its original state; this being a 'no -net loss' in the integrity of biodiversity. Should this not be possible, or where there is a reasonable risk that this outcome would not be achieved within a reasonable timeframe or in the foresee able future, the disturbance should be considered unsustainable and the application to damage the environment should be declined. The enduring nature of this principle codifies the intent of the legislature to entrench not only the prevention and minimisat ion of future harm, but also, in accordance with the trust duties, the principle to remedy significant harm to biodiversity which may have occurred prior to the promulgation of the NEMA \u2014 or where residual or recent harm cannot be ascribed to a perpetrator .140 This principle \u2014 in giving a legislative effect to the public trust doctrine \u2014 has significant ramifications for remedying of damage to biodiversity and ensuring a continued no -net loss in the integrity of the trust entity \u2014 irrespective of when the dam age was inflicted. Thus, for example, when determining a biodiversity offset for a proposed development or land transformation,141 the target which the offset is to achieve142 may not necessarily be equivalent to the prevailing biological status of the landsca pe to be disturbed. In cases where there has previously been significant degradation of the biodiversity \u2014 resulting in a loss of species, ecosystem integrity or ecosystem services \u2014 the sufficient competence to interpret information provided, and the second being that the person or entity intending to carry out an activity which could potentially harm the environment, must, in accordance with the 'polluter pays principl e', provide the necessary specialist information in order for the potential harm to be considered. 140 This being any 'person who causes, has caused or may cause [...] significant degradation of the environment (S 28(1) of NEMA). Further, the retrospective remediation of environmental harm in this principle is prescribed in S 28(1A) of NEMA. 141 A biodiversity offset is defined as the 'conservation actions intended to compensate for the residual, unavoidable harm to biodiversity caused by development projects, so as to ensure \"no -net loss\" of biodiversity', quoted in K Ten Kate, J Bishop, and R Bayon Biodiversity offsets: Views, experience, and the business case (2004) at 13. 142 This target is often referred to as a 'baseline' or 'reference point'. See, generally, Ten Kate ibid. 93 offset target should be determined or based on the pristine or near p ristine state of that landscape. It is recognised that it may be unreasonable, however, for the proponent to assume responsibility for previous impacts which the proponent had not caused. Such impacts, in accordance with section 28 of the NEMA, remain the responsibility of the person who caused degradation of the environment. Should the circumstance be such that this responsibility cannot be assigned, the responsibility of remediation naturally reverts back to the government as the biodiversity trustee. The failure to consider residual damage from the proposed offset, risks foreclosing on making good historical damage to biodiversity. It would be, thus, inappropriate for government, as the trustee, to authorise a biodiversity offset which negates reimbursing or compensating the trust entity for the loss. This approach would not only negate the risk of a no-net loss in biodiversity resulting from the proposed development, but would also ensure a continued restoration of the trust entity for use by current and future generations. Sensitive, vulnerable, highly dynamic or stressed ecosystems, such as coastal shores, estuaries, wetlands, and similar systems require specific attention in management and planning procedures, especially where they are subject to significant human resource usage and development pressure .143 This principle requires the government to recognise that the sensitivity of the environment varies both spatially across the landscape, and temporally. In so doing, this principle sets in place the req uirement for the government not only to consider objectively each potential impact within its circumstance, but also to put in place pre -emptive or proactive management or planning measures to avoid or limit impacts within particularly sensitive areas.144 This principle specifically recognises that some ecosystems are (a) particularly sensitive to use and human disturbance as their recovery may extend beyond 143 Section 2(4)(r) of Act 107 of 1998. 144 For example, this requirement was confirmed by J Erasmus in SA Shore Angling Association v Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism 63/02 25 April 2002 (ECHC), where the need to protect the biod iversity on beaches and surrounding areas from impacts of off -road vehicles, was stated. 94 the foreseeable future or if at all, (b) utilised for their goods and services145 or are preferential ly targeted by humans rendering then vulnerable to transformation,146 and (c) variable or dynamic in their nature \u2014 which renders the consequence of impacts difficult to predict. This principle further recognises that certain ecological systems may have an e levated sensitivity to particular uses or disturbances, resulting in rapid undesirable change which in turn renders timely intervention difficult.147 In such circumstances, a particularly cautious threshold of concern (Figure 1) would be required. The signif icance of this principle \u2014 from a public trust doctrine perspective \u2014 places a focused responsibility (and therein accountability) on government to not only a priori identify those ecosystems and habitats that may be sensitive and vulnerable to human use, but also to apply a cautious and risk - averse approach to their use.148 3.6 DISCUSSION In consolidating the public trust doctrine and human rights to form the environmental right in South Africa's Bill of Rights, it has been argued that South Africa effectively merged 1 500 years of common law with two centuries of \u2014 predominantly American \u2014 case law ,149 as well as century of consideration and reinforcement of the need for the then Colonial Rulers and subsequently 145 For example, the desirability of marine and beach viewscapes in the tourism and residential industry renders the dune cordon vulnerable to transformation. 146 For exa mple, The The Body Corporate of Dolphin Cove v Kwadukuza Municipality and Another (8513/10) [2012] ZAKZDHC 13 (20 February 2012) , where the Kwadukuza Municipality was ordered to remove a promenade constructed in a sensitive area at or near the high -water m ark and active literal zone. 147 See, generally, Terry P Hughes, Cristina Linares, Vasilis Dakos, Ingrid A van de Leemput, and Egbert H. van Nes 'Living dangerously on borrowed time during slow, unrecognized regime shifts' (2012) Trends Ecol Evol 28 149 -155. 148 The various instruments provided for in both NEMA and the specific legislation this Act provides for, will be analysed in Part 2 of this paper. 149 David Takacs 'The Public Trust Doctrine, Environmental Human Rights, and the Future of Private Property' (2 008) N.Y.U.

The incorporation of the public trust doctrine into South African law, following the adoption of the Constitution, imposed new and renewed responsibilities on the government to safeguard the country's natural environment for the benefit of current and fu ture citizens. It thus follows that land owners are not given absolute real rights, and cannot use the land in a way that may prejudice people \u2014 as those species, ecosystems and ecosystem services that are generated from that land, are held in trust for fu ture generations.151 In addition to a common law application of the public trust doctrine, the NEMA provides a framework of principles that must be explicitly and jointly applied by government in all environmental decision -making, in order to achieve the pur pose of the doctrine. This is to maintain the integrity of South Africa's biodiversity for current and future generations, and therein to achieve the sustainable development contemplated by Brundtland and the 1992 Rio De claration.152 150 The Convention of the Preservation of Wild Animals, Birds and Fish in Africa (the 1900 London Convention) is the earliest record of the need for trusteeship in Africa. Since then, the State exercising public trust duty ha s been recognised and developed through subsequent multilateral agreements which include the 1933 London Convention - the Convention for Relative to the Preservation of Fauna and Flora in their Natural State the, Arusha Manifesto of 1961 and the 1968 Africa n Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (the Algiers Convention). 151 King v Dykes (1971) (3) SA 540 (RA) at 545, quoted in Thomas v Head of the Department of Agriculture Conservation Environment & Tourism North West Province and Others ; M J Thomas t/a Elandskraal Garage v Gouveia and Others 27858/2006, 2007 (GPHC) 242 at para 19; HTF Developers (Pty) Ltd v Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism and Others 2007 (5) SA 438 (SCA) at para 19. 152 The Rio Dec laration \u2014 which consisted of 27 principles \u2014 required to achieve future sustainable development. See: 96 A key uncertainty faced by government in applying the public trust doctrine to decision -making on the use and potential harm of biodiversity, is the separation between the rights of the private landowner and the general rights of people. The public trust doctrine grants a pre -existing title in favour of the government as trustee \u2014 to regulate the use of biodiversity on private property. The application of the doctrine, therefore, provides specifically for the protection of existing public rights where there is a potential for the irreversible loss of the country's biodiversity. It would thus be incorrect to assume that private property rights take precedence over public interests.153 Such an assumption is likely to result in a private gain from the unsustainable destruction of biodi versity, a shrinkage of the trust entity, and an ongoing cost borne by the public. The exercising of the common -law public trust doctrine \u2014 either directly or indirectly through the application of environmental principles \u2014 cannot be regarded as a deprivat ion of private property and has been well debated by trust scholars and in various legal challenges.154 A distinction needs to be drawn between an 'absolute or vested right' and a' legitimate expectation.' An absolute or vested right would include, for example, the right to own property.155 The concept of a legitimate expectation arises from administrative la w and includes the principles of fairness and http://www.un.org/documents/ga/conf151/aconf15126 -1annex1.htm (accessed 10 October 2014). 153 Deborah G Musiker Tom France and Lisa A Hallenbeck 'Public Land and Resources Law Review' (1995)16 Pub.

Libecap 'Property rights and the public trust doctrine in environmental protection and natural resource conservation' (2009) The Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics 53 7; Van Der Schyff (n47) at 122 -89. 155 Section 25(1) of the South African Constitution provides that 'No one may b e deprived of property except in terms of law of general application, and no law may permit arbitrary deprivation of property.' 97 reasonableness.156 In the latter, a landowner would have a legitimate expectation that any application to destroy biodiversity would be considered with an open and fair mind \u2014 drawing on the necessary expertise \u2014 and the decision made would be, given the circumstance of the application, reasonable and defendable.157 Any expectation by the landowner for government to arbitrarily grant approval to destroy significant biodiversity \u2014 given perceived prior right \u2014 would be inappropriate and illegitimate.158 In such circumstances, any claims that private property rights are superior to continued regulation in favour of the public interest, will naturally attract close scrutiny in both an appeal and by the courts.159 Property o wnership, therefore, does not grant an unfettered discretion to use the land for parochial or private purposes,160or in a manner which is in conflict with the good of society.161 The government must therefore consider which competing use is the most favourable in respect of 156 Section 33(1) of the South African Constitution provides that 'Everyone has the right to administrative action that is lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair.' 157 It is implied in the public trust doctrine that government must have the necessary competence (skills, experience, and qualifications) to evaluate the potential merits and negative impacts of an application to destroy biodiversity, and identify the need and draw on necessary expertise in order to come to a reasonable and rational decision. It stands to reason, therefore, that an adjudication of an appeal, or a judicial review of a decision, would find on merit that the government \u2014 by not embracing the necessarily capacity to consider the application \u2014 had not fulfilled its fiducial duty. 158 In such cases, where a prior right is suspected to exist and which would provide for significant harm to biodiversity, section 28 o f NEMA provides for a 'duty of care' obligation which enables government to impose a 're -evaluation' of the circumstance by the landowner, by undertaking an environmental impact assessment to determine the magnitude of the suspected harm, and the mitigatio n required to make good the harm caused. The consideration of this assessment, by government, may therefore result in the setting aside any expectation where such harm may erode the public trust. 159 See, generally, Ndlambe Municipality v Lester and Others 92/2011 3 May 2012 441 (EC); and Joseph L Sax 'The Public Trust Doctrine in Natural Resource Law: Effective Judicial Intervention' (1970) Michigan Law Review 68 471-566, quoted in Brewer (154) at 1. 160 Joseph L.

The value of a parcel of land cannot, therefore, be calculated solely on the landowner's unregulated and expedient intent, but on the result of the competing uses (that desired by the lan downer versus that required in the public interest) which would ultimately determine its value. It is thus the government's duty, in compliance with the Bill of Rights within the Constitution and the environmental principles in NEMA, to act as the trustee and to regulate the use of and to conserve biodiversity \u2014 and prevent unreasonable and unsustainable exploitation thereof, even if this enhances the land's economic value. Where unsustainable exploitation of biodiversity has taken place, or is unavoidable, the government has a proactive duty to secure compensation for that loss162 and to institute mechanisms to reinstate that which has been lost. Should the government fail to fulfil these obligations by making a just decision, the public may seek relief from the courts. Such relief may be sought without fear of a cost award \u2014 particularly where the relief sought is on behalf of the public interest or in the interest of protecting the environment to seek, inter alia, appropriate relief in respect of any breach or threatened breach of a principle contained in the NEMA.163 The failure of government to expressly apply the NEMA principles in deciding on matters that may result in biodiversity loss, has been challenged by aggrieved members of the public and non - governm ental organisations.164,165 Where the public trust has been diminished 162 Musiker, France and Hallenbeck Op. cit.

This action for relief, however, may only take place once all avenues of cooperative governance have been exhausted \u2014 including those provisions within the Intergovernmen tal Relations Framework Act 99 through improper application of, inter alia , the environmental principles in the NEMA, the beneficiaries of that trust, the public, are entitled to appropriate compensation. The litigant ha s a right to craft a remedy that conforms to the novel character of the circumstance.166 Here, Justice Moseneke applied the Latin maxim ubi ius, ibi remedium to the circumstance \u2014 where government failed to remain within the rule of law, by stating: It goes without saying that every improper performance of an administrative function would implicate the Constitution and entitle the aggrieved party to appropriate relief. In each case the remedy must fit the injury. The remedy must be fair to those affected by i t and yet vindicate effectively the right violated. It must be just and equitable in the light of the facts, the implicated constitutional principles, if any, and the controlling law. It is nonetheless appropriate to note that ordinarily a breach of admini strative justice attracts public -law remedies and not private -law remedies. The purpose of a public -law remedy is to pre - empt or correct or reverse an improper administrative function. In some instances the remedy takes the form of an order to make or not to make a particular decision or an order declaring rights or an injunction to furnish reasons for any adverse decision. Ultimately the purpose of a public remedy is to afford the prejudiced party administrative justice, to advance efficient and effective public administration compelled by constitutional precepts and at a broader level, and to entrench the rule of law.167 13 of 2005. As a result, many interdepartmental disputes, particularly on matters concerning the environment, are resolved on the threshold of the courts \u2014 for example, the De Hoop Dam resolution. See: E. Couzens and M. Dent 'Fi nding NEMA: The National Environmental Management Act, the De Hoop Dam, conflict resolution and Alternative Dispute Resolution in environmental disputes' (2006) PER 9(3) 2 -51. 166 Thusi v Minister of Home Affairs and Others 7802/09 23 December 2010 (KZN) 56 1 at para 52. 167 Steenkamp NO v Provincial Tender Board of the Eastern Cape CCT71/05 28 September 2006 (CC) 121 para 29. 100 In deciding on an appropriate remedy, the courts are likely to gravitate to the principle of law \u2014 that where a party seeks redress against the proponent of an action, such redress cannot operate unduly harshly against the proponent and thereby produce an unjust result. This would be when the costs of the corrective action disproportionately exceed the value of the damages incurred.168 Here Jus tice Alkema describes this as the 'disproportionality of prejudice test.'169 It is conceivable, however, that the corrective action would include damages to current and possibly future society. The conundrum faced by the courts, where on organ of state has f ailed to reasonably apply the environmental principles and in so doing has facilitated unsustainable damage to biodiversity \u2014 is that any punitive or remedial or corrective action against that organ of state would ultimately be underwritten or compensated, via the fiscus, by the very people (the public) the doctrine and the environmental principles intended to safeguard. The solution to the conundrum facing government as to whether the environment has residual capacity for continued 'balancing of conflicti ng interests', hinges on whether a sustainable -use threshold has been transgressed or if the impacts arising from the decision may result in the transgression (Figure 1 above). It stands to reason, therefore, that the balancing of needs170 between biodiversi ty and social and economic needs, can only be provided for in that sustainable -use realm which exists above this threshold. Likewise, a trade -off between these two domains in the realm that exists between the limit of acceptable change and sustainable -use threshold (Figure 1 above), can only be in those circumstances where the damage to biodiversity is absolutely necessary and in the overriding interest of the state. Here the proponent would need to make good the impacts through 168 Here, Ferris, citing the S v Manamela case, describes this circumstance as using 'a sledgehammer to crack a nut'. See: Loretta Ferris 'Environmental Rights and Locus Standi' in Alexander Paterson and Louis J Kotz\u00e9 (eds) Environmental Compliance and Enforcement in South Africa: Legal Perspectives (2009) at 182. 169 Ndlambe Municipality v Lester and Others Op. cit.

See arguments in 3.2 herein above. 101 rehabilitation and offsettin g, in order to restore the biodiversity to above the threshold of concern \u2014 to ensure a no -net loss of the trust entity. A further solution is vested in ensuring that the public trust doctrine, characterised by the NEMA principles, is pre -emptively applie d to environmental decision -making. For this, the relevant official of government, or the person seeking to either directly or indirectly harm biodiversity, should question whether: the biodiversity involved is rare, unique, endangered, or has historical significance; the biodiversity is easily replaceable; the proposed action or decision will have any significant consequential effect on other actions or initiatives that provide for the conservation of biodiversity; the negative consequences of an action or decision are realistically or reasonably reversible; damages or costs for mitigation and amelioration of negative consequences may be reasonably recovered by those responsible for the environmental damage; cumulative impacts of human activities on bio diversity have not exceeded a sustainable -use threshold; there is sufficient confidence (i.e. defendable information) that the trust object will not be damaged; the impacts of the activity would be reasonably mitigated or remediated within a meaningful tim eframe, or the foreseeable future, or within a period that ensures strict compliance with the conditions of the decision; and the realisation of potential economic and social benefits that require the safeguarding of biodiversity to be compromised.171 3.7 CONCL USION The inclusion of the public trust doctrine in South African environmental jurisprudence entrenches the government's obligation to hold in trust the country's biodiversity and to ensure that it is not damaged or eroded and 171 The need for criteria to enable both the government and the courts to determine whether the public tru st doctrine has been applied in decision -making, was highlighted by Judge Reilly in the case of City of Portage v. Kalamazoo County Road Comm' (355 N.W.2d 913, 915 -16 Mich. Ct. App. 1984). 102 remains intact for use and enjoyment by current and future generations. The foundation of this inclusion is not only in the environmental right housed in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution, but also in a series of environmental principles of the NEMA. These principles include an express provision of the doctrine, as well as others that reinforce the doctrine's application in environmental decision -making. This collective presentation of the doctrine in South African jurisprudence obligates the governmen t to exercise due care to prevent destroying important or irreplaceable biodiversity. Appropriate interpretation and application of these principles is fundamental, therefore, for the application of the public trust doctrine and the concomitant protection of South Africa's natural heritage. The doctrine, and the environmental principles thereto, discourages government from taking decisions of ignorance or convenience that are in favour of social, political or economic gains \u2014 but prejudicial to biodiversity . The failure of government to uphold the public trust doctrine in environmental decision -making provides strong grounds for public intervention and judicial review of the decisions taken. With respect to previous or historical damage to the country's biod iversity, the doctrine \u2014 together with the array of trust -related principles \u2014 requires the government to retrospectively make good this loss. This observation has direct bearing on offsets, as a means to mitigate the residual impacts of development and la nd transformation on biodiversity. In circumstances where historical damage is prevalent, therefore, the government may have an obligation to make good the historical loss of significant biodiversity, and this may need to be exercised concomitantly with the biodiversity offsets they authorise. 103 CHAPTER 4: THE PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE, RESEARCH AND RESPONSIBLE WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA 104 BOTHALIA: JOURNAL OF AFRICAN BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION VOLUME 47 PART 1 OF 2017 THE PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE, RESEARCH AND RESPONSIBLE WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA Andrew Blackmore Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, Research Fellow -School of Law, University of KwaZulu - Natal 4.1 ABSTRACT A significant proportion of South African biodiversity occurs in extensive private wildlife areas. A s such, the continuance of these private reserves is paramount to conservation of the country's biodiversity. The areas are, however, vulnerable to being divided into smaller camps as landowners enter into the new and rapidly growing industry of selective breeding and intensive management of antelope and predators. Concerns are being raised as to the long term consequences of the products and impacts of this industry on, inter alia, integrity and conservation of the country's wildlife, and the landscapes th ese facilities are located in, as well as the country's reputation as a free ranging and fair chase hunting destination. Using the public trust doctrine as a foundation, this paper characterises the relationship between the country's environmental law and the roles played by government as the regulator, the wildlife industry, research and the public in achieving responsible wildlife management and the long -term conservation of this resource. These relationships are seen to be finely balanced between the pro vision of robust science, and evidence based and cautious or risk averse decision -making. It is concluded that the public trust doctrine is a powerful tool to limit the impacts of unsustainable and parochial use of wildlife on the conservation of biodivers ity. It is also concluded that an improved understanding of the doctrine by researchers, public and the wildlife industry would lead to a greater relevance of research, and in turn sound evidence -based decision -making and ultimately sustainable use of wildlife. 105 Keywords: Public trust doctrine, responsible wildlife management, genetic content, biodiversity, intensive and selective breeding, robust research. 4.2 INTRODUCTION Globally, the conservation of wildlife is under great pressure with an increasing number of species being listed as vulnerable, threatened or endangered. The rapid decline of wildlife in the late 1800s through unsustainable hunting (Hoffmann & Jungius 1972) precipitated the drafting of the Convention of the Preservation of Wild Animals, Birds and Fish in Africa (1900 London Convention). Although this convention never came into force, it is regarded as the first multilateral realisation of the threat of the 'indiscriminate slaughter' of game was having on wildlife populations (Preamble to the C onvention). This convention was replaced by the Convention Relative to the Preservation of Fauna and Flora in their Natural State (1933 London Convention) which came into force in 1936, and which was in turn replaced by the 1968 African Convention on the C onservation of Nature and Natural Resources (Algiers Convention) which is currently still in force. Throughout these revisions, an increasing emphasis was placed on the economic values of wildlife (for example sport hunting and tourism) as well as inter al ia, scientific and research, educational, cultural and aesthetic values (Hofmann & Jungius 1972). The Algiers Convention was substantially reviewed and updated by the (revised) African Convention on Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources which was signed into being in Maputo in 2003 (the Maputo Convention) but this is yet to come into force. The Maputo Convention consolidated the trend towards sustainable use of wildlife as well as a landscape approach to conservation of biodiversity. In addition, the 1992 a SADC Treaty and its derivative, the 1999 Protocol on Wildlife Conservation and Law Enforcement, recognised the economic value and hence the need for a collective effort by the African States to safeguard their wildlife through sustainable use and c onservation. Towards achieving this objective, the Protocol sets in place a number of obligations on the SADC region to give effect to via legislation and enforcement, and decisions authorising or prohibiting use of wildlife. Since the realisation of the value of game in the 1970s, the number of game farms or extensive private wildlife areas has grown to approximately 16.8% of 106 South Africa's landmass (Cousins et al. 2010). It is argued that these extensive wildlife areas make a significant contribution to the conservation of biodiversity at a landscape and country level (Luxmoore 1985; Trimble & van Aarde 2014). Given the considerable rate of transformation of natural land in South Africa (Dobson et al. 2006; Jewitt 2015) it sta nds to reason that not only the retention of these areas as extensive wildlife systems, but also the responsible management of the wildlife therein is an important, if not crucial, consideration in the conservation of this component of biodiversity. Respo nsible wildlife management may be characterised from a variety of perspectives in the short to long term. This characterisation may be based upon the gradient from which 'irresponsible' wildlife management manifests (for example, the keeping of an animal i n inhumane conditions) to an extensive wildlife system where natural processes predominate. It, therefore, covers interrelated domains of animal health and welfare and biodiversity at both a genetic and population level. It is for this reason, that the eme rgence of selective breeding and intensive management of antelope and lions in South Africa has raised concern within the broader conservation and hunting fraternity and particularly the conservation agencies in the country. Within the above context, thi s paper explores and derives an understanding of the relationship between the public trust, responsible wildlife management, and research, using commercial selective breeding and intensive management of components of wildlife as a point of reference. 4.2.1 Commercial wildlife management and genetic integrity The pollution of a gene pool of a population through hybridisation, inbreeding or other types of genetic manipulation poses a wide and long -term threat which may never be corrected, and, as such, if not avoided at the outset, would constitute grossly irresponsible wildlife management from a biodiversity conservation management perspective (Allendorf et al. 2001; Crispo et al. 2011). This concern is exacerbated by the recent acceleration in the commercial isation of wildlife that has resulted in, inter alia , movement of species out of their natural ranges, mixing of subspecies, selective breeding and intensive management for 107 uncommon colour variants or enhanced physiological traits, or progressive removal o f trophies from a wild population by way of hunting. (Mysterud & Bischof 2010; Trailla et al. 2014). While it may be argued that each event in isolation would have an insignificant negative impact on genotypes of the wildlife population or biodiversity as a whole, the same cannot be argued from a cumulative and a broad -scale perspective. This is particularly relevant given that South Africa's wildlife heritage predominantly occurs on private land and private game farms, and this is where most selective bree ding and intensive management of wildlife phenotypes is likely to take place (Taylor et al. 2016). The disquiet about the cumulative impacts of the commercialisation and associated genetic manipulation of wildlife may be aptly described in the arguments e xpressed in Hardin's 'Tragedy of the Commons' (Hardin 1968). This being that in the absence of an understanding of, and in part taking responsibility for, the cumulative risk to the county's wildlife emanating out of what may be seen as a 'free ride' or ap parent individual right (Stone 2012) to exploit wildlife as personal property the integrity of wildlife is likely to fail (Ostrom 1999). This argument is particularly relevant where users of wildlife resources adopt a norm - free strategy to maximise short -term gains. Drawing on the economic reasoning of Khan (1966), the 'special status' acquired by most threatened and endangered biodiversity results from a 'series of small decisions' (Odum 1982). Here, a series of individually small, potentially economically rational decisions may lead to a reduction in future opportunities to a point where alternatives (untainted wildlife) are irreversibly destroyed (Kahn 1966) . The solution to preventing an erosion of the integrity of wildlife lies in the collective recogn ition of a common resource pool of wildlife and its genetics followed by a long -term view of the consequences of both individual and cumulative impacts arising from its commercial use. This may be achieved through the application of responsible management through self -regulation, complexed with regulatory surveillance by the wildlife authorities (Van Gestel 2005; Short & Toffel 2010). Should such a voluntary mechanism not be forthcoming from the private wildlife industry, the government would be obliged to impose such policy or uniform regulations which are necessary to safeguard the integrity of the country's wildlife although this is significantly less efficient than self -regulation 108 (Ostrom 1999; Ostrom 2012) and requires a higher degree of regulatory surveillance. Notwithstanding the difference in the effectiveness of these two approaches both options are substantially underpinned by the availability and use of empirical research (Dicks et al. 2014; Krausman et al. 2013). 4.3 ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION 4.3.1 South Afr ica's Constitution It is contended that responsible wildlife management is founded in the common law public trust doctrine, which has been enshrined in section 24 of the environmental right of the Bill of Rights of South Africa's Constitution, which states that: Every one has the right\u2014 (a) to an environment that is not harmful to their health or well-being; and (b) to have the environment protected, for the benefit of present and future generations, through reasonabl e legislative and other measure s that\u2014 (i) prevent pollution and ecolo gical degrada tion; (ii) promote conservation; and (iii) secure ecologically sustainable development and use of natural resources while prom oting justifiable economic and social developmen t (Constitution 1996) . In brief, since wildlife is a fundamental component of the environment, all people including future generations, as a consequence of this environmental right, have an absolute right, as opposed to a progressive right, to have South Africa's wildlife shielded from signific ant human -induced danger, injury, change, and loss. This perspective on rights was set in place by justice Yacoob in the founding case of the Government of the Republic of South Africa v Grootboom . 109 It is, therefore, a sound argument that South Africa's env ironmental right in the Bill of Rights encompasses people's right to have South African wildlife safeguarded from significant human -mediated genetic change. This brings into play both moral and ethical considerations relating to changes in the phenotypes of species through the over accentuation of uncommon genes or gene associations, leading to what are commonly described as 'colour -variants'. While the aesthetic value of the phenotypic appearance of individual species falls outside the scope of this paper, it remains, together with 'ecological degradation', an important consideration from a Constitutional and public trust perspective. From a broad perspective, the achievement of the environmental right effectively prohibits any use of the country's wildlif e in a manner that may be counter to its conservation. The breadth of this right gives credence to the understanding that the protection of the environment includes the protection of the genetic integrity of the country's wildlife. Another pillar of protec tion is seated in the use of wildlife. Here, any use must be 'ecologically sustainable' in perpetuity in order not to foreclose on, at least, current and future generations' opportunities. Economic and social use of wildlife cannot be at the expense of the integrity of this resource. In short, the environmental right dispels the concept that the ecological integrity of the country's wildlife can be compromised to further economic or social development. Such compromise is likely to be considered unconstituti onal and unjustifiable, although this supposition remains to be tested in the Constitutional Court. 4.3.2 The National Environmental Management Act and the public trust doctrine In its entirety, the environmental right in South Africa's Constitution embraces to the full the concept of the public trust doctrine prescribed in the National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998 (NEMA). This Act defines the public trust doctrine as one of a number of principles to be applied to all environmental decision -making u ndertaken by the government. The public trust principle reads as: The environment is held in public trust for the people, the beneficial use of environmental resources must serve the public interest and 110 the environment must be protected as the people's com mon heritage (Section 2(4)(o)). The trust principle is further refined by section 3 of the National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act 10 of 2004 (NEMBA), under the heading of 'State's trusteeship of biological diversity'. This section reads as: In fulfilling the rights contained in section 24 of the Constitution, the state through its organs that implement legislation applicable to biodiversity, must (a) manage, conserve and sustain South Africa's biodiversity and its components and genetic resource s, and (b) implement this Act to achieve the progressive realisation of those rights. The government, through all its organs of state, has a proactive duty to act as a trustee of the environment and the biodiversity and the genetic resources therein. Simpl y worded, wildlife 'should be held in trust by the state, which must manage its consumptive use and protection on behalf of present and future citizens' (Sagarin & Turnipseed 2012) or 'the State is the trustee of all natural resources which are by nature m eant for public use and enjoyment' (Jain et al. 2012). The public trust therefore stresses the application of the 'doctrine of equality', in both the practical and regulatory domains (Jain et al. 2012). It is incumbent on the government to ensure that the regulatory process applied to the use of wildlife is non -arbitrary and guided by the country's Constitution and the environmental principles in NEMA, which are to serve the broader public good. In addition, the application of the public trust doctrine stre sses transparency in order to confirm fair access to wildlife resources and continued protection of the national and public interest (Jain et al. 2012). The government therefore has a fiduciary obligation to ensure the safety of the county's wildlife and t o protect it from damage. As the trustee of the public trust, when read in conjunction with the environmental right, the government may not allow any erosion of the integrity of the country's wildlife through negligence, lack of capacity, popular or partis an demand, by vote, or by the monetary or other desires of a select few. As with all trusts, the government as trustee has a primary obligation to the trust's beneficiaries, the public, and in particular to those who are yet to be born (Redmond 2009). Many of the remaining environmental principles in NEMA (see 111 section 2) underpin the application of the public trust doctrine and therein serve to protect the public's wildlife interest. A selection of the environmental principles is briefly discussed below, by way of example - see Blackmore (2015) for comprehensive analysis of the environmental principles. 4.3.3 Environmental principles and provisions underpinning the public trust doctrine in NEMA The first principle states that any environmental decision taken by go vernment 'must place people and their needs at the forefront of its concern.' The use of the term 'people' embraces the plurality of contemporary society and of future generations. This principle renders it inappropriate for the government to service the n eeds of an individual, or organisation, or a limited group of people at the expense of the integrity of wildlife or the fundamental rights of broader society (Blackmore 2015; Brundtland 1987). It further empowers the government to 'promote the interests of the general public rather than to redistribute [these] public goods from broad public uses to restricted private benefit' (Sax 1970). The risk -averse principle of NEMA brings to the fore the precautionary principle to environmental decision -making, which was first proposed in the 1972 Declaration of the UN Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm Declaration), and later in the Rio Declaration on the Environment and Development and the Convention on Biological Diversity. The purpose of the risk - averse principle is to anticipate and prevent harm in circumstances where it is perceived that there is a significant degree of uncertainty regarding the potential impact on wildlife (Ramlogan 2011; Trouwborst 2006). With this principle, when applied with the co mmon law on the burden of proof and the polluter -pays principle, the obligation lies with the promoter of the suspected harm (e.g. the wildlife owner or breeder) to demonstrate, beyond a reasonable doubt, that no or negligible harm will arise from any of t he actions proposed to be taken (Blumm & Guthrie 2012). It is, therefore, not the duty of either government or the general public, to demonstrate the possibility of significant risk to wildlife (Blackmore 2015). The importance of this principle to furtheri ng responsible wildlife management, is to ensure that the integrity of wildlife (the trust entity) is not degraded as a result of a lack of understanding by government of the 112 consequences of the decision taken (Blackmore 2015). Should, however, potential of realised harm to wildlife arise, the polluter -pays principle states that the avoidance, mitigation or remediation of any harm that may arise, must be paid by those responsible for the harm. Section 28 of NEMA further places an obligation on the owner or person in control of a person who has a right to use the land, or a person who is responsible for, or who directly or indirectly contributed to the pollution, to take 'reasonable measures to prevent the pollution or degradation from occurring, continuing o r recurring'. In circumstances where the harming activity has not been authorised by government or cannot reasonably be avoided, the person referred to earlier must 'minimise and rectify' the pollution or degradation. Reasonable measures contemplated in NE MA, include an assessment of the impact, cessation of the activity and elimination of the source of the pollution. Failing to undertake such reasonable steps, the government may issue a directive to achieve the necessary protection of potentially affected wildlife. Should the person fail to comply with the directive, it would be deemed an offence in terms of this Act resulting in a significant fine, jail term, or a combination of the two. Furthermore, the government in executing its fiduciary duty as the tr ustee for wildlife, may undertake the necessary preventative or remedial measures and recover the costs from the defaulting person or persons. The provision of these measures is to ensure that the public (the beneficiaries of the wildlife trust) do not have to pay the cost of remediation that is necessary to correct or avoid a potential loss in the integrity of wildlife (Section 28 of NEMA). While the ultimate responsibility of policing the wildlife industry lies with the government, the drafters of NEMA r ecognised the critical role the public plays in bringing the government's attention to a significant threat to the environment or a potential wildlife crime through whistle -blowing. Section 31 of NEMA importantly affords all bona fide whistle -blowers (Figu re 1.) protection from being civilly or criminally liable; or being dismissed, disciplined, prejudiced or harassed for having disclosed pertinent information to the relevant authorities or popular press. 113 Figure 1. Schematic relationship of key role -players and their contribution to responsible wildlife management. Green arrows denote a positive contribution to the wildlife trust and the red represents an adverse consequence that ultimately undermines the trust and its use. Further, NEMA reaffirms that the environment, and hence wildlife, is part of the broader public trust, by granting the public the legal standing to approach the courts for relief where there is a breach of the provisions of the Act or its environmental pri nciples and, inter alia , the NEMBA or any other statute that provides for the protection of wildlife (Section 32). Furthermore, this section of NEMA also grants the public protection against cost order, should their judicial intervention prove to be unsucc essful. Such measures facilitate the access of the public to a decisive mechanism (judicial intervention) to have set aside any decision or action taken by government which may threaten the public trust entity (Figure 1). NEMA, therefore, is a solid found ation for responsible wildlife management not only by way of regulation but by enabling civil society, as immediate beneficiaries of the wildlife public trust, to monitor and evaluate government's compliance with its fiduciary duties. 114 4.3.4 Wildlife research an d the public trust doctrine From a research perspective, although not legally binding, the environmental principles provided in NEMA may also apply to research in that they may be used to guide the researcher to apply an ethical responsibility to understa nd the broad - spectrum context in which the research and provision of information will be used. Likewise, the onus lies with the researcher to provide the wildlife industry or the state with information that is researched and interpreted in a responsible ma nner. The foundation for this duty lies not only with the professionalism of the researcher, but also with the realisation that the research may be used in decisions that could impact on the conservation of biodiversity. It is obvious, but worth mentioning , that responsible decision -making, and consequently responsible wildlife management, is fundamentally vulnerable to 'perverse research' in which expedience, falsification, fabrication or misrepresentation of research data prevail (Clavero & Garcia -Berthou 2005; Fanelli 2009; Noorden 2011). Where decisions and policies derived from the research may have far -reaching consequences for wildlife (Figure 1), it is paramount for the researcher to exercise the principle of minimising error through the design of th e research, analysis of the data, and, importantly, in the interpretation of the findings (Gibbons 2000; Resnik 2015;). The relative paucity of wildlife research, however, particularly when compared to other disciplines (e.g. human health), accentuates the vulnerability of the wildlife decision -making sector to the consequences of capricious research, in that such research is unlikely to be effectively overturned or set aside. In these circumstances, this unreliable information is likely to persist and infl uence decisions for time immemorial (Noorden 2011). Thus, significant negative impacts on wildlife resulting from a commercial or other use is likely not to be avoided, mitigated or ameliorated in the short to medium term, exposing the wildlife trust entity to ongoing and cumulative damage that may not be reversible or remediated. This concern is particularly relevant when the quality and quantity of the wildlife resource is eroded towards its sustainable -use threshold (Figure 2). There is, therefore, a mor al and ethical responsibility, and a moral duty of care placed at the door of all researchers, their institutions, and funding agencies to ensure that both the research and the interpretation thereof, remains robust, accurate and relevant, independent, and unbiased (Myhr & Traavik 2002; Pullin & Knight 2003;). 115 Figure 2. Diagrammatic representation of the sustainable -use threshold on a diminishing resource gradient (after Blackmore, 2015). The 'sustainable -use threshold' represents that threshold beyond w hich there is significant uncertainty whether recovery is possible given the influence of other unrelated system dynamics or disturbances. The term 'limits to acceptable change' is concerned with that point beyond which there is a high likelihood of seriou s or irreversible damage or harm (viz. extinction of a species or habitat). Furthermore, contemporary thinking on the undertaking of research places an additional dimension of responsibility on the researcher, research institutions, and the funders of rese arch, to ensure that derived science is 'socially robust' (Nowotny et al. 2001). Lubcheno (1998), Nowontny et al. (2001), L\u00f6brand and \u00d6berg (Sarewitz 2004) and others, have argued that this dimension requires that the research undertaken is not only scien tifically steadfast, but also 'context sensitive' in that it must take into consideration the needs and expectations of broader society. By stating this aphorism, it is acknowledged that the benefits to be gained by an individual or a select few cannot be at the expense of society whether current or future (Blackmore 2015; Bruskotter 2011). Such arguments, in the undertaking and application of research, naturally have strong parallels in the application of the public trust doctrine and the duty of care ther ein. Given that 116 research, perspective and approach of wildlife scientists have a key and positive contribution to policy, this domain will be vulnerable to the pressures of advocates for a particular use of wildlife, or the broader environment, in support of or to further their potentially un sustainable agenda (Pielke 2004). The application of the public trust doctrine to wildlife research resonates predominantly in two interlinked domains. The first is generating a defendable understanding of the status o f the wildlife resource under consideration. This understanding goes beyond describing the species and its distribution, population trends and genetic integrity and must take into account all the threats, perturbations (e.g. drought, climate change) and na tural dynamics of the wildlife resource. However, it must also bring to the fore information that ensures that the anticipated use of wildlife element (from at least a meta -population perspective) remains sustainable and stable over time (Figure 2). The se cond domain is founded on providing sound information: (a) presented in an understandable manner so that the government authority, wildlife manager or self-regulating entity can exercise his or her discretion in a manner that promotes both the public's leg al and practical interests together with reducing the vulnerability of wildlife to its use, and (b) which conveys not only the status of the wildlife resource but also the scope of the discretion that can be exercised by the decision -maker from a sustainab le use perspective. The scope of this discretion may be determined by the position of the wildlife entity in the 'recourse quality/quantity gradient' (Figure 2), complexed with the confidence with which that position was determined. The closer to the susta inable -use threshold or a lower degree of confidence in locating this position on the recourse quality/quantity gradient, the higher the risk of significant damage to the wildlife entity under consideration (Figure 2). Under these circumstances, the cautio us and risk -averse principle should be strictly applied in decisions regarding the proposed use of the wildlife entity. The narrative generated by the researcher in this regard thus needs to clearly demonstrate these considerations as well as any other unc ertainties that may apply. Alternatively, in the absence of a defined or reliable sustainable use threshold, the wildlife user would need to demonstrate that the component of wildlife being used is done so in a manner that promotes the interests of society or which does not 'impair substantially, the public interest in the remaining [component of the resource]' ( Illinois Central Rail Road Co. v. 117 Illinois 1982). It is therefore incumbent on the self -regulatory entity, but ultimately on the government as the fiduciary trustee, to ensure, at a minimum, that the cumulative use of wildlife is maintained above the sustainable -use threshold (Figure 2). Naturally, this threshold should be set well above the natural dynamics of the wildlife resource so that any pertu rbations and threats (e.g. climate change, disease) that may or are likely to occur, do not have a significantly adverse impact on the integrity of the wildlife resource. Here, defining a point of reference and thereafter demonstrating that the quality and quantity of South Africa's wildlife is being maintained above the 'sustainable -use threshold', should be a crucial focus for researchers and research institutions, as well as the wildlife industry. 4.3.5 Research and the sustainable use threshold The complexity of determining the sustainable -use threshold (Cairns 2004) requires an ongoing and systematic undertaking and synthesis of wildlife research, and, importantly, the condensing of this information to inform policy within government (Dicks 2013 ; Leslie et al. 2014). To achieve this, research institutions and funders of research would need to extend their pursuits from a purely theoretical base to include applied science, with the express intention of influencing policy that guides self -regulatory management, and, importantly, government decision -making (Rose 2014). This change in focus would naturally require conservation scientists and research institutions, not only to have a fundamental understanding of the provisions in law that require the policy to be in place, together with the process followed by government in applying the policy in decisions affecting wildlife \u2014 but also an understanding of the importance and application of the public trust doctrine. Without this understanding, it is unlikely that the outcomes of the research would have the desired impact on the decisions ultimately taken by government to safeguard the wildlife trust entity. This challenge is described as 'constructing a compelling conservation narrative' (Rose 2014), drawing on argumen ts that are focused, inter alia , on contextualising research within the public trust philosophy and highlighting the solutions and consequences of non -action (Bommel & Zouwen 2012). The description of the 'non action option' should further highlight the im mediate and potentially cumulative impacts on the wildlife trust entity. The derivation of this compelling argument 118 requires an understanding of the decision -making processes and thus may require, frequent, and with a high degree of clarity and simplicity, effective engagement with either government or the self -regulating wildlife industry (Basken 2009). As a means to ensure appropriate consideration of the potential impact on the wildlife trust entity, researchers or decision -makers may apply a series of p rinciple questions that guide an assessment on whether the biodiversity trust entity would be at risk (Blackmore 2015). These questions, listed below, are in many respects overlapping and probe different aspects of potential long -lasting or irreversible impacts on the trust entity. In so doing, they form the beginnings of the 'context sensitive' framework discussed earlier to guide the focus of the research necessary to inform and guide policy and decisions made by government. It also gives the government o fficial, researcher and the wildlife industry a framework to determine whether the sustainable -use threshold (Figure 2) has been or is at risk of being transgressed, or whether the observed or proposed use of the wildlife is sustainable in its true form. T he answers to the following questions (extracted from Blackmore 2015), therefore provide insights as to whether the public wildlife trust entity has been appropriately safeguarded: Is the biodiversity involved rare, unique, endangered, or does it have significant historical significance? Is that component of biodiversity used or impacted upon easily replaced? Will the proposed action or decision have any significant consequential effect on other actions or initiatives that provide for the conservation of biodiversity? Are the negative consequences of an action or decision realistically or reasonably reversible? Can damages or costs for mitigation and amelioration of negative consequences be reasonably recovered from those responsible for the environmental d amage? Have the cumulative impacts of human activities on the elements of biodiversity under consideration not exceeded any sustainable -use threshold? 119 Is there sufficient confidence (i.e. defendable information) that the trust object will not be damaged? Will the impacts of the activity be reasonably mitigated or remediated within a meaningful timeframe, or in the foreseeable future, or within a period that ensures strict compliance with the conditions of the decision? Will the realisation of potential eco nomic and social benefits that require the safeguarding of biodiversity, be compromised? In answering these questions, the government official is enabled to: '(1) consider the potential adverse impacts of any proposed activity over which it has administrat ive authority; (2) allow or grant permission to undertake such activities that do not substantially impair the state's wildlife resources; (3) continually monitor the impacts of an approved activity on the wildlife to ensure preservation of the corpus of t he trust; and (4) bring suit under the parens patriae doctrine to enjoin harmful activities and/or to recover for damages to wildlife' (Musiker 1995). 4.3.5.1 Public rights in terms of protecting wildlife As the beneficiaries of the trust, drawing on the environm ental right read with the right to access to information and just administrative action (sections 32 & 33 respectively) in the Bill of Rights, the public have a constitutional right to be informed of any activity that may have a negative impact on the wild life trust entity. It is for this reason that NEMA requires the general public to be consulted (public participation) when a damaging activity is being considered by an applicant (section 47B). This enables an aggrieved person or group of persons to appeal (section 43) the decision when such decision erodes the public trust entity or the public's fundamental right to have the environment protected from harm (Figure 1). Furthermore, NEMA provides an opportunity for any person or a group of persons to seek th e intervention of the courts to enforce compliance with a statutory provision (including the environmental principles) relating to the protection or use of the environment. Relief from the courts may, inter alia , be achieved in one's or the group's own int erest, in the interest of a class or group of persons unable to institute legal action (i.e. future generations), in the public interest, or in the interest of protecting the environment (section 32) (Figure 1). The NEMA further entrenches the paramount im portance of safeguarding the public trust, by: (a) providing the courts leave to waver a cost order should the 120 applicant have acted, inter alia , 'reasonably out of a concern for the public interest or in the interest of protecting the environment', and (b) allowing any person of the public to initiate and conduct a private prosecution where is there are reasonable grounds to believe an offence has been committed (section 33). The constitutional imperative to protect the public trust and the rights of the public to ensure that the trust entity is safeguarded, is also reflected in the Promotion of Access to Information Act 2 of 2000 (PAIA) and the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000 (PAJA). PAIA provides a statutory mechanism for the public to g ain access to information that may be important for, inter alia , the protection of any rights. PAJA provides a legal mechanism for the public to ensure that an administrative action (i.e. a decision or importantly failure to make a decision) is lawful, rea sonable and procedurally fair. PAJA also provides a mechanism to take a decision (or failure to make a decision) by government on judicial review (Figure 1). Such review may result in, inter alia , the decision being set aside, a condition to the decision b eing changed or others added, or in a mandamus ordering an official to perform a public or statutory duty where the official has failed to do so. Finally, NEMA provides specific protection to whistle - blowers (section 31), who, in good faith, believe that t he disclosure of information or a circumstance was reasonably warranted to avoid or address an imminent threat to the trust entity and the wildlife therein. The public are thus granted a substantial amount of legal power and protection to 'police' the use and status of the country's wildlife. Imbedded in this is the key role the public ought to play in directing the conscience of the wildlife industry and government (Figure 1). As the beneficiary of the public trust, it is incumbent on the public to exerci se this vehicle in the public interest to ensure that, inter alia, responsible management of wildlife prevails. This duty extends to playing an active role in monitoring the decisions taken to authorise various uses of wildlife, the promulgating of new leg islation that relates to relaxing constraints on the use and management of wildlife, and the practices of the wildlife industry. The NEMA and PAJA require that potential threats to wildlife or its environment be resolved through the various appeal (includi ng whistleblowing) mechanisms provided in this legislation. These mechanisms need to be exhausted, unless the threat constitutes an emergency, before seeking relief from the courts. While it may be argued that 121 'environmental extremism or purism' has played a role in strengthening the protection of individuals of a threatened species, or occasionally threatened habitat and ecosystems at or below the limit of acceptable change (Figure 2), this approach has had little success, at least in recent years, in term s of revising environmental policy (Posluszna 2105). This observation also applies at the decision level, where often the approach taken by government is to balance consumptive needs and the need to protect the environment. Here, environmental extremism is often dismissed by the decision -maker as unreasonable or irrelevant (Figure 1). In contrast, a rational and principled approach to engaging with the government or the wildlife industry on matters regarding the public trust, places the public in a robust p osition to guide both these sectors at the decision -making level as well as influencing, if not directing, wildlife policy (Figure 1). Furthermore, the public set the moral and ethical norms that drive responsible wildlife management, either directly by wa y of opinion, or via the courts. These norms affirm the intrinsic value of wildlife in a natural form that underpins its economic value for non -consumptive tourism, hunting, and trade (Child 1970). The development and imposition of these norms is the core of the trust standard to be applied by both government and the wildlife industry. In essence, the public -trust doctrine provides a 'common -law check -and-balance' that monitors and holds the government accountable for its administrative actions and the indu stry's use of wildlife (Ryan 2004). As the trustee for wildlife, government is ultimately accountable for the integrity of the wildlife trust entity. A decline in the public's confidence in government to manage and safeguard the public trust leads to a low er rate of compliance with policy and regulatory frameworks (Figure 1) (OECD 2013). While the public have an independent role to voice their confidence (or distrust) in government's policies and its compliance with these, it is not uncommon for the public to place their trust in the very organ of state democratically appointed, and hence ultimately mandated, to conserve and protect wildlife. This is particularly so if there is low confidence in the wildlife industry's ability to undertake responsible wildli fe management through self -administration. This, in turn, results in an increased demand for regulation and policing (Aghion 2010). 122 The same is also argued for a declining wildlife resource, particularly when the status of this resource has traversed the sustainable -use threshold and is considered endangered or facing extinction (Figure 2). In such circumstances, the government is obliged to exercise its fiduciary duty, emanating from the environmental right within the Constitution, together with the publi c trust principle within NEMA to impose greater regulation and in extreme cases impose a prohibition on the use of wildlife. The implementation of the 2007 Threatened or Protected Species (TOPS) Regulations to the NEMBA, serves to illustrate such fiducial action. The converse of this argument also holds, in that should the industry effectively maintain a high standard of responsible wildlife management, confidence is generated within both the public and government. This, in turn, would lead to greater enabl ing environmental policy and ultimately regulation being replaced with self -regulation (Figure 1). The history of 'deregulation' in the wildlife industry and in the broader environmental sector, has been a troubled one in that lobbyists for deregulation ha ve often had a private economic agenda that is exploitative and to the detriment of the wildlife trust. In such circumstance, objective and independent evaluation of the standards of the self -regulation of the wildlife industry is required to be set in pla ce in order to avoid undue influence by such conflict of interest. 4.4 CONCLUSION Although deeply rooted in South Africa's Constitution, environment and biodiversity conservation legislation, the public trust doctrine is largely unknown and poorly understood in the broader wildlife management and research arenas. Despite this, the doctr ine remains a powerful tool for both the government and the public to limit the impacts of parochial interests that promote exploitation over wildlife conservation. In addition, the doctrine ultimately provides the impetus, through individuals or groups of individuals acting in the public interest, for evoking judicial action for the courts to hold the government accountable to its trust obligations, in order to safeguard the integrity of the country's wildlife. The impacts of the commercialisation, and in particular genetic manipulation of wildlife, is riddled with uncertainty. Consequently, outside of strict regulation it presents a high risk to the integrity of this natural resource. Against this background, it is further concluded that it is critical tha t the public trust be 123 understood and brought into the discourses of and narratives leading to decisions taken by government or the wildlife industry, and should also form the foundation of wildlife research undertaken to inform such decisions. 4.5 ACKNOWLEDGEM ENTS The author would like to thank Professor Arie Trouwborst (Tilburg University) and Ms Lizanne Nel (South African Hunters and Game Conservation Association) for their valuable discussions and well -placed on comments.

Whilst it may be argued that the damage to the protected area is insignificant, such action, for the conservation manage ment, raises a number of principle, operational policy, and legislative questions. It is common practice for people to practice their religion within the protected area, but this usually involves the use of existing facilities and does not involve injury t o the vegetation or landscape. It is argued that the unplanned establishment of a worship site is in conflict with the purpose of the establishment of the protected area and regulating legislation. It is further argued that the clearing of the site risks a dding to the cumulative impact of unnatural disturbance to the protected area, which invokes consideration of the role of the Public Trust Doctrine decision and actions taken by the conservation agency on this matter. Analysis of South Africa's conservatio n jurisprudence indicates a significant disparity in the provision of the Public Trust Doctrine between the biodiversity and heritage conservation legislation. The latter 132 legislation embraces a perplexing and potentially problematic form of the Public Trust Doctrine, in that it confuses the traditional roles of the state, the trustee, and the broader public \u2014 the 'beneficiaries'. This is a significant challenge for conservation managers drawing on the Doctrine to guide the development and implementation of an operational policy within the protected area. Keywords: Biodiversity, Church of Nazareth (Shembe), conservation, cumulative impacts, environment, heritage, protected area, Public Trust Doctrine, South Africa. 5.2 INTRODUCTION Nature reserves with other protected areas comprising less than 6 percent of South Africa's land mass337 remain vulnerable to activities and disturbances that conflict with the purpose for which they were established such as isolation of protected areas from neighbouring natural areas or other protected areas338, loss and fragmentation of habitat.339 Protected areas are also subjected to human - induced actions such as recreational and consumptive use of the natural resources, and development of management and tourism related facilities.340 It is these actions that, either individually or cumulatively, negatively impact the integrity of the protected area and the biodiversity therein, as well as livelihood of those who depend on environmental services like clean water, which are provided by the protected area. Thus it is important to ensure that decisions taken within protected areas do not undermine biological conservation values or the integrity of the protected area. 337 See the synopsis of the South African National Biodiversity Asses sment on http://bgis.sanbi.org/nsba/ terrestrialAreas.asp and generally Driver, K.J.

This overlapping area contains more than 472 species of birds (approximately 60 percent of South Africa's total, and with five species endemic/near endemic to the Hotspot).348 341 South Africa: White Paper on the Conservation of Biodiversity N/1 095, Government Gazette No 18163, 28 July 1997, and P Goldblatt, 'An Analysis of the Flora of Southern Africa: its Characteristics, Relationships and Origins' (1978) 65 Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden 369. 342 See generally , P Seligmann et. al., 'Centers for Biodiversity Conservation: Bringing Together Science, Partnerships, and Human Well -being to Scale Up Conservation Outcomes' (Conservation International, 2007); and Conservation International, Biodiversity Hotspots (2007), <www.biodiversityhotspots .org> accessed 25 July 2014. 343 Including the Cape Floristic Region, Succulent Karoo, and Maputaland -Pondoland - Albany. 344 In order for a region to qualify as a 'hotspot,' it must meet two strict criteria: (a) it must contain at least 1 500 species of vascula r plants ( 0.5 percent of the world's total) as endemics, and it has to have lost at least 70 percent of its original habitat. 345 AE van Wyk, 'Biodiversity of the Maputaland and JM van Medenbach de Rooy (eds), The Biodiversity of African Plants 198 (Kluwer Academic Publishers 1996). 346 The region is also recognised by the IUCN as a key centre of plant endemism. 347 W Matthews, 'Maputaland's Tembe Elephant National Park - a Little Known Reserve with Many Natural Se crets', <www.africaelephants.com/ecology.htm> accessed 25 July 2014. 348 Ibid. 134 Tembe Elephant Park is located within the core area of the Maputaland - Pondoland -Albany Hotspot and contains rare vegetation types as well as rare plant and animal species.349 The park is approximately 30,000 ha350 in extent and its northern limit is the international boundary between South Africa and Mozambique, and encompasses a significant representative sample of the endangered Sand Forest351 \u2014 which is poorly conserved elsewhe re in this region.352 Sand Forest comprises a wide variety of rare and unusual plant and animal species, including several endemics. Of the total number of plant species endemic to the Maputaland Centre, 30 are associated with Sand Forest and 20 exist solely within this vegetation type.353 349 Ibid. 350 Declaration as a nature reserve in accordance with section 23 of the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act 57 of 2003, Extraordinary Provincial Gazette of KwaZulu -Natal, No 83 of 30 August 2012. 351 In Mozambique this forest type is known as 'licuati forest'. 352 About half of the forests have been destroyed, with variations of this forest type occurring in Ndumu and the iSimangaliso Wetland Park World Heritage Site.

The park was set aside by the late iNkosi (Chief) Msimba Tembe, to establish a secure sanctuary for the last natur ally occurring population of African elephant (Loxodonta africana ) in KwaZulu -Natal,354 primarily to protect life and property of the local people from damage and injury by the free roaming elephants. iNkosi Msimba also envisioned to protect Livingstone's Suni (Neotragus moschatus ) in Southern Africa, as well as other naturally occurring fauna and important vegetation types \u2014 including the endangered Sand Forest.355 354 This is one of three original populations of elephant. The other two are within Addo Elephant National Park and Kruger National Park. 355 Tembe Elephant Park: Manag ement Plan, compiled in accordance with section 39 of the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act 57 of 2003, <http://www.kz nwildlife.com/index.php/ conservation/planning/protected -area- management planning.html >. 136 Initially, the protected area's northern border was left open allowing elephants to continue their normal migratory patterns into Mozambique.356 At that time, poaching for meat and ivory and the recent civil war in Mozambique were the key threats to the elephant roaming on the coastal plain. Elephant were killed or injured by the military for ivory, or were injured or killed by landmines during this war.357 The then KwaZulu Department of Conservation made a decision in 1989 to elephant proof the northern South African Mozambique boundary to confine the resident elepha nt in the protected area. The purpose was to make the existing population serve as a seed population to restock the southern Mozambique areas on the establishment of the Usuthu -Tembe -Futi Transfrontier sub -Conservation Area. This was -component of the broader Lubombo Transfrontier Conservation Area.358 The containment of the elephant within, and the subsequent expansion of, the Tembe Elephant Park has resulted in significant impacts on the vegetation therein, and particularly on the sensitive Sand Forest . This has prompted research on the concern359 and the conservation agency took steps to slow or halt the rate of increase in the number of elephant.360 5.3.2 Cultural Significance of the Tembe Elephant Park and Surroundings South Africa, including the Maputaland region in which the Tembe Elephant Park is located, is a culturally diverse country. The park and surrounding areas have been recorded as containing stone flakes and stone tools that date back to 356 Part of the international border between South Africa and Mozambique forms the northern boundary of the protected area . 357 Roelof J Kloppers, 'Border Crossings: Life in the Mozambique/South Africa Borderland Since 1975' 1, 68 (D Phil Thesis (Anthropology), University of Pretoria 2005). 358 See Peace Parks Foundation's website <http:// www.peaceparks.co.za/tfca.php?pid=19&mid=1006> accessed 29 July 2014. 359 See generally DDG Lagendijk, Respondent L Mackey, BR Page and R Slotow, 'The Effects of Herbivory by a Mega - and Mesoherbivore on Tree Recruitment in Sand Forest, South Africa' (2011) PLoS Rooy en, 'Effects of Water Dependence on the Utilization Pattern of Woody Vegetation by Elephants in the Tembe Elephant Park, Maputaland, South Africa' (2010) 48 African Journal of Ecology 126-134. 360 Fiona Macleod, 'Jab for Birth Control gets Jumbo Roll out', Mail & Guardian, 10 August 2012. 137 between 300,000 and 1.7 million years BP.361 The archaeologica l record also indicates an array of early and late Iron Age pottery, grinders and ceramic fragments \u2014 the oldest of which date back to first Bantu -speaking agriculturists that entered KwaZulu -Natal from Eastern Africa approximately 1600 years ago.362 The cul tural significance of the area is also related to a fusion of Tonga, Swazi, and Zulu cultures there \u2014 overlain by an influx of refugees during the 1815 Zulu Wars and later during the Mozambican War (1975 - 1992).363 The area has also evolved culturally and economically as a 'frontier life style', following the division of the Mabudu chiefdom in the British South Africa and Portuguese Mozambique nations by the 1875 MacMahon Award.364 This award supported most of Portugal's claims over those of Great Britain. The boundary was not, however, put into effect until 1888, when a joint boundary commission comprising the United Kingdom, Portugal, Swaziland, and the South African Republic was established to resolve the remaining boundary disputes between Mozambique, Sw aziland and South Africa. In respect of the Mozambique/ Natal boundary, the resolution of the commission was recorded in Article III of an Anglo -Portuguese Treaty of 11 June 1891 which states that 'Great Britain engages not to make any objection to the extension of the sphere of influence of Portugal, south of Delagoa Bay, as far as a line following the parallel of the confluence of the River Pongolo with the River Maputo365 to the sea -coast'.366 Star Camp' (Thlahlo Environmental 2012) <www.sahra.org.za/ findreports > accessed 29 July 2014. 362 Ibid. 363 Kloppers, Border Life in the Mozambique/South Africa (n 21) at 50 and 215. 364 In 1861, Navy Captain Bickford declared the area stretching from this area to Inhaca and Elephant islands as British territory. This act finally culminated in a dispute in 1872 between Great Britain and Portugal, which was submitted to French president Adolphe Thiers for arbitration. Thiers failed to do so and his successor, Marshal MacMahon, declared in favour of the Portuguese on 19 April 1875 (the \"MacMahon Award\").

While most of these events make use of existing facilities such as chapels and picnic spots, others take place in natural areas and occasionally in areas classified as 'wilderness.'369 The latter category, in accordance with the permissions granted, may not result in any significant damage or the use of vehicles off the established road network. Furthermore, protected areas in KwaZulu -Natal, and elsewhere, contain spiritual sites such as graves of various ancestors and leaders370 and sacred roc k art paintings and etchings.371 Many sites are still visited and used by people for cultural and spiritual reasons.372 The Church of Nazareth Baptists (known as the Shembe Church) was founded by the Zulu healer -prophet Isaiah Shembe (1870 -1935) in the early 20th Century, following a revelation and covenant on Nhlangakazi mountain in central KwaZulu - Natal.373 The followers of this religion revere Isaiah Shembe as an African 367 Roelof J Kloppers, 'History of the Mabudu -Tembe', Masters Thesis, University of Stellenbosch 1, 60 (2003). 368 'KwaPuza' \u2014 iSiZulu word for 'a place where people can drink' or a 'place where the drinker s are.' 369 Wilderness is defined as an area \"for the purpose of retaining an intrinsically wild appearance and character or capable of being restored to such and which is undeveloped and roadless, without permanent improvements or human habitation\" (Section 1, National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act 2003). 370 For example, the graves of King Shaka's ancestors in the eMakhosini Ophathe Heritage Park, KwaZulu Natal, and Rhode's burial place in the Matopos National Park Zimbabwe. 371 Many of the rock art shelters in the Ukhahlamba -Drakensberg Park World Heritage Site are considered to be shrines or reliquaries of San ancestors, which are still revered in local San communities. 372 The presence of this living heritage within protected areas was the key o bjective requiring the incorporation of the provision in sub -section 42(3) that provides for co - management and harmonises the management of cultural resources. 373 Now the site of an annual pilgrimage for the Shembe Church, on the first Sunday of the New Yea r. 139 'messiah'. According to Shembe lore, God conferred on him the founding principles (mixture of Zulu tradition and Christianity) of the Church, and extraordinary powers to heal the sick, to interact with and command animals, and to communicate with the universe and spiritual beings. Over time, the Shembe Church has become a prominent reli gion in KwaZulu -Natal and beyond, with over six million followers.374 The Shembe Church traditionally use open -air places of worship that typically comprise a mown -grassed area, with white -painted rocks placed in a circle to demarcate the ceremonial site. Recently, conservation staff working with the Tembe Elephant Park, who are also members of the Shembe Church, cleared an area of approximately 400 m2 of potentially sensitive vegetation to establish a place of worship near to their accommodation within the protected area. The establishment of the place of worship triggered a question whether such action was in accordance with the purpose and conservation use of the protected area. Furthermore, given the process followed in identifying the site and its use th ereafter, the Shembe staff asserted that the site constituted a heritage site in terms of the National Heritage Resources Act, 1999, and as such, senior management were both duty and legally bound to ensure that the site was retained and protected fo r worship. The objectives of this paper are threefold. These are to evaluate: a) The role and significance of the Public Trust Doctrine in protected area management with particular reference to the establishment of the Shembe worship site. b) Whether the establishment of a Shembe worship site within a protected area is in accordance with the provisions of the South African National Environmental Management Protected Areas Act375 and the Regulations thereto; c) Whether such a site qualifies as heritage site in terms of the National 374 I Hexham, 'amaNazaretha' in Stephen D Glazier (ed), Pentacostalism in Africa Encyclopedia of African and African -American Religions Minds' Natal Witness 3 (Pietermaritzburg, 18 May 2010). 375 South Africa, Act 57 of 2003. Hereafter referred to as NEMPA. 140 Heritage Resources Act, 1999.376 5.5 ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION 5.5.1 The Public Trust Doctrine The common law public trust doctrine is considered to have its origins in the Justinian Institutes of Roman law.377 The public trust doctrine was evolved in the context of the public rights over submerged land under navigable waters. Resultantly, the submerged land under navigable waters was considered as a common property. This concept of common property, and therein public rights, were subsequently incorporated into the Magna Charta and became a part of English common law, where the Crown held these lands for the benefit of its subjects.378 The recognition of the importance of the doctrine in safeguarding the public int erest has been advanced in the United States of America since its debut in Illinois Central Railroad Company v Illinois.379,380 Further, the role of the doctrine in environmental decision -making has been advanced by various scholars. For example, in his semina l article, The Public Trust Doctrine in Natural Resource Law: Effective Judicial Intervention , Joseph Sax introduced the concept of using the public trust doctrine as a tool for judicial protection of natural resources. He argued that the \"central substant ive thought\" in public trust litigation is \"[w]hen a state holds a resource which is available for the free use of the general public, a court will look with considerable scepticism upon any government conduct which is calculated either to reallocate that resource to more restricted uses or to subject 376 South Africa, Act 25 of 1999. 377 P Redmond, 'The Public Trust in Wildlife: Two Steps Forward, Two Steps Back' (2009) 49 Natural Resources Journal 249, 250. 378 TJ Conway, 'National Audubon Soci ety v.

The latter describes this case as the 'most famous assertion of the public trust theory'. 141 public uses to the self -interest of private parties\".381 Some commentators have described the doctrine as a principle that defines the purpose of government 'to promote the interests of the general public rather than to redistribute public goods from broad public uses to restricted private benefit'.382 There is no limitation placed on the nature of the term 'public'. For this reason, the term 'public' not only includes the current generation as beneficiary of the t rust but also future generations.383 The state, therefore \u2014 through its administrative organs, for example the conservation agency \u2014 has a duty to administer, protect, manage, and conserve the resource not only for the current generation, but also has an affirmative duty or obligation to preserve the resource for future generations.384 Should it be shown that the state's actions are inconsistent with the public trust, the mandate of the organ of state undertaking the trust function ought to be withdrawn.385,386 Thus, the Public Trust Doctrine represents a legal tool that enables or empowers citizens to fight unsustainable use of resources that should be protected for the common good.387 These resources were determined to include both biodiversity and ecosystem service s388 as was argued in National Audubon Society v Superior Court (the Mono Lake case),389 ,390 M C Mehta v Kamal Nath,391 and elsewhere. 381 JL Sax, 'The Public Trust Doctrine in Natural Resources Law: Effective Judicial Intervention' (1970) Mich.

The Bill of Rights in South Afric a's Constitution grants to everyone a right to, inter alia, have the \"environment protected for the benefit of present and future generations through reasonable legislative and other measures\" by \"preventing pollution and ecological degradation, promoting conservation\", and finally securing \"ecologically sustainable development and use of natural resources while promoting justifiable economic and social development\".395 The re -codification of this 'environmental right'396 into the preamble of the National Envir onmental Management Act,397 makes this statute the key framework conduit to fulfil this right.398 The NEMA openly state s the application of the Public Trust Doctrine,399 and characterises it in a series of operating principles that guide any organ of state that exercises any function that concerns the protection of the environment.400 These include: placing people and their needs at the forefront of decision making401 and ensuring that all development is sustainable402 by avoiding disturbances t o the ecosystem, the loss of biological diversity and sites that constitute the nation's cultural heritage;403 392 Redmond (n 41) at 251. 393 South Africa, Act 108 of 1996. Hereafter referred to the as 'the Constituti on'. 394 Takacs (n 51) 723. 395 Section 24. 396 This term does not imply that the 'environment' has rights, but rather serves to describe a fundamental human right to have a safe environment. 397 South Africa, Act 107 of 1998. Hereon referred to as 'NEMA.' 398 M Kidd, Environmental Law 32 (Juta and Company Ltd 2008). 399 Section 2(4)(o). 400 Section 2(1). 401 Section 2(2). 402 Section 2(3). 403 Subsections 4(a)(i) and (iii). 143 uses of ecosystems are within resilience levels;404 impacts on people's environmental rights are to be avoided or made good.405 The Doctrine is further operationalised in the NEMA by giving protection to whistle -blowers who act in good faith to protect the environment. The NEMA also grants any person or group of persons \u2014 who believe that a decision taken by the state or the actions taken by a private par ty are, inter alia , harmful to either the environment or people's environmental rights or contrary to any statutory provision that provides for the protection of the environment \u2014 the right to approach the courts for remedies.406 This locus is granted not on ly if the relief is sought \"in that person's or group of persons' own interest\" \u2014 but is extended to include \"the interest of, or on behalf of, a person who is, for practical reasons, unable to institute such proceedings [for example future generations]; i n the public interest; or in the interest of protecting the environment\".407 The NEMA further grants the court the discretion not to award costs where a person or persons have reasonably acted in pursuance of protecting the environment.408 Removing the deterre nt of costs enables the public to bring legal action to safeguard the environment and therein ensuring the integrity of the public trust entity for current and future generations. Within the framework of NEMA, the title to section 3 of the National Enviro nmental Management Biodiversity Act409 declares the state as the sole trustee of biodiversity and in so doing endeavours to bring into South African biodiversity legislation , the common law provisions of the Public Trust Doctrine. The provisions of this sect ion, however, do not state the Doctrine, but reaffirm the rights contained in section 24 of the Constitution. As discussed herein above, these provisions are synonymous with the duties imposed on the state by the Doctrine, in that a mandatory duty is place d on all organs of state who apply, inter alia, these two statutes to fulfil the environmental right by managing, conserving and sustaining South Africa's biodiversity,410 and act as a trustee of protected areas in the Republic of South Africa.411 Section 3 of both NEMBA and NEMPA further places 404 Subsections 4(a)(vi). 405 2(4)(a)(viii). 406 Section 32(1). 407 Section 32(1) (a) to (e). 408 Section 32(2). 409 South Africa, Act 10 of 2004. Hereafter referred to as 'NEMBA'. 410 Section 3(a). 411 Section 3(a). 144 a duty on the state to implement the Act to achieve progressive realisation of environmental rights in the Constitution. Given that both the NEMBA and NEMPA are specific environmental management legislation established within the terms of NEMA,412 the application of this legislation must be guided by the NEMA principles. Furthermore, NEMBA provides a series of tools to give effect to the Public Trust Doctrine by: (a) a national biodiversity framework413 that provides for a co-ordinated and uniform approach to biodiversity management by, inter alia , organs of state in all spheres of government414 and ensuring that representative and viable samples of South Africa's biodiversity are conserved;415 and (b) in defining bioregions of t he country and developing management plans thereto416 as well as supplementary biodiversity plans for the conservation of either an ecosystem or for a specific species.417 Both the NEMBA and the NEMPA provide for monitoring of the achievement of aims and obje ctives of the legislation. While NEMBA requires any person, organisation or organ of state involved in biodiversity conservation to report regularly to the Minister, who in turn reports to Parliament on the trends and conservation status of biodiversity,418 the Act is silent on accountability and responsibility for the measured trends and conservation status of South Africa's biodiversity. NEMBA is also silent on the action or actions to be taken should the responsible organ of state fail to meet its predeter mined indicators that are set in place to ensure that the environmental right has been achieved and the provisions of the Public Trust Doctrine observed. In contrast, section 3 of the NEMPA specifically mandates the state to explicitly \"act as the trustee of protected areas in the Republic\" and to achieve the progressive realisation of the environmental right enshrined in the Constitution.419 This Act provides for the establishment of indicators against which monitoring of the performance of management author ities in achieving the objectives of the Act takes place and hence the 412 See the definition of Specific Environmental Management Acts, section 1 of NEMA. 413 Section 38. 414 Section 39(1)(a). 415 Section 39(1)(c). 416 See sections 38 and 39. 417 Section 43. 418 See Section 49. 419 Section 3(a) and (b). 145 application of the Public Trust Doctrine occurs.420 The Act also provides for the state to undertake corrective intervention where a management authority of a protected area fails to perf orm its duties, or under -performs.421 The state may also terminate, if needed, a management authority's mandate to manage the protected area and assign another organ of state the mandate of the management authority.422 In case the actions of the conservation a uthority are inconsistent with the provision of public trust duties \u2014 by failing to adequately accomplish the requirements of NEMPA \u2014 the state may withdraw the mandate of the conservation authority. 5.5.3 Public Trust Doctrine in South African Heritage Jurisprudence In contrast to NEMPA and NEMBA, and in particular NEMA, the National Heritage Resources Act (NHRA) follows a perplexing approach to the Public Trust Doctrine in conserving heritage resources \u2014 in that Section 5(1)(b)423 levies a 'moral respons ibility' on the public 'to act as a trustee'. In the absence of clarification in the Act, the term 'to act' must assume a colloquial meaning, namely to behave in a specified way or to perform or play the part of. Thus the Act appears to set in place the ex act antithesis to that contemplated by the Doctrine. This is done by confusing the roles and responsibilities of the state and the public by assigning a trust responsibility on the beneficiary of the trust and restricting the state's obligation solely to t he management of heritage resources. It further appears to provide a dais for the state to relinquish its trust obligations in conserving heritage resources for current and future generations. The question arises as to the nature of the 'moral responsibil ity' and whether it is fundamentally different from that contemplated by the Public Trust Doctrine, and whether it includes a fiduciary obligation on the public as a 'trustee. ' Common law pertaining to trusts requires any trust obligation to be clearly def ined and this should spell out the uses to which the trust object is to be, or may not be applied. 420 See Section 43. 421 Section 44(1). 422 Section 44(2). 423 \"[E]very generation has a moral responsibility to act as trustee of the national heritage for succeeding generations and the State has an obligation to manage heritage resources in the interests of all South Africans\" (own emphasis). 146 Likewise, a libellous breach of duty by a trustee needs to be clearly defined \u2014 particularly when such a breach could result in a significant loss in the tru st object (viz. South Africa's heritage resources). The NHRA is, however, silent on the moral duties the public are mandated to assume and thus the concept of 'morality' must assume a common understanding. Traditionally, a 'moral responsibility' is interpr eted as deserving of, inter alia , blame, reward, or punishment for an act or omission \u2014 in accordance with one's moral obligations.424 It is a common tendency, therefore, to presume that a person's responsibility is dependent on whether that person has fulfi lled a set of objectives and justifiable requirements or values on being responsible. Values are, however, considered subjective, vary across individuals and cultures, and are in many ways aligned with belief and belief systems \u2014 and thus the morals and va lues of an individual may not necessarily equate to those of a broader society. This is particularly relevant in a country like South Africa with its diverse cultural heritage. The individual trustee's conduct, therefore, by either acting or, importantly, not reacting to a detrimental use of a heritage resource, risks being contra bonos mores and inadvertently non - compliant with the trust provision of the Act. This observation is particularly relevant given the NHRA's all -encompassing and far reaching defin ition of cultural resources.425 Despite this risk, the Act \u2014 and particularly the principles for management of heritage resources426 \u2014 is silent on the requirements to determine whether a trustee has acted in a 'morally' acceptable manner and hence brings into question whether such obligation is legally binding. The Act is, however, explicit on the duties and responsibilities to be undertaken by the state \u2014 for example 'rights, duties and exemptions of state and supported bodies' and 'protection and management of heritage resources'427 and so on. These are predominantly those duties conventionally exercised by the trustee in accordance with the Public Trust Doctrine. The Act, therefore, appears to remove the trusteeship duties already conferred to the public, and reassigns the conventional 424 A Eshleman, 'Moral Responsibility' in Edward N. Zalta (ed), The Stanford of Philosophy (Winter 2009 Edition) <http://plato.stanford.edu/archi ves/win2009/ entries/moral -responsibility> accessed 25 May 2014. 425 A heritage resource is defined in section 1 as \"any place or object of cultural significance, where significance is defined as any object having an aesthetic, architectural, historical, sci entific, social, spiritual, linguistic or technological value or significance\". 426 Section 6. 427 Section 9 and Part 2 and Chapter II of the Act respectively. 147 trusteeship responsibilities to the state. This affirmation is further supported by the requirement that the state is to be treated as a trustee by any individual who intends to undertake a development activity that may impact on any component of a heritage resource \u2014 by way of an application to the heritage authority.428 Thus the intention of a 'trustee' in section 5(1)(b) must be profoundly different from that contemplated in the Public Trust Doctrine. It is recognised that a significant proportion of heritage objects,429 as with items of biodiversity, are in private ownership, and it is likely \u2014 given the large number that may occur in South Africa \u2014 that relatively few of these have been formally protected.430 It is thus incumbent on the owner of the heritage resource to recognise it as a heritage object, and then apply the conditions of NHRA to ensure that its integrity is not lost. Thus, it may appear that the intention of the Act with respect to moral trusteeship confer red on the public may extend no further than a requirement of the legal owner of the heritage object to safeguard that object so as to accomplish the purposes of the Act as expressed in the long title: namely to 'empower civil society to nurture and conser ve their heritage resources so that they may be bequeathed to future generations'. Whilst the Act enables the public to request the Minister or relevant member of the Executive Council431 to declare the object as being of 'special national significance',432 part of the 'national estate',433 or 'worthy of conservation',434 the Act fails to confer any power or legal authority435 to the owner of the heritage object and thus falls short of providing meaningful fulfilment of the 'empowerment' envisioned in the long title of the Act. This observation is underscored by the absence of any provision in the Act that would enable delegation of powers or duties to a private owner of a heritage object. 428 See, for example, sections 27(18), 29(10), 32(13) and 32(19). 429 Section 1 and 3 provides a list of objects that are expressly protected in terms of this Act, and covers the spectrum between moveable and immoveable objects. 430 Section 7 of the Act provides for a conservation grading of heritage resources. 431 Commonly known as the Provincial Minister. 432 Section 7(1)(a). 433 Section 7(1)(b). 434 Section 7(1)(c). 435 Here empowerment is interpreted as \"to give (someone) the authority or power to do something\" Oxford English Dictionary (2013) Oxford University Press. 148 5.5.4 The Protected Area and Disturbance It is unlikely that the conservation agenc y would locate staff accommodation in a sensitive portion of the protected area, as this would potentially be in conflict with the purpose of establishing the protected area. Likewise it is unlikely that the clearing and levelling of the worship site of 40 0 m2 (an insignificant portion of the 300 km2 protected area) near or within an area designated for staff accommodation, would make a significant impact on the integrity of the protected area. Thus it could be argued that such disturbance is likely to be i nsignificant \u2014 warranting no further consideration by conservation authorities. Alternatively, it may be argued that cumulatively, together with the impacts associated with elephants, tourism436 and management infrastructure, the impact of the worship site is potentially significant at a habitat, vegetation type or protected area scale. The incremental accumulation of impacts is described by American economist Alfred E Kahn in his essay437 regarding a \"tyranny of small decisions\" or what might be called \"small decisions effects\".438 Kahn describes circumstances where a series of individually small rational decisions (or indecisions) can negatively impact subsequent choices and reach a point where desirable alternatives (i.e. the integrity of protected area) are i rreversibly destroyed. Fuggle and Rabie439 describe this as an 'insidious problem' that leads to unregulated degradation of the natural environment440 and the implications with regard to the integrity of the protected area being unclear. It thus stands to reason, therefore, that the degradation of the natural environment in a protected area, as a result of the cumulative permissions (or indecisions) granted, may be largely a result of the management authority's failure to provide adequate protection, at the dec ision-making level, of the natural resources on behalf of current and future generations. A similar notion is proposed by Stack and 436 The Park already has a network of tourist roads and game -viewing hides and an upmarket safari tent lodge. 437 See AE Kahn, 'The Tyranny of Small Decisions: Market Failures, Imperfections, and the Limits of Economics' (1966) 19/1 Kvklos : 23. 438 WE Odum, 'Environmental Degradation and the Tyranny of Small D ecisions' (1982) 32/9 BioScience 728. 439 RF Fuggle and MA Rabie (eds), Environmental Concerns in South Africa: Technical and Legal Perspectives 93 (Juta and Company Ltd 1983). 440 Ibid. 149 Vandenbergh as the 'One Percent Problem' \u2014 where cumulative impacts of small, seemingly insignificant actions cause incremen tal degradation.441 By way of example, Stack and Vandenbergh highlight the consequence of exempting a party from regulation (e.g. the Shembe worshippers) on the justification that the action would contribute to less than one percent of the problem ( viz. the erosion of the integrity of the protected area or a sensitive vegetation type therein). In so doing, Stack and Vandenbergh bring to the fore the role of the state (in this case the management authority) in contributing to the vulnerability and degrada tion of the natural environment (the protected area or sensitive vegetation type)442 \u2014 by not providing a mechanism to prevent accumulation of seemingly insignificant actions. Stack and Vandenberg argue that authorities tend to use their discretion to make decisions of convenience. They point out that in a situation where contributors to a regulatory problem (in this case, human -induced impacts on the natural environment) are very low -percentage contributors, the small size is taken by the authority as an exc use to exempt them from regulation. They conclude that '[i]f too many are exempted, public goods are imperilled'.443 In addition to exemption, a significant proportion of environmental degradation is in one way or another positively granted by way of a decis ion or other authorising mechanism.444 Thus, by way of this reasoning, it is argued that each decision taken by the conservation authority requires consideration of the public trust duties of that authority. Further, and importantly, it is a consideration f or the conservation agency that allowing one religious group to establish a worship site by clearing the natural areas, may prompt others to do the same. Likewise, the followers of the Shembe Church (or other religions for that matter) may argue that they need to be given the same opportunity in other protected areas. 441Dave Owen, 'Critical Habitat and the Challenge of Regulating Small Harms ' (2012) 64 Fla. L. Rev. 141, 142. 442 Other protected areas might be vulnerable to other religious groups wanting to create similar facilities to further their spiritual wellbeing \u2014 citing the Tembe case as a precedent. 443 KM Stack and MP Vandenbergh, 'The One Percent Problem' (2011) 111(7) Columbia Law Review 1385. 444 M Wood, 'Advancing the Sovereign Trust of Government to Safeguard the Environment for Present and Future Generations (Part I): Ecological Realism and the Need for a Paradigm Shift' (2009) 39/1 Environmental Law 25, 43. 150 5.5.5 Protected Areas and Spiritual Sites The NEMPA provides 12 purposes for which protected areas may be declared,445 of which the majority (nine) are directly related to the conservation of biodiv ersity.446 The remaining three are focused on the provision of ecosystem services,447 tourism448 and 'generally, to contribute to human, social, cultural, spiritual [...] development' (own emphasis).449 Whilst it may be argued that the establishment of a Shembe wors hip site within a protected area is prima facie in compliance with this purpose, the reading of this purpose of a protected area must be undertaken within the context of the intention of the Act, which is characterised by the long title of the Act, namely: 'the protection and conservation of ecologically viable areas representative of South Africa's biological diversity and its natural landscapes and seascapes'. The relationship between biodiversity and spiritual enrichment has been well recognised as one o f the key benefits of protected areas.450 This has been recognised in the Convention of Biodiversity.451 The relationship has also been recognised in various African multilateral agreements providing for the conservation of biodiversity.452 The emergent benefit that arises from the relationship between biodiversity and spiritual enrichment that protected areas provide, however, is dissimilar if not unrelated to the establishment of a worship site by the Shembe staff members. In the latter ca se, there appears to be no prerequisite, save for convenience , for the Shembe worship site to be located in a location typical of the indigenous character of the area. Furthermore, it appears to be uncommon for protected areas to be used for the establishm ent of worship sites.453 Dudley et al. explored various ways in which faith and 445 Section 17. 446 Included herein is the management of the \"interrelationship between natural environmental biodiversity, human settlement and economic development\", which speaks directly to the ultimate purpose of the Tembe Elephan t Park as a protected area. 447 Section 448 Section 17(g). 449 Section 17(l). 450 P Seligmann et al., Centers for Biodiversity Conservation: Bringing Together Science, Partnerships, and Human Well -being to Scale up Conservation Outcomes 13 ( Conservation International 2007). 451 Preamble to the Convention. 452 See, for example, the characterisation of protected areas in Annex 2 of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. 453 N Dudley, L Higgins -Zogib and S Mansourian, Beyond Belie f - Linking Faiths and Protected Areas for Biodiversity Conservation, (WWF International Research Report 2005). 151 protected areas interact \u2014 with two principal values emerging. The first was the direct protection of sacred species and sites, and the second the influence of nature on follower 's beliefs.454 The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) expanded this research from 100 to 300 protected areas455 and failed to demonstrate that protected areas are either traditionally or occasionally selected to establish new places of worship \u2014 but rather continued to emphasise the importance of the establishment of protected areas to protect the existing and well established spiritual sites. Furthermore, the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage recognises the importance of cultural an d spiritual heritage within protected areas.456 While the Convention has adopted a wide definition of cultural heritage,457 this recognition458 does not extend to include protected areas as being desirable for the establishment of new places of worship. Whilst the purposes of establishing a protected area in the NEMPA includes contributing 'to human, social, cultural, spiritual and economic development',459 it is unlikely that this objective embraces the concept of clearing areas of natural vegetation for the esta blishment of a place of worship. The activity undertaken by the Shembe staff would thus be deemed incompatible with the purpose of establishing the Tembe Elephant Park. This notion is further supported by the Regulations to the Act, in that the establishme nt and use of the Shembe worship site may be considered an offence,460 as it is mandatory for authorisation to be obtained from the Management Authority in order to, inter alia, 'intentionally 454 Liza Higgins -Zogib, The Spiritual Dimension of Protected Areas: Overlooked and Undervalued Quoted in Protected Areas in Today's World: Their V alues and Benefits for the Welfare of the Planet 50 (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Technical Series 6 2008). 455 Ibid., 119. 456 UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, 2003, Article 1. 457 Cultural Heritage is defined by UNESCO as \"oral traditions, performing arts, social practices, rituals, festive events, knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe or the knowledge and skills to produce traditional crafts\" (see www.unesco.org). 458 The same is reflected by the IUCN in their recognition of cultural heritage in protected areas. See the IUCN WCPA Cultural and Spiritual Values Specialist Group <http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/ gpap_home/gpap_people/gpap_tilcepa/ gpap_spiritual/> Accessed 25 July 2014 and, generally, Dudley (n 117). 459 Section 17. 460 Regulation 54. 152 disturb any species or specimen in a nature reserve',461 'cut, dama ge, remove or destroy or be in possession of any plant or any part thereof ',462 or 'pick parts of, or cut, chop off, uproot, damage or destroy, any specimen in a nature reserve',463 or undertake an organised cultural event or special activity in a nature rese rve. Management of protected areas must be in accordance with the protected area management plan.464 This plan sets in place the foundation adaptive management framework for the protected area465 based on an approach466 which excludes matters relating to human -induced disturbance other than the management of extractive harvesting of plant and animal resources.467 The plan does, however, refer to the need for compliance with the conservation agency's internal operational policies, of which the Integrated Environmen tal Management Policy applies.468 This operational policy requires the protected area management to 'avoid or reduce any adverse effects', having undertaken or caused to have undertaken an appropriate impact assessment where adverse environmental impacts on natural or visitor environments are anticipated. Thus it is likely that the notion of a Shembe worship site within the bounds of the protected area would need to be made known to the conservation authority in order for a principled decision to be taken in an open and transparent manner. 5.5.6 Cultural Heritage The National Heritage Resources Act469 views South Africa's heritage as 'unique and precious', and that it cannot be renewed. It is also seen as contributing to defining the county's cultural identity, and thus lies 'at the heart of [of South Africa's] spiritual well -being, and affirms the cou ntry's diverse cultures, and in so 461 Regulation 33(1)(c). 462 Regulation 33(1)(g). 463 Regulation 33(1 )(j). 464 Section 40(1)(b) of the NEMPA. 465 See Tembe Elephant Park Integrated Management Plan 2009 -2013 (2009) at 107, <http://www.kznwildlife.com/index.php/conservation/planning/protected -area- management -planning.html> accessed 25 July 2014. 466 Section 6.5. 1 at 46. 467 Section 6.7 at 51. 468 See Documents and Policies at the Conservation Organisation's website, <http://www.kznwildlife.com/index.php/conservation/biodiverity -research -and- assessment > accessed 25 July 2014. 469 South Africa, Act 25 of 1999. 153 doing shape [South Africa's] national character'.470 The question arises is whether the establishment of a Shembe Church of Nazareth worship site in the middle of a nature reserve in South Africa constitutes cultural herita ge \u2014 as claimed by those who created the site. The Act defines living heritage as 'intangible aspects of inherited culture' which may include cultural tradition, oral history, performance, ritual, popular memory, skills and techniques, indigenous knowledge systems, and the holistic approach to nature, society and social relationships.471 In order to qualify, the worship site must have exceptional qualities that would be determined by a heritage assessment, and to be of special provincial and national signific ance.472 Other than being a roughly circular area of cut grass, the Shembe worship site is devoid of cultural artefacts or objects. The practicing of the Shembe religion at that site \u2014 in a manner comparable to countless other similar worship sites in South Africa \u2014 cannot be argued as being a unique or reasonably exceptional oral tradition in order for it to qualify as a living heritage site. Thus the claim that the Shembe worship site within Tembe Elephant Park qualifies to the contrary is without substanc e. 5.6 CONCLUSION The establishment of a Shembe Church of Nazareth Baptists worship site within the Tembe Elephant Park without permission from the Management Authority is in conflict with the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act. Furthermo re, given its recent establishment and the absence of extraordinary or significant heritage objects or traditional oral history, the site cannot reasonably be considered protected in terms of the National Heritage Resources Act. Had permission been sought, the Management Authority would have been required to consider the application in terms of the purpose of the establishment of the protected area, the provisions of the management plan, and various operational policies that may be in force. This considerat ion \u2014 together with an assessment of the cumulative human -induced disturbances within the protected area \u2014 would be required to determine whether the duty of trust to safeguard the protected 470 Preamble of the Act. 471 Section 1. 472 Section 27(a) and (b). 154 area and the biodiversity therein would be compromised. The cumul ative impacts of seemingly small, anthropogenic disturbance pose a threat to the integrity of protected areas and thus risk undermining the conservation agencies' ability to give effect to their trusteeship obligations. The fate of the Shembe worship site lies in the hands of the operational policies and practices of the conservation agency. It is further concluded that South Africa's biodiversity, and particularly the protected area legislation, embraces the contemporary understanding of the Public Trust Doctrine. South Africa's heritage legislation, however, appears to have confused the roles of the state and the public, and in so doing renders application of the doctrine to the conservation of heritage resources problematic. 155 CHAPTER 6: LEGAL AND PUBLIC TRUST CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE NDUMO GAME RESERVE AND SOUTH AFRICA -MOZAMBIQUE BORDER, FOLLOWING THE MIGRATION OF THE USUTHU RIVER 156 JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN PUBLIC LAW VOLUME 30 PART 2 OF 2015 Legal and Public Trust Considerations for the Ndumo Game Reserve and South Africa -Mozambique border, following the migration of the Usuthu River Andrew Blackmore*1 6.1 ABSTRACT The Usuthu River forms part of the international boundary between South Africa and Mozambique. In 2002, this River breached its south bank within the Ndumo Game Reserve and established a new channel within the protected area. In response to the breach, Moz ambique proposed the excavation of the floodplain and the establishment of berms to force the flow of the river back into its original alignment. Analysis of the origin and associated history of this portion of the international boundary indicates that it is unlikely that the international boundary has moved with the breech. Furthermore, customary international law pertaining to avulsion or mutation alvei of rivers supports the notion that the international boundary remained in the original channel of the U suthu River. Finally, case history of a similar circumstance in Africa affirms that this boundary is unlikely to have shifted with the avulsion of the Usuthu River.

This paper is one of a series of papers forming a PhD which is focused on exploring the significance and scope of the public trust doctrine in the conservation of biodiversity, and the management of protected areas in South Africa. 157 brings to the fore an array of public trust considerations which ar e founded in South Africa's Constitution, and environmental and biodiversity conservation legislation. These considerations prohibit the excavation of the Ndumo Game Reserve. The concept of the state acting as a trustee for, inter alia, biodiversity and pr otected areas, is reinforced by various water and biodiversity -orientated multilateral agreements to which South Africa is a signatory. Within these, the ones adopted by the Southern African Development Community are the most profound in that they, and spe cifically the Protocol on Wildlife Conservation and Law Enforcement, enjoin state parties from taking decisions that may cause damage to the trust entity beyond the limits of their sovereignty.

The northern boundary of the Ndumo Game Reserve is the Usuthu River, and the nature reserve includes the confluence of this river with the Pongola River and th e floodplains of the two (Figure 1). The origins of the Usuthu River are within eastern South Africa and Swaziland, and exit the latter via the Lebombo Mountain Range, onto the Makhathini flats and coastal plain \u2014 before draining into the south section of Maputo Bay. As the river approaches and enters Ndumo Game Reserve, it enters its alluvial floodplain system where the river naturally meanders, leaving in its wake a series of oxbow lakes and bowed wetlands. The meandering is caused by continued deposition within the river channel and concomitant erosion of the 2 Also known as the Riv er (Rio) Maputo in Mozambique. Originally, the name of this river was spelled as 'Usutu' \u2014 which is incorrect spelling in isiZulu. Recent texts use the correct spelling of 'Usuthu\". For convenience and consistency, unless the original name is quoted, the correct spelling is used throughout this document. 158 banks, whereas the lakes are a result of avulsion and the creation of new river channel within the floodplain.3 In 2002, the Usuthu River breached its southern bank within the Ndumo Game Reserve, an d began flowing southwards into the middle of the protected area, before making its way back to the main channel upstream to its confluence with the Pongola River (Figure 1). The breach and subsequent avulsion of the river southwards, poses a dilemma as to whether the international boundary separating the two countries \u2014 and with this the boundary of the Ndumo Game Reserve \u2014 has moved.4 This would allow Mozambique to gain sovereign rights of the Usuthu floodplain within Ndumo Game Reserve. This dilemma incl udes amongst other things, concerns regarding sovereignty of a portion of game reserve, and, naturally, the security of biodiversity therein. Further, Mozambique has recommended a series of remedial interventions to restore the Usuthu River back to its ori ginal alignment, which requires excavation and the location of earth berms within the Usuthu River floodplain. These challenges foreground the role of the public trust doctrine in decisions taken by the South African government \u2014 in order to safeguard the integrity of the Ndumo Game Reserve. The purpose of this paper is consider whether the international boundary between South Africa and Mozambique has moved with the southerly migration of the Usuthu River. The answer to this question lies in the origins an d history of the boundary, international common and case law \u2014 together with an understanding of the geomorphology of that part of the river occurring within the Ndumo Game Reserve. This paper also evaluates the role the application of the public trust doctrine should play in decision -making that may arise out of South Africa's environmental legislation, and various SADC5-based multilateral agreements set 3 Hans-Henrik Stolum 'River Meandering as a Self -Organization Process' (1996) Science 271 at 1711. 4 J.W.

This declaration also included part of the Native Reserve 16 \u2014 the northern boundary of which extended along the Usuthu River to a point one mile east of the confluence of the Usuthu and Pongola Rivers.9 This northern boundary of the Ndumo Game Reserve, as discussed below, corresponds to the international boundary separating South Africa and Mozambique. Since 1924, the protected area has undergone a number of re -declaration s that mostly dealt with changes in legislation. Of these, the most significant of the re -declarations was the release of Ndumo Game Reserve, by the Natal Province, to the newly established KwaZulu Government following the establishment of the 'independent homeland of Republic of Seychelles, Republic of South Africa, Kingdom of Swaziland, United Republic of Tanzania, Republic of Zambia, and Republic of Zimbabwe. 6 The Ndumo Game Reserve was administered by the then provincial conservation agency, which, over time, evolved into the present -day Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife. 7 Declaration of the Ndumo Game Reserve was in accordance with the provisions of section 17(1) of the Game Ordinance 2 of 1912. 8 Ndumo Game Reserve: Management Plan, compiled i n accordance with section 39 of the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act 57 of 2003 <http://www.kznwildlife.com/index.php African Perspectives on the Relationship between Transfrontier Conservation Areas and the Protection of Rights' in Louis J.

In this 1988 declaration,10 the northern boundary of the protected area was described as the international boundary with Mozambique to the confluence of the Usuthu and Pongola Rivers.11 During 1997, the Ndumo Game Reserve was listed a s a Ramsar site \u2014 particularly as it includes the largest remaining natural portions of the Usuthu and Pongola floodplains. This floodplain system formed the foundation of the Ramsar application due to its uniqueness in South Africa, as it comprises five w etland types including permanent to ephemeral lakes, marshes and pools with riparian and gallery forest. The Ramsar listing also included the high abundance of internationally important wetland bird species, including many recorded as rare or vulnerable.12 The Ndumo Game Reserve forms part of the 'mini -Ndumu -Tembi - Futi Transfrontier Area' which came into being with the signing of the protocol (between South Africa, Mozambique and Swaziland) establishing the broader Lubombo Transfrontier Conservation and Reso urce Area in 2000.13 From a biodiversity conservation perspective, the Lubombo Transfrontier Conservation and Resource Area was set in place to provide a cooperative platform for these countries to conserve and protect representative samples of, and key cor ridors within, the Maputaland -Pondoland -Albany Hotspot or Maputaland Centre of Endemism \u2014 of which the Ndumo Game Reserve is one of the core areas.14 10 In terms of section 29(1) of the KwaZulu Nature Conservation Act 8 of 1975. 11 KwaZulu Government Notice 132 of 1988. 12 Extracted from Ndumo Nature Reserve - The Annotated Ramsar List: South Africa.

This became the trading headquarters throughout the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, until substituted by Delegoa Bay as the colony's capital in 189 8. King Nhaca ruled over a large area around Delagoa Bay, and his main settlement was west of the bay (now Maputo city) on the Umbeluzi River. In the Eighteenth Century, King Nhaca was defeated by the Tembe who conquered the entire region south of Maputo c ity between the Lubombo Mountains and the ocean. This expanded Tembe Kingdom was later ruled in two parts. The first covered the area between the Lubombo Mountains and the Maputo River, and the second covered the area east of the Maputo River and extended from Inhaca Island in the north into South Africa. The colonial alignment of the Natal Colony - Mozambique border was thus based on the southern boundary of the Thembe Kingdom. The formalisation of territorial claims in 1752, therefore, resulted in a boundar y separating the two countries which is not dissimilar to the present boundary. The southern boundary was challenged in 1853 by Captain W.F.W. Owen of the Royal Navy, when he discovered that the Portuguese, having suffered extensively from malaria, did not exercise sufficient authority over the lands and the local people15 to the south of the Louren\u00e7o Marques settlement in Delegoa Bay to justify International, 2007); and Conservation International, Biodive rsity Hotspots (2007), <www.biodiversityhotspots.org> accessed 25 July 2014. 15 Here, Owen reasoned that the Portuguese had apparently advised him that he (Owen) had to negotiate the safety of his boats with the local people, and the Portuguese had not exercised sufficient governance over the territory to claim possession. As a result, Owen further reasoned that the area secured by the Portuguese was limited to the range of their guns at the Portuguese Fort. See George McCall -Theal History of South Africa: F rom 1795 - 1872 Volume 1 (Ulan Press, 2011) at 129. 162 ownership of these areas.16 Realising the strategic importance of Delegoa Bay17 and claiming the area was terra nullius ,18 Captain Owen exercised the customary international law principle of effective occupation by concluding treaties of cession with the Tembe19 and hoisting the British Flag.20 The following year, Owen proceeded to establish a military presence21 and ad ministrative control in accordance with the customary international law principles of effective occupation22 and prescription.23 This action by Captain Owen effectively 16 Eric Anderson Walker (ed) The Cambridge History of the British Empire: South Africa, Rhodesia and the protectorates Volume VIII, Second Edition (Cambridge University Press 1969) at 453. 17 Given the then accelerated trade between Cape Town and Zanzibar, Muscat and the western seaboard of India. 18 Mabel V.

Prager, 1967) at 216 -7. 19 Various texts refer to this treaty being concluded with the Tembe \"Chiefs\" (correctly known as the amaKhosi) or directly with the Tembe King. In reality, given that the region was ruled by the Tembe King as two semi -autonomous areas, the treat ies would naturally need to be concluded with both amaKhosi and the Tembe King. 20 Territories which lacked a recognised social or political administration were considered terra nullius in international law, and sovereignty over these areas was established by effective occupation by a sovereign state. See Australia Mabo v. Queensland (1992) 175 CLR I at 21. 21 Under the pretext to defend the territory from the growing military might of the Zulu Kingdom to the south. 22 This principle was later codified in the General Act of the Berlin Conference (the Berlin Act) in 1885. Article 34 of the Berlin Act stated that colonial powers could acquire rights over colonial lands only if they took possession. Here possession entaile d, inter alia , concluding treaties with local leaders, hoisting their flag, and actively exercising law enforcement. 23 The customary international law principle of prescription is rooted in Roman law, wherein the possessor of a property whose original titl e to that property was defective could nonetheless acquire the title ( usucapio) \u2014 so long as the acquisition of the property was: 1) in good faith, 2) physically possessed ( corpus occupandi ) with the intent of ownership (animus occupandi ), and 3) possessed without interruption for an extended period of time 163 appropriated the southern portion of Mozambique from the Portuguese. The Portuguese objec ted to these actions by claiming Great Britain had illegally taken possession of the territory, and appealed to the international community to intervene. Following attempts by Portugal to reclaim the territory, Navy Captain Bickford, in 1861 re -declared t he area stretching from the present southern border to Inhaca and Elephant islands as British territory. This declaration included the Bay of Maputu. Furthermore, in 1868 the Transvaal President Marthinus Pretorius claimed a substantial corridor of this ar ea for the Transvaal Republic, this boundary being the Lebombo Mountains in the east, to Delagoa Bay. Following objections from Lisbon, the Transvaal President came to an agreement with the Portuguese, in which Portugal's sovereignty over the area that Tra nsvaal had originally claimed, was recognised. This resulted in the 29 July 1869 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Boundaries, Portugal and Transvaal Republic.24,25 Great Britain, however, continued to occupy the disputed territory. Finally, Portugal declar ed a dispute with Great Britain and lodged this with French president Adolphe Thiers for arbitration. Thiers failed to consider the application. With this strategic position not being effectively controlled by either Portugal or Great Britain, Portugal in 1872 petitioned Field Marshal MacMahon,26 the then which is often defined by law. See D.H.N. Johnson, Acquisitive Prescription in International Law (1950) 27 British Year Book of International Law at 334 -335. 2424 This treaty was later replaced by the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Boundaries, South African Republic and Portugal (11 December 1875 ), which re -confirmed (Article XXIII) the portions of the western boundary of Mozambique with South Africa (the then Transvaal state). The southern boundary in this treaty was not defined, as it appeared that clarity on ownership and use rights of the Delagoa Bay Railway (following its confiscation by Portugal in 1889) \u2014 which extended from Delagoa Bay (Maputo) through Swaziland to the Transvaal \u2014 had already bee n determined. See Edward Hertslet Map of Africa by Treaty (Frank Cass and Co London, 1909) at 705. 25 Interestingly, the subsequent convention between Great Britain and the Transvaal state ratified this boundary on 3 August 1881. 26 In terms of the protocol signed at Lisbon, 15 September, 187 (No. 142). See n 24 at 701. 164 president of the French Republic.27 MacMahon found that arguments from both parties claiming effective occupation were weak,28 but concluded that a temporary loss of control did not necessarily divest Portuga l of her sovereignty.29 MacMahon, however, awarded wholly in favour of the Portuguese in 1875, and re -established the southern limits of the Portuguese territory.30 In 1884, the Berlin Conference attempted to settle outstanding matters regarding, inter alia , the territories in south -eastern Africa. The conference also provided for the General Act that formalised colonial occupation. In 1895, Britain claimed sovereignty over the Transpongola31 territories (south of the disputed land), and in so doing providing some degree of stability to the boundary separating the Portuguese and British territories to the south.32 27 Walker (n 16) at 453. 28 Ibid. 29 Alexander George Roch The Minquiers and Ecrehos Case: An Analysis of the Decision of the International Court of Justice (Librairie Minard, 1959) at 3. 30 Edward Hertslet The Map of Africa by Trea ty (London, 1894) at 695. 31 International Boundary Study No. 133 - April 16, 1973 Mozambique - South Africa Boundary at 3. 32 Protocol of Conference between Great Britain and Portugal, which documents their respective claims to certain territories formerly belonging to the Kings of Tembe and Mapoota, on the Eastern Coast of Africa, including the Islands of Imyack and Elephant, and agreeing to refer the same to arbitration.

Boundary Commission In 1888, a Joint Boundary Commission33 investigated and verified the boundary separating the province of KwaZulu -Natal of South Africa from Mozambique.34,35 This Commission described the boundary onto which the Ndumo Game Reserve abuts, as: The frontier, with the exception of some slight devia tions, follows the parallel of the confluence of the Rivers Pongolo and Maputo (Usuthu) to the Indian Ocean, and is situated at latitude south 26o 51'12.96\" 33 Comprised representatives of the United Kingdom, Portugal, Swaziland, and the South African Republic. 34 This decision was ratified in Article III of an Anglo -Portuguese treaty of 1891, quoted in United States Department of State (1973) International Bound ary Study No 133 Mozambique -South Africa Boundary, Washington, D.C. Office of the Geographer, Bureau of Intelligence and Research at 3. 35 In addition to this pr\u00e9cis, there were other events that took place to define the boundary between what is now South A frica and Mozambique. These were minor or did not involve the boundary in question and include: Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Boundaries, South African Republic and Portugal (11 December 1875); Convention between Great Britain and Transvaal state (3 August 1881 and 27 February 1884); Convention between Great Britain and South African Republic (11 and 20 June 1888); Exchange of Notes between Great Britain and Portugal (24 September and 5 October 1895); Report by the Joint Boundary Commission (2 October 1897); Exchange of Notes between Great Britain and Portugal (29 December 1898 and 25 January 1899); Exchange of Notes between Union of South Africa and Portugal (6 October 1927); and Anglo -Portuguese Exchange of Notes (29 October 1940) to fix boundary 'tr ipoint' boundary intersection with Zimbabwe. 166 (twenty -six degrees, fifty -one minutes, twelve decimal ninety -six seconds). From the point of depa rture, namely, the confluence of the Rivers Pongolo and Maputo (Usutu), the frontier follows the east channel of the Maputo (Usutu), known amongst the natives as the Pongolo River, as far as a clearing made in the bush at the water's edge on the right bank . From that point looking across a swamp Beacon No. 1 may be seen erected upon a sloping ground at a distance of about 4 metres to the north large tree.36 In the absence of beacons, the words \"the frontier follows the east channel of the Maputo (Usuthu)\" im plies that the international boundary (deriving the northern boundary of the Ndumo Game Reserve) is defined as the Usuthu River.37 The term 'east channel' further implies that the Boundary Commission must have been aware that the Usuthu River may have multi ple channels, and thus the Commission may have known that either the river may assume a different channel from time to time, or the river tended to flow simultaneously though a number of channels. The reference to a particular channel suggests that the Com mission intended to provide the necessary clarity by associating the position of the international boundary with an enduring feature in the landscape. 6.3.3 The Usuthu River Breach During the summer floods of 2002, the Usuthu River breached its southern bank within the protected area, and began flowing southwards before returning to its original alignment via the Bhanzi Pan at the confluence of the Pongola with the Usuthu and River and their respective floodplains ( Figure 1). 36 Hertslet (n 24) Vol. III, at 1066. This boundary description was subsequently accepted by the note s exchanged between the United Kingdom and Portugal on 29 December 1898, and 25 January 1899. 37 From the confluence eastwards to the coast, the boundary was demarcated by the remainder of the 13 beacons and thus fall outside the scope of this analysis \u2014 in that the eastern boundary of the Ndumo Game Reserve is the confluence of the Usuthu and Pongola Rivers. See Hertslet (n 24) Vol. III, at 1066. 167 Figure 1: Location of the Ndumo Game Reserve showing the international boundaries (yellow), Usuthu and Pongola Rivers, point of breach and location of the new channel. The Mozambican Hamlet of Catuane is marked with an 'O' . The question now arises \u2014 with the avulsion of the Usuthu River and its migration southwards, had the international boundary and with it the protected area, also moved? In considering this question and its answer, one must be mindful of the fact that the residents of the Mozambican hamlet, Catuane, which occurs immedi ately north of the breach, have requested that the river be returned back to its original alignment. This request was centred on these residents having continued access to the Usuthu River and its resources. In response to the concerns, the Mozambican gove rnment made diplomatic representations to the South African government in 2005 \u2014 to close and seal the breach, so forcing the river back to its original alignment. In 2007 the South African Department of Water Affairs, 168 under instruction from the Presidency ,38 placed sand -filled hessian bags in the breach in the river bank, as an emergency measure. This hessian -sandbag plug failed following the spring rains of that year (Figure 2). Figure 2: Sand -filled Hessian bags stacked to plug the breech in the ri ver bank (A), and displaced sandbags at the breech point following the first spring rains (B). The failure of this repair was later reported by Mozambique to the Tripartite Permanent Technical Committee (TPTC)39 for permanent resolution. The TPTC subsequent ly requested the Mozambican government to investigate and recommend a desirable solution. The Mozambican government appointed a geophysical specialist to recommend a permanent solution which would cause the 38 Mr James Perkins (pers. com.), Regional Director Water Affairs - National Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (KZN). 39 The Tripartite Permanent Technical Committee (TPTC) is a formal collaboration between South Africa, Mozambique and Swaziland. It is t he objective of the TPTC to direct the management of, inter alia , the Usutu/Maputo River and the provision of water resources. The TPTC is the Water Resources Technical Committee contemplated in Article 5(1)(a) of the Revised Protocol on Shared Watercourse Systems. 169 river to return back to its original alignment wi thin the Ndumo Game Reserve \u2014 in order to secure the necessary relief for the Catuane Hamlet.4041 6.3.4 Proposed Solution by the Mozambican Government The Mozambican government's proposal involved a series of three earth berms within the Ndumo Game Reserve \u2014 angled to redirect the water which had entered onto the floodplain via the breach, back into the Usuthu River. The creation of the berms would necessitate the excavation of those areas of the Usuthu floodplain within the protected area. With the rising of the water levels within each basin, the water flows would 'flood' back into the original channel. Excess flows in the first basin would overtop the first berm only to be redirected to the river by the second and thereafter the third berms. Water that had gone over the third berm would be considered to have gone past the Catuane Hamlet and hence would be left to flow across the remainder of the floodplain into either the Usuthu or the Pongola River. The net result of this engineered solution would be that w ater flowing into the artificial basins would be redirected into the original channel of the Usuthu River for use by the Catuane Hamlet. From a protected area perspective, the Mozambican proposal would require substantial earth works in order to create the berms. This activity would involve the removal of a significant proportion of the natural vegetation and associated wetland habitats that currently comprise the floodplain. It would also result in a significant change in the functioning of the floodplain. The net result would be to alienate and transform a portion of the Ndumo Game Reserve into an artificial water -supply area for the Catuane community. 40 Salomon LDA \"Draft Inception Report Progressive Realisation of the IncoMaputo Agreement (PRIMA) - Study for the Implementation of the Permanent Solution in the Lower Usuthu Breach\" (Salomon LDA 2010) <http://www.preventionweb.net/files/16411_primausuthubreachinceptionreportv02.pdf on 23 September 2014 > (hereafter referred to as the 'Mozambican Proposal'). 41 Ibid. at Secti on 8.1. 170 Being hydrologically focused, the Mozambican proposal is silent on the significance of the environmental impacts on the protected area, its Ramsar status and other biodiversity importance \u2014 other than an acknowledgement through reference to another study,42 and the mention of possible \"flaws that hinder progress\".43 These flaws include the flooding of numerous potentially rare and endangered fauna, accelerated sedimentation of the floodplain, and accelerated erosion of the outlet of Bhanzi Pan - an oxbow lake considered to be of significant biodiversity importance.44 Furthermore, the Mozambican Report suggests th at these may be addressed though discussions between the state parties.45 The Mozambican proposal naturally raises two key questions. The first is whether the proposed intervention is in keeping with the international law, including the obligations pertain ing to biodiversity conservation and shared water resources. The second is whether the solution proposed by Mozambique may be accommodated within South Africa's domestic legislation that regulates the use and protection of biodiversity, and safeguarding th e integrity of protected areas. Within this context, this paper investigates: (a) the potential consequence of the avulsion of the Usuthu River from its current course for the international boundary separating South Africa and Mozambique, and (b) the provi sions of both domestic and international law that may be drawn on to protect the Ndumo Game Reserve, and (c) the role of the public trust doctrine in the decision -making process. 42 R.

These principles, and in particular accretion and avulsion have their origins in resolving boundary disputes in the Roman property law and have subsequently been accepted into public international law.47 Figure 3: Schematic representation o f accretion (A), and avulsion (B) arising from a meandering river. 46 Thalweg is a German term used to describe the location of the deepest part of the river channel used for navigation purposes. The locati on of the thalweg not be the centre of the river, and hence this term is often used in multilateral agreements particularly in the case of navigable rivers. See Dante A. Caponera. Principles of Water Law and Administration - National and International 2nd edition (2007) at 202. 47 Donaldson (n 4) at 157. 172 The accretive principle (alluvio or avulsio )48 regulates the results of a gradual shifting of a water course over an extended period of time. In this case, the changes in the river course are as a result of slow or imperceptible addition of land through the deposition of water -borne sediment and the concomitant erosion of land on the opposite side of the river. While instantaneous observation (or observation over a short period of time) may r ender the shifting channel imperceptible, monitoring over an extended period of time may show that changes in the position of the river have occurred through slow ongoing natural deposition and erosion (Figure 1). The resultant and fundamental consideratio n, is that the movement of the river (irrespective of the time interval) fails to create a new channel which can be reasonably distinguished from the old.49 Thus, where there is no discernible new channel, and the acquisition of ownership (and the related loss of ownership) is granted by way of ipso iure , foregoing the need to actively take possession of the land gained through this natural process.50 While the international boundary remains the centre, or ad medium filum , of the river,51 this may not necessar ily be the deepest or navigable section of the river. The deepest section of a river is predominantly created and maintained by that part of it that has the highest velocity of fluvial flow. Thus, when the deepest section of the river is caused to shift aw ay from its centre (the Thalweg - Figure 3), the international boundary would generally shift with this change. The principle of avulsion or mutation alvei occurs when there is a sudden change in the course of the river, or a sudden loss or addition of lan d through the 48 Generally known as the increase of a parcel of land as the result of the deposition of soil on the shoreline through the action of the river, ocean or bay. 49 Klara and Rafal 'Shifts in International Boundary Rivers' (2002 -2003) 26 Polish Yearbook of International Law at 141. 50 Kanska and Manko (n 49) at 141; Jan Glazewski Environmental Law in South Africa 2nd ed (Butterworths 2005) at 350; The Body Corporate of Dolphin Cove v Kwadukuza Municipality and Another High Court Judgement of 20 February 2012, ZAKZDHC 13, 8513/10, at para 22. 51 See, for example, U.S. 1892. Nebraska v. Iowa . 143 U.S. 359 -370. 173 action of water52 and the creation of a new channel. Avulsion occurs in both instances where the old channel is completely or partially abandoned (Figure 4). For the latter, the river may continue to flow in both channels creating an island (circumluvio ) or may flow predominantly in the new channel \u2014 depending on the amount and velocity of flow. In either instance, therefore, mutation alvei occurs when a sudden new channel is formed and irrespective of whether the original channel is abandoned or not. Further, it is conceivable, although in the extreme, that a river may cease to flow entirely, or a significant portion of land occurs between the old and the 'new' channel.53 It is also implausible that the disappearance of the river (as in 'river capture' through encroachment by another river) would result in disappearance of a portion of an international boundary. In this case the international boundary would remain at the centre of the abandoned river bed. In support of this argument, it is inconceivable that citizenship of people would change as a result of such an event. It is also inconceivable, in the absence of a transboundary agreement,54 that land and infrastructure would be precipitously forfeited to the neighbouring state.55 It thus stands to reason that the principle law surrounding international boundaries or common sense would prevail \u2014 in that the boundary between two neighbouring sta tes would not change as a result of avulsion or mutation alvei. The position of the boundary in such circumstances would remain firmly at the position of the old channel \u2014 to ensure 52 A parallel example would be the migration of the high -water mark in either pro - or regrading beaches along a sandy coastline. See, generally, The Body Corporate of Dolphin Cove v Kwadukuza Municipality and Another (n 50). 53 For example, in periods of extended and profound draught or in a sudden river capture event. 54 In the circumstance where both state parties have come to an agreement that define s the boundary when there is a shift in the alignment of the river, this agreement would supersede international customary international law discussed herein. See Green Haywood Hackworth Digest of International Law (U.S. Government Printing Office, 1940), vol. 1 at 409, quoted in Kanska and Manko (n 49) at 146. 55 Donaldson (n 4) at 157. 174 that no state party is disadvantaged unfairly by a sudden change in the co urse of the river.56,57 Figure 4: Schematic representation of a meandering river prior to (A) and following (B) an avulsion or mutation alvei event. Thus, in the case of the migration of the Usuthu River, the principle of avulsion would apply and thus the boundary separating South Africa from Mozambique remains unchanged, irrespective of the location of the Usuthu River \u2014 being the abandoned channel of the Usuthu River. 56 Hackworth Ibid.; Kanska and Manko (n 49) at 141. 57 There are, however, circumstances where the inte rnational boundary may change due to the newly created or new principal channel following an avulsion event. These circumstances occur when there are existing navigation rights and these rights may be potentially lost. Since navigation is not central to th e questions surrounding the avulsion of the Usuthu River, this dimension of determining the position of an international boundary will not be pursued. 175 6.4.1.2 Sedudu/Kasikili Island judgment Although there are several cases in Africa concerning disputed boundaries involving water courses, there are surprisingly few where the dispute has arisen from the movement of a river separating two countries. Notwithstanding when the principles of accretion and avulsion do not apply, the judgment by the International Court of Justice in the Hague in the Netherlands (I.C.J.) on the Kasikili/Sedudu Island dispute between Botswana and Na mibia \u2014 is case law which may assist resolve any boundary dispute that may arise from the avulsion of the Usuthu River. The Kasikili/Sedudu Island is located within the Chobe River, and ownership was disputed by Botswana and Namibia. The origin of the dis pute is rooted in the Anglo -German Treaty of 1890, which defined the boundary terms as \"the middle of the main channel\" or \" thalweg \" of the Chobe River,58 but it is silent on the criteria required to identify the \"main channel\". In the Court's opinion, the meaning of the term \" thalweg \" was the corpus of the dispute between the two counties.59 The Court was also of the opinion that the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, in particular Article 31 thereto, was applicable \u2014 inasmuch as it ref lected customary international law.60 Here the I.C.J. interpreted the 1890 Treaty by applying the rules of the 1969 Vienna Convention: a treaty must be interpreted in good faith, in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their con text and in the light of its object and purpose. Interpretation must be based above all upon the text of the treaty. As a supplementary measure recourse may be had to means of interpretation such as the preparatory work of the treaty.61 58 Article III, para 2 of the German version uses the term \"thalweg\" of that channel (Thalweg des Hauptlau fes) 59 Para 29 -42 of the I.C.J. judgment. 60 Ibid., paras 18 -20. 61 Drawing on the text quoted in the Territorial Dispute (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/Chad), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1994, pp. 21 -22, para. 41. 176 The Court reasoned t hat the \"centre of the main channel\" had the same meaning as the words \" thalweg des Hauptlaufes \" and thus the \"centre\" was synonymous with the navigation term \" thalweg\" .62 In addition, the Court understood that the hydrological situation of the Chobe around Kasikili/Sedudu Island was essentially similar to the situation which existed when the 1890 Treaty was concluded. The I.C.J. therefore concluded that 'navigation' was a principle objective of the provisions of Article III, paragraph 2, of the Treaty \u2014 in that both parties sought to secure navigational rights along the Chobe River.63 This reasoning assisted the I.C.J. to conclude on which channel constituted the boundary between the two parties.64 Thus it would be likely that a similar conclusion could be dr awn for the Usuthu River, in that in periods of high water flows, the original channel would be most navigable given that the new channel is spread out over a significant surface area of minimal depth as the waters enter the floodplain. Here, in keeping wi th the Kasikili/Sedudu Island case, the border would be likely to remain the original channel of the Usuthu River \u2014 and not the new shallow channel derived from the avulsion event. In considering the role and significance of current and in particular hist orical maps, the I.C.J. in the Kasikili/Sedudu Island case recalled the position of the Court with respect to the evidentiary value of maps in the 'Frontier Dispute' between Burkina Faso and the Republic of Mali: 62 Vice-President Weeramantry, in his dissenting opini on, stated that \"main channel\" and \"Thalweg des Hauptlaufes\" in the 1890 Treaty implied more than one interpretation \u2014 and undue weight was given to the main channel equating to the thalweg in the judgement.. 63 Judge Oda, inter alia , affirmed that the court was amiss for not taking into consideration scientific knowledge on channels in the system and for not calling on advice of experts in this regard. Furthermore, Judge Kooijmans, inter alia , concurred that the Vienna Convention was too limiting in applicat ion and that the court should be guided by other multilateral agreements, such as the 1997 Convention on the Non -Navigational Uses of International Watercourses \u2014 and therein the rule of equitable utilisation of transboundary watercourses. 64 I.C.J. judgmen t, paras 88 -89 inclusive. 177 maps merely constitute information which v aries in accuracy from case to case; of themselves, and by virtue solely of their existence, they cannot constitute a territorial title, that is, a document endowed by international law with intrinsic legal force for the purpose of establishing territorial rights. Of course, in some cases maps may acquire such legal force, but where this is so the legal force does not arise solely from their intrinsic merits: it is because such maps fall into the category of physical expressions of the will of the State or States concerned. This is the case, for example, when maps are annexed to an official text of which they form an integral part. Except in this clearly defined case, maps are only extrinsic evidence of varying reliability or unreliability which may be used, along with other evidence of a circumstantial kind, to establish or reconstitute the real facts.65 In the Usuthu matter, unlike that observed in Sedudu/Kasikili Island, maps associated with positions of colonial and present state parties, consistently and with sufficient detail display the boundary as being the Usuthu River. Furthermore, the Mozambique government reinforced this position of the international boundary by requesting that the flow of water be returned to its original channel as depicted in the maps included in their consultant's report. It is further argued that this action would constitute evidence of a \"subsequent agreement\" or \"subsequent practice\" within the meaning of the Vienna Convention, and in so doing would strengthen the notion that the international boundary separating South Africa and Mozambique remains the original channel of t he Usuthu River. The final consideration by the I.C.J. \u2014 relevant to the Usuthu matter \u2014 was whether the occupation of the Sedudu/Kasikili Island constitutes \"subsequent practice in the application of the [1890] treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation\".66,67 The I.C.J. was of the opinion that mere occupation of land by rural people did not accord the application of the 1890 65 I.C.J. Reports 1986 at para. 54. 66 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Art. 31, para. 3 (b)). 67 See I.C.J. judgment, at paras 71 -75 inclusive. 178 Treaty, and as such the principle of uti possidetis68 cannot be applied.69 In contrast, and in a ddition to any national security activities that have been undertaken along the border, KwaZulu -Natal's conservation agency continued to enforce various conservation laws in the area of the Ndumo Game Reserve, and in particular in the area of land immediat ely south of the Usuthu River's main channel downstream of the point of avulsion. In so doing the South African government, through the actions of the conservation agency, continued to carry out, in practice, the principles of effective occupation and pres cription in compliance with the Berlin Convention and the customary international law principle of uti possidetis . This occupation also fulfilled the requirements that the I.C.J. ruled paramount for creating certainty about where the international boundary was located.70 In many respects, the Sedudu/Kasikili Island case \u2014 although it does not involve avulsion of the Chobe River \u2014 is germane to resolving uncertainties that may arise following the avulsion of the Usuthu River. In this, the arguments posed in the judgment, together with the opposing opinions by the individual judges, strongly suggest that the avulsion of Usuthu River did not result in a change in the position of the international boundary separating Mozambique and South Africa. 68 From the Latin phrase \" uti possidetis, ita possideatis ,\" or \"as you possess, so may you possess.\" 69 Weeramantry held a contrary opinion to the Court, in that the presence of people from one of the states on the island did infer an 'agreement' with respect to Article 31, paragraph 3 (b), of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties \u2014 as their presence indicated, by action or inaction, affirmation or silence, a common understanding between both states of ownership through prescription. In addition, Judge Oda was dissenting on the weight given by the judgment to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties \u2014 particularly in relation to any \"subsequent agreement\" or \"subsequent practice\" 70 Vice-President Weeramantry also affirmed that the decision based on navigation inappropriately involved dividing or dismantling what was c learly an integrated ecological unit, in which the channels occurred. Weeramantry further stated, as expressed in the opinion, that the island should be safeguarded in the environment's interest. 179 6.4.2 Protected Area Management Following the conclusions made above, consideration shifts towards the river and its surrounds and South Africa's obligations to manage the Ndumo Game Reserve as an integrated ecological unit \u2014 as well as to those obligations nested within both African and global multilateral agreements. The management of the Ndumo Game Reserve would be in accordance with the provisions of the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act.71 Section 3 of this Act obligates the state to \"act as a trustee o f protected areas\" within the country, or alternatively states that a protected area is held in trust on behalf of the public \u2014 the beneficiaries.72 The crux of this obligation is that the state has a fiduciary duty to act prudently and in accordance with t he objectives for establishing protected areas. These fiduciary obligations are tied to a hierarchy of imperatives and concrete performance standards, and these are specified in the Act. The overarching imperative specified in the Act directs the state to wards achieving the environmental right in section 24 of the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.73 This right, inter alia , grants all the right to have the \"environment protected for the benefit of present and future\" and by \"preventing pollution and ecological degradation, promoting conservation.\" This right imposes a responsibility on the state to take necessary steps to ensure environmentally protective management principles are applied to decision making.74 The second and s ubordinate imperative imposed on the state is that the establishment and subsequent management of protected areas must contribute to achieving the objectives of the NEMPA, and, in particular, the protected area must form part of a \"diverse and representati ve network of protected areas\".75 Given the Ramsar status, being the protected area giving protection to the last remaining natural portion of the Usuthu River, it is inconceivable that Ndumo 71 South Africa, Act 57 of 2003. Hereafter referred to as N EMPA. 72 Section 3 of the NEMPA. 73 South Africa, Act 108 of 1996. Hereafter referred to the as 'the Constitution'. 74 Kidd, M., Environmental Law , 2nd ed. (Juta & Co. Ltd 2011) at 21 -26. 75 Section 2 of the NEMPA. 180 Game Reserve would be considered a duplication or redundant withi n South Africa's protected area network. It stands to reason, therefore, that the potential loss of the flood plain within the Ndumo Game Reserve, as a consequence of the proposed interventions by Mozambique, is highly likely to result in a depreciation in the diversity and representivity of South Africa's protected area network. The performance standards specified in the NEMPA are largely housed in the protected area management plan \u2014 which must be submitted to the relevant political head within one year o f assignment of the management authority.76 In this, it is the \"object of a management plan is to ensure the protection, conservation and management of the protected area concerned in a manner which is consistent with the objectives of this Act and [ exclusi vely] for the purpose it was declared\".77 This purpose ultimately is directed at conserving and protecting that crucial component of the public trust entity.78 The Act specifies a finite hierarchy of purposes which underpin its declaration. This array of pur poses does, however, include \"to assist in ensuring the sustained supply of environmental goods and services\".79 It is unlikely, if not inarguable, that (a) the artificial return of the Usuthu River would meet the intent of this purpose, particularly given that the avulsion of the river is a natural process within a floodplain, from which the latter provides various in situ and downstream users natural products and services; and (b) the need to return the Usuthu River to the original channel under the auspic es of \"environmental goods and services\" would supersede other preceding purposes such as protecting representative ecosystems and associated ecological integrity, rare and threatened species, and the like. 76 Section 39 of the NEMPA. 77 Section 40 of the NEMPA. Own emphasis. 78 Justices Nyamu, Ibrahim and Emukule - in the consideration of the importance of upholding the fiduciary duties of the state and that the public trust entity must be managed and used for this purpose. This being for the benefit of current (intragenerational equity) and future (intergenerational equity) generations. Nyamu, Ibrahim and Emukule draw on the reasoning of E. Brown Weiss On Fairness to Future Generations (UN University Press 1989) at 36 -37, and stress that the public trust cannot be used to maximise the welfare and wellbeing of a few at the expense of others. See chapter entitled 'Summary of Remedies' in Kenya, Waweru v Republic AHRLR 149 (KeHC 2006). 79 Section 17(g). 181 Consequently, the NEMPA provides little scope for the management authority (in this case the state) to undertake any activity that is not in line with the purpose of the protected area, its management plan \u2014 or which may lead to potential damage to the protected area and the biodiversity therein. Furthermore, the management authority (the state in the case of the Ndumo Game Reserve) must monitor and report on its performance in achieving the standards specifi ed and included in the management plan. Finally, should the relevant political head deem that there is underperformance with regard to the management of the area or the biodiversity of the area, the tenure of the management authority may be terminated and another organ of state assigned. The provisions of NEMPA, therefore, constrain if not preclude the state from either causing or sanctioning the construction of berms within Ndumo Game Reserve, that would lead to the near permanent flooding of the floodplai n and an associated loss of biodiversity. 6.4.3 The Public Trust Doctrine and Environmental Governance The National Environmental Management Act80 serves as framework legislation aimed at, inter alia, defining overarching and generic principles that must be considered by the state for management decisions that concern the environment81 \u2014 including actions that may arise out of other South African legislation concerning the protection or management of th e environment.82 In many respects, as mentioned above, these principles set the foundation of the fiduciary duties to be exercised by the state in safeguarding the Ndumo Game Reserve and its biodiversity. Included in these, the NEMA explicitly brings into S outh African jurisprudence the common law principle of the public trust doctrine which is stated 80 South Africa: Act 107 of 1998. Hereaft er referred to as 'NEMA'. 81 Section 2 of the NEMA defines the environment as the \"surroundings within which humans exist and that are made up of - (i) the land, water and atmosphere of the earth; (ii) micro -organisms, plant and animal life; (iii) any part o r combination of (i) and (ii) and the interrelationships among and between them; and (iv) the physical, chemical, aesthetic and cultural properties and conditions of the foregoing that influence human health and well-being\". 82 Section 2(1). 182 in this Act as the \"environment is held in public trust for the people, the beneficial use of environmental resources must serve the public interest and the environment must be protected as the people's common heritage\".83 Simply worded, natural \"resources should be held in trust by the state, which must manage their consumptive use and protection on behalf of present and future citizens\"84 or \"the State, as trust ee, is under a fiduciary duty to deal with the trust property, being the common natural resources, in a manner that is in the interests of the general public\".85 While other countries have effectively relied solely on the courts to develop the nuances of th e doctrine that apply to the natural environment, including the biodiversity therein,86 the NEMA augments the doctrine with an array of principles that guide the state to act in the public interest. For instance, the first principle provides that environmen tal management \"must place people and their needs at the forefront of its concern and serve their physical, psychological, developmental, cultural and social interests equitably\".87 This provision guides the state away from applying a myopic approach to dec ision-making in favour of a select few people, and requires a broader consideration of the interests of all people (current and future), and these interests need to be considered with an impartial and unfettered mind. The needs of the Catuane Hamlet in Moz ambique, therefore, cannot be seen in the absence of a broader evaluation, as being paramount and overriding of 83 Section 2(2)( o). 84 Raphael D. Sagarin and Mary Turnipseed 'The Public Trust Doctrine: Where Ecology Meets Natural Resources Management' (2012) Ann. Rev. Environ. Resourc . 37 at 473. 85 Kenya, Waweru v Republic AHRLR 149 (KeHC 2006) at para 20. 86 For example, the relocat ion of the Beas River in the Kullu Valley ( India, M.C. Mehta v Kamal Pollution of the Kiserian River ( Waweru v Republic (n 78)) and diversion of the Owens river in the Mono Lake case (California, National Audubon Society v Superior Court , 658 P.2d 709). These judgments are particularly relevant in the Usuthu River matter, in that they provide insights into the fundamental role the p ublic trust doctrine may play in protecting ecosystems, and the weight that must be given to the interests of broader society over the needs of a subset thereof. See, generally, P. Redmond 'The Public Trust in Wildlife: Two Steps Forward, Two Steps Back' ( 2009) 49 Natural Resources Journal at 249, 250 on wildlife cases within the United States of America. 87 Section 2(2). 183 other needs of a broader community and intra - and inter -generational equity . Furthermore, this framework entails the state to ensure that any de cision affecting the environment \" must be socially, environmentally and economically sustainable\".88 It stands to reason, therefore, in applying the principles to decisions affecting the environment, that the state would be amiss in giving weight to one of these \"environmental pillars\" at the expense of another. To do so risks rendering the outcome of the decision unsustainable and therein brings into question whether such a decision was taken in the broader public interest or if it was made in favour of a s elect few. The subsequent environmental principles speak directly to those factors or components of the environment that underpin the notion of sustainable use. These include, inter alia , the safeguarding of ecosystems and biological diversity ,89 prevention of pollution and degradation of the environment,90 and disturbance of landscapes and sites that constitute South Africa's cultural heritage.91 In considering these, the state is required to consider and primarily avoid negative impacts on the protected area and the biodiversity therein. In circumstances where negative impacts cannot be altogether avoided, the impacts are to be minimised and the residual loss remedied.92 Further nested in this principle, the state in striving for sustainable use of the environment, and is to apply \"a risk - averse and cautious approach \". This takes into account the limits of current knowledge about the consequences o f decisions and actions.93 These sets of 'sustainable use' principles form the foundation of the fiduciary duties of the state acting, in particular, as trustee of the Ndumo Game Reserve. The purpose of this collection of principles is to ensure that the tr ust entity (in this case the protected 88 Section 2(3). Own emphasis. 89 Section 2(4)(a)(i). 90 Section 2(4)(a)(ii). 91 Section 2(4)(a)(iii). 92 Section 2(4)(a)(i) and(ii). 93 Section 2(4)(a)(vii). The risk adverse approach to decisions pertaining to the environment is South Africa's interpretation of the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. See n 132 (below). 184 area and the biodiversity therein) remains uncompromised and not exposed to significant and irreversible risk. The subsequent environmental principles embrace a people -centric approach to environmental decision -makin g that could be used in the argument that the needs of the Catuane Hamlet are paramount, and therein the necessity for the return of the Usuthu River to its original alignment. For instance, the NEMA provides for the state to consider maintaining \" equitabl e access to environmental resources, benefits and services to meet basic human needs and ensure human well -being must be pursued [...].\"94 Whilst this and the other people -centric principles would hold for people within the country, it is questionable whether the NEMA and therein the fiduciary duties imposed by the trust could be applied outside the sovereignty of the state. Here it may be argued that the consideration of the needs of the Catuane Hamlet may only be considered by way of various multilateral agreements that apply in this circumstance. The NEMA, however, provides the principle that global and international responsibilities are to be discharged in the national interest.95 Within the context of the avulsion of the Usuthu River, this principle guides the state not to favour or give weight to global, African, or SADC multilateral agreements that risk an action being taken that is not in South Africa's national interest. This principle, therefore, requires the state to consider whether there is an overri ding South African national interest \u2014 before any decision to accede to the construction of the various berms within the Ndumo Game Reserve is made. Finally, the NEMA concludes with the principle that the state must apply specific attention when considerin g management and planning procedures, to \"sensitive, vulnerable , highly dynamic or stressed ecosystems, such as [...], wetlands, and similar systems\", especially in those circumstances where these natural assets are \"subject to significant human resource usa ge and development pressure\".96 Given that the floodplains within the Ndumo Game Reserve are the last remaining natural areas of the Usuthu River system, as a direct consequence of human - 94 Section 2(4)(d). 95 Section 2(4)(n). 96 Section 2(4)(o). 185 induced transformation of the broader landscape, the state would be ha rd pressed to grant permission for the construction of the proposed berms and therein permit the loss of these remaining sensitive areas. 97 Finally, the NEMA entrenches the application of its principles in environmental decision -making by enabling the Sou th African public (the beneficiaries of the trust) to hold the trustees (relevant authorities in the South African government functioning as the public trustee) accountable for decisions taken, or failure to take a decision98 \u2014 that may compromise the envir onment. Here any person may, inter alia , seek judicial relief for any breach, or, importantly, \"threatened breach\" of the principles and any provision of this Act or any other statutory provision concerned with the protection of the environment. Further, t his relief may be sought in the public interest or in the interest of protecting the environment.99,100 In seeking this relief, the NEMA provides for the court not to award costs where the relief was sought for this purpose.101 Thus, the Mozambican Proposal, g iven its potential impacts on the Ndumo Game Reserve, cannot be granted. To do so would altra vires the NEMA and the public 97 An explicit analysis of the public trust doctrine in relation to the NEMA Principles is given in Andrew Blackmore 'The Relationship between the NE MA and the Public Trust Doctrine: The Importance of the NEMA Principles in Safeguarding South Africa's Biodiversity.' (2015) SAJELP Forthcoming. 98 Section 1 of South Africa's Promotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000 ('PAJA') defines administration action, inter alia , as \"any decision taken, or any failure to take a decision, by an organ of state, when exercising a public power or performing a public function in terms of any legislation\". 99 Section 32(1) of the NEMA. 100 Furthermore, section 3 of the PAJA considers any decision (or indecision) which materially and adversely affects the rights (for example the Environmental Right, see n 73 and 74) or legitimate expectations of any person (the expectation that a protected area must be protected and managed for the purpose for which it was declared a protected area). Section 6 of the Act defines an extensive array of criteria which render a decision unjust, which forms the basis for any person seeking judicial relief. 101 Section 32(2). 186 trust principles therein, and expose the state's decision to the likelihood of being overturned by way of judicial review. 6.4. Specific Multilateral Agreements Directly Applicable to the Usuthu River and the Ndumo Game Reserve102 6.4.3.1 Maputo Convention (2003)103 Underscoring the public trust duties, the (revised) African Convention on Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources \u2014 signed in Maputo in 2003 (the Maputo Convention) in accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity104 \u2014 places specific obligations on state parties to take measures, inter alia , for the conservation, sustainable use and rehabilitation of vegetation ,105 and to avoid or eliminate risks to biodiversity that manifest at species106 and habitat levels.107 Furthermore, the Maputo Convention requires signatories to establish and expand existing protected areas, and stresses that these area are to be managed for the purpose for which they were established. Article XIII(1) of Convention requires the signatories \"individually or jointly ... to take appropriate measures to prevent , mitigate and eliminate detrimental impacts on the environment\". Interestingly, this Art icle refers primarily to \"radioactive, toxic, and other hazardous substances and wastes\", but subsequently addresses general harm to the environment. Here the signatories are required to: 102 A general discussion of the application of the public trust doctrine within global multilateral agreements, is given in Peter H. Sand 'The Concept of Public Trusteeship in the Transboundary Governance of Biodiversity' in Louis J. Thilo Marauhn (eds) Transboundary Governance of Biodiversity (Brill Nijh off, 2014) at 45 -63. 103 The Maputo Convention is yet to come into force and thus adherence to its provisions are not yet binding on the signatories. The wording of this Convention, however, does represent a clear statement of intent by both South Africa and Mozambique. It is for this reason that this Convention is considered in this paper. 104 See Article 10 of the Convention on Biological Diversity. 105 Article VIII. 106 Article X. 107 Article XII(2) \u2014 with instruction of the need to identify and conserve critically important areas. 187 provide for economic incentives and disincentives, with a view to preventing or abating harm to the environment, restoring or enhancing environmental quality,108 and ensuring that they, inter alia, to the maximum extent possible, take all necessary measures to ensure that development activities and projects are based on sound environmental policies and do not have adverse effects on natural resources and the environment in general.109 Finally, this convention recognises that force majeure circumstances may arise that may necessitate a compromise of the integrity of the natural environment.110 Even though it may be argued that the avulsion of the Usuthu River is force majeure , given the delays that have transpired since the avulsion event, it is unlikely to be considered an emergency and the proposed solution necessary for \"defence in human life\".111,112 The principle of retaining the Ndumo Game Reserve and the Usuthu River floodplain therein, in trust, thus remains paramount. Finally, Article VII of the Maputo Convention requires signatories to take measures to ensure that their water resources are managed at the \"highest possible quantitative and qualitative levels\". To t his end, the signatories are required to, inter alia , maintain water -based essential ecological processes.113 This article further requires, in addition to surface water, that the signatories establish and implement policies for the planning, conservation, m anagement, utilisation and development of underground and rain water to ensure supply of sufficient suitable water for people's needs.114 By underscoring underground and rain -water resources, t he Convention appropriately requires its signatories to consider all sources of water and to exploit primarily those resources that are likely to have the least impact on biodiversity. Thus, from a Mozambican and public -trust 108 Article XIII(2). 109 Article XIV. 110 As contemplated in Article XXV. 111 Ibid. 112 At the time of writing, the only action taken (discussed above) was the attempt to temporarily plug the breach with sandbags. 113 Article V(1). 114 114 Article V(2). 188 perspective, it is argued that it would be inappropriate for this country Mozambique to require South Africa to damage a protected area and the biodiversity therein, in order for the Catuane Hamlet to be able to abstract water from the Usuthu River within its original alignment. This observation is particularly relevant given that alternative source s of water (for example, boreholes, a pumping line from the new alignment of the river, or rainwater collection) appear not to have been considered. Furthermore, it would be inappropriate for the South African government to consider, within the context of this Convention, to cede to the Mozambican proposal and to allow the Ndumo Game Reserve and its biodiversity to be irrevocably damaged. 6.4.3.2 Revised Protocol on Shared Watercourse Systems (2000) South Africa shares four rivers with its six neighbours \u2014 the Inco mati, Orange, Limpopo, and Usuthu. South Africa ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses on 26 October 1998,115 which brings with it various political and practical responsibilities that include the exchange of data and information, the protection and preservation of water bodies, the creation of joint management mechanisms, and the early settlement of disputes.116 The Convention codifies at least three common law obligations: equitable and reasonable utilisation,117 prevention of significant harm, and prior notification of planned measures. These obligations form the cornerstones of the Convention and transboundary c o-operation, in that the use of a transboundary watercourse by one state must be reasonable and in a manner that is equitable with the other states which are using it. The Convention further requires that the states collaborate and \"participate in the use, development and protection of an international watercourse in an equitable and reasonable 115 This convention is not yet brought into force, but does form a point of reference with respect to transboundary waters, particularly in the drafting of regional specific multilateral agreements as is indicated below. 116 UNEP (2002). 117 Article 5. 189 manner\".118 Article 7 (the \"Obligation not to cause significant harm\") requires upstream signatories to \"take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of signif icant harm\" to downstream user countries. Should a signatory believe it has sustained significant harm due to an upstream or co -riparian signatory's use of an international watercourse, the former is entitled to raise the issue of harm with the latter. Art icles 5 to 7, inclusively, provide a platform for both states to reach a solution that is equitable and reasonable and that addresses the downstream harm and the consequences thereto. This solution may naturally include the payment of compensation to achie ve the desired balance of equitable use. While Part III of the Convention provides for prior notification of any planned measures that may have an adverse impact on downstream states, importantly, from this paper's perspective, Part IV of the Convention cr eates the foundation for the protection, conservation and appropriate management of the watercourse ecosystems and the watercourses themselves \u2014 particularly where they support human life and important biodiversity. Drawing from this Convention, on 7 Augu st 2000, the Southern African Development Community (SADC)119 adopted the Revised Protocol on Shared Watercourses of the Southern African Development Community120 \u2014 which not only recognises the UN Watercourses Convention, but strengthens principles that, inter alia, provide for integrated management of shared basins.121 Here, specific emphasis is placed on equitable utilisation of water, and notification of planned 118 Ibid. 119 Comprising 15 memb er states: Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. 120 The Revised Protocol on Shared Watercourses entered force in 2003 and replaced the original Protocol of 1995. This revision was necessitated to bring the Protocol in -line with the 1997 UN Watercourses Convention. The revision also recognises, although obliquely, the Helsinki Rules and Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. See Salman M.A. Salman 'Legal Regime for Use and Protection of International Watercourses in the Southern African Region: Evolution and Context' 2001 Natural Resources Journal 41 at 1004. 121 Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) and the Regional Strategic Action Plan for Integrated Water Resources Development and Management (RSAP -IWRM). 190 measures of use that may impact downstream user states. This protocol also places specific emphasi s on the principle of no significant harm to shared watercourses, and notification of and cooperation during emergency situations. The focus of the protocol was to create a platform for establishing close cooperation for sustainable and equitable use of ec ological and hydrological resources of southern Africa's shared watercourses. Furthermore, the Revised Protocol promotes transboundary harmonisation of legislation, uses policies to achieve these foci,122 and reinforces the importance of creating and maintai ning a balance between the use of the resources within the waterway and the requirements to sustain the natural environment.123 In terms of 'sustaining' the natural environment, the Revised Protocol further requires state parties either individually or, wher e appropriate, collectively, to \"protect and preserve the ecosystems of the shared watercourse\".124 Thereafter, this Protocol requires state parties to individually or jointly prevent, reduce and control pollution of the watercourse that may arise from its u se125 Finally, the Revised Protocol provides for a series of institutional mechanisms responsible for its implementation.126 These mechanisms127 are comprised of political heads and government officials, whose primary concern or expertise is water. The incorpora tion of expertise or political responsibilities that would provide for a joint approach to the protection and preservation of relevant ecosystems, is absent. Given the predominant focus on water, these committees, and particularly the TPTC, are unlikely to attribute appropriate weight to biodiversity concerns when contemplating the provision of water to the Catuane Hamlet. Furthermore, the Revised Protocol is silent on requiring its committees to liaise with other 122 Article 2. 123 This is referred to and is characterised as the environmental reserve in section 2 of the South African National Water Act 36 of 1998. This being the amount of water required \"to protect aquatic ecosystems in order to secure ecologically sustainable development and use of the relevant water resource\". 124 Article 3(2)(a). 125 Sub-clause (b). 126 Article 5. 127 The Committee of Water Ministers, Committee of Water Senior Officials, Water Sector Co-ordinating Unit and the Water Resources Technical Committee and sub -Committees. 191 sectors accommodated within the SADC multil ateral agreements. As such, the TPTC and other committees are not bound to consult with the institutional entities provided for by, in particular, the Protocol on Wildlife Conservation and Law Enforcement. Consequently, sole reliance on this Protocol as th e multilateral mechanism \u2014 to give effect to the protection of the integrity of the Ndumo Game Reserve \u2014 would be precarious and inadvisable. 6.4.3.3 SADC Protocol on Wildlife Conservation and Law Enforcement (2002) The SADC Protocol on Wildlife Conservation and Law Enforcement128 was set in place to establish a common framework for conservation and sustainable use of wildlife in the region. Taking its lead from the wildlife objective of the SADC Treaty,129 this protocol provides the foundation for trusteeship of biodiversity by requiring each state party to apply the principle to ensure that its wildlife resources are conserved and used sustainably.130 Within this cooperative framework, the Protocol uniquely binds each state to apply this principle outside of their jurisdiction, by enjoining SADC countries from \"causing damage to the wildlife resources of other states or in areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction\".131 In formulating a decision, each SAD C country must consider the potential impacts that may manifest outside its borders. Where such impacts may be considered significant or non -trivial, an alternative consideration would naturally be warranted.132 This Protocol therefore embraces the concept o f a 'multinational environmental law' using the public trust responsibilities to pierce the veil of state 128 Brought into force on 30 November 2003. 129 Article 5(1)(g). 130 Article 3. 131 Ibid. 132 This provision is in keeping with the Precautionary Principle adopted by the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development in 1992. This being: \"In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States acc ording to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost -effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.\" 192 sovereignty to safeguard transboundary habitats and ecosystems, and the wildlife therein. It also requires, in accordance with Principle 16 of the Rio Declaration,133 the internalisation of environmental costs \u2014 particularly those that may traverse an international boundary The decision by the Mozambican government to require the construction of the various berms within the Ndumo Game Reserve is likely t o lead to damage to the protected area and floodplain \u2014 and its biodiversity. This decision by the Mozambican government to call on the South African government \u2014 via the TPTC \u2014 to implement the proposed solution of the berms, could be considered a stateme nt of intent to cause damage to wildlife resources in another state. This decision is likely, therefore, to be seen to be acting in a manner contrary to the provisions and spirit of the Protocol, and, as a consequence, to the SADC Treaty. From the South Af rican perspective, the Protocol requires the country to, inter alia, take an array of measures to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of wildlife and effectively enforce its national legislation.134 South Africa is thus required to apply its environm ental, biodiversity and protected area -related legislation to ensure that the integrity of its wildlife resources (the Ndumo Game Reserve) is safeguarded. Finally, the Protocol requires both states to co -operate in managing shared resources \u2014 as well as an y \"transfrontier effects of activities within their jurisdiction or control\".135 In this, South Africa may need to cooperate with Mozambique in order to supply the Catuane Hamlet with a sustainable supply of water, should this resource be unobtainable within Mozambique.136 133 \"National authorities s hould endeavour to promote the internalization of environmental costs and the use of economic instruments, taking into account the application that the polluter should in principle bear the cost of pollution with due regard to the public interest and witho ut distorting international trade and investment\". 134 Article 4(2)(a) and (b). 135 Article 4(2)(c). 136 The Ndumo Game Reserve is integral to the Ndumu -Tembe -Futi Transfrontier Conservation Area, and forms one of five protocols forming the broader Lubombo Trans frontier Conservation and Resource Area between Mozambique and South Africa. The latter was set in place to form a platform to protect and conserve what is known as the Maputaland Centre of Endemism. Du Plessis and Du Plessis (n 7 at 275); Andrew 193 The Protocol provides for an array of institutional mechanisms137 responsible for its implementation.138 These mechanisms comprise political heads and government officials that govern matters relating to wildlife resources and food production. Wi thin these it would be the prime function of the Wildlife Sector Technical Committee139 to implement the Protocol.140 It is requirement of this committee to, inter alia , liaise with other SADC sectors to promote inter -sectorial cooperation in wildlife manageme nt.141 It would therefore be the duty of this committee to ensure that the TPTC was informed of the potential negative impacts the Mozambican proposal would have on the integrity of the Ndumo Game Reserve and its biodiversity. Given that the Revised Protocol on Shared Watercourse Systems is silent on an equivalent provision, it would be unlikely that a reciprocal action would be undertaken by the TPTC \u2014 this being to proactively liaise with the Wildlife Sector Technical Committee on matters potentially concer ning the impacts on biodiversity their decisions may have. It, therefore stands to reason that liaison between these two sectors would be dependent on South Africa simultaneously raising its biodiversity and protected area -related concerns with both the Wi ldlife Sector Technical Committee142 and the TPTC. Finally, any disputes that arise from the Wildlife Sector Technical Committee, or as a result of the liaison with the TPTC, may be raised by South Africa (or Mozambique) with the SADC Treaty Tribunal, Blackmore, 'The Interplay Between the Public Trust Doctrine and Biodiversity and Cultural Resource Legislation in South Africa: The Case of the Shembe Chur ch Worship Site in Tembe Elephant Park in KwaZulu -Natal' (2014) 10/1 Law, Environment and Development Journal at 3. 137 These mechanisms comprise the Wildlife Sector Technical Coordinating Unit, Committee of Food, Agriculture and Natural Resources (FANR) Min isters, Committee of Senior Officials, and the Wildlife Sector Technical Committee. 138 Article 6. 139 Comprising the administrative heads for the organs of state that are responsible for the protection and use of wildlife. 140 Article 6(7). 141 Article 6(8)(h). 142 At the time of writing, I could not confirm whether the biodiversity concerns relating to the proposal of redirecting the Usutu River back into its original channel, was considered at any of the Protocol's institutional committees. 194 for th e necessary relief.143 Here the decision of the Tribunal, having considered the merits of the matter, will be final and binding on both countries.144 6.4.3.4 Ramsar Convention Notwithstanding the domestic and SADC obligations imposed on the state, as the trustee, to protect integrity of the Ndumo Game Reserve and its biodiversity, the state has also assumed a similar obligation to the global community as, inter alia, a consequen ce of listing the Ndumo Game Reserve as a wetland of international importance in terms of the Ramsar Convention.145 Pursuant to this obligation, Article 3.2 of the Convention requires the state party to notify the Bureau to the Convention when the Ramsar sit e is under threat,146 for discussion at the next Convergence of parties. Furthermore, the state is obliged to consider, if not implement, general or specific recommendations made by the Conference of Parties \u2014 as a means to remedy the threat.147 This enables a broader international public's interest to be considered in decisions taken that may affect the integrity of the Ramsar site.148 These provisions ensure that the contracting parties to the convention take into consideration the global public's interest when exercising management, as the trustee, over the management of their Ramsar - listed sites. In this, and in accordance with the state's sovereignty of the Ramsar site, this convention recognises that the state party may exercise discretion to allow the Ramsa r site to be significantly impacted upon in circumstances of \"urgent 143 Article 14. 144 Article 17 of the SADC Treaty. 145 Ndumo Game Reserve was listed as a Ramsar Site 887 on 21 January 1997 (<https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris/887 > accessed on 28 May 2015). 146 Worded in the Article as the site \"is changing o r is likely to change as the result of technological developments, pollution or other human interference\". 147 Article 6. 148 At the time of writing, a submission of this nature was considered to be premature \u2014 in that the TPTC had not considered, let alone a dopted, Mozambique's recommended intervention. 195 national interest\".149 In such circumstances, the state as the trustee would be required, as far as possible to: compensate for any loss of wetland resources, and in particular it should create additional nature reserves for waterfowl and for the protection, either in the same area or elsewhere, of an adequate portion of the original habitat.150 Noting that the Usuthu River breached its southern bank during the summer of 2002, the plugging of the breach took place in 2005, and the remedy recommended by Mozambique was completed in 2010, it is highly unlikely that Ramsar or the Conference of Parties would consider this intervention as being 'urgent'. Whilst it is conceivably 'in the national int erest' to cooperate with Mozambique to ensure that the Catuane Hamlet has access to water , and noting the extensive land transformation of the areas surrounding the Ndumo Game Reserve, the state may be hard pressed to find a reasonable alternative area (at least in South Africa) that would offset the loss of the last remaining natural portion of the Usuthu River floodplain. Here it is surmised that the state would be amiss not to consider alternative remedies, other than diverting a major river in its flood plain, in order to provide the Catuane community with a reasonable supply of water. These remedies would conceivably include pumping water \u2014 as is practiced elsewhere. Finally, the Ramsar 'in the national interest' provision, not only ensures that there is a 'no nett loss' in the area and quality of wetlands listed by the convention (the trust entity), but also provides for a continued maintenance of the core of the public trust entity on behalf of the beneficiaries \u2014 the country and the global community. 6.5 CONCLUSION There are several key factors that lead to the conclusion that the international boundary separating South Africa and Mozambique remains unchanged, despite the Usuthi River breaching its southern bank and creating a new river channel 149 Article 4.2 records this damage occurring as a result of activities given effect to deleting or restricting the boundaries of the listed site. 150 Article 4.2. 196 through the Ndumo Game Reserve. Of these, historical derivation of the original boundary, western and traditional customary international law pertaining to land ownership, treaties, bi - and multilateral agreements, resolution of disputes, and relevant African case history, are all paramount. The Sedudu /Kasikili Island case indicated clearly that compliance of the (a) principles effective occupation and prescription as described in the Berlin Convention, and (b) Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties through the a pplication of the customary international law principle of uti possidetis \u2014 are fundamental considerations should the location of this border be referred to an international court for resolution. Interestingly , dissenting arguments to the Sedudu/Kasikili I sland judgment highlighted the importance of including the geographical setting and natural dynamics of the river within a floodplain \u2014 in considering disputes regarding international boundaries. Given understanding, the provision of water or allowing the Mozambican hamlet reasonable access to water, is thus technical in nature. The solution proposed by Mozambique is likely to result in significant damage to the integrity of the last remaining natural portion of the Usuthu floodplain. This portion of the fl oodplain occurs within South Africa's Ndumo Game Reserve and forms a key component of the motivation that led to the reserve being listed as a Ramsar site. One of the key considerations for South Africa is that the proposed solution will likely result in the irreversible loss of the last remaining natural flood plain of the Usuthu River and therein represents a significant loss of a component of South Africa's biodiversity. As such, the mooted proposal stands to irreversibly damage the public trust entity t hat the South African government set up, for which it is to act as a trustee. Notwithstanding the common law provisions of the public trust doctrine, this fiduciary duty is directed by the very legislation that regulated protected area management, biodiver sity conservation, and environmental decision -making. South Africa, therefore, would be hard pressed if not prohibited from considering the implementation of the Mozambican solution within the protected area. South Africa would also be hard pressed to con sider the Mozambican solution, as this would be contrary to the provisions of the SADC Treaty and its Protocol on Wildlife Conservation and Law Enforcement. Furthermore, the decision of Mozambique to request South Africa to consider a solution that has sig nificant 197 potential to destroy or at least irreversibly change the last remaining pristine component of the Usuthu River floodplain, and its biodiversity, would also be in contravention of the Wildlife Conservation and Law Enforcement Protocol. This conclus ion is particularly significant from a public trust perspective \u2014 in that this Protocol explicitly extends the fiduciary duties From a global perspective, South Africa would be required, should this be considered an exceptional circumstance, to offset the loss with an equivalent area that would ensure a 'no nett loss' to the Ramsar Site. In the absence of alternative pristine areas that may be included into the Ndumo Game Reserve, identification of an offset of this nature is considered to be unlikely \u2014 if not impossible. South Africa, under this circumstance, would risk being in breach of the Ramsar Convention should it accept and implement the Mozambican solution. Being primarily about water provision, it was correct of the Mozambican government to raise the matter with the Tripartite Permanent Technical Committee formed under the Revised Protocol on Shared Watercourse Systems. While this Committee has an obligation to consider the impact of the Mozambican proposal on biodiversity, the focus and expertise of the committee (and the protocol) \u2014 is primarily water quality and quantity, for use by downstream communities. This Protocol is insular in its approach to water conservation, in that it lacks the provision to refer matters of concern that are best consi dered by other multilateral structures. In order for the biodiversity and protected area -related concerns to be appropriately debated at an international level, it is paramount that South Africa raise the biodiversity concerns emanating from the Mozambican solution with the appropriate institutional mechanisms set in place to service the SADC Protocol on Wildlife Conservation and Law Enforcement. Finally, it is concluded that South Africa has discrete domestic and multilateral legal and public trust fiduci ary duties to safeguard both its protected areas, and its biodiversity. These duties obligate the South African government to resist any activity that may result in a significant loss in biodiversity or threaten the integrity of the Ndumo Game Reserve. Fur thermore, these public trust duties, from a SADC perspective, are similarly binding on Mozambique \u2014 precluding it from requiring South Africa to accept significant damage to a protected area and Ramsar site, in 198 order provide water to the Catuane Hamlet. Th is conclusion is particularly relevant given that other sustainable sources of water have not been investigated. 199 CHAPTER 7: TSETSE FLIES SHOULD REMAIN IN PROTECTED AREAS IN KWAZULU -NATAL 200 KOEDOE: AFRICAN PROTECTED AREA CONSERVATION AND SCIENCE VOLUME 59 PART 1 OF 2011 TSETSE FLIES SHOULD REMAIN IN PROTECTED AREAS IN KWAZULU - NATAL Adrian J. Armstrong1 & Andy Blackmore1,2 1Scientific Services, Ezemvelo Wildlife, South Africa 2Research Associate University of KwaZulu -Natal, South Africa. 7.1 ABSTRACT The proposal to eradicate tsetse flies from South Africa, including its protected areas, via the sequential aerosol technique combined with the sterile insect technique to reduce trypanosomiasis in cattle did not present an appropriate analysis of the impacts that implementation of the proposal would have on biodiversity. Not only would the implementation of the proposal be contrary to South African laws protecting and conserving biodiversity, but it would also have negative consequences for the conservation of biodiversity. Some of the negative consequences are reviewed, including extirpations and negative impacts on ecological and ecosystem processes and services. Alternative strategies to control trypanosomiasis in cattle effectively in a more environment -friendly manner are presently available and others will almost certainly become available in the not - too-distant future. Conservation implications: Environmental protection, promotion of conservation and sustainable use of the environment is deeply seated in South Africa's law. Rural livestock husbandry considerations and biodiversity conservation are not mutually exclusive and the importance of one cannot supersede the other. The eradication proposal is seen to be environmentally damaging and therefore it is concluded that the purpose of this proposed eradication exercise is unconstitutional, contrary to various multilateral 201 agreements South Africa has entered into and contrary to good environmental governance. 7.2 INTRODUCTION Tsetse flies are the most important vectors for African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) in cattle. Although indigenous wild mammals have resistance to trypanosomes, susceptible cattle develop clinical trypanosomiasis. T he eradication of tsetse flies from KwaZulu -Natal (and therefore South Afri ca) has been proposed by several authors (International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 2006; Kappmeier Green, Potgieter & Vreysen 2007). The IAEA has a Technical Cooperation Project, 'Supporting a Feasibility Study to Eradicate Tsetse from Southern Mozambique , South Africa and Swaziland', under the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/IAEA Programme, 'Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture', as part of its peaceful use of nuclear technology theme (IAEA n.d.). This eradication proposal (EP) recomme nds using the aerosol technique (SAT) over north -eastern KwaZulu -Natal (neKZN; Figure 1), a region with a number of very important protected areas, including a World Heritage Site (WHS) and five Ramsar sites. SAT involves blanket spraying an ins ecticide from the air several times to suppress tsetse fly populations. Deltamethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid, at a low concentration of active ingredient, has been proposed as the insecticide of choice (IAEA 2006). The SAT would be followed by the sterile insect technique (SIT) in which millions of sterilised male tsetse flies are released to eradicate the flies through suppression of reproduction. Although generally believed to have low environmental build -up and greater specificity to invertebrates , delta methrin is pernicious in aquatic systems. It has been recorded in fish liver, water, and sediment samples in South Africa, and it has been found in trace amounts in the Ndumo Game Reserve and Tembe Elephant Park (Ansara -Ross et al. 2012), both of which are in the proposed spray region. Further contamination by deltamethrin of protected areas that are held in public trust for the conservation of biodiversity should not be permitted. Deltamethrin poses a significant risk to non -target species, including aquatic insects and macrocrustaceans (Ansara -Ross et al. 2012). Implementation of the EP would have detrimental consequences that are not restricted to tsetse flies and trypanosomes, bu t will include several non -target species of conservation concern 202 and others of great biodiversity and ecosystem service value. Area -wide eradication of tsetse flies in KwaZulu -Natal and the adjacent part of Mozambique and Swaziland is still promoted in th e scientific literature (e.g. De Beer, Venter & Vreysen 2015). The study by Perkins and Ramberg (2004) on the impacts of deltamethrin applied via the SAT in 2001 and 2002 to eradicate tsetse flies from the Okavango Delta (OD) and the recovery study in 2003 have been used to justify why the EP would be acceptable from an environmental viewpoint. Little critique of, or research on, the negative impacts that the eradication course of action would have on biodiversity has been published. Hence, this review give s reasons why the EP should not be carried out from a biodiversity conservation viewpoint, and indeed may not be carried out in protected areas. 203 Source : IAEA 2006; Smith & Nhancale 2010; cartography by Heidi Snyman FIGURE 1: Protected areas, including a World Heritage Site and five Ramsar sites, and priority areas for protection that would be blanket aerially sprayed with deltamethrin and where millions of sterilised male tsetse flies would be released. 204 7.3 THE BIODIVERSITY CASE AGAINST IMPLEMENTATION OF TH E ERADICATION PROPOSAL 7.3.1 Various South African legislations promulgated to conserve biodiversity would be contravened The consideration and implementation of a strategy to eradicate tsetse flies within a region of South Africa, and importantly in existing protected areas, is seen to contravene South Africa's constitutional and environmental laws and some African and global multilateral agreements this country has entered into. The Environmental Right in the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of South Africa affords a right to present and future generations to have, inter alia , protection and conservation of the environment which is devoid of ecological degradation, and that all use of the environment must be ecologically sustainable within a context of justi fiable economic and social development. Therefore, the EP presents a significant risk of contravening the supreme law of the country. Derived from the Environmental Right, the National Environmental Management Act (No. 107 of 1998) (NEMA) provides for a se t of environmental principles that: serve as guidelines by reference to which any organ of state must exercise any function when taking any decision in terms of this Act or any statutory provision concerning the protection of the environment. (Republic of South Africa Government 1998, s. 2, ss. 1). The application of these principles is binding on all organs of state. Within these, NEMA brings into South African law the public trust doctrine which is defined as: The environment is held in public trust for t he people, the beneficial use of environmental resources must serve the public interest and the environment must be protected as the people's common heritage. (Republic of South Africa Government 1998, s. 2, ss. 4o). The remainder of the environmental prin ciples provide the guidance and the tools necessary to ensure that the trust entity (the environment) is not depleted or degraded (Blackmore 2015a). The application of the public trust doctrine is 205 further reinforced by section 3 of the National Environment al Management: Biodiversity Act (No. 10 of 2004) (NEMBA) and the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act (No. 57 of 2003) (NEMPAA) in which both biodiversity and protected areas are held, by the State, in trust for the people of South Africa , thereby clearly bringing biodiversity, and in this case the tsetse flies, into the public trust entity (the environment). Thus, the State has fiduciary duty to ensure, through all of its organs of state, the protection of the tsetse flies as species with in South Africa as well as a component of biodiversity occurring within the country's protected areas (Blackmore 2014). The EP is in conflict with the 2003 African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (the Maputo Convention) that requires state parties to undertake measures, inter alia, to avoid or eliminate risks to biodiversity that manifest at species and habitat levels (Article X). Furthermore, the parties to the Convention are to ensure that they, inter alia : to the maximum ex tent possible, take all necessary measures to ensure that development activities and projects are based on sound environmental policies and do not have adverse effects on natural resources and the environment in general. (Article XIV, s. 2.a); IUCN 2004). The 1999 Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol on Wildlife Conservation and Law Enforcement requires each state party to apply their fiduciary duty to ensure that its wildlife resources are conserved and used sustainably (Southern African Development Community 1999, Article 3, s. 1.). The protocol also requires SADC countries to refrain from causing 'damage to the wildlife resources of other states or in areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction' (Southern African Development Communi ty 1999, Article 3, s. 1.). The request or expectation of South Africa to eradicate tsetse flies in this country, by neighbouring countries, would conflict with this provision (Blackmore 2015b). The EP is also in conflict with the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Ramsar and World Heritage Conventions, to which South Africa is a signatory. Given that the South African distribution of tsetse flies includes protected areas that are Ramsar a nd WHS sites (Figure 1), the provisions of these conventions 206 also apply. The global recognition of these sites is founded mainly on the species and habitat assemblages that occur within these protected areas. South Africa has an obligation to protect the O utstanding Universal Values of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park WHS: it fulfilled, inter alia , the criterion of containing 'the most important and significant natural habitats for in -situ conservation of biological diversity' (United Nations Educational, Scie ntific and Cultural Organisation 2015, s. II.D, ss. 77(x)); the prerequisite condition of integrity included the condition that 'The properties should contain habitats for maintaining the most diverse fauna and flora characteristic of the bio -geographic pr ovince and ecosystems under consideration' (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation 2015, s. II.E, ss. 95) . It is thus common cause that the WHS would include a complete assemblage of co -evolved animals, including indigenous mammal s, tsetse flies and trypanosomes. By entering into these multilateral agreements, and thereafter having applied for both listing and the inscription of these protected areas, the State has fundamentally bound itself to conserving and protecting all indigenous species and habitats that comprise the biodiversity of these sites (section 231 of the Constitution). Furthermore, these multilateral agreements have also been bought into South Africa's jurisprudence by way of the NEMA (section 2[4][n]) and the NEMBA (section 5), and within an array of explicit provisions in the NEMPAA. The NEMPAA further requires the State to ensure that the management of a protected area is commensurate with the purpose it was declared as such (Blackmore 2015a, 2015b). Finally , by way of a schedule to the World Heritage Convention Act (No. 49 of 1999), the Convention is explicitly brought into South African law. The entire Convention and all provisions of this Convention are, therefore, binding on all organs of state. Even outs ide protected areas, the State has a duty to conserve indigenous biodiversity. 7.3.2 Tsetse flies and trypanosomes are part of biodiversity Tsetse flies and trypanosomes are ancient and remarkable organisms, being components of indigenous biodiversity, and have intrinsic existence value. A 207 maximum of about nine final instar larvae are born live per female and so tsetse flies are 'K -selected' ( Nagel 1995), rather like humans and elephants. They are the only insects that live entirely on blood, and they have become model organisms in biology (Snyder & Rio 2013). Trypanosomes are remarkable for their ability to live in two hosts, and to evade the mammalian immune system, mediated through changes in their surface glycoproteins (Matthews 2005). The trypanosome has beco me a model organism in the study of cell biology and genetics. 7.3.3 Ecosystem health and functioning would be compromised Indigenous parasites and their vectors are important components of biodiversity. Tsetse flies are eaten by many animals (Nagel 1995), and s o if they are eradicated, the food -web structure will be altered, which would result in a less stable and resilient animal community. The elimination of a parasite from an ecosystem can strongly affect the interactions between a diverse range of species in the community, both hosts and non -hosts, and hence affect biodiversity (Lebarbenchon et al. 2007). Parasites such as trypanosomes are an integral part, and are vital to the maintenance, of biodiversity. Parasitic species increase the species richness of a n area dramatically, and parasites alter the outcomes of competition between, and therefore the relative abundance of, other animal species. Parasites increase the number of linkages in food webs and therefore the connectivity and cohesion of the food webs , as well as increase the average number of links per species and the lengths of food chains. These factors increase the stability of food webs and therefore of biotic communities. Animals at higher trophic levels are less vulnerable to predators but more vulnerable to parasites. All of these factors cause an increase in ecosystem stability (Lafferty, Dobson & Kuris 2006). Parasites can divert host energy towards investment in immune function, reduce reproductive success and increase susceptibility to preda tors or to stress. Many parasites have significant effects on the survival, behaviour, growth and competitive ability of their animal hosts, and therefore play a role in natural population regulation and have an important influence on the flow of 208 energy be tween various trophic levels. Parasites influence speciation through changes in animal life histories and gene flow and by influencing the ways in which species interact. The end result is that parasites increase the health of ecosystems (Hudson, Dobson & Lafferty 2006). The following local example is illustrative of a role of tsetse flies and trypanosomes in ecosystems. R.H.T.P. Harris discovered in Zululand in the 1920s that shape and shading were important in the attraction of tsetse flies to their hosts . A unicoloured mammal of horizontal, cylindrical shape with its undersurface in shadow attracts tsetse flies; the horizontal cylindrical body profile of a zebra is 'broken up' by vertical black and white contrasting stripes, rendering them unattractive to biting flies, and they are seldom bitten. Therefore, the characteristic striping of zebras evolved to avoid the attention of biting flies, especially tsetse flies (Caro et al. 2014; Egri et al. 2012; Waage 1981). Classic equine symptoms of trypanosomiasis are known in zebras, and the disease may come at a greater fitness cost than for wildebeest (Caro et al. 1986). Therefore, the striped coats of zebras appear to have an adaptive function to reduc e the risk of parasitism by trypanosomes. Direct pathological effects of trypanosomes on populations of wild mammals will most likely occur when animals are stressed (Ford 1971; Glover 1965; Molyneux 1982), such as in times of drought and poor food availability or high competition with other species (cf. Melton 1987). In a prolonged drought situation, reduction in population numbers may be crucial to avoid severe habitat degradation (Walker et al. 1987). Trypanos omes may play a role in reducing populations of certain species more quickly under these circumstances. 7.3.4 Non-target organisms would be detrimentally impacted The OD study documented that the SAT had immediate, significant, measurable impacts on non -target o rganisms, some of which were long lasting (Perkins & Ramberg 2004; Ramberg et al. 2006). Abundance of aquatic invertebrates and terrestrial invertebrates was reduced by up to 50% and 70%, respectively, and the losses of higher aquatic invertebrate taxa and of species in the canopies of 209 various tree species was up to 30% and 40%, respectively, after spraying. There was a significant effect of deltamethrin spray on the abundance and community composition of non -target invertebrate organisms (Perkins & Ramberg 2004) . Although recovery of assemblages to near those present pre -spray was documented in the recovery study of 2003, some of the spray -affected families of aquatic organisms remained at reduced levels and 10% of the identified species may have been lost because of spraying. In the terrestrial invertebrate recovery study, the long -term fate of 18 rare species flagged as missing could not be determined. However, only four tree species out of the approximately 1300 vascular plant species and subspecies in th e OD were sampled and five major invertebrate groups analysed (Perkins & Ramberg 2004; Ramberg et al. 2006). Given that many invertebrates are host specific, even at lower taxonomic levels, or are microhabitat specific, the long -term impact of the SAT on t he total terrestrial invertebrate assemblage of the OD could not be determined from such a small sample . Little follow -up study was done in the OD to determine whether any 'lost' species may have been extirpated from the sprayed area. For example, various Odonata were severely affected by the aerial spraying and t he disappearance of 22 species of dragonflies and damselflies from the Delta was plausibly the result of the aerial spraying (Ramberg et al. 2006). Kipping (2010) recorded some of the 'lost' specie s again in the OD, as would be expected for non -endemic mobile species, but some species historically recorded in the OD were not recorded after the spraying. Kurugundla , Kgori and Moleele (2012) summarised the impacts of the SAT using deltamethrin that wa s carried out in the Kwando -Linyanti region in 2006, which included severe detrimental impacts on orthopterans. 7.3.5 The biodiversity of the north -eastern KwaZulu - Natal is more susceptible to the sequential aerosol technique than that of the Okavango Delta Although the proposed number of insecticide sprays is fewer than in the OD because of the proposal to use the SIT in conjunction with insecticide sprays, severe negative impacts can still be expected if the EP were to be implemented. The OD is part of a vast, relatively uniform savanna, and generally the species 210 there are widely distributed. No species were known to be endemic to the OD (Cowling & Hilton -Taylor 1997; Ramberg et al. 2006). The re -appearance of hardy and mobile species after the spraying could be reasonably expected. In contrast, Maputaland is hemmed in by the sea on one side and by mountains on another, and consists of a diverse mosaic of habitats. The Maputaland Centre of Endemism is part of the Maputaland -Pondoland -Albany global biodiversity ho tspot (Cowling & Hilton -Taylor 1997; Steenkamp et al. 2004). The negative impacts of the SAT would likely be greater in Maputaland than in the OD owing to greater habitat heterogeneity, environmental stability, numbers of localised endemics and perhaps mor e specific relationships between certain invertebrates and particular host plant species or localised vegetation types. For example, moth species assemblages differ between Ndumo Game Reserve, Tembe Elephant Park, Manguzi Forest Reserve and Kosi Bay which are all in relatively close proximity (Figure 1; Staude 2016; see Staude 1999 for other comparisons). Seventy -three per cent of the total 322 species recorded in these protected areas have only been found in one reserve. Conversely, in the northern Kalahar i, there is very little change in looper moth composition between Shakawe and Maun, which are about 250 km apart (Staude 2016). Re -establishment of populations of species that were vulnerable to deltamethrin would depend on nearby sources of immigrants and the lack of barriers (e.g. Longley et al. 1997). These conditions would not be fulfilled for Maputaland endemics and likely not for species with patchy distributions in a transformed and fragmented landscape. Extirpation of non -target organisms in north -eastern KwaZulu -Natal: Extermination of tsetse flies can have repercussions for other elements of biodiversity. Predators of tsetse flies may be forced to feed on other prey (Nagel 1995) and may be reduced in number. Parasites (including trypanosomes) and parasitoids of tsetse flies may be concomitantly exterminated or reduced in number. Parasitoids and predators are important for the control of tsetse and other fly populations (Glasgow 1963). The mourning bee fly Exhyalanthrax lugens , which parasitises tsetse fly pupae, of neKZN that were aerially spraye d with DDT even before the pale -footed tsetse fly Glossina pallidipes itself was eradicated (Fiedler, Du Toit & Kluge 1954; Fiedler & Kluge 1954). This bee fly did not return to the sprayed areas, nor was it and another parasite of tsetse fly pupae, the ab rupt bee fly Exhyalanthrax abruptus , recorded at the 211 uMkhuze Game Reserve in an extended survey carried out between 2002 and 2005 (Greathead et al. 2006). This suggests that the spraying had long -term impacts on some non -target species and that the control of other tsetse flies may have been affected, perhaps allowing populations of other tsetse fly species to expand (cf. Esterhuizen et al. 2005). Parasitoids endemic to Maputaland (Figure 2) will be susceptible to reduction in numbers and eventual eliminati on, depending on their specificity to the tsetse fly hosts and sensitivity to the SAT. Ecological processes such as the population control of other flies may therefore be affected. a b Source : Photos taken by Adrian Armstrong FIGURE 2: Two Maputaland -endemic bee flies, (a) the Mozambique bee fly Exoprosopa mozambica (female) and (b) the dull -white -banded bee fly Exoprosopa albata (males). Additionally, some lepidopteran species disappeared from the sprayed area to the south and east of the Lebombo Mountains . For example, Rhodometra satura (Figure 3) has not been seen again in the sprayed areas despite the presence of appropriate habitat , host plants and populations to the north. Chionopora tarachodes (Figure 3) is one of several other ex amples of Maputaland -endemic looper moths that may be vulnerable to SAT (Staude 2016). 212 a b Source : Photos taken by Hermann Staude FIGURE 3: (a) Saturated vestal moth Rhodometra satura and Chionopora tarachodes . Red List: Some Rare, non -endemic invertebrate species were present in the OD before the commencement of the SAT in 2001, but no threatened endemics (Ramberg et al. 2006). In contrast, the Critically 4) and the vulnerable blue river crab Potamonautes lividus are endemic or near -endemic to neKZN and the wider Maputaland region (IUCN 2016; Samways 2006). M ost, if not all, of these species would be severely affected were the EP implemented. Some Rare butterfly species, including the white spotted sapphire Iolaus lulua (Figure 4) , , that complete their whole life -cycles on plants, are also endemic to the same region (eds. Mecenero et al. 2013). Deltamethrin is known to cause mortality of butterfly larvae at very low doses, including relatively long -term delayed mortality of larvae and pupae through sublethal effects, as well as loss in fitness in survivors (\u00c7igli & Jepson 1995). Other no n-endemic Red List species occur in neKZN. The threat status of most invertebrate groups in South Africa is unknown, but some species have their entire life -cycles in the canopy of trees or on bushes in the region, and these may be susceptible to local ext inction if the EP were to be implemented. 213 a b Source : (a) Photo taken by Michael Samways, (b) photo taken by Steve Woodhall FIGURE 4: (a) vulnerable Maputaland -endemic Umsingazi spotted sapphire Iolaus lulua . Some other susceptible invertebrates: Dragonflies and damselflies, b eetles, grasshoppers and crickets, and spiders were some groups negatively affected by the SAT in the OD (Kurugundla et al. 2012; Perkins & Ramberg 2004; Ramberg et al. 2006). Owing to the diversity of habitats, neKZN is an important area for Odonata (50% of the species in South Africa are known to occur there) which contribute to various ecosystem services (Hart et al. 2014). Implementation of the proposed SAT would have negative repercussions for Odonata. Amongst the beetle families in neKZN, leaf beetles (Family Chrysomelidae) may be severely affected by the SAT . Many species in the subfamilies Chrysomelinae and Cassidina e have traits that make them very vulnerable to heavy mortality or extinction through aerial application of insecticides, including traits such as host specificity (often at plant species or genus level), living exposed on plants for most or all life -cycle stages and winglessness (Chaboo 2007; Grobbelaar 2016; Heron 1997; Figure 5). Not only do leaf beetles contribute to ecosystem functioning through their herbivory, but many good flyers are also pollinators. Orthoptera are important herbivores i n the savannas (Scholes & Walker 1993), and at least seven genera of grasshoppers and three genera of crickets have flightless species endemic or near-endemic to Maputaland. Spiders are very important predators of other invertebrates, and some spiders that live above -ground, including on tree trunks and on grass, are known to be sensitive and even very sensitive to deltamethrin (Nagel 1995). Maputaland has a high diversity of spiders (e.g. Haddad & Russell - Smith 2009). Declines in populations of at least so me species of spider, if not 214 extinction, would occur if the EP were to be implemented, and n on-lethal effects would affect invertebrate community structure and ecological processes to some degree . a b Source : Photos taken by Adrian Armstrong FIGURE 5: (a) A pitted flightless leaf beetle Iscadida alveolata (Chrysomelinae) tortoise beetle Aspidimorpha nigropunctata (Cassidinae). The negative effects of factors such as climate change on the persistence of elements of biodiversity may either be added to or multiplied with the negative effects of other factors, such as habitat loss (Jewitt et al. 2015a), increased pollution, increase d use of pesticides and drought, to cause a greater negative effect than if just one factor was operating on biodiversity. The impact of insecticide spray, acting additively or synergistically with other factors, may push some species towards extinction or lead to local extirpation through decrease in population size, including through various genetic effects in small and isolated populations (e.g. Pekin 2013). Conservation is required in various parts of the range of a species, particularly for endemic spe cies that occur at low densities and in restricted habitats. 215 7.3.6 Negative ecosystem effects are likely 7.3.6.1. Negative ecosystem effects in the aquatic environment The use of deltamethrin in the OD affected the full spectrum of aquatic habitats and animals, from water surface predators to sediment -dwelling mayflies, with negative impacts to a wide range of non -target aquatic organisms, representing many of the functi onal feeding groups of aquatic macroinvertebrates (Perkins & Ramberg 2004). Community recovery was affected, with some changes to community structure and function. A good example of impacts from the OD study concerns freshwater shrimps Caridina species that were severely negatively affected by the deltamethrin applications and showed poor recovery. Freshwater shrimps (Figure 6) are important in various freshwater lakes in neKZN: they are the dominant zoobenthic species of the littoral zone of Lak e Sibaya in terms of biomass, and occur in nearly every marginal habitat, and are abundant in various habitats at Lake Mgobezeleni (Bruton 1980; Hart 1979, 1980). These detritivores will be important in the process of the mineralisation of detritus. Lake S ibaya and many of the wetlands in neKZN are closed systems, being rain fed and with drainage internal to the region, so the shrimps will not be able to re -colonise them from elsewhere should the EP be implemented. Source : Photo taken by John Craigie FIGURE 6: Freshwater shrimp Caridina species. In Lake Sibaya and in pans on the Pongolo River floodplain, Caridina was found to be a main food in the diet of the tank goby Glossogobius giurus , 216 manyspined -tooth catfish Clarias gariepinus , and together with aquatic insects form part of the diet of other fish such as young tigerfish Hydrocynus vittatus , 1980). Deltamethrin is known to be toxic to even hardy fish, and can cause mortality of, or non -lethal effects in, fish (e.g. Huang et al. 2014). Cascading negative ecosystem effects might occur in neKZN should the EP be implemented. Impact on livelihoods of poor rural people: Fish are important in the diets of poor rural people in Maputaland, and t he fish species mentioned in the preceding paragraph are important for the local fishermen (Bruton & Kok 1980; Coetzee et al. 2015; Kok 1980). The livelihoods of these poor rural people in the spray area would likely be negatively impacted were the EP to b e implemented, through impact on the prey base of fish species that are important in their diets. Actions that reduce the provision of ecosystem services must be properly weighed up against the benefits of the actions. 7.3.6.2. Negative ecosystem effects in the ter restrial environment Invertebrates play very important roles in the functioning of ecosystems. Implementation of the EP will have impacts on ecological processes and ecosystem services, as illustrated by the selected examples below. Nutrient (carbon, nitro gen and phosphorus) cycling from leaves to the soil: Herbivorous invertebrate communities play very important roles in the recycling of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus from vegetation to the soil, making these nutrients more readily available to plants and other micro -organisms than would otherwise happen (Metcalfe et al. 2013). The detrimental impacts that the EP would have on insect herbivore communities could negatively affect ecosystem carbon sequestration and soil fertility, particularly in sub -tropica l forests and grasslands, at least in the short term. Scholes and Walker (1993) reported that leaf-feeding grasshoppers and lepidopteran larvae removed about 5% of the foliar primary production in an infertile, sub -tropical, broad -leafed savanna, and a greater proportion of foliar primary production in fertile sub -tropical, fine -leafed 217 savanna. This biomass is returned to the soil as faeces, bodies and cut pieces of leaves that are more easily processed by detritivores and bacteria than abscised leaves. The plant nutrients are thereby more efficiently recycled to the soil to assist plant growth. Pollination of flowering plants: Reduction in pollination efficiency may occur if non -target pollinators (such as bees, bee flies, beetles and tabanid flies) are reduced in number or extirpated. Pollination limitation may lead to a reduction in or absence of recruitment of certain plant species through poor or absent seed production (Potts et al. 2010), a reduction in the preferred food supply of certain herbivores, and so on. Some wild pollinators, particularly bees, have been declining globally, in part owing to the lethal and sublethal effects of insecticides, which may act synergistically with other drivers such as habitat loss and disease (Potts et al. 2010). An estimated 94% of plant species in the latitudinal band 29\u00b0 - 0\u00b0 are biotically pollinated, mainly by insects (Ollerton, Winfre e & Tarrant 2011), and the impact on the pollination of some of the plant species of Maputaland could be severe if the EP were to be implemented. Vamosi et al. (2006) show that animal -pollinated plants in plant hotspots have reduced seed -sets owing to grea ter pollen -limitation than elsewhere, and human -mediated impacts on pollinators may eventually lead to the extinction of plant species. Bees may be killed or disabled by deltamethrin, depending on the genus or species of bee (Desneux, Decourtye & Delpuech 2007; Scott-Dupree, Conroy & Harris 2009). Other pollinating insect groups have not been studied the way bees have been, but the same general impacts are likely. Toxicity of a particular insecticide to different pollinators can vary markedly. However, Scott -Dupree et al. (2009) found that d eltamethrin is highly toxic to alfalfa leaf -cutting bees Megachile rotundata , an important indigenous North American pollinator of native plants and cultivated crops. At least 20 species of Megachile bees occur in neKZN (Eardley 2013 and references therein ) and deltamethrin may be highly toxic to them. Parasitism and predation: Parasitoid and predator insects are important for controlling insect populations. Deltamethrin is known to have lethal and a wide variety of sublethal effects on insect parasitoids a nd predators (e.g. Desneux et al. 2007; Longley et al. 1997). A small change in the reproductive potential of parasitoids can disrupt biological control and make it less successful. Deltamethrin 218 can act synergistically with another pesticide in terms of de trimental effects (Desneux et al. 2007). Ecosystem services relied on by poor rural people: Implementation of the EP would affect ecosystem services needed by, or important to, poor rural people. Poor rural communities in the proposed spray region are reli ant on indigenous plants to maintain health and treat disease, and use indigenous plants and other vegetables and fruits as food (Cunningham 1988a, 1988b; Ellis, Myers & Ricketts 2015). Many of these are insect -pollinated and a variety of wild insect polli nators are vital for good fruit production in many pollinator -dependent vegetable and fruit crops (Garibaldi et al. 2011, 2013). Managed honeybee pollination cannot replace wild insect pollination for many of these crops. Predatory insects and insect paras itoids that assist with the control of pests of crops (e.g. Samways 1988), including those of poor rural people, would be adversely affected by broad -scale SAT using deltamethrin, with likely detrimental impacts on crop production, food security and tradit ional medicine resources. Crop production may be affected where poor rural people rely on ecosystem services rather than fertilisers for soil fertility. Many rural people in neKZN rely directly or indirectly on activities associated with wildlife for incom e (Aylward & Lutz 2003). Protected areas are reservoirs of natural resources, including invertebrates that mediate ecosystem processes and services. Biological control: Alien plant biological control projects in neKZN might be negatively affected were the EP implemented. One of the probable reasons why neKZN does not have great problems with feral and alien invasive mammals is that these mammals are susceptible to diseases such as trypanosomiasis. If trypanosomes, and in future other disease -causing parasites and their vectors, are deliberately exterminated in neKZN, feral and alien invasive mammal problems would likely increase, with corresponding increased imp acts on indigenous species. Various domesticated animals that have the ability to become feral are susceptible to trypanosomiasis (Nwoha 2013), and when controlling factors for those species are reduced or eliminated, the feral species are released from po pulation control and can cause changes in community structure and function, including extinctions of indigenous species (Hollings et al. 2016). Controlling feral and alien mammals would be costly. 219 Stable host -parasite relationships: Eradication of tsetse f lies and certain trypanosome species would disrupt the stable host -parasite relationship between the trypanosomes and the native mammalian wildlife. Should these tsetse flies and trypanosomes return to the region after a certain period, severe clinical trypanosomiasis would be likely in wild mammals. Immunity against local trypanosomes but not against foreign trypanosomes is a known phenomenon (Ford 1971). South African rhinos that were translocated to areas where different trypanosomes were encountered , and rhinos brought into Maputaland from areas that do not have trypanosomes, suffered from trypanosomiasis. Some died and others had to be treated. Also, if tsetse fly parasites have been eliminated, tsetse fly populations could build up rapidly again. The r easoning that tsetse flies would not come back to the region if the whole population was eradicated can also be used to support the claim that the eradication would then be unnecessary as neither would the population expand northwards. 7.3.7 The eradication of t rypanosomes without proper cattle population controls would likely exacerbate the destruction of biodiversity Forty-four vegetation types occur in the approximate area of occurrence of tsetse flies in KwaZulu -Natal. Ten of these vegetation types are classe d as Critically Endangered, eight as Endangered, five as vulnerable and 21 as Least Threatened. Targets for protection have been reached in only 14 of the 44 vegetation types; two of the Critically Endangered vegetation types are not protected. Existing pr otected areas fall short of conserving a representative sample of the diversity of the region, and accordingly emphasise the importance of areas outside protected areas for meeting South Africa's and Mozambique's and Swaziland's conservation commitments (S mith et al. 2008). The rate of land transformation is high at an average of 1.2% of KwaZulu -Natal per annum between 1994 and 2011 (Jewitt et al . 2015b). Therefore, reaching the conservation targets in the future is becoming less likely. Risks associated wi th tsetse fly eradication include increasing cattle and other livestock numbers, leading to a reduction of vegetation cover, increasing runoff and erosion, increased pressure on conserved areas, increased transmission of livestock diseases to wild mammals and vice versa, and reduction in biodiversity and increase in alien plants 220 through overgrazing. Contrary to the EP (IAEA 2006), the argument for not eradicating tsetse flies has in fact become stronger in this respect. 7.3.8 Environment -friendly methods and opti ons for the control of trypanosomiasis in cattle Alternative options currently exist to reduce the incidence and prevalence of trypanosomiasis in cattle without causing extinction of indigenous species, and other options will be available in the future. Normal veterinary measures that include trypanosomiasis surveillance, dipping of cattle using appropriate dips or else the use of pour -ons and treatment of infected cattle with trypanocides have proved effective in the past (Kappmeier, Nevill & Bagnall 1998) . Trypanosomiasis is not the only, nor the most important, disease in cattle in neKZN. Tick -borne diseases also have to be controlled using the same methods. Decentralised control of animal husbandry at the farmer level using environment -friendly methods c ould be the ultimate goal. Rather than area - wide eradication, creation of local grazing areas free of tsetse flies would assist the farmer and would be more environment -friendly. For many centuries, communities practicing agriculture have been able to resi de successfully in areas where tsetse flies existed via local adaptations in the ways the communities formed and lived (e.g. Anderson et al. 2015; Ford 1971). Colonialism and the impacts of its practices and pastoralist migrations often had adverse impacts on these ways of life (e.g. Anderson et al. 2015; Ford 1971). The consequences of the gradual encroachment of people and cattle into an area where tsetse flies occur on the epidemiology of bovine trypanosomiasis are well known (Molyneux 1982; Van Den Boss che 2001). Hunting of indigenous mammals and continuous clearing of vegetation eventually removed the hosts and breeding habitat of the tsetse flies, which then disappeared from the area. This enabled farming with crops and cattle to occur even within the tsetse belts (Ford 1971; Kent 1926; Van Den Bossche 2001). Trypanosomiasis in cattle is likely to be more severe where the cattle are close to the boundaries of protected areas or other areas of suitable tsetse fly habitat with wild mammal hosts (De Beer et al. 2016; Van Den Bossche 2001) . Glossina austeni has a short flight distance and is predominantly restricted to forest in KwaZulu -Natal (Esterhuizen et al. 2005). 221 Keeping cattle away from forest or bush would greatly reduce the incidence of trypanosomia sis in cattle. This could be achieved by grazing cattle on fenced pastures and by keeping cattle out of protected area buffers or away from protected area boundaries. Trypanosomiasis in cattle is more severe where poor nutrition or other stress factors are present (Ford 1971; Holmes 2013). Improvement in the immune system and general health of cattle will occur with improvement in the condition of grazing lands and maintenance of these in good condition through rehabilitation of grazing lands, adherence to appropriate stocking and land resting rates, and implementation of an integrated land -use plan with designated grazing areas (e.g. pastures) where tsetse flies cannot breed. Traps and targets are effective for tsetse flies in KwaZulu -Natal (Esterhuizen et al. 2006; Kappmeier & Nevill 1999), and so could be used to good effect on cattle grazing lands that are within the normal flight range of tsetse flies, especially Glossina brevipalpis . Certain species of trypanosomes such as Trypanosoma vivax are transmit ted via the proboscis of blood -feeding flies, including tsetse flies, horse flies (Family Tabanidae) and stable flies (Genus Stomoxys ). So the eradication of tsetse flies alone will not prevent trypanosomiasis in cattle (Ahmed et al. 2016). Replacing susce ptible cattle by cattle with resistance to trypanosomes in a recapitalisation programme would be fruitful (Department of Agriculture 1950; Holmes 2013). Maintenance of heterozygosity by rotation of breeding bulls should be practiced to decrease susceptibil ity of calves to transmittable diseases such as trypanosomiasis (Murray et al. 2013). Maintenance of physiological adaptation of the cattle to trypanosomes, as occurred in Nguni cattle (Department of Agriculture 1950), would be required. Stress may cause c attle to loss resistance, so it may be necessary to use other means than cattle for ploughing. Tractors are alternatives to cattle for draught power and are preferred in terms of modernisation of agriculture. In addition, modern agricultural thinking empha sises the value of no - till farming which has grown remarkably in KwaZulu -Natal because of its benefits for the farmer and carbon storage. Cattle coat colour selection could be used to good effect. White horse models are very unattractive to tabanid flies ( Egri et al. 2012), and blue and black are most attractive to tsetse flies in neKZN (Kappmeier & Nevill 1999). If the majority of Nguni cattle near the boundaries of protected areas had light coats, the incidence of trypanosomiasis may be reduced further. 222 White-coloured cattle were kept by the king of the Mtetwa clan, King Dingiswayo, in the iMfolozi Game Reserve area before it was proclaimed a reserve (Foster 1955). Perhaps, this was a local adaptation to the presence of tsetse flies and horse flies, the wh ite coats of the cattle not being attractive to them. Maputaland is not South Africa's major beef -producing region, and nature tourism plays a major economic and development role in neKZN (eds. Aylward & Lutz 2003). The dependence on cattle as a monetary s ystem could be reduced through diversifying income streams, including small business development around wildlife or the green economy. Environmental costs (many of which are not financial) have not been quantified or incorporated into a cost -benefit analys is in terms of the EP. Further, opportunity costs, depending on what are the pressing social needs, and costs and benefits of alternative management strategies would also have to be included. A significant contribution to livestock productivity could be ac hieved by investing in the control of invasive alien plants that are invading and reducing the grazing capacity in neKZN, such as famine weed Parthenium hysterophorus . With the sequencing of the trypanosome genome complete, and genetic research on trypanos omes proceeding well, there is a good chance that biochemical and molecular genetic techniques can be used to prevent or reduce trypanosomiasis in cattle in the future (e.g. Caljon, De Vooght & Van Den Abbeele 2013). The development of vaccines could be on e outcome. Owing to the great strides that are being made in understanding the biology of trypanosomes, long -lasting environment -friendly solutions for the prevention of trypanosomiasis in cattle are likely. 7.4 CONCLUSION The proposed mass killing of inverte brates, including parasites, as mooted in the tsetse fly EP, would be illegal and detrimental to the biodiversity of South Africa, as was the destruction of 'game' in the middle of the 20th century. Eradication of tsetse flies from protected areas and the use of aerial spraying of insecticides over vast regions is no longer an option in a country that prides itself on its conservation principals with innovative and advanced environmental protection laws. A total ban on insecticide use and the SIT is not wha t is being proposed here, but rather conservative and environmentally judicial use where 223 needed at local grazing land scales, if appropriate. A variety of techniques are now available to combat trypanosomiasis in cattle, and in future others should become available. The more environment -friendly ones should be priority for use at the grazing land scale. 7.5 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife for assisting with the research and publication of this work.

MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR FREE -ROAMING ELEPHANT IN SOUTH AFRICA Andrew Blackmore and Arie Trouwborst 8.1 ABSTRACT In 2008, South Africa adopted its 'National Norms and Standards for the Management of Elephants in South Africa'. Concern has subsequently been raised as to whether these norms and standards apply to free -ranging elephant on land which had not been enclosed with a fence \u2014 with the express purpose of containing these animals and other game on the property. The application of these norms and standar ds pivots on whether the owner(s) of the property have taken possession of these animals in accordance with common law applicable to game, or have given effect to the provisions of the Game Theft Act. To address this concern, this paper briefly explores th e evolution of South African regulatory jurisprudence applicable to game, including elephant, and analyses the norms and standards in relation to international and national legislation and common law applying to elephants. The norms and standards are not a pplicable to unowned, free-roaming elephant. These norms and standards therefore do not fulfil their primary objective of uniform management of elephant across South Africa. This limitation of the norms and standards therefore needs to be considered when t hey are revised. Keywords: Elephant; Game; Common Law; Management Plans; Multilateral and standards; Ownership; Public Trust Doctrine; Norms and Standards; Res nullius ; Wildlife. 8.2 THE CONUNDRUM National Norms and Standards for the Management of Elephants in South Africa (DEAT 2008) implemented in terms of Section 9 of the National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act 10 of 2004 (NEMBA) requires landowners or the management authority (as the case may be) with wild elephant on their 238 properties, to compile and have adopted an elephant management plan by the relevant political head (DEAT 2007). While not legally binding, these norms and standards provide authoritative guidance to officials when implementing the legislation of relevance to elephants (Hopkinson et al. 2008). The norms and standards apply to land that has been declared as a protected area, a registered game farm, or which is considered to be private or communal land. Furthermore, such land is required to be appropriately fenced in order to contain the elephant. The norms and standards are, however, not explicit on who is responsible for free roaming elephant that have not been restrained by fences, or which have crossed over from countries neighbouring South Africa. The purpose of this paper is to gain an understanding of the provisions in South African and international law that would point to who is responsible \u2014 if anyone at all \u2014 for developing and having adopted by the relevant authority, a manage ment plan for a single elephant, or groups or populations of elephant that are considered free -roaming and not enclosed within a fenced estate. To achieve this, the paper first introduces the history and international context of elephant management plans. Subsequently, it delves into the questions of ownership of, and responsibility for, elephant \u2014 and the specific issue of elephant management plans. 8.3 A BRIEF HISTORY AND INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT OF ELEPHANT MANAGEMENT PLANS The use, and hence ownership, of wild life has been a hot topic in South Africa at least since the early rule of Van Riebeek in the Cape Colony where certain sectors of society were precluded from hunting (Rabie 1976; Couzens & Blackmore 2010). For the next 200 years, various governors attempt ed to curtail the consumptive use of wildlife in that they believed that unregulated or indiscriminate hunting had led to the demise of this resource in the Colony (Couzens & Blackmore 2010). In in the late 1800s, the Cape introduced the Better Preservatio n of Game Act 36 of 1886, which restricted the right to, inter alia , 'kill, catch, capture, pursue, hunt, or shoot game' by the landowner, unless the person wishing to undertake such an activity possessed a licence (Mackenzie 1988). This right could be established by the landowner issuing a warning either in person, or by letter or a 239 notice in the Gazette or local newspaper \u2014 with the intention to preserve the game on the land in question (Tennant & Jackson 1895). In many respects, notwithstanding an encroa chment on the res nullius status of game (Couzens & Blackmore 2010), this provision was the earliest legal foundation for the establishment of a 'game farm' or 'private protected area', in that this Act granted the landowner an unfettered right to manage a nd protect wildlife on his property. Similarly, the colonial powers in Africa expressed concern over the significant decrease in wildlife throughout the continent. This concern was rooted in the Convention for the Preservation of Wild Animals, Birds, and F ish in Africa (1900 London Convention). Although this Convention never entered into force, it was significant in that it not only brought into the international arena the consequences of unregulated, commutative use of wildlife and the potential extinction of species such as elephant, but also introduced the need to establish extensive systems of 'reserves' in which indigenous wildlife could persist in a undisturbed or wild state. Such a state was deemed to be achieved only when the land set aside for this purpose had 'all the qualifications necessary as regards food, water, and, if possible, salt, for preserving birds or other wild animals, and for affording them necessary quiet during the breeding time' (Article II). It was the intent of the Convention to facilitate domestic legislation that rendered it unlawful to 'hunt, capture, or kill any bird or other wild animal except those which shall be specially exempted from protection by the local authorities' (Article II). This provision naturally provides for the requirement that the reserve be actively monitored and managed in order for the reserve authority to be in a position to grant such exemptions and continue to fulfil the intent of the Convention. The drafting of this Convention was deemed to be profoun d, in that it represented the earliest record requiring the active management, protection and conservation of, inter alia , elephant. These provisions of the 1900 London Convention were enhanced by subsequent multilateral environmental agreements \u2014 culminat ing in the 1968 African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (Algiers Convention). One of the hallmarks of this latter Convention is the explicit requirement of management plans 'based on scientific principles' \u2014 for, inter alia , the management of wildlife inside 'designated areas' in accordance with the objectives of such areas, and also to 'manage exploitable wildlife populations outside such areas ..., compatible with and complementary to other land uses' 240 (Article VII). It must be assumed that 'designated areas', although not defined in the Convention, would naturally include formal protected or conservation areas. Parties are furthermore required to ensure that elephant are 'totally protected' both within and outside protected a reas \u2014 entailing a prohibition on hunting, killing and capture, except when specially authorised by the competent authorities (Article VIII). South Africa, however, is neither party nor signatory to the Algiers Convention. The Algiers Convention is to be r eplaced by the 2003 revised African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (Maputo Convention). Although the Maputo Convention is still to enter into force, since submitting its ratification in 2013 South Africa is already under a general obligation to 'refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose' of the Convention (1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 18). This, together with the active role played by South Africa in the development of the Conventi on, puts this multilateral agreement at an equivalent level to domestic policy. Furthermore, as noted elsewhere (see Blackmore 2017), the Convention played a significant role in the formulation of the NEMBA and the regulations thereto. Against this backdro p, South Africa would need to be guided by and strive to fulfil the provisions of this Convention. The Maputo Convention requires contracting parties to actively manage animal populations within the country's array of protected areas in accordance with the objective of such areas. In addition, the Convention requires, inter alia , that contracting parties provide appropriate protection to currently or potentially threatened species, and the same for species that are migratory or congregatory. It stands to re ason that these provisions would be best met by way of a species -specific management plan, such as that provided in Section 9 of NEMBA. This is the legal foundation for affected landowners to develop and implement an elephant management plan, as provided f or in the National Norms and Standards for the Management of Elephants in South Africa (DEAT 2008). Significantly, one of the stated objectives of these elephant norms and standards is to ensure that elephant management in South Africa is regulated in a wa y that conforms to the country's 'international obligations in terms of international agreements on biodiversity management binding on the Republic' (Section 2). 241 The non -binding but authoritative World Charter for Nature, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1982, contains a general requirement that '[a]ll planning shall include, among its essential elements, the formulation of strategies for the conservation of nature'. The equally general provisions in the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity include an obligation for states to develop 'national strategies, plans or programmes for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity or adapt for this purpose existing strategies, plans or programmes' (Article 6). Finally, while not requiring spe cific domestic wildlife management plans, the SADC Protocol on Wildlife Conservation and Law Enforcement (SADC 1999) imposes an obligation on each of its contracting parties, including South Africa, to 'ensure the conservation and sustainable use of wildli fe resources under its jurisdiction' and to take 'such policy, administrative and legal measures as appropriate' to achieve this (Article 3). Furthermore, it sets in place the foundation for broad wildlife management and enforcement co -operation across SAD C state boundaries. Given that elephant populations abutting the country's borders have or may have home ranges that are transboundary in nature, management of these populations, and hence the associated management plans, would need to be aligned between t he affected countries. This significance of the Protocol to this issue is briefly revisited below. 8.4 OWNERSHIP OF AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR ELEPHANT, IN A NUTSHELL The conundrum is who owns the free -ranging elephant? South Africa, as did many others countries, founded its legal system on Roman or Roman -Dutch law (Muir 2016). In these legal systems, game (including elephant) are subject to the common law concept of ' res nullius '. Simply put, res nullius literally means 'property of no one' \u2014 but it can be owned by a person, on their own accord, by taking possession. This is opposed to ' res communis' (common property that cannot be privately owned) and ' res publica ' which is commonly held (public) property, which may be privately owned when such ownership is granted by a relevant state authority. In the case of game, possession (and hence ownership) is commonly achieved, inter alia , through hunting, shooting, seizing, ca pturing 242 and uniquely marking (e.g. branding) an animal. Under these circumstances, the animal or animals possessed in this manner would be clearly distinguishable from other free -ranging individuals of the same species. The loss of physical control over an animal \u2014 for instance when an unmarked animal is stolen or escapes \u2014 would however result in concomitant loss in ownership of that animal (Couzens & Lewis 2015; Muir 2016). In seeking to establish an extensive or semi -extensive wildlife area, it is both illogical and impractical for a landowner to take physical control of each of his or her animals in accordance with the common law principle of ownership. It was for this reas on that the South African legislature promulgated the Game Theft Act in 1991 (Rumsey 2009; Couzens & Lewis 2015; Muir 2016). This Act grants ownership of game to that person (or persons) who keeps or holds game on land that is sufficiently enclosed (Sectio n 2). The Act further enables the owner to retain ownership of the sufficiently enclosed game should it escape, or be hunted or seized without, inter alia , the owner's permission (Muir 2016). Thus, the owner of a sufficiently enclosed property (game farm, protected area, or private or communal land), would not lose ownership of, or responsibility for, his or her escaped elephant. The corollary of this is that game moving onto a property that is not sufficiently enclosed would not ordinarily become the prope rty of the owner of the land \u2014 unless this owner takes physical possession of the animals by way of shooting, capture or enclosing them by way of an adequate fence in accordance with the provisions of the Game Theft Act. It would also be counter to natural law for any person to take possession and claim ownership of an animal, when it is common knowledge that the animal had recently escaped and was legally possessed by its owner. For instance, should a landowner be the sole source of elephant and if it woul d be unlikely that an elephant could have originated from elsewhere, that elephant would be considered property of and hence would remain in the ownership of, that particular land owner. Under such circumstances, the owner of the escaped elephant would nee d to be given a reasonable opportunity to recover it, as was afforded to SanParks with the escape of 'Sylvester' the lion from Karoo National Park (news24 2016). While this circumstance holds for recently escaped animals, the retention of ownership may not hold where it may be argued that uncommon or uniquely held wildlife have increased in numbers, causing them to reassume their wild ( ferae naturae ) or non -captive status such 243 that they can move or escape into neighbouring properties (Muir 2016). In such circumstance, these animals would be considered res nullius and hence predisposed to being captured and owned by another person ( Magudu Game Company v Mathenjwa 2008). Taking an international perspective, notwithstanding that the res nullius principle applie s to all including the state, game (including elephant) occurring within the country are considered subject to South African sovereignty (De Klemm 1989). Should elephant, however, move from South Africa to one a neighbouring country, those animals, in acco rdance with this common law principle, would become the sovereign property of the neighbouring state \u2014 unless an international agreement determines otherwise (De Klemm 1989). Such circumstance would prevail regardless of whether the landowner was deemed to have been granted a certificate of adequate enclosure in terms of the Game Theft Act, in that domestic legislation has no standing outside South Africa. The multilateral environmental agreements pertaining to wildlife \u2014 in particular the Protocol on Wildl ife Conservation and Law Enforcement and the Convention on Migratory Species \u2014 recognise the vested interests abutting countries have in terms of the responsible treatment by their neighbours of wildlife populations that straddle or commute across internat ional borders, and hence stress the need for co -operation and joint management of these populations by the affected countries (Carr & Scott 1999; Selier et al. 2017). The SADC Protocol sets out a joint requirement for states parties to 'cooperate to develo p as far as possible common approaches to the conservation and sustainable use of wildlife' (Article 3). Furthermore, each party shall 'cooperate with other Member States to manage shared wildlife resources' (Article 3). The reference to cooperation concer ning 'shared wildlife resources' in the SADC Protocol raises the issue of the 'shared natural resources' concept under general international law. As Birnie et al. (2009) describe it, the essence of this concept is a 'limited form of community interest, usu ally involving a small group of states in geographical contiguity, which exercise shared rights over the resources in question'. The 1974 Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, for instance, sets out the following principle: 'In the exploitation of natural resources shared by two or more countries each state must co -operate on the basis of a system of 244 information and prior consultation in order to achieve optimum use of such resources without causing damage to the legitimate interests of others' ( Article 3). The notion was developed further in the 1978 UNEP Principles on Conservation and Harmonious Utilization of Natural Resources Shared by Two or More States, which received a measure of endorsement by the UN General Assembly (UNGA Resolution 34/18 6, 1979). According to the UNEP Principles, the main obligations of states concerning shared natural resources concern transboundary cooperation and equitable utilisation (Principle 1). While it is relatively uncontentious that shared watercourses classify as 'shared natural resources' in the above sense, there is some debate about whether migratory and other transboundary wildlife species can be classified such (Birnie et al. 2009; Selier et al. 2016). In sum then, customary international law does not appe ar to impose significant limitations on the sovereignty of South Africa over elephant living on its territory \u2014 other than a general requirement to cooperate with neighbouring states regarding the conservation and management of elephant belonging to transb oundary populations (Birnie et al. 2009; Bowman et al. 2010; Selier et al. 2016). One suitable way of giving effect to the general duty of cooperation concerning shared natural resources, is the joint development and management of transfrontier conservatio n areas (TFCAs) (Lubbe 2014). For instance, the 2002 Treaty for the Establishment of the Great Limpopo records the aspiration of the states of Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe to develop a 'wildlife sanctuary across political boundaries, where animals may freely roam and flourish in keeping with natural ecological processes' (Preamble). To that end, the Treaty establishes several more detailed cooperation commitments and the necessary institutional framework. Similarly, the 2011 Treaty on the Establish ment of the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA TFCA) was concluded by Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe, for the 'primary purpose of harmonizing policies, strategies and practices for managing shared natural resources that s traddle the international borders' of the five parties (Article 2, emphasis added). Another suitable way of implementing the 'shared natural resources' concept is the creation of international agreements or plans tailored to particular transboundary wildli fe populations (Trouwborst 2015; Selier et al. 2016). A 245 pertinent example is the Collaborative Policy and Planning Framework for the Management of Elephants that was developed by the Trilateral Technical Committee of the Greater Mapungubwe TFCA \u2014 and targe ting the elephant population of the Central Limpopo River Valley shared between Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe (GMTFCA TTC 2011; see, also, Selier et al . 2016). Unfortunately, however, this need for transboundary coordination is poorly reflected in th e South African norms and standards (DEAT 2008). As Selier et al. (2016:130) note, 'a drawback of the Elephant Norms and Standards is that they do not effectively cater to elephant movements between South Africa and neighbouring countries'. Furthermore, '[ g]iven the emphasis on elephant management within fenced areas, the Norms and Standards' implications for the elephant population utilizing the GMTFCA are less than clear' (Selier et al. 2016). Underpinning the country's sovereignty, section 3 of the NEMBA re-affirms the state as the trustee of the country's biodiversity, and, as such, it has a fiduciary duty to manage, conserve and sustain South Africa's biodiversity in fulfilment of the environmental right in the Constitution's Bill of Rights (Blackmore 2 015). As with common law pertaining to trusts in general, although non -possessed free - roaming elephant in South Africa are sovereign to the country, such status cannot be misconstrued with ownership. As the trustee, the government cannot arbitrarily become the owner of the objects of the trust, in that the trust objects are held, not owned, on behalf of the beneficiaries. For the government to legally possess free-roaming elephant, it would need to comply with the common law pertaining to the ownership of w ildlife, and therein take physical control of the animals. The practical and legal challenges of such an action are vast \u2014 and full outside the scope of this paper. 8.5 ELEPHANT MANAGEMENT PLANS The provision of norms and standards for use and management plans is rooted in section 146 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (1996), where there is, inter alia , a requirement to regulate a matter uniformly across the country. This uniform ity was given effect by way of norms and standards to the 2007 Threatened or Protected Species Regulations (TOPS) to the NEMBA. 246 The objectives of the norms and standards include the need to achieve 'specific management objectives of protected areas, regis tered game farms, private or communal land' which relate to the ensuring the 'long term survival of elephants within the ecosystem in which they occur or may occur in future' (DEAT 2008). It is safe to conclude that the purpose and application of the norms and standards (Section 2) is limited to those parcels of land in which the conservation of wildlife is a primary consideration. Thus, in circumstances where the presence of elephant is extraneous to the primary use of the land, and the land owner has not made any purposeful efforts to take possession of the animals, the landowner would not be required to compile and have adopted a management plan. The norms and standards do, however, define the scope in which management plans may apply, by defining the ci rcumstances under which elephant may be 'kept' (Sections 5 & 6). These include an extensive wildlife system that forms part of a declared protected area or registered game farm, or private or communal land. The keeping of elephant is not defined in the nor ms and standards, and hence the common use of the term would prevail. As such, the keeping of elephant would imply 'ownership' (Concise Oxford Dictionary 2011). In this case, given that the common law regarding ownership of game would apply, the landowner would need to have at least applied the provision of the Game Theft Act to take ownership of the elephant that happened to occur on his or her property. In the absence of the landowner taking purposeful ownership of the elephant on his or her property, the refore, the norms and standards would not apply. Further and interestingly, section 5 of the Act is silent on 'state land' that is not a protected area or considered communal land. Organs of state that have land vested in their care, such as the South Afri can Defence Force, would thus not be required to comply with the norms and standards should elephant occur on their vested property. Interestingly, in certain cases 'free roaming' elephant may still be covered to some degree by an elephant management plan, particularly when the elephant originate from a (protected) area where a management plan applies. For instance, the Elephant Management Plan for the Kruger National Park contains detailed provisions on how to deal with damage causing elephants outside the National Park, based on an agreement between SANParks and the Mpumalanga and 247 Limpopo provincial authorities (SANParks Scientific Services & Kruger Park Management 2012, Section 4.2.2.2). While the definition of an 'extensive wildlife system' in the TOPS R egulations may encompass land used for purposes other than wildlife conservation, it would be unlawful in the absence of reasonable compensation, for the reasons given above, to compel the landowner or landowners to comply with the norms and standards. Giv en the sovereignty status of game, the state is ultimately responsible for the country's wildlife. Thus, game considered to be res nullius is ultimately in the ownership of the state until such time it is possessed and taken ownership of by a person. Shoul d it be a prerequisite to have management plans in place for all elephant in the country, it would be common cause that the state would have to assume responsibility for free -roaming, unowned elephant. 8.6 CONCLUSION The National Norms and Standards for the M anagement of Elephants in South Africa were brought into force to ensure that, inter alia , wild elephant were subject to a management plan. While these norms and standards clearly apply to proclaimed protected areas, registered game farms, and private and communal land that has been sufficiently fenced in accordance with the Game Theft Act, the same cannot be said for open, unfenced land on which elephant naturally occur. A lacuna does appear to exist in the norms and standards where elephant are free-roami ng and where a person has not taken possession of the animals. Furthermore, a lacuna in the norms and standards is evident where ownership of elephant is ambiguous or where the land is in the ownership of a state and is vested for purposes other than wildl ife management. Given that, in terms of the provisions within the Constitution, norms and standards are to bring uniformity to elephant management across the country \u2014 the 2008 National Norms and Standards for the Management of Elephants need to be amended to accommodate the above lacunae . 8.7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank Ms Magdel Boshoff, Deputy Director: Threatened or Protected Species Policy Development, Department of 248 Environment, Pretoria, for raising the uncertainty regarding who is responsible for management plans for free -roaming elephant.

It is apparent that in the 20 odd years since the adoption of South Africa's Constitution, the existence and importance of the public trust doctrine within the academic and legal diaspora, bureaucratic decision -making and the courts, has largely been overlooked.624 This observation evokes curiosity about the meaning of the doctrine and its relevance in, at least, the conservation of biodiversity in a South African context. 9.1.1 Synopsis of the Origins and Evolution of the Doctrin e 9.1.1.1 Roman Law The public trust doctrine has its roots in Roman and Roman customary law \u2014 and South Africa, as did several other countries, inherited Roman law from its antecedent Anglo -Saxon colonial powers. This formed the basis on which the country founded its legal system. In its essence, the public trust doctrine is based on the concept that certain components of the natural environment are inherently considered to be res omnium communes and res extra commercium , in that they are common to all and cannot be held in private ownership (for example fisheries and waterways).625 This is opposed to res publica , which are commonly held resources which, under certain circumstances, may be held in private ownership by way of res privatae or res singulorum (for example the communication frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum),626 or res nullius in which an object (for example a wild animal) is owned by no one but may become owned by a 623 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996. 624 Blackmore ( 2018a (2012). 626 Blackmore (2017d). 253 person taking physical possession.627 The distinction between res omnium commu nes, res publica , and res nullius , may not necessarily be absolute and constant over time, in that the public retain a vested interest (to varying degrees, and depending on the magnitude) in the use and disbursement of components of the natural environment . This is particularly relevant in such circumstances where a natural resource is no longer abundant , or the integrity of the resource may be threatened by way of a specific or cumulative use. The evolution of the public trust doctrine from its Roman roots , and its resultant flexibility in addressing previously unconceived human -induced threats to the natural environment , has been comprehensively demonstrated in the United States.628 This led to speculation that South Africa,629 as well as Brazil, Canada, Ecuad or, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Swaziland, the Philippines, and Uganda630 (and perhaps other countries) , purposefully imported the doctrine, either implicitly or explicitly, from the United States into their respective environmental legal syste ms. An analysis of the statutes comprising South Africa's environmental law, suggests, however, that there was not a hermetic import , and that the public trust doctrine is more likely to have had several origins.631 Of these, the evolution of the doctrine i n Africa , and its ultimate influence on South Africa and its fledgling democratic legal system following the end of apartheid in 1994 , is probably the most profound.632 9.1.1.2 Development of the Public Trust Doctrine in Africa While not explicitly stated, the prob able beginnings of the public trust doctrine in Africa may be traced to the 19th century and the drafting of the Convention of the Preservation of Wild Animals, Birds and Fish in Africa (the 1900 London Convention). Recognising the rapid loss of wildlife a s a result of both trophy and 627 Blackmore (2017d) ; Muir ). 632 Ibid. 254 meat hunting, this Convention endeavoured to form the foundation for the colonial powers' fiducial duties to regulate the indiscriminate consumptive use of wildlife, and to set in place protected areas to conserve representati ve samples of biodiversity.633 This Convention never came into force, and was replaced by the 1933 London Convention (The Convention Relative to the Preservation of Fauna and Flora in their Natural State). From a public trust perspective, the hallmark of the 1933 London Convention was the enrichment of protected areas, with the founding of the requirement of a system of national parks, as well as the establishment of 'strict natural reserves' as a prime means to safeguard each territory's biodiversity.634 While embracing the concept that wildlife needed to be conserved for the current and future common good, it also recognised that the protected areas were a key instrument in giving effect to this fiduciary duty. It was for this reason that the Convention required its colonial powers to pr ohibit (save under exceptional circumstances) the alienation of any part of an established protected area. While the common -sense relationship of this provision to the public trust doctrine is evident, the subtle significance of this provision lies in poli cy being able to prescribe what is unquestionably considered to fall within the scope of res omnium communes or res extra commercium (the public trust entity) and res publica . The 1933 London Convention also recognised that the value of biodiversity (in the form of wildlife) may be enhanced by domestication.635,636 In this, the Convention recognised that this activity could pose a threat to wildlife \u2014 633 Article II of the Convention of the Preservation of Wild Animals, Birds and Fish in Africa (1900). 634 Article 2(1) ; Blackmore (2017b) . 635 Article 7(8). 636 The proposed 'domestication' of wildlife in this Convention is given emphasis because it serves to illustration that a particular use of wildlife may have significant negative consequences for the wild populations of species used and the broader natural environment. This consideration has arisen in the recent upsurge in selective and intensive breeding of wildlife, which is discussed in Chapters 4 and 5. Thus, domestication of wildlife is not per se a concern from a public trust doctrine, but the impacts t hereof need to be considered from the doctrine's perspective. 255 particularly that which is protected in strict nature reserves.637 By making this distinction between what is dom esticated (appreciably through selective and possibly intensive breeding of wildlife ) and what is free ranging and genetically un-manipulated wildlife, the drafters of the Convention and the signatories thereto recognised that human manipulation of the cha racter of wildlife may pose a significant threat to the wildlife trust entity.638 Recognition of the issue of domestication and the potential consequences thereof for a country's wildlife was short lived, as the domestication of wildlife failed to be include d in the 1968 Algiers Convention (and subsequent African multilateral environmental agreements) which replaced the 1933 London Convention.639 The issue of the domestication of wildlife remained dormant for 70 years until the exploitation of genetic products of biodiversity became a conservation concern, which resulted in the adoption of the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit -Sharing. A further 10 years then lapsed before selective breeding and intensive management of wildlife became a common practice in So uth Africa (and recently in Namibia where a breeding facility has been established) ,640 thus posing a potential threat to the country's wildlife in general , as well as specific economic components of the wildlife industry.641 The significance of this is discus sed below. Apart from a key focus on wildlife and protected areas, an additional hallmark of the 1933 London Convention was a broadening of the scope of the public trust duties of the colonial powers to include 'objects of aesthetic, geological, prehistori c, historical, archaeological, or other scientific interest'. The Convention explicitly noted that these environmental values were to be safeguarded for the 'benefit, advantage, and enjoyment of the general public'.642 The significance of this inclusion into the Convention is the realisation that a greater variety of environmental components (significantly both natural and those derived from activities of people) required active consideration, management and protection, in 637 Article 642 Section 2(1). 256 order for these to be available for enjoyment by current and future generations. This Convention, therefore, ushered in a growing awareness that the environment is finite and in many respects includes non -renewable components that need to be proactively safeguarded. Prior to the drafting of the 1968 Algiers Convention (African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources) and its replacement of the 1933 London Convention,643 the now independent African states under the auspices of the then Organisation of African Unity, adopte d the Arusha Manifesto , which was a truly African statement on the conservation and protection of the continent's natural environment. In his opening address at the launch of the Manifesto, the first prime minister of the then Tanganyika (now Tanzania), Ju lius Nyerere, expressed the core concerns and ultimate purpose of the Manifesto: (a) the inextricable dependence of the health and wellbeing of Africans on a naturally functioning and sustainably used natural environment, and (b) the fact that newly establ ished African governments ha d an obligation to act as a trustee of their country's wildlife (as an inheritance) for the enjoyment of future generations.644 Julius Nyerere and the Arusha Manifesto , thus, formally brought the doctrine of public trusteeship into African multilateral jurisprudence. Following the Manifesto's lead, the hallmark of the 1968 Algiers Convention lies in the further extension of the fiduciary duties of the African states to the ent ire environment, by way of the inclusion of edaphic and hydrological considerations.645 The Algiers Convention is poised to be superseded by the (revised) African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, which was signed in Maputo in 2003 (the Maputo Convention).646 The Maputo Convention enhances the trust requirement of its parties to consider and bring marine issues on a par with terrestrial biodiversity conservation. In this, parties are obliged to establish, maintain and expand an in tegrated network of protected areas, as a 643 Adopted in Algiers, Algeria, on 15 September 1968, and entered into force on 16 June 1969. 644 IUCN, Conservation of nature and natural resources in modern African States (1961). 645 See Articles IV and V. 646 African Union (2003) African Convention on Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources . 257 means to ensure that representative samples of African terrestrial and, importantly, marine biodiversity, are formally protected and safeguarded.647 The significance of this history lies not only in 100 years of Afr ica embracing the fundamental importance of the fiduciary duties of each African state to protect its biodiversity, but also in the extension of the doctrine far beyond its original Roman application: its application to every aspect of each county's natura l and cultural environments. The evolution of the doctrine in this multilateral context has also provided a firm foundation for, at least, the African states, and particularly South Africa , to bring the doctrine into their respective environmental jurispru dences.648 9.1.1.3 Origin of the public trust doctrine in South African environmental law The obvious origin of the public trust doctrine provisions in the various statutes that constitute South Africa's environmental law, from a legal perspective, is section 24 of the Bill of Rights in the country's constitution: Everyone has the right \u2014 (a) to an environment that is not harmful to their health or well -being; and (b) to have the environment protected, for the benefit of present and future generations, through reas onable legislative and other measures that\u2014 (i) prevent pollution and ecological degradation; (ii) promote conservation; and (iii) secure ecologically sustainable development and use of natural resources while promoting justifiable economic and social development.649 647 Article XII. 648 Blackmore ( 2015b) . 649 Section 24 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996. 258 The adoption of this Environmental Right into the country's constitutional law represented a landmark which grounded South Africa in understanding the importance of conservation and the inextricable dependence of people's health and wellbeing o n a functional and heathy natural environment.650 The re - acceptance and concomitant repositioning of South Africa following the country's democratisation in 1994 allowed its legislature to import and enhance the contemporary (both African and global) underst anding of the public trust doctrine. As mentioned above, while some commentators have suggested that the adoption of the doctrine into South African environmental law was solely by way of a hermetic import of a 'Saxion' interpretation (and with that an U.S.-orientated understanding and hence application) of the concept,651 the significant influence of the development of the doctrine in Africa, as described above \u2014 as well as its domestic evolution from first principles of the concept \u2014 has largely been overlooked.652 Speculative analysis of the South African legal provisions relating to the public trust and the concomitant fiduciary duties of government, suggest s a number of bloodlines of the doctrine. For instance, the stark parallels between the provisions of South Africa's Policy on Environmental Management653 and the Brundtland Report,654 and concomitantly the 1992 Declaration on Environment and Development,655 and the Convention on Biological Diversity, suggest a strong rooting of the doctrine in Western and gl obal multilateral environmental agreements and international soft -law ideology.656 In sharp contrast, however, the provisions in specific environmental legislation provided for by NEMA657 suggest a strong rooting of the doctrine in an African multilateral agre ement setting, as White Paper on Environmental Management Policy for South Africa 1998. 654 Brundtland (1987). 655 Principle 15. 656 Blackmore (2015b) and ( 2018a ). 657 National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act 57 of 2003, and National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act 10 of 2004. 259 discussed above.658 The coastal zone and air quality legislation, however, tend to be more aligned with the original Roman and Roman -Dutch principles, upon which South African law is predominantly based.659 Furthermore, provisions emulating the public trust doctrine within the legislation regulating water quality and quantity appear to have had a strong Western influence \u2014 by way of the guidance from Joseph Sax, Joseph Dellapenna and possibly others.660 Finally, the assumption that South Africa unilaterally imported the well - developed understanding and application of the doctrine from U.S., is further countered by the discovery that the doctrine has not been uniformly codified across and, in certain insta nces within, the various disciplines comprising the environment.661 For example, despite the consultation with Professor Sax and others,662 the explicit provision of the public trust doctrine in the National Water Act663 appears to be inconsistent with other key trust-related provisions in the Act. The most profound in this regard is a fiduciary duty of the government to safeguard the minimum requirement of water in order to ensure the ecological integrity of the country's water bodies.664 Here the drafters created an exceptionally progressive provision that appears to confer an absolute right to the environment, by way of setting in place the ecological reserve \u2014 but appears to be extremely conservative, if not overly restrictive, in defining the scope of the trust in section 3. In this section, the fiducial duties of government are limited to 'promoting environmental values', which is in sharp contrast to confirming a right by way of the ecological reserve. 658 Blackmore (2018a ). 659 Ibid. 660 Here it was discovered that Professors Sax and Dellapenna were purposefully consulted by the drafters of the National Water Act 36 of 1998 on, inter alia , the role of government and its fiduciary duties in water conservation (see Blackmore 2018a ). 661 Blackm ore (2018a ). 662 Officials of the then Department of Water Affairs met with both Professor Joseph Sax and Professor Joseph Dellapenna on the content and wording of the Act. See: Blackmore (2018a ). 663 Act 36 (2018a ). 260 Likewise, section 5(1)(b) of the National Heritage Resour ces Act665 appears to conflate the responsibility of the trustee and the beneficiaries. These observations suggest that, at the time of drafting the components of South Africa's environmental legislation, the authors of at least these two statutes \u2014 as well as the legislature adopting such into law \u2014 may not have had a thorough and cohesive understanding of the public trust doctrine.666 Furthermore, the nature of the public trust doctrine as codified in the specific environmental Acts provided for in NEMA, sugg ests different origins. NEMA, by way of its founding policy667 and environmental principles, suggests a close affinity with the Brundtland Report and the Rio Declaration , whereas (despite its founding policy)668 the NEMBA and the NEMPA have a strong affinity w ith an African origin \u2014 while (as pointed out above) NEMICA is more closely aligned with the doctrine's Roman roots. It is thus concluded that it is unlikely that the public trust doctrine in South Africa n environmental law was a hermetic import (of the do ctrine's scope) from a single source. From at least a biodiversity perspective, South Africa appears to have had a greater African influence than a Western one.669 The importance of this observation relates to the fact that the interpretation of the fiduciar y duties of the South African government is more complex than an import of a 'Saxion' interpretation of the doctrine. Thus, to interpret the application of the doct rine arbitrarily, could subject the fiducial decisions taken on legal review. Given the potentially multiple origins of the South African environmental trust duties, the country is best p laced to develop, while naturally mindful of its African and global use, its own public trust jurisprudence. It is further concluded that, given the doctrine's multiple pedigrees, its application is unlikely to be uniform across the various disciplines that constitute the environment in South African law. The disparities in its codification suggest that South Africa has signi ficant uncharted territory to cover in respect of 665 Act 25 of 1999. 666 Blackmore (2018a ). 667 White Paper on Environmental Management Policy for South Africa (1998). 668 White Paper on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of South Africa's Biodiversity (1997). Published in GN 1095 July 1997. ). 261 developing a full and defendable understanding of the role and significance of the doctrine. 9.1.2 Public Trust Doctrine Anatomy Globally, the public trust doctrine has enjoyed a plethora of definitions. Many of these, and the concomitant understanding of the application of the public trust doctrine, have been based on legislative reasoning, and academic arguments and judgment. For example, Professor Joseph Sax described the doctrine as the 'principle purpose of government to promote the interests of the general public rather than to redistribute public goods from broad public uses to restricted private benefit',670 and argued that the 'central substantive thought' in public trust proceedings is '[w]hen a state hold s a resource which is available for the free use of the general public, a court will look with considerable scepticism upon any government conduct which is calculated either to reallocate that resource to more restricted uses or to subject public uses to t he self -interest of private parties'.671 By way of contrast, Waweru v Republic of Kenya defined the doctrine as follows: the 'State, as trustee, is under a fiduciary duty to deal with the trust property, being the common natural resources, in a manner that i s in the interests of the general public'.672 South Africa's National Environmental Management Act673 holds the doctrine as 'The environment is held in public trust for the people, [and] the beneficial use of environmental resources must serve the public inter est and the environment must be protected as the people's common heritage'.674 Subsequently, in one of the few South African legal proceedings in which the concept of the public trust was relied upon, Justice Ngcobo stated that the concept of 'sustainable de velopment will ensure that socio -economic developments remain firmly attached to their ecological roots and these roots are protected and nurtured so that they may support future socio -economic developments.'675 670 Sax (1970), quoted in Redmond (2009). 671 Sax (1970). 672 Waweru v Republic (2007). 673 Act 107 of 1998. 674 Section 2(4)(o). 675 Fuel Retailers Association of Southern Africa v Director -General Environmental Management (2007). 262 Irrespective of the definition, or the history within which it evolved, a contemporary understanding of public trust may be reduced to the key components listed below. The division of the trust into its components provides insights not only into the nature of the doctrine, but importantly into how the doctrine is to be applied. These were discussed in the main chapters of this thesis. The public trust doctrine comprises the following components : (a) human health and wellbeing are inextricably linked to the natural environment and the provision of envi ronmental products and services (b) the environment (the public trust entity) needs to be described and quantified by at least the trustees and known by the beneficiaries , (c) environmental decision -making should not compromise the potential opportuniti es or health and wellbeing of others or further generations, and therein the concept of intra - and inter -generational equity is embraced , (d) certain components that constitute the environment cannot be alienated into private ownership or irreversibly los t, (e) trustees of the environment are bound by fiduciary obligations to safeguard the environment and are accountable to the public for decisions taken or not taken, and (f) there is a clear separation of the roles and responsibilities of the trustee (the government) and the beneficiaries (the people).' 676 These six components that comprise the public trust principle, make implicit that the fiduciary duties of government are both progressive and retrospective.677 Thus, in those circumstances where the natural environment has historically been allowed to degrade, or the sustainable -use threshold ha s been exceeded, through active decisions taken (or by way of indecision), the government retains its fiduciary obligat ions to rehabilitate, remediate and restore that which was lost by the public trust entity.678 This conclusion is underpinned by section 28 of NEMA 676 Extracted rovides for, inter alia , the remediation of environmental damage that occurred before the commencement of the Act , i.e. prior to 1999. The challenge facing government is the recovery of the costs of the restoration, in accordance with the polluter -pays principle , from those who caused and benefited from the damage. In many respects, given the difficulty of unequivocally identifying the responsible person or persons, the cost of the restoration becomes a public burden, in that the public \u2014 the current beneficiaries \u2014 would be expected to fund the cost of recovering the damaged public trust entity through the ir taxes and other levies.679 This observation raises another dimension to the public trust doctrine which may require investigation in time to come. This is the current beneficiaries' role in, or obligation to, restore that component of the trust entity which was unsustainably used by themselves or a previous generation.680 This conundrum is mainly being explored in the research and reasoning surrounding efforts to address global phenomena like climate change. However, responsibilit y and accountabilit y pertain ing generally to 'a cause and effect' \u2014 at least at the level of continued biodiversity loss and extinction at a country level \u2014 remain (from a public trust perspective) unexplored. Notwithstanding this reflection, South African environmental laws, and in particular NEMA, provide a legal opportunity for both the government and, importantly, the public , to intercede where the environment and biodiversity are placed at risk.681 9.1.3 Application of the Doctrine in Decision -Making As with the common law application of the doctrine, NEMA obligates all organs of state, and hence the officials therein, to apply the public trust doctrine and other environmental principles when making decisions that concern the environment.682 Ensuring the application of the public trust do ctrine , however , remains a challenge for decision -makers. This observation is particularly relevant 679 Ibid. 680 United Nations Secretary General's High level Panel on Global Sustainability. 2012. Resilient People, Resilient Planet: A future worth choosing . New York: United Nations. (quoted in Turnipseed et al. (2012), Du Plessis 2015). 681 Blackmore (2014). 682 Section 2(1). 264 in a country like South Africa, where the concept has been, for all intents and purposes, overlooked \u2014 and as a result its application is in its infancy. Th e same applies to the general public when questioning whether the public trust doctrine was appropriately applied in a decision taken by a government official, or during the review of the decision taken. From a biodiversity perspective, the application of public -doctrine thinking and gaining an understanding of the sensitivity of or risk to the environment, may be achieved by applying a series of questions. The purpose of applying guiding questions would naturally be directed at determining the extent or si gnificance of the residual negative impact, after mitigation, on the environment. An array of questions is proposed as a framework for exploring the sensitivity of the biodiversity trust entity to a particular use. In so doing, the bureaucrat, legal practitioner, member of the public, or researcher \u2014 as the case may be \u2014 would be able t o gauge whether the integrity of the biodiversity public trust entity is at significant risk or has even been compromised. In so doing, these questions probe, in part, the details derived from various components of the doctrine discussed in section 3 above . While the focus of this thesis is on biodiversity, a similar concise and wieldy array of questions could be derived for the other components constituting the natural and cultural environments to assist in identifying whether the public trust entity o r components are at risk of being irreversibly damaged through a current or proposed use. While a plethora of guiding questions could be generated in order to determine the potential impacts on the public trust entity, it is common cause that their ultimate value lies in them being concise and efficient (readily tractable by both the decision -making bureaucrat or the public ) at bring ing focus on the significant and pertinent public trust concerns. The biodiversity trust questions identified in this research are: Is the biodiversity involved rare, unique, or endangered, or does it have significant historical significance? Is the component of biodiversity used or impacted upon easily replaced? 265 Will the proposed action or decision have any significant consequential effect on other actions or initiatives that provide for the conservation of biodiversity? Are the negative consequences of an action or decision realistically or reasonably reversible? Can damages or costs for mitigation and amelioration of negative conse quences be reasonably recovered from those responsible for the environmental damage? Have the cumulative impacts of human activities on the elements of biodiversity under consideration exceeded any sustainable -use threshold? Is there sufficient confidence (i.e. defendable information) that the trust object (biodiversity) will not be damaged? Will the impacts of the activity be reasonably mitigated or remediated within a meaningful time frame, or in the foreseeable future, or within a period that ensures str ict compliance with the conditions of the decision? Will the realisation of potential economic and social benefits that require the safeguarding of biodiversity, be compromised?683 The aim of these questions is to empower an official to apply the public trus t doctrine. In so doing, it enables attention to be focused on the core concern arising from the proposed use or potential damage to biodiversity vis-a-vis other components of the environment. This focus enables the official to: (a) take into consideration the potential adverse impacts on affected biodiversity, (b) authorise activities that do not significantly impair biological diversity, (c) be able to appropriately monitor the impacts of the use of biodiversity as a means to ensure the protection corpus of the trust, and ( d) set in place appropriate legal interventions to halt potential significant harm and to recover damages to biodiversity.684,685 683 Blackmore ( 2017a) . from Blackmore ( 2017a). 266 In accorda nce with the principle of the public trust doctrine, a similar array of questions could be asked by the public in order to gauge whether an official has exercised due diligence in assessing and conditionally granting the right to damage a component of the environment \u2014 thereby ensuring the integrity of biodiversity as a whole.686 Where a decision fails to pass muster, the National Environmental Management Act687 empowers an individual or an organi sation to seek relief from the courts.688 This is founded on granti ng people the locus standi to approach the courts in their own or the group's interest, or on behalf of a person or group of persons who are unable to institute legal action (i.e. future generations) \u2014 in the public interest or in the interest of protectin g the environment.689 Should such litigation prove unsuccessful, the court may waive costs where such action was, inter alia , 'reasonably out of a concern for the public interest or in the interest of protecting the environment'.690 This concession removes the disincentive caused by the cost of litigation, and therein makes the courts more accessible to people who have a genuine interest in protecting the environment and ensuring that the country's environmental laws are appropriately implemented and enforced. Furthermore, NEMA provides protection for whistle -blowers691 and can seek the assistance of the courts to enforce the country's environmental legislation and to institute a private prosecution in the public's interest or in the interest of protecting the en vironment, and naturally the biodiversity therein.692 In so doing, the drafters of the Act and the South African legislature recognised that the fiduciary responsibilities of the public trust doctrine extend beyond those exercised by government and its offic ials. These provisions of the NEMA (that affirmatively enable members of the public to perform a monitoring and surveillance function and to approach the courts to intervene in the interests of their rights to have the environment protected where the gover nment has failed to do so ) confer a 686 Ibid; Blackmore (2014) Section 31. 692 Sections 32 and 33. 267 fiduciary duty on the public to perform this function.693 Had the public trust questions, listed above, applied to the case studies discussed in this thesis , the person proposing or official considering such a proposal wou ld rapidly determine that a significant component of the biodiversity trust entity would be placed in peril, or that there would be sufficient uncertainty to advocate a precautionary or risk-averse approach , or to exercis e the 'no go' or moratorium option .694 This consequence is demonstrated in the assessment below (Table 1) .

Pretoria. Pp171. 269 In answering the questions, it is evident that significant components of biodiversity, the Ndu mo Game Reserve and R amsar site, and protected areas in general , may be at risk should the activities highlighted in Chapters 1, 4, 5 and 6 be permitted to take place as described. By applying the guiding questions, t he government official (or officials) t asked to consider these activities is placed in a position to be alerted to the potential, and in these case studies significant , consequences to biodiversity and the integrity of, at least, the protected area concerned. The application of the public trus t doctrine in the realm of conservation of biodiversity , the protection of species and habitats , and safeguarding protected areas , invariably encounters emotional, ethical and moral pressures \u2014 particularly those emanating from society and its concerned co mponents. The application of the doctrine is also subject to, in particular, short -term political and parochial economic pressures that are often not aligned with the conservation of biodiversity and the safeguarding of the broader natural environment. The challenge placed on government is to find a solution that both conserves biodiversity and promotes human, economic and political wellbeing in a balanced and transparent manner.695 This challenge is unfortunately frustrated in circumstances where simplifying the understanding of the public trust entity occurs \u2014 to the detriment of biodiversity696 \u2014 in order to, for example, improve the health and wellbeing of people. This circumstance is demonstrated in the cases of the proposed eradication of the tsetse fly, t he selective and intensive breeding of wildlife ,697 or challenging the integrity of a protected area when it is perceived as a resource or an expedient opportunity for non -conservation -orientated development, like that proposed for Ndumo Game Reserve and Tembe Elephant Park.698,699 The principle of the public trust precludes the government from the arbitrary grantin g of a capriciously 695 Earthlife Africa v Minister of Energy (2017); Company Secretary of Arcelormittal v Vaal Environment , (2014). 699 For example, the proposed remediation of breach and migration of a river into a protected area. 270 convenient decision, where such a decision would lead to a loss in the value and integrity of the environment and its biodiversity.700 In such circumstances, a decision of this kind would be considered 'unsustainable' and a moratorium or a 'no go' or 'no destruction of biodiversity' option \u2014 in accordance with the precautionary or risk -averse principle \u2014 ought to prevail. 701 9.1.4 Role of Research and Information in Public Trust Decision -Making The challenge experienced by the adjudicating off icial often lies in whether a proposed use or potential damage to biodiversity would, if granted, cause that component of biodiversity to traverse (at least) its sustainable -use threshold and therein contribute to extinction or a system collapse.702 It stand s to reason, therefore, that decisions taken by an official representing the government must ideally be risk -averse and must be based squarely on a defendable understanding of the conservation status of the component of biodiversity which is at risk of bei ng damaged. Given the dependence of sound evidence -based decision -making on research, a reasonable expectation \u2014 if not an obligation \u2014 is placed on researchers and research institutions to provide robust, accurate and relevant, context -sensitive, independ ent, and unbiased information.703 The pinnacle of this argument lies in the realisation (by both bureaucrats and researchers) that decisions that lead to protection or erosion of the biodiversity trust, are likely to persist indefinitely and are, in the case of the extinction of a species or a habitat, usually not realistically reversible.704 The recognition of the accuracy and applicability of research is therefore paramount. 700 Blackmore (2015). 701 Novacek & Cleland (2001). 271 The understanding and application of the public trust doctrine \u2014 at least in South Af rica, and as is the case with the development of policy and legislation in general705 \u2014 suffers from an intrinsic separation from empirical research. As a result, policy and decision -makers place greater reliance on parochial experience and informal or tacit knowledge than on scientific information,706 when ensuring consistency with the doctrine.707 In order for conservation scientists and research institutions to influence conservation and environmental decision -making and practices, the onus lies with them to p rovide an accurate research product, which is context -sensitive and which can be easily interpreted in a responsible manner.708 This observation is particularly relevant in the conservation sector where, when contrasted to other disciplines like health, heur istic research underpinning decision -making is uncommon.709 The corollary of this circumstance, particularly given the rareness of research on biodiversity -related decision - making, is the vulnerability of decisions to perverse research in which 'expedience, falsification, fabrication or misrepresentation of information prevail'.710 In addition, given the paucity of investigation into and, importantly, the reliance on the public trust doctrine in South Africa's biodiversity and environmental decision -making , government officials are at risk of resorting to an undue reliance on a prevailing norm or personal stance, applying an ill -considered opinion of another, or drawing heavily on or remaining inextricably consistent with previous decisions.711 Under such circ umstances, the information gleaned from perverse research may persist in decision -making, even when such research is withdrawn or superseded by more accurate information.712 705 Singh et al. (2014). 706 Nguyen et Cvitanovic et Johnson & Graber (2002). 712 Van Noorden (2011). 272 While the public trust doctrine provides decision -making officials with a powerful mechanism to anticipate and regulate unsustainable use of the natural environment, and in particular its biodiversity, 713 its long -term effectiveness can only be guaranteed by way of public ( by means of the courts) surveillance and scrutiny of regulatory de cisions taken (or fail ed to be taken) that affect the trust entity.714 In this regard, it is both appropriate and desirable for researchers and research institutions to package their research in a manner which emphasises its relevance, and is articulated in a way that is understandable by the lay public and the legal profession. 9.1.5 The Public Trust Doctrine Ownership The separation between private ownership and what constitutes the public trust entity is complex and often unclear. By seeking the wisdom and guidance of the courts, U.S. has made great strides in clarify ing this separation within their environmental and l egal contexts. Other countries appear to be following suit, particularly in terms of requiring the courts to confirm the core entities of the public trust.715 The separation between the biodiversity trust entity and specimens or pieces of natural land has la rgely remained uninvestigated, and hence remains, on the whole, ambiguous. In many respects, this conundrum relates to the separation between what constitutes the public trust and ownership \u2014 be the latter communal, state or private. In its simplest form, the objective of the government in exercising its fiduciary duties is limited to the realm of trustee of common property, which cannot be extended to ownership or even a vested interest in ownership. While the government may, in certain circumstances, be the property owner , this function remains separate from its overarching trusteeship persona. Thus, exercising its fiduciary duties to safeguard biodiversity 713 Blackmore (unhealthy environment - Nairobi); Niaz Mohamed Jan Mohamed v Commissioner for Lands ( 1996) (privatisation of public land \u2014 Mombasa); Minister of Water and Environmental Affairs and Another v Really Useful Investments (2016) (public trust takings); M.C. Mehta v Kamal Nath (1997) (restoration of the natural environment). 273 and the environment as a whole cannot be extended by government into the realm of private and commun al ownership without risking giving effect to unlawful expropriation or takings.716 Irrespective of the circumstances, therefore, exercising a public trust duty cannot encroach on the domain of ownership. Thus, from a public trust perspective, elements that comprise South Africa's biodiversity cannot be part privately (or communally) and part 'owned' by the government as the trustee. Likewise, as with sovereignty, the government cannot use its fiducial duties as a springboard or conduit to take ownership of b iodiversity that occurs within the country's borders \u2014 even if that biodiversity is considered res nullius . Such separation of fiducial duties and ownership is highlighted by regulations that require all elephant sovereign to South Africa to be subjected to a management plan that secures their safety and wellbeing. The extension of such public trust and sovereignty obligations to unowned wild elephant would be a bridge too far and would be unlawful.717 9.1.6 The Prospects for the Public Trust Doctrine in South Af rica in a Nutshell The future of the public trust doctrine in the application of South Africa's environmental law is unknown and at best speculative . What is certain is the prominent inclusion of the doctrine into South African environmental law.718 The provision of the doctrine in its environmental statutes, does, however, make explicit the South African government's inalienable fiducial obligation to hold sovereign and safeguard the country's natural and cultural environments .719 This obligation , irrespective of the component of the public trust entity being considered, cannot be laissez -faire in nature but requires , at minimum, an affirmative approach to ensuring that the trust entity , as it currently stands, is safeguarded and sustainably used from one generation to the next. 716 Bramley 717 Blackmore Schyff (2010, 2011). 274 The need to ensure the integrity of the environment and the sustainable use thereof (the realm of the public trust doctrine) appears to be gaining attention within and being confirmed by the South African courts.720 In grappling with the concept, the courts have reaffirmed that public trust pertains, at least, to that component of the environment that currently exists and the administrative decisions taken by government that may affect the persistence of such. The South African courts have also grappled with, and recognised that the natural environment (the public trust entity) includes transient and esoteric values which may not be easily measured or readily demonstrated \u2014 for example, the biodiversity migratory or corridor attr ibutes of a parcel of natural or near natur al land,721 or the sense of place negatively impacted upon by a brick and mortar development.722 The courts have, however, not been given an opportunity to venture beyond the immediate scope of the public trust doctr ine as provided for in South Africa's environmental statutes . They also have not been given the opportunity to undertake critical examination of, or provide clarity on the magnitude of the fiducial duties placed on the government.723 For instance, Justice Ng cobo stated that the ' trusteeship position carries with it the responsibility to look after the environment ,'724 but didn't venture what the 'responsibility' entailed beyond the fiducial duties of an official decision on a proposed or recently created development and its immediate impacts on the environment. Yet the consequences of government's decisions (or indecisions) may have a significant 720 See for example, Minister of Water and Environmental Affairs v Really Useful Investments (2015); Clairison's CC v the MEC for Local Government Environmental A ffairs and Development Planning and others (2012); HTF Developers (Pty) Ltd v Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (2006); Elandskraal Garage v Gouveia and Others (2006); Fuel Retailers Association of Southern Africa v Director -General Environment al Management and others (2007. 721 Clairison's CC v the MEC for Local Government Environmental Affairs and Development Planning and others (2012). 722 Ndlambe Municipality v Lester and Others (2011). 723 Van Der Schyff (2011). 724 Fuel Retailers Association of Southern Africa v Director -General Environmental Management (2007). 275 long-term residual impact on the environment , which may worsen with time, and may ultimately become a threat t o the health and wellbeing of people. In such circumstances , particularly when the proponents of the damage and threats are unknown and the polluter -pays principle cannot be applied, or cannot adequately be applied, a liability vacuum, from a pub lic trust standpoint , potentially exists.725 Feris (from a mining and water -quality perspective ) and Blackmore (from a biodiversity and protected -area perspective)726 argued that in such circumstances, the responsibility of the trustee is extended to include the liabili ty to make good on the historical damage to the public trust entity , as well as to remove any imminent threats that may exist. Under such circumstances, t he government may be compelled to implement the duty of care obligations provided in section 28 of NEMA (as if it was the polluter or damager of the environment) and exercise 'reasonable measures to prevent the pollution or degradation from occurring, continuing or recurring.'727 Whilst each component of the environment is the responsibility of specific organs of state within government, uncertainty arises as to which organs of state are ultimately answerable to assume a proactive remedial duty where the cause of the harm is in one component of the environment (e.g. mining and acid mine drainage) and the consequence is manifested in another (e.g. water quality and biodiversity ).728 The denial or obfuscation of responsibility by the relevant organs of state is likely to result in continued harm to the environment (as was the case in acid mine drainage),729 and the objective of the public trust principle being undermined. Justice Ngcobo in his Constitutional Court judgment on the matter of the Fuel Retailers Association of Southern Africa v Director -General Environmental Management and others , recognised that these instances are likely to arise when the responsible organ of state fails to undertake its responsibility as the trustee in accordance with the public trust doctrine. For these instances, Justice Ngcobo affirmed the crucial role of the court in ensuring that this constitutional imperative 725 Feris (2012). 726 Blackmore Feris and Kotze (2014) . 276 is upheld by stating that '[i]t is the duty of the court to ensure that this responsibility [protection o f the environment ] is carried out .' The domain of the public trust doctrine may not be limited to current threats and the retrospective remediation of previous residual harm to the environment . It has also been argued that the doctrine encompasses an affi rmative duty of the South African government to anticipate and avert future harm to the environment , as well as the potential harm a compromised environment may pose to future generations.730 Du Plessis and others ha ve argued that this affirmative duty remai ns incumbent on government in those circumstances where there is a significant degree of risk but with concomitant uncertainty over when such risk would manifest (for example the predicted impacts of climate change).731 The affirmative ameliorative action to avert the consequences of these decisions (or indecisions), which manifest significantly after the foreseeable future of the decision, is threefold . The first is to cease those activities that have caused or contributed to the predicted impacts ( e.g. the cessation of the release of ozone - depleting substances and the burning of fossil fuels ). The second is to enhance the absorptive capacity and adaptability of the environment ( e.g. reinstating natural habitats and biological corridors , etc.),732 and the third is setting in place technical solutions (e. g. sea barriers, relocating potentially vulnerable communities, etc.) .733 In addition, Du Plessis emphasises that the onus is on the government , as the ultimate trustee of the environment , to take the necessary action to 'focus it s laws and policies' to avert or mitigate these negative intergenerational consequence s of unsustainable use of the natural resources and to set in place a culture of bureaucratic decision -making ( e.g. climate -resilient development ) that is sensitive to and avoids long -term impacts on the environment and future society.734 This prospective attribute of the doctrine thus stands to overrule the inherent bias in both legal and politic al deliberations and 730 Du Plessis 2015. 731 Du Plessis (2015); Smit (2005); Heller and Zavaleta (2009) . 733 Wilmouth Ashley et al. (2005); Heller and Zavaleta (2009); Hulme (2005). 734 Du Plessis (2015) 277 decisions by bureaucrats , that favours the present over the needs and aspirations of future generations ( i.e. presentism ) in that the doctrine serves as an omnibus to give voice to future generations and in particular those who are yet to be born.735 This interpretation of the public trust doctrine was recently confirmed in the seminal finding of J ustice Murphy in the matter of the proposed Thabametsi coal-fired power station .736 Here Justice Murphy found that it was incumbent on government to take into consideration all relevant factors that may lead to, inter alia, environmental degradation.737 Such consideration must include the potential manifestation of the impacts on future generations , such as climate change. Furthermore, Justic e Murphy reaffirm ed that the investigation into potential consequences of a (development) decision that may manifest at some stage in the future (and in so doing , place the environment and the health and wellbeing of future generations at risk , e.g. by way of exacerbating climate change ), must be comprehensively investigated and such investigation must be commensurate with the require ments for identifying short - and medium -term consequences of the development or land -use change . Finally, Justice Murph y confirmed that any application to government of this nature must include this comprehensive assessment before a decision can be taken to authorise or deny such an application . The foundation for such reasoning was based on the fiducial duties of governme nt to safeguard the future integrity of the environment and the health and wellbeing of future generations . In order for the public to undertake a monitoring and surveillance role to ensure that the government exercise s its fiducial public trust duties, they need to be given reasonable access to information relating to the construction, operational and decommissioning phases of a development . This information equips the public to exercise its rights in the case of actual and potential environmental damage.738 As such, the public would need to have reasonable access to information that may be held by private bodies or persons. In circumstances where significant 735 White (2017); Thompson (2010); Winter 2008; Thompson EarthLife The Minster of NEMA section 240(1)(b). 738 Blackmore (2015b, 2017a). 278 environmental damage has occurred or may occur, access to relevant information is crucial for the pu blic to exercise its rights , i.e. to litigate in the public interest.739 The locus standi of a person (or a group of persons ) to seek relief from the courts to secure the wellbeing of the environment in the interests of the yet to be born, and in the face of the relief sought having little or no 'effect [...] on his or her interests or potential interests ,'740 was reconfirmed in the matter between Lionswatch Action Group v MEC: Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning and Others . Here, Justice Binns -Ward affirmed the wide - ranging applicability of section 32 of NEMA for a person or a group of persons to approac h the court for relief in, inter alia , 'the interest of, or on behalf of, a person who is, for practical reasons, unable to institute such proceedings ', the public interest , or in 'the interest of protecting the environment .' In so doing, the locus standi conferred by NEMA (particularly when read in conjunction with the Lionswatch and Arcelormittal judgement s)741 provides the public with unrestricted and unquestionable access to the courts whe n government fails to exercise it fiducial duties and take the necessary action to prevent or mitigate environmental harm. This includ es, inter alia , environmental harm arising from the collective action of humans that may manifest in the future , such as is observed with the impacts of climate change and ozo ne depletion . The regulation of the use of property in the public's best interest is widely accepted not to be commensurate with a 'taking' or expropriation . In certain circumstances, the fiducial duties embodied within the doctrine may , however, be extend ed into the realm of expropriation (with the appropriate compensation) in two situations. The first arises where it is in the public's interest for government to remove a particular asset from it s being privately owned.742 It is common cause 739 Company Secretary of Arcelormittal South Africa v Vaal Environment Justice Alliance (2015 ); Blackmore 2014; Biowatch Trust v Registrar, Genetic Resources & others (2009) . 740 Justice Cameron established in his judgement in the matter between Giant Concerts CC v Rinaldo Investments (Pty) Ltd and Others (2013) that the standing to seek such relief is reliant on the person demonstrating a direct interest in the relief should such be granted. 741 Company Secretary of Arcelormittal South Africa v Vaal Environment Justice Allia nce (2015 ). 742 Van der Schyff (2015). 279 that such environmental assets must be considered to be of such value that it would be irresponsible for the asset to remain in private ownership. In South Africa , expropriation has been traditionally exercised in securing import ant biodiversity and cultur al heritage areas,743 cultural artefacts, and , more recently , reinstating coastal public property.744 The second arises from the situation where certain sectors of the country, prior to the establishment of a democratic South Africa in 1994, were unfairly excluded from having reasonable access to the country's natural resources, and in particular its water , minerals and the genetic products of biodiversity .745 The intra-generational equity attribute of the public trust doctrine enjoins government to redistribut e access to natural resources in an equitable manner .746 This aspect of the public trust doctrine was embodied through the revision of the country's statutes which effectively removed the legal barriers preventing access and the flow of benefits from the env ironmental resources to previously disadvantaged communities .747 Whether this reallocation constitutes a compensational deprivation is a complex question and its answer is embedded in the circumstance s under which the original right was granted.748 As pointed out by Van der Schyff and Viljoen ,749 the allocation of licences to exploit the country's natural resources is generally regarded as a state grant and thus may be subject to review and in some cases amended or cancelled. Van der Schyff and Viljoen submit tha t this revision power of government represents a necessary extension of government's fiducial duties (as trustee) to be able ensure that the use of an environmental resource, either singularly or cumulatively, is sustainable. In summary , the scope of the public trust doctrine in South Africa goes beyond government 's mere protection of the extant natural and cultural environment , and embraces the retrospective duty of correcting significant historical damage to the trust entity. It is also argued that the fiducial duties embodied in the doctrine both 743 Van der Schyff (2015). 744 Blackmore (2018a). et al. (2007); Ten Kate and Laird (1999); Crouch et al. (2008). 746 Blackmore (2018a, (2008). 748 See for example Van der Schyff (2003). 749 Schyff and Viljoen (2008). 280 empower and obligate the government to exercise an active monitoring and surveillance role over the cumulative use of trust resources , and to actively manage this use equitably and sustainably. Furthermore, the public trust doctrine provides the South African government with an obligation to set in place proactive ameliorative measures to safeguard both the environmental trust entity and future generations from the negative impacts resulting from the collective a ctions of humankind (such as climate change) on the environment. The interpretation and application of the public trust doctrine within the South African context, therefore, demonstrates distinct and overlapping similari ties with that of other countries wi th Anglo -Saxon -derived legal systems. 9.2 GENERAL CONCLUSION The promulgation of South Africa's constitution and subsequent legislation regulating the use of the country's environment by people, gave explicit legislative credence to the common -law public trust doctrine in environmental decision - making. Notwithstanding this, in the 21 years since the promulgation of South Africa's constitution and environmental legislation, there has been little academic and legal recognition of the public trust provisions. Against the backdrop of South Africa's biodiversity , which is \u2014 as in many other developing and developed countries \u2014 under significant threat from the impacts of land transformation and unsustainable use, the role and significance of the doctrine in deci sion-making is naturally questioned. Such questioning includes consideration of whether the concept has been understood or if it needs to be revived to provide greater protection to South Africa's natural and cultural resources, and in particular its biodiversity. Outside of the Constitution, the public trust doctrine in South African environmental law is likely to have multiple bloodlines. These bloodlines are rooted in Roman common law, recent Western ideology, African multilateral environmental agreement s, and international soft -law. These diverse origins may have played a significant role in the variation observed in the (sometimes) contradictory coding of the doctrine in the various statutes that constitute South Africa's environmental law. It is surmis ed that both the drafters of the environmental statutes and the legislature adopting the same had a variable 281 understanding of the doctrine , which, on the one hand conferred a right to the environment and on the other conflated the roles of government as th e trustee and the public as the beneficiaries of the trust. The legal relevance of this discovery is founded on two fronts. The first is that it may be inappropriate in South Africa to anchor an understanding of the public trust solely in the Western interpretations of this doctrine. The second front is a realisation that the application of the doctrine in South Africa is in its infancy. It thus stands to reason that substantial research, academic dialogue and legal argument in the courts is required, in or der for the public trust doctrine to gain prominence in South Africa's jurisprudence and environmental decision -making. Notwithstanding the variable manner in which it has been incorporated into the statues regulating the broader environment, the South Af rican legislature appears to have embraced the fundamental principles of the doctrine. Of these, the policing role the public may assume and the intervention of the courts on behalf of the public, are seen to be paramount for public trust to become a power ful influence in relation to the protection and sustainable use of the environment. Furthermore, this synergistic relationship between the government needing to make principled decisions and the public needing to make sound arguments to challenge decisions that fail to achieve this standard , effectively extends the objective of the public trust doctrine to be supported by researchers and research intuitions. In this, a reasonable expectation, if not an obligation, is placed on both the researcher and resear ch intuition, to provide accurate, robust, relevant and context -sensitive information in a form that is readily accessible to decision -makers, the public and the legal profession. South Africa's environmental management principles in the National Environm ental Management Act 107 of 1998 \u2014 at least from a biodiversity - conservation perspective \u2014 reinforce, are complementary, and in some respects are crucial for the effective application of the public trust doctrine. Application of the environmental managemen t principles, either individually or synergistically, requires the environment (and naturally it s biodiversity) to be sustainably used from one generation to the next \u2014 this being the core objective of the public trust doctrine. Likewise, these principles make explicit that decision -making must be in the people of South Africa's best interest. The corollary is that South Africa's 282 natural environment, and especially its biodiversity, cannot be arbitrarily reserved or apportioned in favour of a parochial inte rest, and at the expense of a broader public interest. In this, the environmental management principles strengthen the requirement that government must exercise and give effect to the public trust doctrine. Demonstrating faithfulness to the doctrine on th e part of decision -makers remains a challenge. The public face a similar challenge when querying whether the official authorising the use of the environment has been faithful to their fiduciary duties to protect the public trust entity \u2014 and whether this is reflected in the decision taken. In this respect, it is concluded that the degree of compliance with the public trust doctrine cannot be arbitrarily gauged, and that the official requires a decision -making framework or set of parameters that elucidate wh ere the trust entity is at a significant risk of exploitation. The same applies to the public when questioning whether a decision on the use of the environment accorded with the public trust doctrine. Here, from a biodiversity perspective, a set of nine qu estions are posed to serve as this guiding framework for decision - making and evaluation. The questions not only evaluate the potential significance of the use to biodiversity, but also the potential effectiveness of proposed mitigation and whether the miti gation would be effective within a foreseeable or reasonable time frame. The application of such an approach to decisions and the evaluation of decisions taken are vital to giving effect to the public trust doctrine. Many scholars have referred to the pub lic trust doctrine as being a powerful tool to safeguard the natural environment, and in particular its biodiversity. In asmuch as the doctrine represents the ultimate safeguard against possible damage to the natural trust entity, its effectiveness cannot b e guaranteed in all circumstances. Political, economic and social pressures that are brought to bear on government officials are persuasive, particularly in a developing and natural resource -hungry country like South Africa. Furthermore, the mere provision of the public trust doctrine in a country's environmental statute law seems to be insufficient to ensure recognition of its existence and its application in environmental decision - making. In view of this, it is concluded that the strength of the public tr ust doctrine lies in a synergistic balance between a thorough understanding of its importance by government officials, the public, researchers and the legal fraternity \u2014 and the 283 ability of the public to hold the officials accountable, by way of appeals and judicial review, for the decisions taken. In closing, the public trust doctrine has been explicitly included in South Africa's Constitution and environmental legalisation. Despite its existence for over 20 years, it has enjoyed little prominence in academ ic discourses and judgements taken by the judiciary. The rapid loss of biodiversity in South Africa, both at a species and habitat level, highlights the need to rediscover the value of the doctrine as a means of enabl ing both the government and the public to bring added protection to the country's natural heritage. There remains, therefore, abundant opportunity for the significance of this provision to be researched, and its application to be debated and tested at the coalface of environmental decision - making and in the courts. It is thus concluded that an improved understanding, within a South African context, of the relevance of the public trust doctrine by government officials, the general public, the legal fraternity and research institutions , would prom ote much improved evidence -based decision -making and sustainable use of the country's biodiversity. 9.3 REFERENCES African Union (2003) African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources .
