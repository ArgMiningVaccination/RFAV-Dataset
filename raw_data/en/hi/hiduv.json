FinchWhen Mt. St. Helens erupted several years ago, there was massdestruction of the surroundinglandscape, with many individualsalso suffering great losses. Griefand sadness were commonemotions for several monthsafterward as people asked, \"Whydid this tragedy take place?\"Then, as the dust settled and theair cleared, somethingremarkable happened. Abeautiful white flower poked itsblossoms out of a crack inmountain rock, lifting its headskyward toward the sunshine.Life had begun again, and with it,the hope of a new beginning! When I discovered that I had End Stage Renal Disease, Iexperienced feelings similar towhat the people living near Mt.St. Helens felt. I was devastatedby my loss and believed that mylife was broken and hopeless. Inmy case, though, there were nomiraculous flowers in sight tooffer me hope. Instead, as I beganto experience more and more sideeffects of kidney failure, myfeelings of grief and despair worsened. I was weak and tired,and I had itchy skin that leftscars on my body that remain tothis day. I also battled a nearlyconstant feeling of nausea. One day, I became sick while I was stuck in rush-hour traffic.With nowhere to pull over, Iended up vomiting into a tennisshoe that my son had left in thecar. At this point, I was no longersimply grief-stricken. I wasfurious! I was angry with Godand I wanted Him to just let medie. After all, I had tried so hardto be a good mother and personso, \"WHY ME?\" I was only 38years old and a single parent aswell, having just left a marriageof 15 years. What had I done todeserve this? Well, God didn't allow me to die, and I gradually began to let go of my anger after I discoveredthe power of humor in life's quirks and ironies. This was animportant discovery, because morechallenges were soon to follow.As I waited in my hospital room on the day I was to begindialysis, I learned that my father,who had cancer, had died thatmorning. Just minutes later, ahospital aid came with awheelchair to take me to thedialysis center. As we made ourway through the halls, tears filledmy eyes and tumbled down mycheeks until the skin on my facestung.

Thisissue should be reaching you duringorgan donor month. Hopefully you were able to participate in a program to promoteorgan donor awareness in your area. We all need to doour part to increase organ donation, as we all knowwe can't have transplantation without our donors. I was at a program recently where the local OPO presented the statistics of the number of those awaitinga transplant and the number of organ donors;unfortunately the need for transplants continues tooutweigh the availability of donors by more than 50percent. Along with some of the alternatives you will readabout in this issue, living donation has been the mostrecent endeavor taken on by transplant centers toincrease donors. Look for a special on this topic in anupcoming issue of the Chronicles . We have been receiving many submissions and requests by our readers.

I was feeling sorry formyself, and felt that nothing could be more awfulthan what I was experiencing. But then life taughtme another lesson. As my wheelchair was pushed further into the dialysis center, I began to notice that there weremany individuals who appeared worse off than me.Several people were without limbs or were blind,and I learned that these individuals were fightingdiabetes as well as kidney failure. I immediatelyrealized that I still had things to be thankful for,and once again found the strength to persevere. On June 1, 1994, a transplant coordinator from the University of Michigan called and said thatthere was a cadaver kidney available. Thetransplant procedure itself went smoothly, but thenew kidney never fully worked. After three monthsit was removed and I went back on dialysis. In a way, I was grateful for the opportunity to continue life on dialysis. I had a 17-year-olddaughter and 13-year-old son who needed me athome. Still, the loss of my transplanted kidneywas shocking and hard to believe. I was countingon the freedom of a transplant to help me keep upthe hectic pace of my life. I was working full timeand even taking some classes toward a mastersdegree in business. Resuming dialysis for 20 hoursa week would certainly be overwhelming, but sowas the thought of going back on the transplantwaiting list and doing this all over again. Knowing this, my daughter, Katy, took it upon herself to get tested to see if she was a compatibledonor for me. It turned out she was, so on May 8,1996, Katy gave me an extra special Mother's Day gift\u2014one of her kidneys. She remarked to me that Ihad given her life and she wanted to give me life back. While this seems like a happy ending, my good fortune didn't end with a successful transplant.On January 4, 1997, I married Jay, a physicianwho also has End Stage Renal Disease. A mutualfriend had introduced us a few years earlier whenwe were both still on dialysis. We immediatelybecame friends, and I found it wonderful to beable to talk with someone who truly knew how Ifelt. Jay underwent a successful kidney transplantin July of 1994, and ironically, was in the hospitala story of hope continued from page 1during the same period I was recovering from myfirst transplant. Our friendship blossomed thatsummer and continued to grow stronger with eachpassing month and year. My life has been turned around thanks to a successful marriage and transplant, but some ofyou reading this article may be feeling down thisvery moment. You may feel your spirit and strengthwaning as you go through the process of waiting ona transplant list. These are not easy times, butdon't give up. Be strong! Be a compliant patient.Follow the suggestions of your physician, nurse anddietitian. Keep yourself as healthy as possible soyou'll be ready when the call for a transplant comes. I truly believe that my husband and I were brought together to love, support and help eachother. Our relationship and life together is anexample of life anew, very much like that freshbeautiful flower in the rocky ledge of Mt. St.Helens. We now have the opportunity to encourageothers to believe that things can, and will, bloomanew for them as well. If things look bleak, alwaysremember that tomorrow is another day, and witheach and every new day, there is always HOPE! TC Kris and Katy never pass up an opportunity to celebrate. Keep Your Transplant Center Updated Throughout the year you may move, change your phone number or change your insurance. It is veryimportant to keep your transplant center informedof these changes. You may be missing out on somevery important information regarding your care. 4Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 4eating right Nutrition Issues in the Chronically Ill or Transplanted Child By Marge Mannarino, RD GIra D. Davis, MD GKimberlee Rast, RD If you are like most parents, feeding your child is an important issue, because good nutrition isessential for your child's growth and development. Inaddition to promoting growth, a healthy diet alsohelps maintain strength, rebuild body tissue andprevent infections. If your child has a chronic illness,good nutrition is even more essential \u2014 and in somecases more challenging. Why won't my child eat? It is frustrating to cope with a child who is having difficulty eating. You may be feelingresponsible and confused about where to turn andwhat to do. Be assured that you are not at faultbecause there are many factors that can affect achild's appetite. Emotional issues (fear, anxietyand depression), side effects from medication andthe specific nature of the illness itself can allcontribute to appetite loss. Children with kidney or liver failure, for example, can have a build-up of toxic substances in theirbodies. These toxins can create taste changes, whichlead to poor appetite and in some cases, nausea andvomiting. There may also be fluid build-up in theabdomen, which can press on the stomach. Another common condition children may experience is reduced gastrointestinal tractfunction. In such cases, food remains in thestomach longer than normal, causing a feeling offullness or upset stomach. Your child may also beconstipated, which can cause cramping anddecreased appetite. In addition to a general loss of appetite, it is not unusual in any of the situationsdescribed above to see extreme changes in appetite orvery rigid food choices. A child who is on peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis may experience a decrease inappetite due to inadequate dialysis,noncompliance with the dietary restrictions or areaction to medication. Peritoneal patients cansometimes feel \"full\" from the added volume ofdialysate fluids in their abdomen, and the glucosethey absorb from their dialysate may suppresstheir appetite.What can you do? If your child has a decreased appetite, the following techniques may prove helpful: GProvide gentle, low-key encouragement as often as possible. Praise good eating habits when theydevelop. Don't nag, don't lecture and never punishyour child if he or she doesn't feel like eating. GDetermine what time of day your child's appetite is better and maximize intake during that time. GIncrease the frequency of meals and snacks with sufficient protein and calories so the totalintake for the day is increased. Offer plenty offluids \u2014 juices, milk, soup and milkshakes. GTry to make mealtime pleasant. Eliminate distractions such as television. Eat with your childor have your child eat with other children. GStock the pantry and freezer with easy-to- prepare foods (pudding, eggs, leftovers) so whenthe urge to eat occurs, you can quickly feed yourchild before appetite loss returns. GDon't worry if your child requests the same food each day \u2014 at least he or she is eating \u2014 but don't beafraid to keep offering new foods or foods that have notbeen eaten in the past. Tastes can change quickly. GIf your child is hospitalized, bring \"a little bit of home\" to the hospital. A favorite cup, utensils orplacemat can perk up the surroundings andincrease appetite. In addition to trying these techniques, seek help from your child's health care team (dietitian, nurse,social worker and doctor). These individuals can bean excellent source of information and support. Dietitians have experience with all types of eaters and they have a wealth of suggestions and ideasfor you. You can also share information with otherparents facing similar concerns. Their ideas andexperiences can offer a new perspective, butremember to always discuss any dietary changeswith your child's doctor before trying them. Continued on next pageTransplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 4 5What happens after the transplant? After a transplant, some children have an immediate improvement in their appetite andintake, while others may take longer. An upsetstomach and other gastrointestinal discomfortscan lead to food aversions that take a while tochange. A child who has been tube fed for a longperiod of time is likely to continue to need tubefeedings for several months or even years. It will be important to continue occupational or speech therapy, along with high-calorie formulas andsupplements. Your child may also need to relearnoral skills\u2014literally learning to eat again\u2014andbecome used to new tastes and textures. Don't give up hope. The constant experimenting and setbacks that occur when dealing with a child's appetite loss caneasily become frustrating and disheartening. Nosingle technique or method is always right, exceptfor plenty of patience. Progress may be slow, butover time you will begin to see improvement. Marge Mannarino is a registered dietitian at Rainbow Babies and Children s Hospital who specializes in the care of children with chronic kidney failure. TCWhat changes can you make to the diet? When there is a lack of appetite, the primary goal is to pack as many calories and nutrients into thesmallest possible volume. If your child is less thana year old, the calories in formula can be increasedby reducing the amount of water or adding oils,special fats, or special carbohydrate powders(Polycose or Moducal). The introduction of strainedbaby foods should begin at approximately sixmonths of age or when your baby isdevelopmentally ready. Margarine, oil and thecarbohydrate powders may also be added to babyfoods to increase calories. If your child is older you can continue to use the carbohydrate powders. These can be added to allliquids, including milk, juice and powdered softdrinks. They can also be added to moist foods suchas applesauce, potatoes, puddings and soups.Some older children can detect the sweetness ofthese products and may begin to reject them. For older children, you can also encourage the use of margarine on popcorn, vegetables, rice,noodles and breads. Stir fry meats and vegetableswith canola, safflower or olive oil. Offer calorically-dense foods such as casseroles, custard or pudding.Be sure to give high-calorie beverages, such as softdrinks and fruit juice, and treats such as frozenjuice bars or Popsicles, rather than just water. Trysmall, more frequent feedings and save fluids forbetween meals to decrease stomach fullness. For an extra calorie boost, there are many nutritional supplements available for your child.These include Kindercal, Pediasure, Boost,Ensure, Nutren and Resource. Milkshakes can bemade with common foods such as sherbet, Kool-Aid, corn syrup and oil (see recipe). What if these changes don't work? If your child cannot get enough calories by mouth,then a feeding tube may be necessary. A tube can beplaced through the nose into the stomach or directlyinto the stomach. You should still continue to offerformula and foods by mouth. Even small quantitiesof formula or food will allow your child to experiencevarious tastes and textures and maintain oral skills.Occupational and speech therapists are available toassist you with oral feedings.

I know it's a few months belated, but as far as I'm concerned, whenever you start enhancing yourlife, it's a beginning. If one of your New Year'sresolutions is to get in shape, the followinginformation will give you some basic tips and toolsto begin a program. Good luck and believe in thebenefits, because what your mind perceives yourbody WILL achieve! When exercise becomes part of your daily life, it will enable you to: GDevelop muscle tone GImprove circulation GStart building strength and endurance GStart replacing fat with muscle GDevelop the capacity to work harder GFeel great Before You Begin Remember, before you begin any exercise or fitness program you should visit your doctor and get acomplete physical exam. Once you've been cleared tobegin you should set some goals. Start with short-term goals to keep things moving along, but promiseyourself that within a year or so you will achievethose goals. Stick to your program and keep anorganized record so you can track your progress. Let's Start Moving! Here are a few things to keep in mind when you're ready to start exercising. 1.Stretch your muscles slowly\u2014no sudden jerks or lunges. You can also warm up by lightly dancingor jogging in place for a few moments. 2.Pay attention to previous injuries. If something hurts, do not work through the pain. Find a lightexercise that works the muscle, as the blood flowwill get rid of waste and speed healing. 3.Don't worry about your body weight when starting your program. You may put on weightinitially since muscle weighs more than fat. 4.Watch for the development of muscle tone. A slight tension in the muscle will be the firstexciting sign that your program is working.Weight Training Before heading to the gym, it's important to know the answers to some common questions aboutweight training. What's the difference between reps and sets? When you do one bicep curl, chest press or lat pull, you have completed one rep(short for repetition) of that exercise. A setrefers to a group of reps performed in a row. For example, if you do fivecurls and then stop to rest, you have performed fivereps of that exercise. If you then do five more curls,you have completed two sets of five reps each. What's the best number of sets to do? The best strength gains come from doing four or five sets of an exercise. To be safe, start with one tothree sets and gradually build up. How long should I rest between sets? You should rest 30 to 60 seconds per set between exercises that use the same muscle groups. Forexample, you may do three sets of bicep exercises,then rest one to three minutes before moving on toa different muscle group, like triceps. How much weight and how many reps per set? A good starting point is to do 10 reps of a weight that is comfortable to you. Comfortable meansthat you can do all 10 reps, but the last rep issomewhat hard to perform. Once you are able to domore than 10 reps, it's time to increase the weight. What's the best combination of weight and reps? It depends on the results you want to achieve. If you want to mainly increase muscle size and strength, usea heavy weight and just do a few reps. To increasemuscle endurance without \"bulking up,\" lower theweight and do a higher number of reps. By adjustingthe weight and reps, you can achieve your desiredcombination of size, strength and endurance. Does the order of my workout matter? Yes.The body contains seven major muscle groups, which I've listed below in suggested order.You should always work the larger groups (such aschest) before the smaller ones (such as biceps). Ifyou do the reverse, such as doing arm curls first,then your biceps will be too fatigued to perform acorrect chest press exercise, which also works the Continued on page 19Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 4 7Every year, more and more people are traveling to developing countries for business trips as well asunique and exotic vacations. Unfortunately, thesepeople are at risk for developing health problemsdue to infectious diseases, especially if they areimmunosuppressed. Many of these problems,however, can be avoided if appropriate precautionsare taken. One of the most common conditions experienced by travelers is diarrhea. To help prevent this, youshould avoid uncooked food (other than peeledfruits and vegetables), non-bottled beverages, icecubes and dairy products that are not pasteurized.Bottled water should always be used for drinkingand brushing teeth. You should also wash yourhands frequently, especially before meals. Despite these precautions, diarrhea may still occur. You should be prepared by taking along an anti-diarrheal agent such as loperamide (Imodium) orPepto-Bismol, as well as an antibiotic prescribed byyour doctor to self-treat diarrhea. Ask your transplantphysician which one is right for you. In some casesyou may need to take the loperamide or Pepto-Bismolplus the prescribed antibiotic in order to get relief. Fordiarrhea that is severe or associated with fever orbloody stools, medical attention should be sought. Inaddition, lost fluids and electrolytes should be replacedwith beverages such as Gatorade or Pedialyte. In certain countries, the risk of malaria exists. This risk is highest in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania (theislands in the northwest and southwest Pacific),intermediate in south Asia, and lowest in the Americasand southeast Asia. If you are at risk for malaria youshould apply an insect repellent containing DEET(N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) to any exposed skinand wear long-sleeved clothing at night, since malariais most often transmitted through mosquitoes. Unlesstreated early, malaria can result in serious medicalcomplications. If you develop a fever during, or shortlyafter, a visit to areas where malaria is endemic, youshould seek immediate medical attention. Among thedrugs used to prevent malaria is chloroquine (Aralen).If you are visiting a region with chloroquine resistance,mefloquine (Lariam) may be used.Malaria advice for transplant recipients does not differ from that for other travelers. There are noknown drug interactions between anti-malarialagents and common immunosuppressive drugs.Transplant recipients do carry a higher risk of skincancer, however, and should take extra precautionsregarding sun exposure. Obtaining proper vaccinations is another important preparation for travel. Because legalrequirements regarding vaccinations differ betweencountries, you must be aware of the specificvaccinations required or suggested for entry intothe countries you will be visiting. As a general rule, visitors to foreign countries should have immunizations against tetanus,diphtheria, pertussis, varicella and influenza. Inaddition, travelers to Asia and Africa should bevaccinated against polio. The hepatitis B vaccineshould be given to long-term travelers who may beat risk for infections transmitted by body fluids orblood. The hepatitis A vaccine is also recommendedfor most travelers to the developing world. Ninety-five percent of patients will develop immunity afterone dose, which should last for 6 to 12 months.Two doses will provide long-term immunity.Transplant recipients should also consider receivingthe typhoid vaccine, as well as the influenza orpneumococcal vaccine, since they are at a higherrisk for viral and bacterial infections. Sincerecipients are less likely to respond toimmunizations, they need to be revaccinated atshorter intervals. Certain countries require immunizations against yellow fever, a viral infection transmitted bymosquitoes in areas of Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. This vaccine must be administeredby a center approved by the World HealthOrganization. Transplant recipients should be awarethat they are at risk for active disease if they receivelive vaccines such as those used for yellow fever,measles or polio. Thus, those vaccines should beavoided (an inactive version of the polio vaccine,however, is available). Recipients in need of a yellow ask the pharmacist Advice for Travelers By Rina A. Shah, PharmD Continued on page 178Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 4Training Volunteers to Work with Funeral Directors By Judy Zavalla I oversee the \"Vital Volunteers\" programs at the LifeGift Organ Donation Center of Southeast Texasin Houston. Most of my volunteers are transplantrecipients or donor family members. Thesevolunteers are typically sent to set up a booth at ahealth fair hosted by a business, civic group,church or school. These same groups also ask ourvolunteers to come to their meetings to discussorgan and tissue donation. Although the volunteersare comfortable and very effective in this role, werealized that by limiting their exposure to thesegroups alone we were missing out on an importantaudience: funeral directors. Funeral directors play a vital role in organ and tissue donation. At a time of overwhelming grief,families rely heavily on the input, direction andsuggestions of the funeral director. As a result,funeral directors can either be a great asset or agreat stumbling block to the cause of organ donation,depending upon their attitude and approach. Oftentimes, a lack of knowledge or a previous baddonation experience on the part of the funeraldirector may lead a family away from donation. Tohelp prevent this from happening, we decided to trainour volunteers to work with funeral directors toincrease their understanding and support of organdonation. The program we developed works toincrease open communication between funeraldirectors and our OPO, and also to get the directorsto serve as donation ambassadors. Originally, we planned to train selected volunteers and then send them to funeral homes to meet withthe directors. However, after careful consideration, wecame up with a different approach. Since funeraldirectors are required to earn a certain number ofcontinuing education credits per year in order toretain their license, we decided to offer them a free,interactive inservice (worth four continuing educationhours) at local hospitals. Most hospitals were willingto provide free refreshments. When that was notfeasible, LifeGift provided them. By sending invitationsthat highlighted the credit information, the free foodand the interactive nature of the session, we gavedirectors a variety of incentives for attending. Prior to the first hospital inservice, I selected approximately 20 volunteers that were either donorfamily members or transplant recipients. Trainingtopics included: enhancing the relationship betweenfuneral directors and organ procurement organization; the content for the upcoming inservices and tips fordelivering the information effectively; troubleshootingmethods; and public relations tips for follow-up visitsto the funeral homes after the inservice. Followingtheir training, the volunteers attended a meetingwhere donor family members and transplantrecipients exchanged their unique personalexperiences with the donation/transplant process. We also used role-play during this session to preparethe volunteers to deal with any potential situationthey might encounter during their funeral home visits. We believed that donor families would be able to have an impact on funeral directors with theirtestimony. While this proved to be true, we werepleasantly surprised to see the equally large impactcreated by our transplant recipients. Many funeraldirectors felt that transplantation was experimentaland they expected to see recipients who wereunable to function on a daily basis. The energy and vitality of our recipient volunteers was a greateye-opener for them. This program has allowed our volunteers to \"spread their wings\" into new areas and, at the sametime, provide a service that is quite beneficial. Oncethe lines of communication were opened betweenvolunteers and funeral directors, the funeraldirectors joined in becoming ambassadors for organdonation. The funeral directors have not onlyincreased their understanding of donation, but havealso begun to call on our volunteers to speak to theirRotary Clubs, Chambers of Commerce and othercivic groups. This additional public education hasbeen invaluable in our efforts to increase donation. No longer limited to simple tasks as in years past, volunteering roles continue to evolve. I urge allvolunteers to use your unique skills, talents and lifeexperiences when promoting organ and tissue donationand to educate new segments of your communities.The results of this funeral director campaign have beenfantastic. If you'd like to get involved in promotingorgan and tissue donation, contact your local organprocurement organization, transplant center orNational Kidney Foundation affiliate. Judy Zavalla is a former organ procurement professional at Lifegift, Houston, Texas. TCEnding months of speculation, Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Donna Shalala named20 members to the Secretary's Advisory Committeeon Organ Transplantation. Selection of thecommittee was one of the last actions taken byShalala prior to leaving the post she held for almost8 years, longer than anyone in history. The reason for the speculation? President-elect Bush selected Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, along-time critic of the administration's organ allocationpolicies, to replace Shalala as HHS director. The committee's charge, as outlined in the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network's (OPTN) finalrule of 1999, is to advise the Secretary on all aspects oforgan procurement, allocation and transplantation,including independent review and advice on organallocation policies developed by the OPTN. \"This committee is a new mechanism for providing independent advice for the Secretary of HHS inreviewing and approving transplant policies,\" Shalalasaid in a press release announcing the committeemembers. \"The committee will provide for expert inputfrom those most closely involved in the transplantsector, including transplant surgeons and physicians,representatives of donors and recipients, and others.\" With Thompson waiting in the wings to take control, there was speculation he may ultimately overturn theHHS regulation which mandates that the OPTN createorgan allocation policies based on medical urgency notthe geographical location of the recipient. A lawsuit filed by the State of Wisconsin last March seeking a permanent injunction to preventHHS from implementing the regulation wasdismissed by a federal judge on November 24.(Transplant News, November 30, 2000) However, JonNelson, director of the Office of Special Projects inthe Health Resources and Services Administration(HRSA), doesn't believe Thompson will move quicklyto change the regulation if he is confirmed.\"The regulation has been in place for almost a year and the question will be whether the policiesare consistent with the new administration's,\"Nelson told Transplant News. \"We will support thepolicies of the new secretary. But the secretarywould have to take some specific action to rescindthe current regulation and we haven't heardanything about the regulation or the contract withUNOS (United Network for Organ Sharing) orURREA (University Renal Research and EducationAssociation) so we have no reason to think its veryhigh on his agenda right now.\" In the press release announcing the selection of the advisory committee, HHS described the currentregulation policies Thompson inherited. \"Nationaltransplantation policies are developed by the OPTNfor approval by HHS. Under regulations that tookeffect March 16, 2000, HHS made it clear that organtransplantation policies will continue, as before, tobe developed by the transplant community throughthe OPTN. HHS review and approval are needed tomake these policies binding on OPTN members.Under the regulations, the advisory committee is toexamine the OPTN's proposed policies and makerecommendations to the HHS Secretary before finalHHS action is taken.\" As an example HHS pointed out the OPTN developed proposals to better characterize the medicalcondition of patients waiting for a liver transplant. Unless Thompson unexpectedly overturns the regulation, the new advisory committee will reviewthese proposals as well as future proposed policies.In addition, on an on-going basis, the committee will review the OPTN's system of collecting,disseminating and ensuring the validity, accuracy,timeliness and usefulness of data. Other scientific,medical, public health, ethical, legal, coverage andfinancing and socioeconomic issues, as well asnational and international policy and developmentsrelevant to transplantation, will also be consideredby the committee.

Just oneday after the Senate confirmed his nomination,Thompson told HHS employees that increasing thenumber of Americans who donate organs will be afocus of his first 100 days in office. We're going to make it a national issue,\" Thompson emphasized. \"We're going to get the information outthere and we're going to encourage families all overAmerica to understand the importance of the donationof organs.\" Thompson reportedly devoted more than athird of his 14-minute talk to the organ donor shortage. In a memo to HHS employees on observing February 10 as National Donor Day in the U.S., Thompson said:\"The facts are staggering. Every 84 minutes someonein this country dies because there aren't enoughorgans available for transplant. Fewer than fivepercent of Americans who are eligible to donate blooddo so. And only 25-30 percent of those whose diseasesmay be cured by a marrow or stem cell transplant willfind a donor among members of their family. The need for donation is great. As humans, we are bound by an inherent dependence we have onstrangers; but none more so than those who sufferfrom a life-threatening illness, or organ malfunction.So I'm asking you to be a hero this weekend\u2014savesomeone's life by participating in National Donor Day.\" Thompson did not divulge any particulars of what new efforts will be supported by the department, orwhat funding resources might be involved in thenew effort. However, he did indicate that at thistime he is not inclined to make any changes in theHHS regulation mandating that organs be morewidely shared based on medical urgency notgeographical location of the donor. \"At this point in time I am not going to change the rule,\" Thompson told the Milwaukee Sentinel Journal. Bill to create medal honoring organ donors and their families introduced by Rep. Stark,Sen. Frist Representative Pete Stark (D-CA) and Senator Bill Frist (R-TN) introduced the \"Gift of Life CongressionalMedal Act of 2001\" which creates a commemorative medal to honor organ donors and their families. The 10Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 4Continued on next pageTransplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 4 11bill, which was introduced on February 14, makes organ donors, or their families, eligible to receive a commemorative Congressional medal to honor their life saving act of organ donation. \"Traditionally, Valentine's Day is an opportunity to shower loved ones with gifts, candy and flowers. Nowwe'd like to change the focus,\" said Senator Frist in apress release announcing the filing of the bill. \"Becausea new name is added to the national organ transplantwaiting list every 14 minutes, the gift of life is the mostneeded contribution a person can make. For thosetaking this generous step, this legislation would honorthe efforts of organ donors while also improving criticalpublic awareness of organ donation.\" Stark noted that the Gift of Life Congressional Medal Act will offer congress a \"great opportunity towork with [Health and Human Services] SecretaryTommy Thompson\" to draw attention to the needfor more organ donations. OPOs engage in unpredictable, sometimes illegal donor consent practices, NIH study alleges Organ procurement organizations (OPOs) engage in divergent, often unpredictable, and sometimesillegal practices for accepting organ donationconsent, according to a report and commentarypublished in the January 17th issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association . To understand current procurement policies and the impact of those polices on organ procurement,Dave Wendler, M.D. and Neal Dickert from theNational Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, MDsurveyed 61 OPOs across the United States. Livingwills, drivers' licenses, and donor cards receivedessentially equal weight in the OPOs' determination ofan individual's donation wishes, the authors stated.But when the wishes of next-of-kin differed fromthose of the deceased, the preferences of the familywere likely to be honored. Only when the holder of adurable power of attorney who was not a familymember sustained the wishes of the deceased weremore than half the OPOs likely to proceed with organprocurement against the preferences of the next-of-kin. More than 40 percent of OPOs said they wouldprocure organs from a deceased who had opposeddonation, provided the family supported the donation. Overall, an equal proportion of OPOs followed the deceased and the next-of-kin's wishes (31 percent),Wendler and Dickert noted. The remaining OPOsprocured if neither party objected (21 percent), ifeither party consented and neither objected (13percent), or did not follow any of these policies (3 percent). Nearly half of the OPOs ranked the impacton the deceased's family foremost in their consentpractices, whereas only 12 percent ranked thedeceased's wishes as most important, the resultsindicated. Finally, regardless of their statedprocedures, the OPOs' consent practices showed noclear correlation with them. \"Contrary to the prevailing wisdom, there is significant divergence in OPOs' consent practiceswith regard to cadaveric solid organ procurement,\"the researchers concluded. \"These data point to theneed for an explicit nationwide debate on the ethicsof consent for cadaveric solid organ procurement.\" According Susan Gunderson, chief executive officer of LifeSource, a St. Paul, MN-based OPO, thestudy findings were not particularly surprising.\"Each state has its own set of statues that arebased on the UAGA but that do have a fair amountof variability,\" Gunderson told Transplant News . \"I think [the points to the need for nationaldiscussions on how [OPOs] can best use the variousforms of donor documentation, including donorregistries, and apply them in our practice.\" As for whose wishes should take precedence\u2014the donor's or the family\u2014Gunderson, who also ispresident of the Association of Organ ProcurementOrganizations (AOPO) said that while OPOs\"obviously want to honor the individual's [donor's]wishes, he or she is part of a family unit. In mostcases, we need the involvement and support of thefamily to get a complete medical-social history,which is very important to being able to evaluatethe organs for donor suitability.\" New procedure may reduce size of kidney transplant waiting lists A procedure developed by Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) transplant specialists may make kidneytransplantation a reality for thousands of people whootherwise would be unlikely to receive a new organ. Approximately 7,000 of the 45,000 people on US kidney transplant waiting lists have elevatedantibody levels that make rejection a virtualcertainty and successful transplantation unlikelyunless a perfect match is found. Consequently, only300 of these patients receive one of the 8,000cadaveric kidneys that are available annually. Somewait as long as 10 years for a transplant. Continued on next page12Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 4The new technique, known as positive crossmatch transplantation, utilizes plasmapheresis, splenectomy,and immunosuppressive medications to greatly reduceantibody levels in these patients, thereby allowingtransplantation. \"We've only done four positivecrossmatch transplants, but these patients have alldone well,\" said Mark Stegall, MD. \"Three of the fourpatients went without any rejection whatsoever, but onepatient did have an antibody-mediated rejection.\" Two ofthe patients are \"out beyond a year now and are doingwell, equivalent to other transplant patients,\" he said. Crossmatch transplantation extends the knowledge gained from ABO-incompatible transplants. More than 20 patients have received transplants from ABO-incompatible living donors over the last two tothree years, with very good success, according toStegall. \"At some point, we hope to do xenograftkidneys. The experience that we have gained with ABO-incompatible and positive crossmatch patients hastaught us a lot about what we will need to know if weare ever going to do pig-to-human kidney transplants.\" Vertebral fractures linked to heart, liver transplantation Patients who receive a heart or liver transplant may face an increased risk of subsequent vertebralfractures, according to a study in the February 3 rd issue of the Lancet . Researchers at the University of Heidelberg in Germany found that during the first post-transplantyear, 21 percent of 105 heart transplant recipients and14 percent of 130 liver transplant recipients sufferedvertebral fractures. By the second year, 27 percent ofthe heart transplant group and 21 percent of the livertransplant group had experienced such fractures. Andby year three and four, one-third of the patients ineach group suffered at least one vertebral fracture. \"Our data confirmed a high risk of osteoporotic fractures...which may markedly influence thequality of life of these patients along with thesurvival rate,\" said co-investigator Gudrun Leidig-Bruckner, MD. \"The high frequency ofosteopororotic fractures in the two years aftertransplantation and the limitations of reliablefracture-risk repredictions show the need toinvestigate preventive therapies.\" Addressing the issue of prevention in an accompanying editorial, Pierre Delmas, MD fromClaude Bernard University in Lyon, France saidpostmenopausal women who undergo transplantationshould receive hormone replacement therapy toprotect their bones. Alternatively, women and possibly men might benefit from drugs such as alendronateand risedronate, which also have been shown toreduce fracture risk in some women with osteoporosis. Great Britain becomes first country in world to legalize cloning stem cells fromhuman embryos Britain became the first nation in the world to legalize limited human cloning after the House ofLords backed new government regulations allowingthe cloning of stem cells from human embryos. By a vote of 212 to 92, Parliament's upper body turned a deaf ear to religious leaders from acrossthe spectrum who had urged them to oppose themeasures. Debate raged for seven hours, buteventually, many opponents voted in favor afterreceiving assurances that a committee of expertswould scrutinize the ethics and science of the issue.Since members of the House of Commons passedthe order by a majority of two to one late last year,the new rules now will become law. Prime MinisterTony Blair had argued vigorously that permittingthe research would allow Britain to stay at theforefront of the booming biotechnology industry. Scientists believe that embryonic stem cells offer the potential to treat diseases such as Parkinson's,diabetes, cancer, stroke, and spinal cord injuries.Archbishop of Westminster Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, the leader of Britain's Catholics, saidstem cells could just as easily be obtained fromadults. But researchers maintain that stem cellsfrom embryos less than 1 week old offer thegreatest possibility for human benefit. While the new regulations change the Human Fertilization and Embryology Act of 1990, extendingthe scope of research to include stem cells fromhuman embryos, human cloning remains illegal. TC Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 4 13Paging Dr. Internet: Using the Internet as a Medical Tool By Bob Spieldenner Offering immediate access to vast amounts of data, the Internet is fast becoming a majorresource for Americans seeking medicalinformation and advice. A recent survey from thePew Internet and American Life Project found that55 percent of Americans who go online have usedthe Internet to search for medical information. Thesurvey also revealed that many people who foundmedical information on the Internet say it changedthe way they treated an illness. There is an astounding amount of medical information available online, with thousands ofmedical and health-related Web sites already inexistence. A search for \"organ transplants,\" forexample, produced more than 93,000 individualWeb sites. Despite its obvious advantages, this growing trend is raising some concerns among medical experts.Many Web sites are limited in their use or may haveinformation that is outdated or even inaccurate. \"There are a lot of people out there who are providing misleading or just plain false information,\"says Adela Casas-Melley, MD, a pediatric transplantsurgeon at duPont Hospital for Children in Delaware.\"As a result, many patients are delaying or evendenying proper medical care. It is important forpatients and family members to get informed, but theyshouldn't forget to involve their physicians in theirquest for knowledge. If you learn something new,discuss your findings with a physician you trust.\" So how can a person safely use the Internet as a medical tool? First, go to Web sites that have doctor-reviewed information or sites that are managed by reputableorganizations. Here are a few: General : www.webmd.comwww.drkoop.comwww.cbshealthwatch.comwww.laurushealth.com T ransplant : www.kidney.orgwww.unos.orgwww.transweb.orgThe next step is to discuss the information you find online with your doctor. \"Prior to my transplant, I did extensive Internet searches about kidney/pancreas transplants andthe potential consequences,\" says Allan Tarkenton,a kidney/pancreas recipient. didn't stop there,though. I confirmed the information with mytransplant coordinator, my primary physician andthe physicians at my transplant hospital. Thatgave me reassurance that my findings wereaccurate.\" The Internet can also be a source of support. A number of support groups are available atwww.egroups.com and www.delphi.com. Stephen Harris, whose daughter received a transplant at Children's Hospital in Boston,reflects, \"In most cases I found the sites to be veryinteresting and useful in helping me see ourexperience as not so strange and out of theordinary. It sort of helped me normalize what we'vebeen through.\" Just as with medical Web sites, any medical facts obtained through an Internet support groupshould also be checked with a doctor, since peopleusing online support groups may unintentionallypass on incorrect information. Combining a nearly unlimited supply of data with ever-increasing power and speed, the Internetcan be an indispensable medical research tool. Byfollowing the simple precautions outlined in thisarticle, it can remain a safe tool as well. Bob Spieldenner is the communications manager at the Coalition on Donation. TC14Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 4Studies of Pediatric Liver Transplantation By Debb Andersen, RN, BSSN, CCTC Studies of Pediatric Liver Transplantation (SPLIT) is a multi-center database for children who receive livertransplants. It was established in 1995 by a scientificadvisory board of pediatric hepatologists and transplantsurgeons and 12 participating pediatric liver transplantcenters. SPLIT's main objective is to recognize trends forpotential risk factors for patient death and livertransplant organ failure, and to improve the medicalcare of children who need, or have already received, aliver transplant. To achieve this objective, SPLIT aims tofollow and collect data on at least 80 percent of allchildren under the age of 18 who receive a livertransplant in the United States and Canada. All children who have liver failure, receive a liver transplant and belong to a participating SPLITcenter are invited to join this study. Using specificguidelines established by the SPLIT group, a nurseor research coordinator at each center collects data on the children and enters it into the SPLITdatabase. The children do not need extra medicaltests or blood work in order to participate in thestudy. Instead, the data is simply taken from thechildren's medical records after appropriate consenthas been obtained from parents or guardians. Thedata collected includes: the cause of liver failure,medical status before transplantation, length ofwaiting time, complications following transplantation,rate of rejection, immunosuppressive medications,nutritional status and patient growth. Each child'sdata is entered into SPLIT through a name code. As aresult, only the nurse or research coordinator knowsthe child's identity. Currently, 36 pediatric liver transplant centers belong to SPLIT. From these 29 centers, 1,144children have been registered into the SPLITdatabase and 604 of these have received their firstliver transplant. Below are some examples of thedata collected thus far. Among the 604 children receiving their first transplant: G38 percent were 12 months of age or younger G43 percent had a diagnosis of biliary atresia, which is the most common cause for pediatric livertransplantation; the average initial hospitalization wasabout 20 days; the average stay in the intensive careunit was a little over a week; immunosuppressivetherapy was nearly equally split between cyclosporineand tacrolimus-based protocolsG85 children died, most commonly from cardiopulmonary complications and infections. These are just a few examples of the important information that SPLIT has already obtained. Some of the many questions that SPLIT hopes to answer inthe future are : 1. What are the trends in immunosuppressive therapy in pediatric liver transplantation, and whatare the side effects in children? 2. What are the patient and graft survival rates, and what kind of illness can be expected followingtransplantation? 3. How is the growth of children affected following transplantation? 4. What are the risk factors, rates of occurrence and treatments and outcomes for infections and diseases such as Epstein Barr andLymphoproliferative disease? With increasing numbers of patients and participating centers adding information to theSPLIT database, it will continue to produce newinsights that will help save and improve the lives ofchildren receiving liver transplants. We hope that ifyou are asked, you will allow your child toparticipate in SPLIT. If you have not already beenasked to enroll your child, please contact your livertransplant coordinator.

TCTransplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 4 15As the shortage of available organs continues to worsen, many transplant centers are developing newmethods for increasing their organ supply. For somecenters, this has meant increasing the number ofliving donors. Others have taken a different approach,focusing instead on the use of non-heart beatingdonors (NHBD). NHBD are those whose hearts havestopped beating prior to organ donation, as opposedto traditional cadaver donors, who are declared braindead while their hearts remain beating artificially. In the past there has been reluctance on the part of some transplant centers to use organs from NHBDbecause it was believed that those organs did notfunction as well as organs obtained from brain deaddonors. However, statistics from the last 10 yearsshow that when kidneys from NHBD have beenobtained using good donation criteria, many of themare successfully transplanted. In fact, some centersreport that greater than 90 percent of the kidneysthey obtained from NHBD have functioned well. With such encouraging results, people started questioning if organs other than kidneys could alsobe used from NHBD. Should NHBD, for example,be considered a potential source for islet cells fortransplantation? Recent studies indicate that isletcells can be recovered from NHBD in adequatenumbers, and that the function of the islet cells issimilar to those obtained from brain dead donors.In addition, because of improved selection criteriaand organ recovery methods, the use of NHBD hasbeen extended to more centers and now includesthe recovery of livers. Again, if strict selectioncriteria are used, organ function has been good. According to a recent report, an aggressive effort to further increase the scope of NHBD has been initiatedby transplant centers in Spain. Three years ago thesecenters began obtaining organs from subjects who have died in the streets, considering anyone less than50 years old whose heart has stopped beating for lessthan 15 minutes as a potential donor. The donor isbrought to the hospital and placed on bypassmachine\u2014which keeps blood flowing through theorgans\u2014until the family is contacted and permissionfor donation is obtained. Only 13 of the 111 familiescontacted denied permission for donation. During the first three years of this effort, 53 out of 111 potential donors have become actual donors.The centers have transplanted 72 kidneys, with 83percent of them functioning well. They have alsorecovered 12 livers, transplanting eight of them, allwith good function. In addition, they also recoveredcorneas and pancreas for islet isolation. Overall,the centers have significantly increased their donorpool through this effort. Dating back to 1996, 49percent of their donors have been NHBD, and ofthese, 85 percent have come from the streets. Is this approach a little radical? Perhaps. Can we do it here in the United States? Probably not. Butwe cannot deny that these centers have been ableto transplant 72 kidneys and eight livers intopeople who might otherwise still be waiting. In other words, as radical as it sounds, the program in Spain is working. In light of this success,has the time come for us to re-examine our ownrecovery strategies and attitude toward NHBD? It'sclear that NHBD are a real source for expanding thedonor pool. Although many transplant centers stillfeel very uncomfortable about using NHBD, we needto carefully consider every possible source of organsfor our patients. Indeed, with the organ shortageworsening daily, we can afford to do no less. TCCOMMENTARY A New Source for Organ Donors Deserves a Closer Look By Adela T.

Although the circumstances leading upto it may not have been unique, the success of thetransplant has placed me in a very select group: Iwas born with hemophilia, but no longer suffer fromchronic bleeding and the fears that accompany it. Hemophilia is a coagulation disorder that prevents blood from clotting normally. I was diagnosed 41years ago when I was 2 years old, after a headtrauma. At that time, most hemophiliacs died young, or if they lived, had an extremely poor quality of life.When they suffered a bleeding episode, they requiredan infusion of whole blood to replace what was beinglost through the bleeding. Then, in 1964, a discoveryby Dr. Judith Graham Pool dramatically improvedthe treatment of hemophilia. Dr. Pool discovered that factor 8, the substance lacking in the blood of hemophiliacs, could beseparated from whole blood, which eventually led tothe development of factor replacement therapy. Thistherapy helped prevent excessive bleeding byimproving clotting times, meaning that whole bloodinfusions were no longer necessary. In addition, thetherapy could often be administered in the home,allowing hemophiliacs to lead much more normal lives. Unfortunately\u2014and often tragically\u2014blood impurities such as hepatitis, and later HIV,accompanied factor 8 during replacement therapy.In fact, about a third of all hemophiliacs lost theirlives in the 1980s and 90s due to AIDS. While I did not contract HIV, I did develop Hepatitis B and C. In early 1997, a physician askedme if I had ever considered a liver transplant. Ishrugged and said, \"No, why should I?\" Heexplained that half of all hemophiliacs with factor-induced hepatitis develop cirrhosis, and half ofthose cases also develop liver cancer. Since I hadalready had cirrhosis for a number of years, he feltthat cancer was a likely occurrence. I remembertelling my wife, Carol, who is a nurse, what thedoctor explained. While I took it in stride\u2014myparents and I had grown used to hearing gloomyprognoses throughout my life\u2014Carol was veryconcerned. Two years later, the physician'sprediction, and Carol's fears, proved accurate, as I was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor near the topof my liver. I now had to decide what to do about it. The options included treatments such as radiation, chemotherapyand surgical removal. Another option was a newprocedure that I had never heard of before, calledcryoablation, which literally freezes the cancer and avery small amount of tissue surrounding it. I chose cyroablation, and in October 1998, successfully underwent the procedure. I wasgrateful that the cancer was under control, but theproblem now was that my liver was smaller and itsfunction continued to decrease and I was placed ona waiting list for a liver transplant. As the months passed, my side effects from the decreased liver function grew more pronounced,especially the fatigue. The fatigue was simply awful.Naps, and even worse, falling asleep at mycomputer, were frequent events. Other side effectsincluded weight gain from edema, enlarged breasts,frequent urination from the diuretics I was taking,a decreased libido, and the gradual changing of myskin color to a pale, grayish yellow. These were allquite unpleasant, but the scariest side effects weredementia and mood swings. Despite efforts to avoidthe dementia, I did suffer several episodes and evendirected some nasty outbursts toward Carol, whoclearly didn't deserve them. My quality of life was growing worse by the day, but thankfully, help arrived in October 1999 when Ireceived my new liver. My life immediately changed forthe better, and in January 2000 I was able to returnto my job as a professor at the University of theSciences in Philadelphia. Today, nearly a year later, Iam happy to say that I feel healthier and strongerthan I have in a decade. Though a little heavier than Iprefer, and still taking several medications, I havemore energy and more optimism than ever before!What's more, I am one of a small group of people onthe planet who can truly say, \"I had hemophilia.\" Dr. Scheerhorn is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. SeeDr. Dunn s article on the next page for more information on this topic.TCTransplant Chronicles, Vol. 8, No. 4 17Apromising new procedure involving the transplantation of small portions of healthy liversoffers new hope to individuals with metabolic diseases,which occur when the production or metabolism ofcritical substances in the body is disrupted. One such metabolic disease, hemophilia, is a genetic defect that interferes with the production offactor 8, which is necessary for normal blood clotting.Attempts are underway to develop a gene transplantto correct this problem, but to date these attemptshave been relatively unsuccessful. Only low levels offactor 8 production have been achieved, and thoselevels cannot be sustained for long. Another attemptto correct the problem\u2014through transfusions offactor 8\u2014has been unsuccessful, with some patientsdeveloping Hepatitis C and chronic liver disease. The most successful efforts to boost factor 8 production so far have resulted from livertransplantation. Patients with hemophilia who havereceived a liver transplant have been cured of theirhemophilia, typically within the first 24 hoursfollowing the transplant. This is because the newliver is able to excrete factor 8 without difficulty. Asa result, patients who have required lifelong factor 8infusion therapy no longer need the infusions. Theyare free to lead a normal life without worrying aboutthe complications of life-threatening bleeding. Although liver transplantation has had impressive results in some patients with hemophilia, in manycases metabolic diseases do not cause actual damageor cirrhosis of the liver itself. If the liver is notdamaged, there is no reason to remove it and performa transplant. How then can people in these cases behelped? The answer is partial liver transplant. When the liver is normal except for its metabolic defect, it is now possible to transplant a smallportion of a normal liver into the abdomen besidethe native liver. The two organs then work intandem. The partial liver is able to correct thenative liver's metabolic defect, while the native livercontinues to perform its usual functions. Patients who receive these partial transplants require immunosuppression to prevent rejectionand can have the same complications as othertransplant recipients. However, there is a safetynet. If the transplanted liver has to be removed, thenative liver will still function as it did before. With promising results so far, we believe that partial liver transplants have a bright future. Until other, moredefinitive forms of therapies such as gene transplantationare perfected, this procedure offers new hope for manypatients with metabolic disease.

If you belong to a health club or gym, a trainer or instructor is usuallyavailable to answer your questions anddemonstrate safe lifting techniques. How often should I lift? Working out three times a week, with a rest day following each session, is a safe and effective wayto begin. This allows for cellular development andgives your muscles a chance to rebuild and getstronger. Do not skip the rest day, even if you feellike lifting. Instead, try doing some alternateaerobic (cardiovascular) exercises such as walking,swimming and light jogging. Aerobic/Cardiovascular Training It's important to condition your total body. That's why, in addition to weight training to keep yourmuscles, ligaments, tendons and bones strong,your fitness program should include aerobic, orcardiovascular training to keep your heart, lungsand circulatory system working well. Running,hiking, walking, swimming, cycling, cross-countryskiing, rowing and skipping rope are all examplesof aerobic activities. An ideal fitness program wouldsupplement weight training with an aerobic activitythree times a week, with a goal of 30 to 60 minutesper session. Start with whatever you arecomfortable with, however, even if it's just for fiveminutes. Add a minute or two to that time eachday or week, depending on your fitness level.Train in Your \"Zone\" It's important to train in a target exertion zone to give yourself the maximum cardiovascular benefitwhile maintaining safety.
