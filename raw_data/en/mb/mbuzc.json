Herd immunity (or community immunity) is accomplished when enough people in a region or population become immune to COVID-19 either from infection and recovery or through vaccination. Once herd immunity is achieved, community spread drops significantly and the virus naturally dies out. [Click here to learn more about herd immunity](https://www.munsonhealthcare.org/blog/what-is-herd-immunity) or watch the video below. What are personal protective antibodies? Personal protective antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight [viral infections like COVID-19](/ContentPage.aspx?nd=5308). Antibodies can take days or weeks to develop in the body following exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. Vaccines are a much safer and more controlled way to develop personal protective antibodies. Will a vaccine prevent me from getting sick with COVID-19? COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response in your body without having to experience sickness. It usually takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity after vaccination. That means it's possible to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and get sick because the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection It is possible for fully vaccinated people to still get infected. These cases are called vaccine [breakthrough infections](/blog/covid-19-breakthrough-infection-should-you-be-worried).

Can I still receive the vaccine? Yes. Contact your family doctor if you have had any severe reactions to medicines or vaccines in the past. According to the CDC, anaphylactic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines are rare. Anaphylaxis typically develops within the first 15 minutes and among individuals with a history of anaphylaxis. These individuals are routinely asked to wait 30 minutes after vaccination for monitoring. Should this occur, anaphylaxis is highly treatable. Vaccine administration sites are prepared with epinephrine and other safety measures and protocols to respond appropriately. I'm immunocompromised or have comorbidities. Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine? The risks associated with contracting COVID-19 may be more severe for people who are immunocompromised.

Due to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the possibility of re-infection, you may receive a COVID-19 vaccine at any time as long as you are not acutely ill. The immunity gained from having an infection, called natural immunity, varies from person to person. At this time, experts do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering. Some early evidence suggests natural immunity may not last very long. Both natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity are important aspects of COVID-19 that experts are studying. If you have received COVID-19 convalescent plasma or [monoclonal antibody treatment](/services/community-health/covid19/treatment), please wait 90 days before requesting a COVID-19 vaccine.
