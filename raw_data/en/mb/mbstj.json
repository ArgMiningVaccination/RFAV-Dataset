He joined Childrens after completing his pediatric residency, medical genetics residency and biochemical genetics fellowship at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. He provides inpatient and outpatient clinical services in biochemical genetics at Children's hospital campus in Seattle and Bellevue clinics and at the Spokane newborn screening outreach clinic. His clinical interests include long-term follow up of infants with abnormal newborn screens, urea cycle disorders and fatty acid oxidation disorders. His clinical work has led efforts to further understand how we can better promote educational efforts and improve the quality of our follow-up of these infants. He is the site principle investigator for the Urea Cycle Disorders Consortium Longitudinal study and received a grant to study the effects of newborn screening in patients and families with urea cycle disorders. He is involved with development of novel pharmaceutical therapies for treatment of urea cycle disorders, fatty acid oxidation disorders, organic acidemias, glycogen storage diseases and lysosomal storage diseases. The expansion of newborn screening the the past two decades has driven much of his clinical work. He serves as the Program Director for the Medical Biochemical Genetics Fellowship program here at the University of Washington. - - Dr. Merritt has a gentle and kind demeanor(very understanding and empathetic), has always exhibited it since his days in early post secondary university in TX. I highly recommend him and have been keenly interested in his research for over a decade. One of the finest pediatric specialists in the US. - Doctor Merritt is an amazing physician willing to go the extra mile searching for a diagnosis, treating the patient and working with parents in the process. We are forever grateful for his diligence in searching for the source of our son's issues. We were seen in a timely fashion for each appointment and never rushed through visits no matter how many questions we had. He is thoughtful and thorough and does not give up. He is a true asset to the field of Biochemical Genetics. - Dr. Merritt LISTENS. He hears everything and responds and does not make us feel foolish for all of our questions that I'm sure he's heard a million times. I am so impressed that he is not threatened by patients researching and learning about their disorder, but encourages it. We are thankful to have been referred to him! - Dr. Merritt has been our doctor for the past 2 1/2 years. Their is no one finer than him and his team. My son was sleepy and not doing normal day to day activities before meeting Dr. Merritt. After meeting him, Dr. Merritt and his team started him on the medicine that helped him have more energy and be able to play and have fun. My husband and I will be forever grateful to him. He is truly the best in his field. He is caring, compassionate, and truly loves what he does. I highly recommend him and his staff. - Dr. Merritt is wonderful! He's super patient, has a great bedside manner and is fantastic with children. My daughter loves him....as do I! If you have a biochemical issue, I highly recommend seeing Dr. Merritt. - - Manuscripts in Refereed Journals - Golden-Grant K, Merritt JL 2nd, Scott CREthical considerations of population screening for late-onset genetic disease. 25677830 Clinical genetics, 2015 Dec. : 88(6)589-92 - Nagamani SC, Diaz GA, Rhead W, Berry SA, Mons C, Lichter-Konecki U, Bartley J, Feigenbaum A, Schulze A, Longo N, Berquist W, Gallagher R, Bartholomew D, Harding CO, Korson MS, McCandless SE, Smith W, Vockley J, Kronn D, Zori R, S, Wong D, Coakley M, Lee BH, Mokhtarani MSelf-reported treatment-associated symptoms among patients with urea cycle disorders participating in glycerol phenylbutyrate clinical trials. 26296711 Molecular genetics and metabolism, 2015 Sept. : 116(1-2)29-34 - Lee B, Diaz GA, Rhead W, Lichter-Konecki U, Feigenbaum A, Berry SA, Le Mons C, Bartley JA, Longo N, Nagamani SC, Berquist W, Gallagher R, Bartholomew D, Harding CO, Korson MS, McCandless SE, Smith W, Cederbaum S, Wong D, Merritt JL 2nd, Schulze A, Vockley G, Kronn D, and glutamine as predictors of hyperammonemic crises in patients with urea cycle disorder. 25503497 Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics, 2014 Dec 11 - Merritt JL 2nd, Berry S, Le Mons C, Teigen C, Matern D, Rinaldo P.Rationale For Newborn Screening For Proximal Urea Cycle Disorders. 2014 May - Merritt JL 2nd, Vedal S, Abdenur JE, Au SM, Barshop L, CO, C, Lorey F, Sesser DE, Thompson JD, Yu AInfants suspected to have very-long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency from newborn screening. 24503138 Molecular genetics and metabolism, 2014 April : 111(4)484-92 - J Lawrence Merritt II, MD, Underhill HR, Hahn SH, Hale S, Merritt JL 2nd.Asymptomatic methylmalonic acidemia in a homozygous MUT 2013 Dec. : Ruhoy IS, Merritt JL 2nd, Amlie-Lefond CCystathionine Beta-synthase Heralded Cerebral Sinus Venous Thrombosis and Stroke. 24138954 Pediatric neurology, 2013 Oct. - Ah Mew N, Krivitzky L, McCarter R, Batshaw M, Tuchman M, Urea Cycle Disorders Consortium of the Rare Diseases Clinical Research NetworkClinical outcomes of neonatal onset proximal versus distal urea cycle disorders do not differ. 22901741 The Journal of pediatrics, 2013 Feb. : 162(2)324-9.e1 - Merritt JL 2nd, Askenazi D, Hahn SHNewborn screening and renal disease: where we have been; where we are now; where we are going. 21947256 Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany), 2011 Sep 27 - Lichter-Konecki U, Diaz GA, Merritt JL 2nd, Feigenbaum Marier M, Scharschmidt B, Rhead WAmmonia control in children with urea cycle disorders (UCDs); phase 2 comparison of sodium phenylbutyrate and glycerol phenylbutyrate. 21612962 Molecular genetics and metabolism, 2011 Aug. : 103(4)323-9 - Seminara J, Tuchman M, Krivitzky L, Krischer J, Lee HS, Lemons C, Baumgartner M, Cederbaum S, Diaz GA, Feigenbaum A, Gallagher RC, Harding CO, Kerr DS, Lanpher B, Lee B, Lichter-Konecki U, McCandless SE, Merritt JL, Oster-Granite ML, Seashore M, Waisbren S, Yudkoff M, Batshaw MLEstablishing a consortium for the study of rare diseases: The Urea Cycle Disorders Consortium. 20188616 Molecular genetics and metabolism, 2010 : S97-105 - Bachmann-Gagescu R, Merritt JL 2nd, Hahn SHA cognitively normal PDH-deficient 18-year-old man carrying the R263G mutation in the PDHA1 gene. 19639391 Journal of inherited metabolic disease, 2009 Jul 29 - Merritt JL 2nd, Nguyen T, Daniels J, Matern D, Schowalter DBBiochemical correction of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency following adeno-associated virus gene therapy. 19156135 Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy, 2009 March : 17(3)425-9 PMCID:PMC2835097 - Merritt JL, Lindor NMFurther clinical with congenital glaucoma and brachycephaly. 18266245 American journal of medical genetics.
