A CAR is a genetically-engineered receptor made so that immune cells (T cells) can attack cancer cells by recognizing and responding to the CD19/CD22 proteins. These proteins are commonly found on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine phosphate, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. NKTR-255 is an investigational IL-15 receptor agonist designed to boost the immune system's natural ability to fight cancer. Giving CD19/CD22-CAR T cells and chemotherapy in combination with NKTR-255 may work better in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Stanford is currently accepting patients for this trial. Stanford Investigator(s): Intervention(s): - biological: Chimeric Phosphate - - other: Questionnaire Administration - drug: NKTR-255 Eligibility For B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 1. Confirmed diagnosis of relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL of one of the following types: - Chemotherapy refractory disease in subjects with B-ALL, defined as progression or stable disease after one line of therapy. - Recurrence of disease after achieving CR. 2. Subjects with persistent or relapsed minimal residual disease (MRD) (by flow cytometry, PCR, FISH, or next generation sequencing) require verification of MRD positivity on two occasions at least 4 weeks apart. 3. Subjects with Philadelphia Chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL) subjects are eligible if they progressed after receiving a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). 4. Subjects with recurrence of isolated CNS relapse after achieving complete remission (CR); if relapsed with MRD, will require verification of MRD positivity on two occasions at least 4 weeks apart. 5. CD19 positive expression- CD19 expression is required at any time since diagnosis. If patient has received anti-CD19 targeted therapy (i.e. Blinatumomab or CD19-CAR T cells), then CD19 expression must be subsequently demonstrated. CD19 expression may be detected by immunohistochemistry or by flow cytometry. The choice of whether to use flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry will be determined by what is the most easily available tissue sample in each subject. In general, immunohistochemistry will be used for lymph node biopsies, flow cytometry will be used for peripheral blood and bone marrow samples. 6. Subjects who have undergone autologous SCT with disease progression or relapse following SCT are eligible. Subjects who have undergone allogeneic SCT will be eligible if, in addition to meeting other eligibility criteria, they have elelino evidence of GVHD and have been without immunosuppressive agents for at least 30 days. 7. Subjects who have undergone prior anti-CD19 or anti-CD22 CAR therapy must be at least 30 days post CAR infusion and may not have eficence of persistnce of CAR T cells in blood smples (circulating levels of genetically modified cels of >/= 5% by flow cytometry. 8. Must have evaluable or measurable disease. Lesions that have been previously irradiated will be considered measurable only if progression has been documented following completion of radiation therapy. 9. At least 2 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time the subject is planned for leukapheresis, except for systemic inhibitory/stimulatory immune checkpoint therapy, which requires 5 half-lives. Exceptions: 1. There is no time restriction with regard to prior intrathecal chemotherapy (incl. steroids) provided there is complete recovery from any acute toxic effects; 2. Subjects who are on standard ALL maintenance type chemotherapy (vincristine, 6-mercaptopurine or oral methotrexate) may be enrolled provided that chemotherapy is discontinued at least 1 week or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) prior to apheresis. 3. Subjects receiving steroid therapy at physiologic replacement doses (5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent doses of other corticosteroids) only are allowed provided there has been no increase in dose for at least 2 weeks prior to starting apheresis; 4. For radiation therapy: Radiation therapy must have been completed at least 3 weeks prior to apheresis, with the exception that there is no time restriction if the volume of bone marrow treated is less than 10% and also the subject has measurable/evaluable disease outside the radiation port. 10. Toxicities due to prior therapy must be stable and recovered to Grade 1 (except for clinically non-significant toxicities such as alopecia) 11. Age 18 or older 12.

No clinically significant ECG findings 10. No clinically significant pleural effusion 11. Baseline oxygen saturation > 92% on room air * A subject will not be excluded because of cytopenia if it is felt by the investigator to be due to underlying leukemia/lymphoma. 14. Subjects with CNS involvement are eligible as long as there are no overt signs or symptoms that in the evaluation of the investigator would mask or interfere with the neurological assessment of toxicity. 15. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (females who have undergone surgical sterilization or who have been postmenopausal for at least 2 years are not considered to be of childbearing potential) 16. Subjects of child-bearing or child-fathering potential must be willing to practice birth control from the time of enrollment on this study and for four (4) months after receiving the preparative lymphodepletion regimen or 1 month after the last dose of NKTR_255, whichever is later. 17.
