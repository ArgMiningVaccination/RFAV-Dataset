How in our lives can we apply sacred focus and sacred action to give life and energy to the seeds we have planted in the past and those that have yet to come? We'll gather fireside under full moon light for a cacao and ritual burning ceremony releasing identities and energies that we no longer are and welcome in that which is yet to be birthed from within us, on the eve of Thursday August 31st. To open our evening Nola will offer everyone a Copal blessings and sacred smudge and share story, science and mythology about this truly profound & sacred bean (ceremonial grade cacao) and how its re-emergence in the world is no accident, yet part of a Universal transformation taking place upon this planet and beyond. Nola will take the time to share as we open our evenings gathering how cacao can serve and assist and deeply enrich each of us uniquely and collectively throughout any and all the cycle's of our lives. Our journey together with be centered upon releasing all limitations and tossing them in the sacred fire! Powerfully stating our intentions and how we would like to move into the end of summer and beginning of autumn's months. Each of us will have time alone with the fire, to speak silently (or aloud) from and to our hearts and souls. Magic truly is afoot. Our guided meditation journey will follow with a beautiful integration and welcoming from our Divine Light & Mind into the next evolution of ourselves. During these ceremonies, many of us experience Cacao's medicine as being in spiritual partnership with our soul's truth and intuitive bodies - igniting their presence in our awareness. This may be an opportunity to open our hearts to what is possible. We will connect, share our hearts, spirits and minds and allow anything no longer serving our highest good to be washed through us. Come relax by the fire with the a hot mug of the world's purest ceremonial cacao and smiling faces to surround! Each participant will receive a surprise One World Cacao gift to bring home and continue their own journeys and integration within.
