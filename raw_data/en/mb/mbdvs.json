Yes we do offer holistic treatment care at our facility. Holistic treatment is widely used as complementary and alternative medicine practice in a wide variety of treatment facilities nationwide. We offer mindfulness meditation, acupuncture, energy healing, massage, and rollology just to name a few. Each patient will be able to select from a daily menu of services to fit their individual needs. Will you help with an aftercare plan? We will customize each patient's after-care plan, just like we customize their detox and wellness plan. The Palm Beach Detox and Wellness Institute staff will have a meeting with the patient and any loved ones prior to discharge to tailor a treatment plan which is specific to their needs. For some patients, transitioning to a residential treatment facility may be appropriate. However, we understand that, for some individuals, alternate options may be preferred. Our team will work closely with you to devise a customized transitional care strategy that may include regular follow-up with our Addiction Medicine physician, our Recovery and Wellness Coach, as well as psychotherapy and wellness services, The staff will even go as far as bringing the patient to local twelve step, SMART, or Refuge Recovery Meetings. Each patient has different wants and needs, and we are here to create an aftercare plan together specifically for that individual. How long will the detox process take? The length of time needed for detox is highly variable depending on several factors including what substance the patient is using, how long they have been using, and the quantity they are using. It can also vary based on any medical complications. We do not discharge any patient until the medical and wellness staff agrees that a patient is stable and ready. Because we are a private pay facility, the length of stay is determined by the progress of the patient as opposed to a facility that takes insurance which may discharge according to how many days the insurance plan will cover. We have the flexibility to keep a patient as long as medically necessary. "}
