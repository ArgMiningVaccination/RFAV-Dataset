Experts warn us about the hard-body arachnids that carry Lyme disease. And Ivermectin in Canada. Health officials say the livestock anti-parasite drug is not an alternative to treating COVID in people, despite those attempting to use it. Also tonight, is alternative Chinese medicine right for you? We'll look at the different modalities and let you decide. All this and more coming up right now on \"WPBS Weekly: Inside the Stories.\" (dramatic music) - \"WPBS Weekly: Inside the Stories\" is brought to you by the Daisy Marquis Jones Foundation, the Watertown Oswego Small Business Development Center, and Carthage Savings, mortgage solutions since 1888. - Good evening, everyone. And welcome to this edition of \"WPBS Weekly: Inside the Stories.\" I'm Stephfond Brunson. Fall leaves, muddy trails, and damp, thick brush attract little bugs that create a big nuisance. They are ticks, and these days they're more prevalent in Northern New York and Eastern Ontario. Deer ticks can carry Lyme disease, and for many folks, the disease is detrimental. But for one Canadian biologist, he and a team of researchers found a way to determine the danger right in the field. WPBS producer, Eric Cleary, has more. (peppy music) (crowd murmuring) - [Eric] Over the past 20 years, there has been an increase in tick population across the US and Canada, and the diseases they can transmit have also become more prevalent, with Lyme disease being the most commonly known tick-borne illness. To better understand how to prevent tick bites, Sue Gwise, of Cornell Cooperative Extension, explains what ticks look like and where to find them. - A description of a tick would be, it's very small. They're kind of a teardrop shape. They have several life stages. They start out as an egg, they go to a larval stage, then nymph stages, which are immature, and then the adult stage. The larva are probably about the size of a grain of sand. The nymphs are probably the size of a poppy seed, and the adult is probably the size of a sesame seed. Now, when they're feeding, and they're engorged and they swell up, they can be as big as a raisin. The deer tick in particular has black legs. It's also known as the black-legged tick. - [Eric] Initially ticks that latch onto a host are very small and hardly noticeable, but what happens once they begin to feed on a host? - Once it's been on your skin and feeding for a number of hours, it will enlarge and become engorged. And at that point, you know, before it's done feeding, it may get as big as the size of a raisin. - [Eric] To remove the raisin-sized arachnid, hikers need to be diligent and move quickly to avoid potential Lyme disease. - How do you remove a tick? The best way is to have a tick removal kit and you can get those almost anywhere. But the key is, is that you want to get extremely close to the skin and pop that tick out. You don't want to break the head of the tick off, because that can lead to future infections. So you want to get very close to the skin and pop that tick out and then save the tick because you may want to get it identified. You may want to have it tested for Lyme disease, or your doctor may want to see it. Ticks acquire Lyme disease by feeding on rodents, mice, any small mammal. So it can be chipmunks, it can be foxes, even birds can harbor ticks. - [Eric] Because Lyme disease can be detrimental to some, determining whether or not the tick carries the disease is crucial. Gwise advises an immediate urgent care visit. Meantime, on the other side of the border, researchers are trying to determine how to detect the disease faster. - So this is a portable sequencer. It's made by Oxford Nanopore. And it's a little, it's got a little device here where you can load your sample. And then it's just like a computer interface. It's got a screen, it has internet connectivity, and it can actually, in real time, sequence the DNA that's extracted from the ticks. - [Eric] In layman's terms, this small device can take a ticks blood sample and determine the danger on the spot. And as research continues, this device just may find its way into urgent care rooms. - The idea is to have a device that we can use in a variety of settings. So it could be a doctor's office and they are interested in what microbes might be in the tick that the patient has been exposed to, or it could be sampling in the field, where we want to monitor different pathogens. Ticks were not a problem 20 years ago, and really over the last 10 years, we've seen this rapid increase in Lyme disease cases. So this is a pretty recent phenomenon. It's something we're all getting used to living with. And you know, every year there's new parts of Canada that did not previously have Lyme disease that where now patients are being diagnosed with it. - [Eric] If you want to avoid ticks altogether, protection is key. - First of all, wear long pants, long sleeve shirt, tuck your shirt into your pants. If you're hiking, stay on the trails, don't go off the trails into brushy areas. It's a good idea to spray your pants and spray your clothing with a tick repellent, something that contains DEET, and there are a lot of them out there on the market. - [Eric] Gwise also recommends pets be treated with flea and tick repellent before hitting the trails. In Watertown, I'm Eric Cleary for \"WPBS Weekly.\" - Also tonight, there's concern among Canadian health officials with the rise in sales of Ivermectin, an anti-parasite drug used on horses and other livestock. It's a drug completely unapproved for use in the treatment of COVID-19 with humans. However, over the past several weeks, we've seen headlines and stories of those attempting to use it to counter the virus. Health Canada says the drug is not an alternative to getting vaccinated or for treating those with the virus. (peppy music) - It's a wait and see. They've said there's nothing else they can do, so why not? - [Reporter] Pete Lopez, an American 74-year-old from Texas, had been at a local hospital in Sugarland, Texas for a month battling COVID-19. His family describing him as the patriarch of the family. A veteran, Lopez suffered a heart attack a few years ago, but his family says he was otherwise healthy. In fact, they couldn't get him to slow down. (women laugh) Unvaccinated, Lopez passed away from COVID on Monday. His granddaughter Gabriel Snyder speaking before his death, his wife, too upset to. - She's afraid she's gonna lose her best friend. - [Reporter] Snyder says they wanted the hospital to use Ivermectin to treat Lopez. Health officials in Texas, as well as here in Canada, have warned against the drug, however, which is intended for animals. The FDA and Health Canada have approved its use in people for the treatment of specific parasitic diseases, but not COVID-19. Still Snyder says they were prepared to try anything. - Now it's a wait and see, they've said there's nothing else they can do. So why not? - [Reporter] Interest in the drug is growing in Canada as well, despite no concrete evidence on whether it can treat the coronavirus. Health Canada has not authorized its use here, saying it could cause serious health problems. The agency saying quote, its \"received concerning reports of the use of veterinary Ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19. Canadians should never consume health products intended for animals.\" The body goes on to say that, \"Health Canada is closely monitoring all potential therapeutic treatments for COVID-19, including treatments being studied in international clinical trials. To date, Health Canada has not received any drug submissions or clinical trial application for Ivermectin.\" - The worst of it is when people think that this is an alternative to getting vaccinated. It is not. We have something that's enormously effective, both for prevention and ensuring that if you've got an infection it's mild, which is the vaccination, and if people turn to something that for which there is no supportive evidence and it's likely useless, it's a very sad story. - [Reporter] Clinical trials on Ivermectin have been done, but experts say they've yielded insufficient evidence of any efficacy to date. Overdose can cause nausea, vomiting, upset stomach, low blood pressure, seizures, and even coma or death. Experts say the desire among some to take the drug mirrors the hype around hydroxychloroquine. Despite little to no clinical data, that drug became a beacon for those who oppose vaccines. A definitive report from January, in the medical trade journal, \"The Lancet,\" concluding, \"Multiple high quality studies subsequently showed no benefit of hydroxychloroquine use as a COVID-19 treatment.\" There are 1,427 Canadians hospitalized with COVID in Canada right now, compared to more than 100,000 in the United States. - Some of it has to do with the fact that there's been tremendous disinformation campaigns and people are believing things that are simply not true. - [Reporter] Back in Texas, the hospital treating Pete Lopez did not listen to the request for Ivermectin. Lopez sued and a judge ruled in favor of the family, ordering the hospital to administer the drug. Despite that order, Snyder says the hospital did not give it to Lopez. The hospital, defending its actions, officials declining to comment on the Lopez case specifically, but a statement saying, quote, \"Physicians diagnose and treat patients consistent with best medical practices. It is the role of medical providers to determine safe and effective courses of treatment for patients.\" It went on to say quote, \"Outside of ongoing clinical trials, the FDA, CDC, WHO discourage the use of Ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19.\" - But that man's will to live is so powerful and he's fighting to live, and Memorial Hermann is fighting against him. - [Reporter] In Canada, anecdotal evidence suggests Canadian interest in Ivermectin is highest in rural regions where vaccination rates trail the national average, like in pockets of Alberta, where Delta variant infections are now dashing hopes of a normal fall. - But because of how fast the Delta-driven, mostly Delta-driven cases are escalating, particularly in the west of the country, the window of opportunity to make that impact is definitely narrowing. (gentle electronic music) - This month, we're tackling different healing modalities, as we move into the darker months of winter. Last week, we shared the benefits of halotherapy. This week, we share the benefits of Chinese medicine. For stress, anxiety, chronic pain, and overall wellbeing, acupuncture may be for you. And if that's not the modality that appeals to you, what about cupping or moxa? Jolene DesRosiers shares more on these different methods and how they just might be your next remedy. (upbeat electronic music) - Moxibustion is another therapy that we use, and it uses the herb mugwort in a dried form. And we can apply it to areas of swelling, or edema, or on specific acupuncture points. Like this a point on the spleen channel, and it helps warm the channel. It can help reduce pain. It's really great for people with swelling, from like an acute injury, like a sprained ankle. I've always loved science and medicine, and I've always loved helping people. I actually started going to nursing school originally. Right out of high school, that's what I wanted to do was something in medicine. But I just found that I wanted to focus more on wellness and how to help the body heal naturally, than just kind of mask symptoms with medications and different procedures. I wanted to help people find their own health through acupuncture. Acupuncture uses really, really tiny, they're about the size of a strand of hair, sterile needles, and we needle points on the meridians in the body. So there's a meridian for all the organs based off of Chinese medicine. So this was medicine that was created thousands and thousands of years ago, and it's all about bringing the body back to balance. So the idea is that when the body isn't in balance, so there's either too much of something, not enough of something or a blockage, we can use acupuncture to help bring the body back into balance. (upbeat electronic music) So acupuncture works by affecting the central nervous system. So we can kind of get you back into the parasympathetic nervous system, which is like the rest and digest. So we're going to take you out of that fight or flight, like, hyped up energy and help calm the body back down. And then based on Chinese medicine, each organ has an associated emotion to it. So then I will work on that organ system as well, to bring the body back into balance. - I've had acupuncture for stress, for digestive issues, for pain in my foot. I've developed arthritis in my big toe. We do acupuncture and she does the moxa, which just really helps get rid of the pain. It's amazing. And I also started a very stressful job last year and that just caused me to experience just horrible stress, just tightness in my chest. So I began seeing her for that. But, well, people's initial reactions are usually like, \"Ouch!\" You know, like, \"You had somebody put needles in you?\" It's not like that. It doesn't hurt. The experience that I have is just phenomenal. It's why I keep coming back. - [Client] I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia about a year and a half ago, and I started seeing Jen at that point for chronic pain, mostly in my back, also stress levels and anxiety she treats me for. And we've recently dove into facial acupuncture, so that is also something that she treats me for, just for the fine lines and wrinkles along the forehead and around the mouth area. I have watched her methods work on me. She has done the moxi on my spleen channel. The smoke literally was traveling up my spleen channel all on its own to try and heal whatever issues were going on with my spleen at the time. - It doesn't hurt. I don't really feel anything. Once it burns down to a certain point, it does start to feel warm and I just let her know, and then she takes the moxa off. The difference in my toe is almost immediate. I'm able to bend it more, the pain's gone. I'm a big, I like to walk, so having arthritis in my toe is very, very painful, and it has prevented me from doing that a lot. (mellow piano music) - Kind of move the cups up and down the channel on the back. And the redness that shows up, shows that there was stagnation in this channel, which can lead to the pain and tightness in the back muscles. Cupping is another form of medicine that's been around for thousands of years. It's, the easiest way to explain it, is the opposite of massage. So massage was going to be pressing in, this is pulling up. So we use a glass cup and fire to create a vacuum, and it helps separate the skin, the muscles, and the fascia layers. So it increases circulation to that area, it can break up adhesions within the muscles. It's really great for tight muscles, it can have like a detoxing effect, just really increases circulation throughout the whole body. - There definitely is a time where modern medicine is an appropriate method, but for the most part, I try to keep everything natural and the way that it's supposed to be. - I think that people are focusing more on wellness and coming back into health. I think people are getting, they're ready for a change from more conventional medicine. I think that people are getting really good results from coming here and then they're going out and telling people how they're feeling from it. And it's getting more popular in mainstream media too, and I think that that's really helping bring people to this form of medicine. - For many North Country and Eastern Ontario residents, fall is the perfect time to visit the Adirondacks. Tonight, we take you through part of the Adirondack Mountains via the Adirondack Railroad, thanks to WPBS producer, Ryan Proven. (peppy music) (car horn honks) (gentle guitar music) - The Adirondack Mountains are the crown jewel of New York state. Beautiful wilderness, absolutely untouched or very nearly so. The people, the businesses up there are fantastic. I'm Larry Gerard, I'm an engineer and a conductor with the Adirondack Railroad. Been here for about 15 years. And I also do outreach for us, for various shows around the countryside. Adirondack Railroad is the revitalization of the old Adirondack Division, which ran all the way from Utica to Lake Placid, and now operates as a tourist line, bringing folks into the Adirondacks. I got started through an auction item. I purchased at the public television station, a couple of cab rides at Lake Placid, and that piqued my interest. That was in the fall of the year, and the following spring I went to a couple of classes and became a car host, and have worked my way up through to engineer since then. My favorite part of working on the railroad is the people. I meet a lot of people every time I run, and they enjoy the trip, they enjoy hearing the history. We do work with local businesses for some of our trips. Our wine and beer trains are very popular, and we work with local wineries and breweries to get local products out there so people can find out what's going on in central New York and that area. Might go up to the high peaks and climb peaks. There are lower peaks you can climb as well, plenty of hiking and biking, or just plain camping and picnicking. So the Adirondacks has it all. Our normal season for the railroad starts around Memorial Day and runs until mid-October, get everyone through the fall colors. In the year 2021, we are in the process of rebuilding the Adirondack Railroad all the way up to Tupper Lake. We'll be able to offer trips probably 2022, all the way from Utica to Tupper Lake. And that proves to be, that should prove to be a very popular, very popular trip. It's beautiful scenery up there, the Adirondacks at it's realist. - Finally tonight, a national musician who frequents the North Country, both solo and with other artists. She is Kay Miracle and she truly is a miracle. Her lyrics reflect truth, but it's her voice that really brings that truth to life. This is singer-songwriter Kay Miracle with her original tune called \"Rebel Gene.\" (drum roll) (cymbal crash) - I'm Kay Miracle, and I'm a singer-songwriter Americana. The first song I'm performing is called \"Rebel Gene,\" and it's a deeply personal song about my father and he served in the military and has Native American roots, but he wasn't much of a father. And later in life, I started writing with veterans and found a new understanding about my dad. And I felt like I needed to start working with veterans and getting their stories told through music. And so \"Rebel Gene\" is like a deeply personal song that actually drew veterans to me to write their story. So when I sit down with them, that's what we do is we, we write their own story, whatever they want to talk about. There's a line in there that says, \"There's two sides of life.\" My father wasn't around. He was very busy with his military career and also he was kind of a renegade. And my mother was the one that stayed at home and kept the family together. And so I was raised by someone that was a little bit devilish and the other side was my mother, who just stuck through it, and gave me a good foundation in regarding to home. So I think that that's something that they'll take away from it. And also it mentions my father's military career, and there's a line in there that says, \"He was baptized by the fire of shock and awe,\" because he came back different and it took a while for us to understand. And as, you know, people are becoming more aware of PTSD and the things that our military goes through that brings trauma, I decided I wanted to use music to somehow heal. Hi, I'm Kay Miracle, and I'm going to perform my original song, \"Rebel Gene.\" I got Native roots and a gypsy soul My granddaddy's Bible with a bullet hole He was forced to wander from the lands The government stole I'm a child of a saint and a renegade One made a home while the other one strayed I honored my mother but broke every rule Dad made 'Cause I was born with a rebel gene No prayin' or scrubbin' could wash me clean There's two sides of life and I'm in between I was born with a rebel gene My mama married a naval air man Served in Korea then Vietnam Left his bride to die of thirst on the desert sand They made Dad a hero out of an outlaw Got a Silver Star to wear next to his bear claw His sins baptized by the fire of shock and awe 'Cause I was born with a rebel gene No prayin' or scrubbin' could wash me clean There's two sides of life and I'm in between I was born with a rebel gene Mama took her babies to higher ground Left a life of driftin' for a one-horse town I grew up with a picture of a man Who couldn't settle down I got Native roots and a gypsy soul My granddaddy's Bible with a bullet hole He was forced to wander At least that's the story Dad told 'Cause I was born with a rebel gene No prayin' or scrubbin' could wash me clean There's two sides of life and I'm in between I was born with a rebel gene There's two sides of life and I'm in between I was born with a rebel gene - That does it for us this Tuesday evening. Join us next week for a fresh look inside the stories. Folklore stories are common this time of year. But are the ones about Bigfoot and the Lyons Falls water monster true? We'll share local sightings. Also, walking to improve mental health. One Canadian author shares his reasons why taking in a hike can make all the difference. We'll have all these stories and more. Meantime, if you have a story idea you'd like to see us explore, or you're a poet or musician that would like to be featured, email us at wpbsweekly@wpbstv.org.
