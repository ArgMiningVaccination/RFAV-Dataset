Herbs that have been growing and healing people in some of the world's harshest environments since 6000 BC. Indian Ayurvedic, then Chinese and Greek practitioners, prescribed hundreds of plants for dozens of imbalances before the term adaptogen was coined in 1940 by a Soviet scientist who documented how these non-toxic plants adapt their function to the needs of the body. And that includes the needs of adrenal fatigue sufferers. When a gland is either overactive or underactive, adaptogenic herbs can help either downregulate or upregulate it back into balance. The ability of these \"intelligent\" plants to move bi-directionally with your body's needs without any toxic side effects has been studied for decades across the globe, as well as at RLC Labs. These botanical medicine healers are unique in that they increase resistance to stress, without disturbing normal biological functions. Whether you're seeking adrenal fatigue supplements or just trying to figure out how to stop feeling tired all the time, adaptogens are your most natural, non-invasive option. Your adrenal glands don't function in isolation - they work in conjunction with your hypothalamus and pituitary gland as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to regulate your stress response. So, when your HPA axis is out of whack, your brain and glands can't effectively send messages to one another and you can develop adrenal fatigue. Adaptogenic herbs mount an immediate hormonal response to your stress by1: a-Drenal combats the side effects of adrenal fatigue while promoting healthy function of the adrenal gland using premium, clinically validated herbs: Adrenal burnout has disrupted enough lives - don't let it disrupt yours when the adaptogen extracts in a-Drenal\u00ae can help rebalance your HPA axis naturally.
