Q:Is frozen yogurt as nutritious as regular yogurt? What happens to live cultures such as acidophilus when yogurt is frozen? A:Frozen yogurt is usually lower in fat than icecream, because yogurt is used in the place of cream. But compared to regular yogurt, frozen yogurt can behigher in sugar and calories. Frozen yogurts often contain lessprotein and calcium than their non-frozen counterparts. Thereis a wide variation between brands and flavors (50 calories ina half cup of Pinkberry's Green Tea frozen yogurt versus 160 calories in a half cup of Ben & Jerry's Cherry Garcia FroYo), so you'll have to check the label. Both yogurts and frozen yogurts can contain live active cultures. Manufacturers might add extra \"healthy\" bacteria(such as L. acidophilus , Bifidobacterium and others) for their health effects, but not all yogurts have these extraprobiotic bacteria. Although the flash-freezing techniqueused in the production of frozen yogurt, unlike slow freezingin a freezer, should not kill the live cultures, there is noguarantee that this won't occur. As a result, the number of bacteria in frozen yogurt is usually lower than that in the yogurt it was made from.However, different yogurts and frozen yogurts are madewith different types of live cultures and probiotics, and thelevels that remain in frozen yogurt depend on the numbers that were in the yogurt and on the heartiness of the specif-ic bacteria that was used. Some frozen yogurts may be bet-ter sources of probiotics than some regular yogurts. The National Yogurt Association sponsors a voluntary labeling program for frozen yogurt; look for the \"Live and ActiveCultures\" seal on containers of frozen yogurt. If the yogurtdoesn't have the label, contact the manufacturer and ask whattypes of bacteria their product contains and at what level. The National Yogurt Association standard for a live active culture frozen yogurt is 10 million cultures per gram at time ofmanufacture; for yogurt it is 100 million.

Preparing my presentation, I was struck by how much of the cutting-edge research on childhood obesity preventionhas involved our faculty. I was reminded once again of the Friedman School's strengthin linking science to application and policy. Ofcourse, no place is more associated with our nation's policies than Washington,D.C. That is where, thanks to the efforts ofOverseer Ed Sylvia Rowe, AndrewShao, N00, Rachel Cheatham, andKate Houston, N99, the school will be spon-soring a workshop in spring 2009 that willfocus on the next decade's nutrition chal-lenges. We expect key members of the newadministration and the new Congress toparticipate. Stay tuned for more details. The Dean's Medal is the highest honor bestowed by the Friedman School, and wewere honored to have three stellar awardeesat a ceremony on September 23: Dr. JoanBergstrom, Mr. Edward Budd and Dr. NevinScrimshaw. (See story, page 34.) Jo an's vision of expanding the Friedman School'simpact worldwide, Ed's efforts to make theschool and its endowment stronger, and Nevin's advancement of nutrition globallyare just a few of their many contributions for which we are grateful. Wishing all a happy Thanksgiving. eileen kennedyPut simply, nutrition proling is the rating or rankingof foods by how nutritious they are. Food companiesand retailers have developed a variety of front-of- package and store-shelf icons that are intended to help guide consumers to make healthier food choices. For example, the Trafc Light System that originated in the U.K. classies foods withgreen, yellow or red lights to suggest whether you should reach for a package, pro-ceed with caution or stop yourself from overindulging. \"Smart Spot\"check mark and Hannaford Supermarkets'\"Guiding Stars\" are two other rankings. However, there is now concern that the proliferation of different icons and scor- ing systems has led to consumer confusion. Rather than helping, the informationoverload is viewed by some as stymieing consumers in their food selection. In September, the Friedman School Symposium was host to a lively discus- sion of the effectiveness of various food-ratings systems, including two new, high-visibility systems that were presented at the symposium. The KeystoneCenter, a nonprofit that looks at environmental, energy and public health dilemmas, unveiled its Smart Choices program. Developed in consensus withmajor food companies, retailers, consumer groups and academics, its \"better foryou\" icon is a check mark combined with a calorie listing on the front of pack-age. Individual foods receive a check mark or not, based on agreed-upon nutri-tion criteria. Ifadopted by major food manufacturers, the system has the potential to reach millions of consumers. Similarly, Dr. Adam Drewnowski presented research from the Nutrient Rich Foods Coalition, a consortium of public- and private-sector organizations, which has used nutrient density as a way to rate foods. The NR system uses a tieredapproach to classify foods, rating them, in essence, from good to better to best. Aside from a rich conversation on the scientic underpinnings of both systems, there was serious debate about which approach is more likely to effectively reach the consumer. Whatever the verdict, public and private sector forces will likely continueto look for a simple, consistent way to alert consumers to healthier food choices, agoal that will probably receive increased attention during the creation of the 2010Dietary Guidelines, now under way. Also in September, I had the privilege of speaking to the Institute of Medicine's Standing Committee on Childhood Obesity Prevention.

Researchers found that women with the shortest arm spans were 50 percent more likely to develop dementia and Alzheimer's disease than women withlonger arm spans. At the same time, the longer a woman's leg from floor to knee, thelower her risk for dementia. In men, only a shorter arm span was linked to dementia,according to the study, which was published in Neurology . \"Body measures such as knee height and arm span are often used as biological indicators of early-life decits, such as a lack of nutrients,\" said Tina Huang, a scien-tist in the immunology lab at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts. Other studies have found a link between limb length and dementiain populations in Asia, and Huang wanted to see if the trend would hold true in a U.S.population as well. The researchers studied 2,798 people for an average of ve years and took knee- height and arm-span measurements. Most people in the study were white, with anaverage age of 72. By the end of the study, 480 had developed dementia. \"We foundthat shorter knee heights and arm spans were associated with an increase risk ofdementia,\" Huang and her colleagues concluded. itamin c is not the micronutrient most people turn to when they think about osteo-porosis. But according to a new study, a high intake of vitamin C may help reduce bone loss in elderly men. The study, which appeared in the Journal of Nutrition, evaluated the vitamin C intake and bone density of 213men and 393 women, average age 75 at the start, over afour-year period. The men who took in the most vitaminC\u2014which was more than three times the recommendeddaily allowance of 90 milligrams for men\u2014suffered fewer losses in their bone density. \"At one hip site, for example, men in the highest intake group, who took in 314 milligrams of vitamin C a day infood and supplements but had low calcium intake, did notlose bone density on average,\" said Professor Katherine L.Tucker, Ph.D., a senior scientist at the Jean Mayer USDAHuman Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts, \"whereas those in the lowest group, who took in 106 mil-ligrams, lost 5.6 percent of their bone.\"Why look at C and bones? Vitamin C is known to enhance calcium absorption, stimulate the cells that buildbone and produce collagen\u2014the brous protein part ofbone and cartilage. Its antioxidant properties may protectagainst inflammation, which can drive calcium away from bones. Tucker, the senior author of the study, said the vitamin C only protected against bone loss in non-smoking menwho had diets that were low in calcium or vitamin E. The study did not nd any signicant results in the women it followed. One reason for this, Tucker said, may bethat estrogen and calcium supplements, which many women take, can complicate vitamin C interactions. The effect was strongest in those men who got most of their vitamin C from food rather than supplements,\"suggesting that whatever positive effects of vitamin C weobserve may not be able to be separated from those of a good quality diet,\" the authors wrote. With that in mind,Tucker recommends that people get as much of their vitamin C as possible from fruits and vegetables. 4tufts nutrition fall 2008ARMS, LEGS AND MEMORY LOSSVA Boost for Bones Ha la carte RESEARCH IN BRIEF510010_005-pg4-5 11/13/08 9:02 AM Page 4esearchers have found a link between deciency of three B vitamins and impaired memory, providing new insight into the mech-anisms that may underlie age-related cognitive decline. Researchers at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA) at Tufts used mice toexamine the effects of B vitamin deciency on metabolic,cognitive and microvascular functions. Mice that were fed a diet decient in vitamins B6, B12 and folate (also known as B9) showed signicant short-comings in spatial learning and memory compared withnormal mice, according to Aron Troen, Ph.D., an assistantprofessor at the Friedman School. At the same time, the B-deprived mice showed \"reductions in brain capillary lengthand density,\" says Troen, a scientist at the HNRCA and thestudy's lead author. The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , helps dene more precisely the wor k- ings of cerebral microvascular disease, which can lead tovascular dementia, the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. The mice were fed special diets for 10 weeks. Researchers then tested their spatial learning and memory with a watermaze, measured their blood concentrations of B vitaminsand assessed their brain anatomy. \"It took longer, on average, for the B vitamin-deficient mice to maneuver the water maze, compared with thecontrols,\" Troen says. The slower mice had shorter cap-illaries, particularly in the brain region called the hip-pocampus. They also showed higher blood levels of homocysteine, a chemical that has been implicated in cognitive decline. The levels were \"comparable to the levels that are asso- ciated in older adults with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascu- lar disease,\" such as stroke and atherosclerosis, says Irwin H. Rosenberg, M.D., University Profes- sor and direct or of the Nutrition and Neu- rocognition Laboratory at the HNRCA.TAKE THE PILL? TAKE CARE Women who take birth control pills may be at risk for vitaminB6 deciency, according to astudy published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition . Martha Savaria Morris, Ph.D., anepidemiologist at the Jean MayerUSDA Human Nutrition ResearchCenter on at Tufts, foundthat three-quarters of womentaking oral contraceptives\u2014butnot supplements\u2014had low bloodlevels of the vitamin. Evenwomen who reported using oralcontraceptives but who were nolonger using them at the time ofthe survey came up short, with40 percent showing inadequatelevels of B6. \"This finding is troublesome women commonly contraception so theycan become pregnant,\" saysMorris, pointing out role in protein andfat metabolism, B6 is essentialto normal fetal development. \"My greatest concern would be for women entering pregnan-cy\u2014when not only the womanbut her fetus is depending onher vitamin B6 level.\" Although the pill takers stood out, many of the nearly8,000 men, women and childrensurveyed showed inadequateB6 status, even when theyreported consuming more thantheir recommended dailyallowance of the vitamin. Thiscould mean that for healthyimmune systems and normalbrain function people need totake in more B6 than oncethought, although more study isneeded.

If success- ful, Operation Chicken Run (as the project is affectionatelyknown) will not only improve the quality of the Iraqi dietbut also create jobs and promote inter-tribal cooperation,says McCoy. Poultry farming was once a major industry in Iraq, but like much of civilian life, it has been severely disrupted bythe war. The roots of the current problem go back even far-ther: Before the war, the industry was controlled by SaddamHussein's government, which supplied poultry farmers with chicks, feed, medication and fuel, and then took mostof the prots. \"Corruption was rampant, and farmers werevery dissatised with what they got,\" says McCoy. Farmershad no say in the pr ocess and little incentive to raise a qual- ity bird. Then, in 2003, with the fall of Hussein and the ensuing chaos, many poultry growers sold their farms. Most of today's Iraqi chicken farmers have little experiencerunning such an operation. Major McCoy's mission is to rebuild the poultry indus- try from scratch, as it were. \"We are teaching farmers howto raise a quality chicken\u2014and why they should,\" she says. A big reason they should is to help Iraq's economy.

McCoy's team believes Iraqi producers can achieve theeconomies of scale required to compete with these foreignimports by banding together. By forming co-ops, Iraqi farmers can bring down production costs by buying high- quality feed in bulk. Considering Iraq's unstable electricitysupply, which prevents farms from operating near capacity,domestic chicken and eggs will probably still cost more thanfrozen imports, but McCoy and her colleagues are urginglocal producers to cater to Iraqi tastes. \"There is a verystrong market for fresh, not frozen,poultry that has been raised withouthormones or other chemical addi-tives and slaughtered according tothe Muslim halal method,\" she says. That kind of thinking is typical for McCoy, who has made a career out of nding bett er ways to feed people. As an undergraduate, shespent a semester on a Kenyangame ranch devoted to the principle that wildmeat feeds people more efciently than cattle. Theidea stuck with her, and she's been traveling theworld looking for alternatives to cattle ever since.In Iraq, where the diet tends to be low in protein,producing poultry makes a lot of sense. McCoy isworking in the Land Between the Rivers, a fertilepatch of territory just south of Baghdad with good irrigation. Farmers there eschew cattle pro-duction, putting the land to better use raising high-value vegetables. But poultry farms would tright in, because they don't require much land. McCoy says she never expected to wind up in the military. \"Like most folks, I never even knewthe Army hired veterinarians,\" she says. But threemonths after responding to a bulk-mail recr uit- ment postcard, she reported for duty on Septem-ber 11, 2001. \"The military kind of changed on that day,\" she says. Since then, McCoy has workedin Egypt, Afghanistan and Iraq, spending a year in each.The military also sent her back to Tufts, where she obtained a master's in humanitarian assistance, a jointdegree offered by the Friedman School and the FletcherSchool (Tufts' graduate school of international affairs) and managed by the Feinstein International Center. In Iraq, McCoy works with \"bilingual bicultural advisers\"\u2014Iraqi-Americans, Iraqi-Canadians or Iraqi-Australians who have returned to their homeland to helprebuild it. The advisers help her reach the poultry farm-ers through their respective sheikhs. \"Since sheikhs havea blood relationship with their people, they are often more influenced by their people's needs than an outsider would be,\" says McCoy.She and her colleagues have established a co-op in Al- Mahmoudiy ah, the agricultural area south of Baghdad, with nearly 300 registered poultry farms. There, a slaughter plant owner, three feed mill owners and about100 growers have formed their own association. Co-op members represent 14 tribes and cross religious lines, so the business model is also \"a good tool for rec-onciliation,\" says McCoy, although \"the rst goal has to beraising chickens and selling them protably.\" This, shebelieves, will stimulate other industries, such as trucking, slaughterhouses and corn or sorghum production for chicken feed. Meanwhile, poultry waste\u2014called litter\u2014is an excellent organic fertilizer that could encouragefarming in other regions of the country. Though she's hopeful that Operation Chicken Run will help Iraqis feed their nation, McCoy is scheduled to leavethe country before the rst co-op chickens are hatched.What's next? Some kind of international development work for sure\u2014with the Army or otherwise, she says. \"Ther e are still plenty of hungry people out there.\" Jacqueline Mitchell, a senior health sciences writer in Tufts' Office of Publications, can be reached atjacqueline.mitchell@tufts.edu.\"W e are teaching farmers how to raise a quality chicken\u2014 and why they should.\" \u2014JESSICA MCCOY McCoy meets with a poultry farmer in the Land Between the Rivers.510010_006-pg6-7 11/13/08 9:14 AM Page 78tufts nutrition fall 2008In starring roles or cameos, cigarettes make frequent appearances in movies. What does it mean for the young people who watch? madeline dalton, ph.d., n88, n94, doesn 't consider movies the root of all evil. She and her twin 16-year-old sons can often be found in their Vermont home catching the latest Netflix arrival on their big-screen television. Theydevour everything from animated features to action thrillers. \"Especially up herein the winter, we enjoy watching a lot of movies,\" she says. So when Dalton, an epidemiologist, associate professor and director of the Hood Center for Chil-dren and Families at Dartmouth Medical School, set out some years ago to studyhow movies influence a child's chances of taking up smoking, she had no grudgewith Hollywood. She didn't know her research eventually would make pr oducers quake and force the movie industry to rethink its ratings system. Dalton started researching movies in 1996, when she and her colleagues at Dart- mouth were working on a project to help children design their own tobacco-pre-vention programs. Because some 90 percent of adult smokers start smoking byage 18, preventing children from trying cigarettes haslong been a public health goal. Talking to children at their schools, the researchers saw they were up against some powerful marketing. Back then it was still legal for cigarette companies to give out promotional items like hats and T-shirts, some of which parents passed on to their children. \"Y ou could see the Marlboro back-packs sitting in the back of a third-grade classroom,\" Dalton says. So she andBY JULIE FLAHERTY ILLUSTRATION BETSY HAYES510010_007-pg8-11 11/18/08 4:10 AM Page 2008 tufts nutrition 9510010_007-pg8-11 11/18/08 4:10 AM Page 9her colleagues started thinking about some of the other media that might influence children to start smoking. They noticed that one thingthe students talked about a lot\u2014and could recount with amazingdetail\u2014was all the movies they watched. No one had ever studied whether watching Gwyneth Paltrow light up in the Royal Tenenbaums could influence a youngster to do the same. \"Now I know why,\" Dalton says. \"It is a very hard thing tomeasure. Y ou can measure how many people smoke in movies\u2014although that's not easy either\u2014but to tie that to what kids arewatching and how strong their exposure is, that was really challeng-ing.\" Just designing the study took almost two years, as their group,which included a pediatrician (James Sargent, M84, as primary investigator), two social psychologists and a statistician, hammered outall the factors they would have to measure. W ith the researchers' var- ied backgrounds, \"it was really difcult to come to a consensus,\" Dal-ton says, \"but it made for great discussions.\" First they had to gure out what movies the teens and tweens (ages 9 to 15) were watching. Through focus groups with children and inter-views with video store owners, they narrowed their movie sample tobox ofce hits from the previous 10 years, plus a handful of others thatfeatured popular teen stars, for a total of roughly 600 lms. (Y es, mostgreat lms of yesteryear are lled with scenes of smoking, but you won't nd many 12-year-olds standing in line at Blockbuster with acopy ofCitizen Kane , so the classics were not included.) They then hired a pair of movie acionados to watch each lm and mark downevery time tobacco made an appearance. (\"The movie coders say it isa great job when it's a good movie,\" Dalton says. \"But when it's a bad movie with a lot of smoking, it's tough.\") This way, when they askedthe nearly 5,000 children they were surveying about their movie-watching histories, they could tally the total puffs and drags each hadseen on the screen. At the same time, the researchers had to control for all the known risk factors for taking up smoking. There were the obvious ones: age,gender, ethnicity and parents' education. Do their parents smoke?Their siblings? Their friends? How do they do in school? (The betterthe grades, the less likely the student will become a smoker.) They also looked at how closely the students' parents (in this case, they focused on the mothers) supervised them and how approachablethey were when their kids had concerns. Does your mom know what you do with your friends, they asked? Does she know where you are after school, or check to see that you do your homework? Does shewant to know about your problems? T o make sure they weren't comparing Sandra Dees to James Deans, they tried to get a feel for whether the children were sensation-seeking or rebellious. They also gauged self-esteem. When the researchers completed the study, they found a link between the movies the children watched and their smoking experi-ence that was so clear, even they were taken aback. All other thingsbeing equal, the children who saw the most smoking in movies weretwo and a half times more likely to have tried smoking than those whosaw the least amount of on-screen light ups. \"I don't think any of usexpected to see such a strong association,\" Dalton says. \"We looked at the rst analysis and said, 'Nobod y is going to believe that,' \" Dalton says. They crunched and re-crunched the numbers, butthe nding didn't go away. The results were published in the Britishmedical journal BMJ in 2001. They followed the children for two more years, and their next paper, published in The Lancet in 2003, revealed something that non-smoking parents were surprised to hear: It was their children whowere most susceptible to the movie influence. In that group, childrenwho saw the most on-screen smoking were four times more likely tolight up than the ones who saw the fewest cigarette scenes. \"I've talked to parents who said, 'Well, my kids watch the movies, but they are not going to be influenced by the smoking. We don'tsmoke, and they hate smoking,' \" Dalton says. \"As a parent of teenagers,I can tell you, you never know what might influence your children.\" AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER Smoking and the movies have a long, tangled history. Decades afterBette Davis and Paul Henreid fell in love over plumes of smoke in Now, Voyager , and long after the dangers of smoking came into focus in the '50s and '60s, cigarettes continued to have a starring role in lms. T obacco companies often paid to have their brands promoted onscreen. (See Superman II , where Philip Morris paid $42,000 for promi- nent placements of Marlboros, the brand name Lois Lane clearly prefers.) One company, R.J. Reynolds, sent monthly supplies of free cig- arettes to actors and directors. In 1983, Sylvester Stallone agreed to use Brown &Williamson tobacco products in ve of hislms in exchange for $500,000. T obacco companies, under pressure from the public, pledged voluntarily toend paid product placement in 1990,and it became ofcial in 1998 as part of the companies' master settlement agree-ment of lawsuits led by state attorneysgeneral over the health-care costs oftobacco-related illnesses. Even so, tobacco depictions in movies, which declined through the 1970s and1980s, actually increased after 1990, according to a 2002 report. (The authorsspeculated that Hollywood was still influ-enced by Big T obacco, although they could not prove it.) And the smoking isnot only in R-rated lms. Researchers at Madeline Dalton with her sons510010_007-pg8-11 11/13/08 9:22 AM Page 10Dartmouth found that the vast majority of on-screen smoking children see is in youth-rated movies, meaning G, PG and PG-13 lms. Armed with the research team's findings, which were reiterated in several studies, public health advocates and state attorneys gen-eral began to push the film industry to make smoking part of the criteria for an R rating, just as nudity, sex, violence, drug use and badlanguage are taken into account. In 2004, Dalton was called to tes-tify before a Senate hearing on the issue. \"From a researcher's perspective, I think it's important to understand what the risk factors are,\" she says. \"From a parenting standpoint, I justfelt like parents needed to know. Many parents were unaware of theimpact that movie smoking exposure could have on their children.\" Jack Valenti, then president of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), the movie industry's trade group, also spoke at theSenate hearing. Earlier he had revealed to Dalton that the MPAA had paid someone to go over her paper in The Lancet, looking for weaknesses, but could not nd any.\"Although he didn't agree with our conclusions,he admitted that the study was methodologically sound,\" she says. Curiously, Dalton found that most of the film directors she spoke with didn't parry her research with a freedom-of-expressionargument. \"Some had a more sympathetic view than many of the public,\" she says. \"I think that's because their movies are rated basedon all kinds of content that they decide to include. And they certainly are aware that movies impact kids. They are the rst to tell you thatit is a very powerful medium. The producers had a different take onit because they don't gross as much from an R-rated movie as froma PG-13.\" The movie industry is beginning to make some changes. In May 2007, the MPAA announced it would consider tobacco use as a factorin its lm ratings. In July of this year, six major movie studios said theywould place anti-smoking public service announcements on DVDs ofall movies with youth ratings that depict smoking. The industry could be under even more pressure with the recent release of a comprehen-sive report from the National Cancer Institute, a federal agency, whichconcluded that lms have a powerful effect on adolescent tobacco use. Still, many are reluctant to believe that letting little Jimmy kill time on a Sunday afternoon with Iron Man or Daredevil (two PG-13 lms that received \"black lung\" designations from SceneSmoking.org) wouldbe enough to get him to take up the habit. After all, when Elvis Presleyswiveled his hips, the rock-and-roll generation didn't turn to lives of debauchery, as some predicted. \"No, but a lot of people started dancinglike that,\" Dalton says. \"And that's the thing with the movies. How manypeople wanted to buy Mini Coopers after The Italian Job? Most of us are influenced in some way by what we see in movies.\" She continues: \"No one really has a problem talking about peer influences. If your friends smoke, you're more likely to smoke\u2014peo-ple take that as a given. The influence of movies is not that much dif-ferent. It's a social influence much the same as peers. It took us yearsto understand how peers influence children, and it will probably takeus years to gure out how movies influence children.\" There is still a lot to make sense of. In a paper for the journal Pre- ventive Medicine , Dalton points out that there is a limit to ho w well a researcher can convert \"the contextual richness and nuances ofmovies\" into survey data. She uses the example of a scene from Romeo & Juliet, where a pensive Leonardo DiCaprio smokes whilewriting in his diary. A researcher simply ticking it off as a smokinginstance on a data sheet \"would not capture the fact that smoking fol-lowed a scene in which Romeo's parents described his depression andalienation from them,\" something many adolescents can identify with, she writes, emphasizing that adults\u2014and scientists\u2014can't nec-essarily watch a lm the way a teenager does. \"Nor would it capturethe almost-sensual nature in which smoking was portrayed, which hasto do with lighting, sound and other factors that simply cannot becoded in a large sample of movies.\" Some people say it should be acceptable for villains to smoke in movies, sinc e it only underscores their wickedness. But Dalton points out that the characters that draw children in aren't always the oneswho wear white hats, and that it is too simplistic to characterize them as good versus bad. She laughs when she thinks of her own sons, whoas adolescents are drawn to the tough guys. \"When they are watchingThe Godfather, they want to be like members of the family, not the policewho are after them,\" she says. TN PHOTO: JOHN SHERMAN fall 2008 tufts nutrition 11 ALTHOUGH HER RECENT RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON SMOKING AND THE media, Madeline Dalton, Ph.D., N88, N94, has retained her interest in nutrition. Since 2005, she has been the principalinvestigator on a comprehensive study examining how environments influence a child's risk for obesity. Several studies have looked at whether children are healthier if they have playgrounds nearby or neighborhoodschools they can walk to. But Dalton's study, which looks atchildren in a variety of New England cities and towns, attemptsto cover more bases. In assessing schools, for example, herteam measures the food offerings in cafeterias, snack shacksand vending machines; the recreational facilities available; the cost of playing interscholastic sports and transportation to games and practices. In the cities and towns, they studyretail food outlets, convenience stores, fast-food restaurants, sidewalks and traffic patterns. In the home, they examine meal patterns, shopping habits, media use, parent physicalactivity and parent diet as an influence on kids. The goal is to account for all the potential confounders. \"We know that people who live in 'walkable' towns are morelikely to walk and exercise, but we don't know if they moved tothe town because it was walkable or if they walk just becausethey live in the town,\" Dalton says. \"More importantly, are kidswho walk home from school going to be at lower risk of beingoverweight? Or are they walking past a convenience store andgoing in to get something to eat?\" How environment and society influence behavior and public health are something of a theme of Dalton's career. As a doctoral student at Tufts, she went to rural Mexico toexamine how mothers' behavior and home environments influenced whether children thrived. She then studiedenvironmental risks for lead poisoning in children, both in the United States and Mexico. And of course, her research on movie exposure and adolescent smoking focuses onthe media environment. \"I've been able to study a range oftopics,\" Dalton says, \"because the methods for answeringeach of these are similar.\" ATTRACTIONS: RESEARCH ON nutrition fall 2008510010_008-pg12-17 11/13/08 9:38 AM Page 12Long known as calcium's sidekick, vitamin D is now gaining recognition for its powers beyond bones. If only more of us got enough of it BY HELENE RAGOVIN ILLUSTRATIONS BY NOAH WOODS510010_008-pg12-17 11/13/08 9:38 AM Page 13\"We've come to realize that there are a whole bunch of things other than bone that have to do with vitamin D, and that are clearly of great interest scientically,\" says Johanna Dwyer, D.Sc., the director of the Frances Stern Nutrition Center at Tufts Med-ical Center and a professor at the FriedmanSchool and the School of Medicine. \"I thinkthe argument people are having right now, inthe scientic world, is how good the evi- dence is for these other kinds of effects, andthe jury's still out on that. I would submitthat it's probably going to be out for another year or two.\" The research adds some urgency to a dis- cussion that has been going on amongresearchers, physicians and the govern- ment\u2014exactly how much vitamin D do peo-ple need? The current recommended dailyAdequate Intake is 200 international units (IU) for children and adults up to age 50, 400for those ages 51 to 70 and 600 for those over70. Those numbers were set in 1997 by theFood and Nutrition Board of the Institute ofMedicine\u2014the U.S. advisory agency that rec-ommends nutritional intakes\u2014and werebased on the amount of vitamin D then believed to be needed to maintain bonehealth. These are also the recommendationsused by Canada's national health agency. Butbased on newer research, many researchersare asking for an update. \"The recommended intakes are too low.Virtually everyone working in the eld believesthat,\" says Susan Harris, D.Sc., N87, a scientistin the Bone Metabolism Laboratory at theJean Mayer U.S.D.A. Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA) at Tuftsand an adjunct associate professor at theFriedman School. And, she says, e ven by current standards, far too many people in North America aren'tgetting enough. According to the third National Health and Nutrition ExaminationSurvey (NHANES III), at least 40 percent ofmen and 50 percent of women in the UnitedStates have lower-than-optimal blood levelsof vitamin D for at least part of the year. THE ABC SOF D Vitamin D's best-understood job is regulatingcalcium. It functions as a hormone, triggeringthe intestines to absorb calcium from foodand add it to the blood stream, where it canbe brought to organs and muscles thatrequire it to function, or to the bones for bone growth and repair. In addition to help-ing muscles, the brain, the nervous system,the pancreas and reproductive organs, vita-min D has also been shown to affect immune function and to reduce inflammation. Back in grade school, you mig ht have learned that vitamin D was the \"sunshinevitamin.\" Y our body makes it when ultravioletB (UVB) radiation from sunlight hits choles-terol compounds in the skin, converting themto vitamin D precursors. These precursors travel to the liver and kidneys, where they areconverted to the active form of vitamin D. The amount of vitamin D you synthesize depends not only on your sun exposure, buton the season (winter is less desirable thansummer), your skin color (darker tones absorb less UVB) and where you live (the far-ther from the equator, the less UVB is avail-able). In fact, Americans who live north of 42degrees latitude (including residents ofBoston, Milwaukee and Seattle) do not getenough D-making UVB from roughly mid-October to mid-March, regardless of how much time they spend outdoors. The sun comes in at such an angle that the necessary rays never hit the earth's surface. Unlike most other vitamins, adequate vitamin D is tough to acquire solely througha balanced diet, although it is naturally pres-ent in some fatty sh and sh liver oils, andin small quantities in beef, liver, cheese andegg yolks. In the U.S., most of the vitamin Dwe consume is in the form of fortied milk,cereal or juice. Historically, the result of severe D de- ciency was rickets, a childhood disease thatsoftens the bones\u2014its most obvious symp-tom is a tell-tale bowlegged stance. Once prevalent, rickets mostly disappeared in theU.S. in the 1930s, with the advent of D-for-tied milk. Occasionally, Dwyer says, health profes- sionals would see rickets surface in popula-tions that didn't consume milk, sh or otheranimal products, including the children of macrobiotic vegans in the 1970s. T o day, veg- ans can obtain adequate vitamin D throughfortied soy products and supplements. THE 'HOT VITAMIN' In adults, a severe lack of vitamin D can leadto osteomalacia, a painful condition of weak-ened bone and muscle. But even people whoare not D-decient, but simply have lower-than-ideal levels, may experience health con-sequences. \"We're no longer talking only about avoid- ing frank deciencies,\" Harris says. \"We're talking about maintaining optimum health,and reducing our risks in more subtle ways.\" For the past several decades, Bess Daw- son-Hughes, M.D., M75, the director of the 14 tufts nutrition fall 2008ver the years, vitamin d has been a loyal partner in the defense of bone health, the Robin to calcium's Batman. But recently, scientists have come to suspect that when it comes to treat- ing and preventing other diseases, they could one day be sending up the \"D\" signal. Researc hers of illnesses as varied as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis are investigating the potentially bene- cial role of vitamin D. While it's too early to draw any denitive conclusions, thevitamin that was once best known for building strong bones appears, from severalrecent studies, to be associated with overall health.510010_008-pg12-17 11/13/08 9:38 AM Page 14Bone Metabolism Laboratory at the HNRCA and a professor of medicine at Tufts, has been a leading gure in the study of osteo-porosis, a condition in which bones becomefragile and easily fracture. Her research hasshown that vitamin D insufciency can con-tribute to development of the disease. T oday, work to investigate the possible connections between low levels of vitamin Dand other conditions, such as heart disease,stroke, hypertension, cancer (of the colon, breast or prostate), Type 1 and Type 2 dia-betes, autoimmune diseases\u2014even gum dis-ease\u2014have made vitamin D research \"afast-moving eld and one of extreme inter-est,\" Dawson-Hughes says, although \"just what is involved with each of these, it's too early to tell.\" The intense research attention to vitamin D dates back about 30 years, when a pair of epi-demiologists hypothesized that lack of expo-sure to sunlight might explain w hy colon cancer rates were higher in northern statesthan in the South. \"We now know that there are receptors for vitamin D in almost all body tissues,\" Harris says. \"Those receptors would not be there ifthey didn't serve some purpose.\" Researchers are still not clear about the exact mechanisms that might make vitamin Dan effective cancer-ghter, or why it seems tobe associated with lower incidence of other diseases, but the quest to answer thosequestions has made it \"thehot vitamin nowadays,\" as cardiologist Thomas Wang,M.D., puts it. Wang and his colleagues\u2014including Fried-man School professors andHNRCA scientists Sarah Booth,Ph.D., and Paul Jacques, D.Sc.\u2014analyzed work from the famousFramingham Heart Study, and concluded that people with lowlevels of vitamin D were at increased risk ofdeveloping heart disease. These results heldeven for those who had few other cardiovas- cular risk factors, such as obesity or high blood pressure. \"That's obviously one of the intriguing questions,\" said Wang, an assistant professor ofmedicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.\"Why do some people who develop cardio-vascular disease do so inexplicably, in the absence of any obvious risk factors? Could vitamin D deciency be a novel risk factor?\" Wang stresses that the connection between vitamin D and heart disease is far from certain,and much more work is needed. \"It's easy tounderstand why there is this interest in vita-min D,\" he says. \"There is a longstanding interest in vitamins and any kind of disease;vitamins are very easy to take ... in cardiology,there have been other reported links betweenvitamin deciencies and heart disease, but they have been hard to prov e. \" CALL FOR MORE When it comes to heart health or cancerprevention, \"we don't have enough infor- mation yet to know what D level in theblood you need to achieve the maximumbenefit,\" Dawson-Hughes says. But her research and that of others has given plentyofdirection on D levels and bone health. \"We now have a reasonable estimate of theminimal amount needed for bones; less is known about the amount needed for theother areas,\" she says. And the ideal for bones, by most accounts, is a higher one than what is currently recom- mended. With that in mind, in an editorial in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in March 2007, 15 vitamin D experts from around the world, including Dawson-Hughes,criticized the \"perpetuation of outdated intakerecommendations.\" \"The balance of evidence leads to theconclusion that the public health is best served by a recommendation of higher daily intakesofvitamin D,\" the editorial said. \"Relatively simple and low-cost changes, such as increasedfood fortication or increasing the amount ofvitamin D in vitamin supplement products,may very well bring about rapid and impor-tant reductions in the morbidity associatedwith low vitamin D status.\" The editorial also questioned the current tolerable upper intake level (UL) for vitaminD\u2014the safe ceiling, so to speak, for how much of any nutrient should be consumed inone day. At present, it is 2,000 IU for adults.The researchers recommended a limit vetimes that, or 10,000 IU. The government is not unaware of the sit- uation. But for the sake of safety, before the federal government can recommend a changein any of the Daily Required Intakes (DRI), there is a years-long r eview process. \"The government is very much interested in the whole issue of vitamin D,\" says Dwyer,who, in addition to her work at Tufts, is alsoa senior scientist in the federal Office ofDietary Supplements (ODS), part of the National Institutes of Health. In August 2007, the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality completedan ODS-funded, evidence-based review ofthe literature on vitamin D and bone health.This year, it began a second review, exam-ining broader research on D. \"Those reviewsgenerally take about a year,\" Dwyer said. \"Idon't know where it will go, but I know fall 2008 tufts nutrition 15\"WE NOW KNOW THAT THERE ARE RECEPTORS FOR VITAMIN D IN ALMOST ALL BODY TISSUES,\" HARRIS SAYS. \"THOSE RECEPTORS WOULD NOT BE THERE IF THEY DIDN'T SERVE SOME PURPOSE.\"510010_008-pg12-17 11/18/08 4:12 AM Page 15CHILDREN AND D AT THE TURN OF THE LAST CENTURY, MANY OF THE CHILDREN WHO arrived at Boston's Floating Hospital for treatment of various ailments were also suffering from rickets, thebone-softening disease that results from a severe lack of vitamin D. Doctors in 1899 recorded these ndings in the Boston Medical Journal , the forerunner of The New England Journal of Medicine . As Johanna Dwyer, D.Sc., the director of the Frances Stern Nutrition Centerat Tufts Medical Center, tells it,even though the children likelyspent time outdoors, the coal-smoke haze that then coveredthe city prevented enough sun-light from getting through, andthey were not able to synthesizea healthy dose of vitamin D.Boston was not unique. It wasnot until several decades later, with the advent of vitamin D-for- tied milk and other advancesin nutrition, that rickets becamerare in the United States. But vitamin D deciency in children has not disappearedentirely. Studies, including arecent one done by researchers at Children's Hospital Boston,have found that significant numbers of children\u2014infantsthrough teens\u2014have extremely low levels of vitamin D. The Children's study, which appeared in the June 2008 issue of the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine , found that out of a group of 365 infants and toddlers broughtto the hospital for well-child exams, 40 percent had vitamin Dlevels below the optimum considered necessary for bonehealth, and 12 percent were frankly deficient; of those who were deficient, 32 percent had evidence of bone loss. Those showing the low vitamin D levels were likely to be exclusively breastfed infants who were not given vitamin D supplements and toddlers who were not drinkingenough milk. \"As a trained pediatrician and a pediatric endocrinologist, I'm a strong advocate of breastfeeding, and we're in no waytrying to deemphasize the importance of breastfeeding,\"says Catherine Gordon, M.D., lead author of the study. Butexclusive breastfeeding without vitamin D supplementationis a major risk factor for vitamin D deciency, she says. With this in mind, in October the American Academy of Pediatrics doubled its recommended intake of D for infants,children and adolescents, from 200 IU per day to 400, beginning in the rst few days of life. \"Breastfeeding is a healthy trend, but it's missing one factor\u2014vitamin D,\" Gordon says. For infants who are not exclusively breastfed, formulas are fortied with vitamin D; for older children, chewablemultivitamins usually contain400 IU. For breastfed infants,vitamin D is available in supplement drops, eitheralone or in combination withother vitamins. For toddlers and older children, another way to getvitamin D is through fortiedmilk, which contains about 100 IU per cup, or fortiedjuices. \"The only caveat about getting vitamin D exclusively through diet is that the labeling is not alwaysaccurate,\" Gordon says.\"Even if the label says it has a certain concentration, it may actually have only 50 percent of that when analyzed.\" While the previous recommendation of 200 IU was enough to prevent rickets, Gordon says, it was not enoughto get vitamin D levels to the optimal range. The new recommendation may still fall short. \"Many, myselfincluded, think the recommended intake should be higher,perhaps 800 to 1,000 IU a day,\" she Dawson-Hughes, M.D., M75, agrees. \"We don't know what the functional outcomes of vitamin D insufciencyin children are,\" says Dawson-Hughes, the director of theBone Metabolism Laboratory at the Jean Mayer USDAHuman Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts. Waitingto see how childhood vitamin D insufficiency affects bonemass in adulthood is not the best way to answer the question, she says. \"We need shorter-term endpoints tond out what dose might tufts nutrition fall 2008510010_008-pg12-17 11/13/08 9:39 AM Page 16fall 2008 tufts nutrition 17there is great interest in seeing a good, solid review done.\" In the meantime, Dawson-Hughes says an increased daily intake is especially vital formaintaining bone and muscle strength in theelderly. The current recommendation for those over age 70 \"is simply not enough,\" shesays. \"T o get to what appears to be a reasonablethreshold, the average older person needs 800to 1,000 IU\"\u2014at least 200 IU more than thecurrent recommended intake. Those ages 51 to70 would also benet from consuming 800 to1000 IU, she says, which is more than twice thecurrent recommendation. Even those age 50 and under would ben- et from consuming more than the recom-mended 200 IU, Dawson-Hughes says. \"There is no real documented danger inmodest increases in vitamin D,\" she says. \"Soif some want to hedge their bets, they might choose to step it up a little.\" However, Dawson-Hughes does not rec- ommend mega-supplements. \"I don't sup-port what some colleagues are recommending,which is extremely high doses for big seg-ments of the population, in the absence of more safety data,\" she says. THOSE AT RISK Based on the results from NHANES, low vitamin D levels are more prevalent amongwomen, Hispanics, African Americans andpeople age 65 and older. People with a highBody Mass Index (BMI) also tend to havelower levels, as body fat can \"trap\" vitaminD.Homebound or institutionalized peo- ple, and others who spend great amounts oftime indoors, also tend to have vitamin Ddeficiency. It's not surprising that African Americans and dark-skinned Hispanics would have lowervitamin D levels, since skin with more pig-mentation is less able to synthesize vitamin D . But studies have also shown that AfricanAmericans are less likely to eat foods fortiedwith vitamin D. One reason may be a higherlevel of lactose intolerance among African Americans, which in turn leads to lower con-sumption of milk and dairy products. \"African Americans have a lower blood level on average\u2014we saw that very clearly inNHANES,\" Harris says. Even most young, healthy African Americans don't show optimallevels of vitamin D, regardless of where in the country they live, or the time of year. But what hasn't been shown as clearly, Har- ris adds, is how this affects health outcomes,because even though African Americans havelower vitamin D levels than Caucasians, theyalso have lower rates of osteoporosis. The underlying physiological reasons for this arenot well understood, and are most likely con-nected to factors other than vitamin D status. \"There was less interest in vitamin D nutri- tion in African Americans than there could have been,\" Harris says, because for a long time, it wasn't seen as having a strong negative impact. \"Now that we're seeing the connec-tions to diabetes, heart disease and cancer, are the low D levels increasing their risk forother conditions? We really don't know yet.\" With that in mind, Harris has begun work on a three-year study of vitamin D, glucose control and insulin sensitivity in AfricanAmericans; the research is funded by a $455,000 grant from the American DiabetesAssociation. The study will look at whethergiving African Americans vitamin D supple-ments for three months will improve theirmarkers for diabetes risk. The African-Amer-ican population has a higher incidence of dia-betes than Caucasians; among people over age 65, the death rate from diabetes is nearly twice as high. LET THE SUN SHINE? In general, researchers recommend meetingincreased needs for vitamin D through sup-plements\u2014unfamiliar words in the nutritioncommunity, where experts usually prefer nutrient-rich foods to pills. But, quite simply,it's almost impossible for most people to eatthe volume of vitamin D-rich foods\u2014whethernatural or fortied\u2014to meet their needs. \"It's not now,\" Daw- son-Hughes says. \"Foods are fortied at fairlylow levels, and there is not a lot of vitamin D,as far as we know, in the natural food supply.\" Vitamin D is included in most mul- tivitamins, and also in combinationwith calcium supplements;in fact, one of the major vitamin manufacturersrecently doubledthe amount ofvitaminD it puts in its \"women's formula\" multivita- min, from 400 to 800 IUs. Which raises a thorny question: What about sunlight? Some researchers say 10 min-utes of sun exposure to the face and arms atmidday, depending on season and location,could be enough to guarantee the body willmake enough D. At the same time, people are cautioned to mind the risks of skin cancer. There's no sureformula for figuring out how much sun exposure might be adequate, but not dan-gerous, on an individual basis. The 2007 Agency for Healthcare Research and Qualityreview of vitamin D and bone health states:\"We did not find any systematic reviewsthat addressed the question on the level ofsunlight exposure that is sufcient to main-tain [vitamin mini-mizes risk and non-melanomaskin cancer.\" The American Academy of Dermatology is emphatic in its advice that people avoidunprotected sun exposure and get their vita- min D from food and supplements, noting that ultraviolet radiation is responsible formore than 1 million skin cancers each year inthe United States. Perhaps fearing that peoplewill shun their sunscreen or take to a tanningbed in an effort to get their D, the academynotes that sunscreens are not perfect, and thateven those who wear sunscreen will likelyabsorb some UV rays and produce some vita-min D. On a sunny June day, it could take afair-skinned individual wearing a typical coat-ing of SPF 15 as little as 20 minutes to get herll of vitamin D. That said, in northern-most and southern- most latitudes, \"you're still left with almost halfthe year\" when sunlight won't do the job, saysDawson-Hughes. While the body can store vitamin D made during the summer for sev-eral months, it's unlikely t o be enough to see most people through the winter, Harris says.That process worked much better for prehis- toric humans, who spent much more time outside\u2014and usually died of other causes long before skin cancer could claim them, she says.

Her grandmother had died of a brain aneurysm at age 43. Her mother, aunts and sister had all had at least one miscarriage. Births were always premature, often dangerously so. No one asked why, Landry noticed. That's just how it was. In fact, her family's experience isn't unusual. Forty percent of black Americans suffer from hypertension, a condition that can lead to more severe health problems, especially if untreated. Consequently, African Americans suffer heartattacks, strokes, kidney failure, vision problems, poor birth outcomes and premature death in farhigher numbers than any other racial or ethnic group. According to the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention, an American has a 30 percent greater chance of dying from heart disease\u2014alreadythe nation's leading cause of death\u2014if he or she is black.BY CLAIRE VAIL PHOTOS BY MELODY KO fall 2008 tufts nutrition 19510010_009-pg18-22 11/13/08 9:39 AM Page 19hile researchers have been aware of the race-related disparity in heart disease gures for decades, isolat- ing the cause is a politically sensitive and sci- entically complex task. Investigators must round up all the usual suspects\u2014genetics,diet, economics, culture, plus social factors such as racism\u2014and take a hard look at howthey interact and influence one another. It isprecise and painstaking work, but Landry welcomes the challenge. At age 27, with a nearly completed Ph.D. in nutritional epi- demiology from the Friedman School andthe rst year of Tufts Medical School under her belt, she is involved in new research thatmay reveal why African Americans are moreprone to heart disease than other Americans. For the last four years, her thesis has required her to shuttle back and forth from the laboratory in Boston's bustling China- tow n neighborhood to a converted strip-mall in Jackson, Miss., where she has joined the staff of the Jackson Heart Study, the largest-ever single-site investigation of cardiovasculardisease in African Americans. Since 2000, the Jackson Heart Study has established a cohort of 5,302 black residents from three nearby counties where rates ofheart disease are among the highest in thecountry. A staff of prominent doctors, nursesand students, including Landry, have spentseveral years gathering and analyzinggenetic, nutritional and general lifestyle datafrom these study participants in an attemptto identify the many risk factors for thisparticular population. Landry's specic research examines the interactions between genes and nutrients anda variety of fatty acids, from \"good\" mono-unsaturated fats like the kind found in olive oilto \"bad\" trans-fats once common in mar- garine and vegetable shortening and nowbanned from man y restaurant menus. \"We've found that depending on what genetic inheritance you have, fatty acids havea different impact on your health,\" Landry explains. \"So, you might be more likely to getcardiovascular disease if you have some genetic traits rather than others. Some drugsmight work on you, and some may not.\" Once the study is further along, there is a possibility that her results may be used tobuild a nutritional intervention, a strategicplan aimed at a particular group to reducethat group's harmful eating habits. While such a plan might begin in Jackson, Miss.,where heart disease is rampant, Landry hopes the study eventually will demonstratehow any African American might be able toprevent the onset of heart disease by fol- lowing a particular diet. FOOD, FAITH AND FAMILY Landry, a bubbly, resourceful woman withan easy laugh, has been we lcomed by her fel- low researchers in Jackson as one of their own. Though she was born and raised in suburban Maryland, visits to her grand- mother in Alabama steeped her in the cul-ture of the deep South, especially the strongties to food, faith and family. She feels at home here, and it shows. \"I was always attracted to the idea of fol- lowing rules,\" she says with a smile. \"Even as avery young child, I took rules very seriously.\"She made sure, for example, that her familywent to church on a regular basis. She alsodecided that her family should observe thenutritional guidelines laid out in the USDA 'sfood pyramid. She used it to supervise familymealtimes, banishing cake and cookies. Herparents coined a half-joking nickname forher: the Food Police. As a pre-med major at Tufts, Landry enrolled in a gr aduate class in primary care at the Friedman School. The class taught nutri-tion students the basic clinical knowledgeneeded to deal with famine and HIV inrefugee camps and international crisis situa-tions. Landry was fascinated by how many health problems could be prevented withproper nutrition. In 2002, she was accepted tothe Friedman School's Food Policy andApplied Nutrition master's program, special-izing in nutritional intervention. Landry had always assumed a genetic risk factor predisposed people in her family todevelop high blood pressure. Her sister, Cherita, had been diagnosed with hyperten-sion in her 20s, an unusually young age. Once they had the condition, they were advised by doctors to cut out salt and fat. ButLandry, who maintained a fairly strict diet,had not yet had any health issues. Was it possible some combination of bad genes and the w rong food was the smoking gun? Could the right food prevent the onset of the diseasealtogether? \"I knew I had to become a doctor to understand the medicine, but I also wanted tocontinue with research in the nutritional eld,\"says Landry, who sought academic counsel from University Professor Irwin Rosenberg,M.D., who was then dean of the Friedman School. Though Tufts offered no formal pro-gram that coupled a Ph.D. at the FriedmanSchool with an M.D. at Tufts Medical School,he encouraged her to see if it could be done.Landry convinced deans at both schools thatif anyone could meet such an ambitious goal,she could. \"That's one of the remarkable things about Tufts. If you have a good idea, they'll help youmake it happen,\" says Landry. Professor Katherine Tucker, Ph.D., Landry's thesis advisor and a senior scientist at the Jean Ma yer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, saw that Landry's talents extended beyond laboratory research andintroduced her to the Jackson Heart Study. A week before her med school board exams, she got an urgent call from her mother.Cherita, then 25 weeks pregnant, was beingprepped for an emergency C-section aftertests revealed her fetus had stopped growing. w510010_009-pg18-22 11/13/08 9:39 AM Page 20Landry knew her sister's hypertension was to blame. Only weeks before her sister's blood pressure had spiked at a stroke-level high of 220 over 100\u2014most probably the point at which the placenta began to decline. At birth, her niece weighed just 13 ounces, less than three sticks of butter. After months of intensive care, the baby began to thrive, but Landry was shaken. Her family had been through tremendous strain. Medical research had to offer something better. HEART OF THE PROBLEM Nearly everything that is known about heart disease and what causes it\u2014high blood pres-sure, high blood cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes and physical inactivity\u2014comes from a landmark experiment begun in Framing- ham, Mass., in 1948. The Framingham Heart Study, which surveyed three generations of Y ankee stock, is considered one of the most successful clinical inquiries of all time.Fewer than 10 blacks took part, but researchers claimed that the study's r esults applied to everyone, regardless of race. While the known risk factors may apply across theboard, curiously higher levels of heart disease for blacks, especially Southerners, suggest the portrait is more complex. \"The question that arose in any academic conference, in any cardiologists meeting, was always, do the results in Framingham apply to non-Caucasian Americans? Are there unique aspects for African Americans, particularly in the South?\" says Herman A. Taylor, M.D., head of the Jackson Heart Study.He and his fellow researchers are the rst to focus on the complex interplay of nutritional, genetic and socio-economic factors in a size- able African-American population. Struc- turally, the Jackson Heart Study is similar to the Framingham one. But the Jackson study also monitors social stresses that may be unique in their degree and effect on the black, southern population, including perceived dis- crimination, cultural differences such as reli- gious faith or regional factors like high unemployment rates.

For example, a person who is likely to develop heart disease is also likely to have multiple risk factors\u2014he might not onlysuffer from high blood pressure, but be over-weight, a smoker or diabetic. In African Amer- icans, however, the prevalence of multiple risk factors is extraordinarily high, and the fac-tors themselves are slightly different fromthose seen in the white population. While whites at risk for cardiovascular disease typi-cally have high triglyceride levels, African Americans tend to have a combination of truncal obesity, hypertension and low HDL,the \"good\" cholesterol. \"That's surprising in some ways,\" Taylor says. \"Historically, it's been thought that if there's anything good about the risk prole forAfrican Americans, it's that they have high HDL levels, and that protects them from hav-ing even more cardiovascular disease than they might otherwise have had. And there's old data to suggest that's true\u2014that high levels ofHDL were common in African Americansand therefore they were protected againstheart disease. In the Jackson Heart Study, wehave found that's not the case.\" A MATTER OF TRUST In 2007, Landry called several of the study par-ticipants for a follow-up visit. One of the mendeclined to return. He claimed that taking part was too expensive. But it's free, she told him.\"He said, 'No, you all referred me to a doc- tor, and now I've got to take medicine,'\" saysLandry. \"That was his perception\u2014that therewas an associated cost with the study. But ofcourse, it's our responsibility as medical peo-ple to refer someone if we nd they have a condition that requires treatment.\" Clinical trials that focus on African-Amer- ican populations, particularly in the South, have a burden of responsibility to bear ever since Alabama's infamous Tuskegee SyphilisStudy, which, between 1932 and 1972, led almost 400 poor, black sharecroppers infectedwith the disease to believe they were beingtreated, when in fact they were not. Whether Tuskegee's legacy has perma- nently affected African-American trust of themedical community is a matter of debate. A2008 study by Johns Hopkins suggested thatblacks are willing to participate in trials, butare more fearful than whites that they'll betreated as guinea pigs. Donna Antoine-Lavigne, Ph.D., coordina- tor for the Jackson study's community out-reach and partnership ofce, agrees there issome distrust, and emphasizes the impor- tance of a tight bond between the public andthe study's administration. \"It's not that black people don't want to be involved in clinical trials,\" she says, \"but certainconditions have to be in place.\" The Jackson Heart Study has been careful to meet those conditions, drawing in com- munity support and participation from thevery beginning. Each of the study's commit-tees includes two local residents, who help guide how the data will be used to benet thestudy participants and the wider public. Vol-unteers suggest and carry out public pro-grams such as weight loss initiatives andcooking demonstrations. \"Trust, truth and honesty,\" were the study's watchwords, according to Francis Hender- son, the study's deputy director. Most partic-ipants wanted to be informed immediately ifthey had a medical condition. \"They wanted black doctors and researchers. It was important that the peopleon the staff look like them. Most importantly,though, they wanted to know they would belistened to.\" WITH GRACE AND GUSTO The Kentucky-born mystery writer Sue Grafton once said that as a Southern woman, she was taught two things: \"Never call atten-tion to yourself, and never make anybody uncomfortable.\" It's excellent advice for an aspiring physi-cian who wants to get the most out of the patient-doctor experience, and Landry fol- lows it to the letter. Her voice is one of her greatest assets. Experience and travel abroadand in the U.S. has helped her cultivate an accent that she alters to suit the company andsituation\u2014anything from a brisk Boston clipto a leisurely Alabama stroll. In an interview with one of the Jackson Heart Study participants, Landry senses thewoman's slight reluctance to open up abouther eating habits. With a bit of conversationabout the weather and local restaurants, and apolite sprinkling of \"yes, ma'ams\" and \"no, ma'ams,\" Landry easily establishes a common language of g r aciousness. In short order, her subject is smiling and talking about buffetdinners, barbecued chicken and her ongoing struggle with weight loss, which she knows is important if she wants to stayhealthy. Her clinical experiences in Jackson and abroad have taught her, Landry explains, that you have to listen to peo-ple if you're going to discover how to treat them. Doctors need to under- stand that circumstances might be dif-ferent for some patients, and maybe if they asked a few more questions, they wouldget at something essential. \"An African American from the South might use different words than a Northernerto describe an illness,\" she says. \"In some partsof the South, people still refer to diabetes as\"the sugar.\" As in 'I've got a touch of the sugar.' Y ou have to be sensitive to these things.\" Taylor and the others on staff at the Jack- son Heart study value her delicate touch asmuch as her research. \"Latrice is such a sweet,gracious individual that you are sometimestaken aback by how brilliant she is,\" he says.\"Her work is outstanding, and really poises herfor a position of leadership in the eld. If I had10 more like her, I could retire.\" But Landry says it is simple stubbornness.\"Y ou remember Ashley's wife, Melanie, in Gone with the Wind? \"she says, laughing. \"When I was young, I wanted to be just likeher, because she was so sweet and unselshand gracious with everyone. But I realized Ihad a lot more in common with Scarlett.When someone tells me I can't do something,I become twice as determined to do it.\" TN Claire Vail is a senior web content specialist atTufts Medical School.\"When I became a graduate student I realizedthere wasn't enough data on African Americans and health disparities.

Are we prepared for 2030? BY PATRICK WEBB HAITI 96ZAMBIA 275INDIA 474CHINA 690RUSSIA 1,180FRANCE 2,573 USA 2,888Pounds of person in 2004 PHOTOS BY VITO ALUIAStocking theWo r l d 'sCupboard510010_010-pg23-25 11/18/08 4:17 AM Page 23Several factors conspired to push up prices, including rising fuel and fertilizer costs, back-to-back droughts for food exporterslike Australia and farms that devoted their acreage to growingcurrently lucrative biofuel crops rather than food. But ironically, a key reason for the price hikes was not a gen- eralized global shortage of food; it was the relative success ofhistorically famine-prone countries in growing more foodand reducing poverty. Places like India, China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Brazil and Nigeria all saw their agricultural sectorsimprove between 1970 and 2000, thanks to a string of tech- nological advances and agricultural reforms collectively knownas the Green Revolution. Improved seeds, fertilizers and pes-ticides; better irrigation technologies; access to credit; invest- ment in farmer education and local markets; and an openingup to the global economy all played a role in their agriculturalsuccess. This contributed to an economic prosperity that lifted many millions of people out of poverty. A new middle class began to buy more meat, fats, sugar and higher-quality cerealgrains, much of which needed to be imported. And when demand goes up, so do prices. This should not take away from the success of the Green Revolution, which was nothing short of a remarkable momentin human history. The share of undernourished people in theworld fell by about half between the early 1970s and the mid- to late-1990s, not coincidentally because more cerealswere produced each year in the last quarter of the 20th centurythan at any other recorded time in history. But the current cri-sis serves as a warning and a reminder that our war withhunger is not over. T o avert greater food pressures down the road, we will have to learn some lessons from the previous 50years of agriculture. KEEPING UP WITH THE NEED As prosperity and population growth converge to increase our demand for food, we will need to grow a lot more of it\u2014an addi-tional billion tons of cereals by 2030, according to some UnitedNations estimates. Developing countries in particular will needto step up their output. By 2030, developing countries are expected to produce only 86 percent of their own cereal con-sumption, with net imports rising from 103 million tons in 2000to some 265 million tons. Given the damage already done byglobal price shocks, and the potential impact of higher fuel andtransportation costs, a dependence on imported food could carrya high price tag. T o keep their imports to manageable levels,developing countries will have to invest much more in their ownagriculture. Given constraints to expansion and concerns for pro-tection of fragile natural resources, almost 70 percent ofthe increase in crop production in developing countries will need tocome from higher yields, as opposed to farming more land. Unfortunately, it is unclear if the world has yet made the appropriate investments to meet future demands. For years, too many international donors and developing country gov- ernments have largely ignored agriculture. The share of overseas development assistance (ODA) that went to agri-culture fell from around 15 percent in 1980 to less than 4 per-cent in 2005. The allocation to Asia fell from more than $4billion in 1980 to $1.5 billion in 2004, roughly the same levelobtained by Africa, which received more than $3 billion in thelate 1980s. This lack of external funding was influenced by the long-term downward trend in prices and by signals fromsome donors (not all) that African governments should not waste t o o much time trying to generate national income growth from agriculture. Last year, the World Bank wrote that the importance of agriculture to most growing economies \"will shrink to bou-tique niches,\" such that just a few resource-rich regions andcountries will, in the future, supply more than 50 percent of the world's grain. Needless to say, most donors still do notbelieve that Africa will be one of those regions. As a result, the capacity of Zambia's Ministry of Agriculture, for example, toprovide help to small farmers has seriously eroded. Zambiahas devoted roughly 6 percent of its annual budget to the agricultural sector in recent years, but of this, less than 4 per-cent was allocated to agricultural researchers and extensionagents, while 75 percent went to salaries for Ministry of Agriculture administrators. True, it has proven to be a major challenge to introduce into Africa the package of products and practices that worked well elsewhere. The continent generally has a low populationdensity, a lack of irrigation, poorly connected markets, under-funded local agricultural research and farmer educa-tion systems, and a tradition of growing crops other than cereals (such as cassava and beans) that have not lent them-selves to major yield gains. As a result, while East Asia, South 24 tufts nutrition fall 2008or the billions of people around the world who earn less than $2 a day and spend more than half of it on food, it has been an especially rough year. In a single dayin early March, the price of wheat on the global market leapt a staggering 25 percent.In April, the price of rice soared 50 percent in just two weeks. This was on top of globalfood prices that had already doubled or tripled over the past couple of years. In dozens of countries from Bangladesh to Haiti, people rioted over the soaring costs of basicfoods as many were threatened by the specter of hunger.510010_010-pg23-25 11/13/08 9:50 AM Page 24Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean all saw their crop yields grow in recent years, yields in the North Africa/Near East region remained largely unchanged, and sub-Saharan Africa trailed far behind. Per-capita production of all staplefoods (grains combined with soy and vegetables) was stilllower in Africa in the late 1980s than it had been in the 1960s.In the early 2000s, less than 4 percent of sub-Saharan Africa'sarable land was irrigated, compared with an average of 26 percent for all developing countries and more than 40 percentfor South Asia. At the same time, Africa is the only continentthat has seen child malnutrition rise in the past decade.This does not mean that gains cannot be made in Africa.Rather, we may need different approaches to achieve the productivity enhancements that were seen in the rest of theworld. QUANTITY VS. QUALITY Even if the world increases its yields of the most commonlyconsumed grains (like wheat and rice), a focus on growth incereal yields has implications for the net nutritional qualityof diets. At the dawn of the Green Revolution in 1966, the sci-entist Roger Revelle pointed out that \"cereal productiontends to be emphasized at the expense of other crops in theunderdeveloped countries, because it is a relatively efficientway of producing food energy for human consumption. \" Hewarned that large-scale increases in cereal yields were coming \"atthe expense of animal and vegetable protein and 'protective' foods, such as fruits and vegetables.\" Some say that the new focus on wheat in countries like Pakistan and India has led toa long-term decline in the cultivation of higher-protein cropslike peas, beans and lentils. That trend has been blamed forcontributing to the high price of legumes in the 2000s and a decline in their consumption. Others argue that because theagricultural sector is boosting the economy, people are earningmore, which should enable villagers to buy better-quality foods. But protein consumption has been declining in rural India, andmany people seem to be eating fewer calories, dropping from adaily intake of just under 2,300 calories per person in the early1970s to under 2,100 in 2004-05. Productivity has also taken a toll on natural resources. Many problems have been pointed to over the years, includingloss of biodiversity due to heavy pesticide and herbicide use; water pollution from fertilizer residue in irrigation drainage;exposure to pests or diseases due to increased mono-cropping; and more recently, output decline as soils taxed by intensive crop- ping over several decades are becoming depleted of nutrients andorganic matter. For example, some argue that int ensive irrigation of rice in India and Pakistan led to zinc and iron deciency in the soil, which could have played a part in arecent slowdown in yields. All these lessons emphasize the need for more investment in the agriculturesector\u2014but in many places in ways dif-ferent from the past. We need to con-tinue agronomic research that raisesproductivity, but also focus on plants that can x nitrogen in the soil (partic-ularly legumes, but perhaps also cereals)to bypass some of the rising costs and potentially deleterious effects of exces-sive fertilizer applications. We have to invest in nutrient-density traits and drought resistance, notonly yield maximization. We should also give renewed atten-tion to minimizing losses (both before and after harvesting),such that the burden of feeding more people does not rest solely on the plants themselv es. We need to invest in education, clean water supplies and access to health care that together withfood can support not just higher consumption but betternutrition and health. The caveats that apply to the agronomic revolution of the 1960s take away none of its achievements. Our challenge todayis to recreate those achievements in sustainable ways, with fewerenvironmental\u2014and socially painful\u2014side effects.

In the cover story of the September 22 issue of Time magazine, \"21 Ways to Serve America,\" Tufts President Lawrence S.

He argued that to \"address this nation's major challenges, we need people across the political spectrum to serve in government, to run forofce and to work to build stronger, more vibrant communities.\" Bacow outlined the efforts Tufts has made to encourage its gradu- ates to pursue careers in the nonprot or public sectors, focusing onthe Loan Repayment Assistance Program, believed to be the rst univer- sity-wide program of its kind in the country. The program, called LRAP,received more than 400 applications for assistance this year. \"Helping young people pursue their passion for service is one of the best investments our society can make,\" Bacow wrote.TIME TO SERVE fall 2008 tufts nutrition 27 510010_011-pg26-27 11/13/08 9:56 AM Page 27\"DSHEA casts this huge umbrella over what is dened as a dietary supplement,\" said Paula Gardiner, M.D., an assistant pro- fessor in the family medicine department atBoston Medical Center. T eas, tinctures, cap- sules, shakes, drinks, concentrates, metabolites and extracts are just some of the many forms of supplements. It's a huge industry. In 1990, only 2 percent of people reported using herbal medicines. In 2002, 19 percent did. According to DSHEA, such remedies are characterized not by their contents, but by their intentions. While supplements cannot claim to treat or prevent diseases, they can make general wellness statements that imply health benets. \"Y ou use calcium to improve bone health, it's a dietary supplement. Y ou use cal- cium to treat osteoporosis, it's a drug for that patient,\" said Jonathan Berman, M.D., Ph.D ., director of clinical and regulatory affairs for the National Center for Complemen-tary & Alternative Medicine at the NationalInstitutes of Health. Joseph Pizzorno, N.D., founding presi- dent of Bastyr University, is a longtime sup- porter of the strategic use of foods, herbs and vitamins to influence health. He acknowledged that botanical remedies arenot studied as thoroughly as pharmaceuticaldrugs. This \"lower standard of evidence\" is appropriate, he said, when nutrients have low toxicity and are used in areas wheresafer alternatives are not available. \"We don't have to spend $300 million proving that when a person needs morevitamin C that you give them more vitaminC,\" he said. At the biochemical level, roots, herbs and some common foods have some of the same properties as familiar pharmaceuti-he question has plagued sniffly consumers in drug store aisles across the nation. So once and for all: Is echinacea an effec- tive vanquisher of the common cold, or just the mother of all sup- plement scams? Getting to the answer reveals some of the complexities, even frustrations, inherent in alternative nutrition research. Wendy Weber, a naturo- pathic doctor and a research associate professor of natural health sciences at Bastyr University in Kenmore, Wash., has run into many challenges while studying this well-publicized plant. One confounder is that there are three dif- ferent echinacea species that are used medicinally, with each featuring a number of chemicals that could have benecial properties. And which part of the plant works the most alleged magic? Is it the dried roots or fresh stems? L eaves or flow- ers? Some people drink it as tea; some swallow pills. \"With echinacea we don't know exactly what to focus on\" in clinical research, Weber said. Weber was one of four experts who spoke at the 2008 Gershoff Symposium, which this year highlighted complementary and alternative nutrition. Nutrition researchers, they said, should be aware of the eld's potential and its drawbacks, espe- cially in light of 1994's Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA).

He used the examples of green tea, licorice root, ginger, onion and willow bark, which are all used by naturopathic physicians to reduce inflammation. Like drugs, these foods can chemically interfere with the enzymes involved in inflammation, such as Cox-2. \"Most drugs are enzyme poi-sons.\" Botanicals, on the other hand, he said, are able to more gently \"tune down the enzyme\" without eliminating it altogether. One drawback of DSHEA is that supple- ments are largely unregulated by federalagencies. As a result, \"what's on the label's not always what's in the bottle,\" said Gardiner. Products often contain less of a key ingredi- ent\u2014such as ginseng\u2014than their labelsclaim. For example, Wisdom, a soft drink made by the SoBe beverage compan y, pro- moted its nutraceutical ingredients, including St. John's wort, a mood enhancer. But an analysis found that a person would have todrink 15 to 45 bottles of Wisdom daily to get what naturopathic doctors consider a thera-peutic dose, Gardiner said. Even more alarming was a study that showed 20 percent of Ayurvedic products, traditionally used in Eastern medicine, are contaminated with heavy metals. Still, sales of supplements like chamomile, St. John's wort, garlic and ginseng are strong. At the top of the list is echinacea. In 2006 echinacea sales topped $129 million in theUnited States alone. The National Center for Complemen- tary & Alternative Medicine (NCAMM), a government agency that funds research, nds that echinacea has gotten mixed results inclinical trials, with most studies to date indi- cating that echinac ea does not appear to prevent colds. NCCAM is continuing to sup- port the study of echinacea for the treatment of colds and other upper-respiratory infec- tions. With echinacea and some other sup-plements, Berman said, it is possible that researchers have not been using large enoughdoses in their experiments. \"Placebo-con- trolled dose ranging trials are the way togo,\" he said. PHOTOS: ALONSO NICHOLS fall 2008 tufts nutrition 29Tim Grifn has spent a good portion of his career helping farmers learn to keep fertilizer nutrients where they belong: in the soil. He has looked for ways to keep phosphorus from washing into rivers and streams; nitrogen from dissipatinginto the air as ammonia; and most recently, carbon from wafting skyward as CO 2, one of the greenhouse gases that is causing global warming. Although other scientists have studied the CO2production of commodity crops like corn and wheat, Grifn, who joined the Friedman School this summeras an associate professor in the Agriculture, Food and Environment Program, has measured how much greenhouse gas is released by high-value crops, likepotatoes. Because potatoes grow underground, harvesting them means disturb-ing the soil a lot. \"When you do that, every time you do that, there is a flux of carbon dioxide,\" he says. \"And those kinds of intensive farming operations dothat a lot, more than if you were a wheat farmer in eastern Washington, whereyou might not stir the soil at all.\" Measuring the gas released is only the rst move. \"The difcult step is can you make the leap and talk about how that might influence an entire set offarms,\" Grifn says. The goal is to turn the science into effective policies thatmake sense for both potato growers and the planet. Grifn is a former research agronomist with the USDA Agricultural Research Service at the University of Maine. From 1992 to 1998, he held positions withthe Extension Service, where he was appointed the rst sustainable agriculture extension specialist in the United States.

Robert Russell, M.D., director of the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging,agreed, but added that few graduates will end up doingwhat they expected to do. In his commencement address,Russell related his own experience, saying that after n-ishing medical school he was certain he would be a psychiat rist. Instead, he was drafted during the Vietnam War. Seeing the diseases suffered by malnourished warorphans inspired him to embark on a career in nutritionand public health, including more than a quarter centuryat the Friedman School. Russell, who was named a professor emeritus earlier in the day at the university-wide commencement cere-mony, also spoke of his setbacks. He spent several yearsresearching beta-carotene, which had shown some strongpromise as a cancer-ghting nutrient. But his hopeswere dashed when it was discovered that high doses of thecompound can actually stimulate lung cancer in smokers. \"Since a lot of my career up to that point had been invested in beta-carotene, I thought this was devastating,and I was going to have to nd another career,\" he said.

The upside of failure was also a theme for Jennifer Layne, a Ph.D. recipient, who revealed in her class addressthat she did not pass her doctoral qualifying exams therst time she took them. She learned that it's important tobe able to articulate what you know, and to admit what you don't know. \"If we can be humble enough to view each mistake as an opportunity to learn, then we will besuccessful, both personally and professionally,\" she said.

Bergstrom, J62, and Edward H.Budd, A55, both members and former chairs of the Friedman School's Board of Overseers, and to Visiting Professor Nevin Scrimshaw, a pioneering researcher in the eld of nutrition. \"It's an honor to be able to acknowledge the extraordinary contributions of these three individuals to the Friedman School,\" said Dean Eileen Kennedy, who presented the medals at a ceremony on September 23. \"With their energy, gen-erosity and dedication, they have helped shape the institution, and they contin-ually create new possibilities for exciting developments here.\" Bergstrom, a professor of education at Wheelock College, has long been associated with children's issues as an educator, author, consultantand entrepreneur. As a volunteer leader at Tufts, she has sought to expand the university's ability to positively impact childr en around the world. Her generosity has enabled the Friedman School to hire a new jun-ior professor, who will address such vital global issues as malnutrition,hunger, food insecurity and famine. The newly created Bergstrom Foun-dation Professorship in Global Nutrition will focus on nutrition for moth-ers and children. Bergstrom is a past recipient of the Tufts University Alumni Association's Distinguished Service Award. Previously she, herhusband, Gary, and son Craig established the Bergstrom Family Chair inLasting Legacies Medal ceremony honors dear friends of the school Applied Developmental Science, the first endowed chair in Tufts' Eliot-Pearson Depart- ment of Child Development. Budd has championed ways to provide the school with long-term strength andongoing growth.

The practice pioneered by the Friedman School's Positive Deviance Initiative enables poor and vulnerable communities around the world, as well as organiza- tions such as schools and hospitals, to harness local wisdom to address prob-lems requiring social and behavioral change. The positive-deviance (PD) approachis being used to address challenges as diverse as childhood malnutrition, mater-nal and newborn care, environmental conservation and school performance. The Positive Deviance Initiative has received a $3 million pledge from the Rockefeller Foundation, including a $1 million matching gift from the foundation ifthe Friedman School raises $1 million for the initiative by 2012. The pledge wasmade in recognition of \"the importance of PD as a 'big idea' and the importance of diffusing the approach throughout the world.\" Positive deviance argues that every community has certain individuals or groups whose special practices or behaviors enable them to nd a better solution to a problem than their neighbors or colleagues in the exact same circum-stances. These individuals or groups \"deviate positively,\" and the approachenables the community to discover and adapt their uncommon\u2014but demonstra-bly successful\u2014practices. Jerry Sternin, director of the Positive Deviance Initiative, and his wife and colleague Monique Sternin pioneered the positive deviance approach in Vietnamin the 1990s, inspired by the seminal research work on positive deviance in nutrition by Marian Zeitlin, a former Tufts professor and now a visiting professor atthe Friedman School. \"Positive deviance is grounded in the wisdom of the people and the potential transformation from unleashing that wisdom,\" said Bonnie Newman, interim executive director of the Positive Deviance Initiative. Take the example of an African village in which many children are malnour- ished and underweight, but a few are thriving. The mothers of the healthier chil-dren have habits different from the mothers of the less-healthy ones: Perhapsthey wash their hands before preparing food, or make an extra effort to findgreen vegetables growing near their homes. Whatever the case, they followbenecial practices that others in their community also could be following, but are not. Such mothers are \"positive deviants.\" PD facilitators might help arrangedaily meetings during which the \"positive deviant\" mothers explain how theyobtain and prepare food, and then lead the group in making a meal together. The Positive Deviance Initiative's current projects include addressing child- hood malnutrition in about 40 countries across three continents, lowering highschool drop-out rates in California, preventing goiter in Indonesia and hospital-acquired infections in the United States, and improving maternal-child health andnutrition in Guatemala. With the Rockefeller grant, the Positive Deviance Initiative will train more professionals in the methodology, support research to evaluate its effectiveness,expand the number of PD projects worldwide and create a community of practicevia its new website. \"We are moving from a small venture to a multifaceted outreach and education center,\" Newman said. \u2014Amy RosenbergFOUNDATION GIFT ACCENTUATES THE POSITIVE Assistant N00, N06; a dietitian at Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center, helps kids like MadisonWorden, who has a metabolic disorder, get thenutrients and energy they need to go to school,socialize with friends\u2014and look forward to a promising future.
