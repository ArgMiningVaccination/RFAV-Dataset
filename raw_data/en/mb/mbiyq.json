In this article, we shall understand the various causes behind muscle spasms and soreness and look at a few natural muscle relaxers that can help you relieve the pain effectively. Read on. In This Article What Causes Muscle Spasms? Muscle spasms most commonly affect the neck, shoulder, and back regions due to poor stance and posture ( [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0004932/)). However, you can experience muscle spasms in any part of the body like hands, feet, calves, hamstrings, abdomen, etc. These limit your range of movement and can cause mild discomfort or intense pain. Muscle spasms, cramps, and soreness can occur due to any one or a combination of the following reasons: - Prolonged strenuous physical activity or heavy exercises - Wrong sitting posture during long work hours might lead to back, shoulder, or neck pain. - Incorrect sleep positions or walking posture - Uterine contractions during menstruation - Rapid weight gain and a sedentary lifestyle might make your muscles more prone to stiffness, spasms, and cramps. - Sudden twists, bumps, or falls - Nutrient deficiencies like a lack of vitamin D, magnesium, or protein - Chronic joint muscle pain caused by underlying conditions like arthritisi [X]An inflammation, swelling, and stiffness of one or multiple joints that cause pain and worsens with age. , fibromyalgiai [X]A disorder characterized by widespread muscle pain and tenderness, which causes pain all over the body. , and similar health conditions - Rarely, spasmodic muscles could be due to certain chronic health conditions like muscular dystrophyi [X]A group of genetic diseases that gradually lead to loss of muscle mass and permanently weaken them. , multiple sclerosisi [X]An autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (brain, spinal cord, and optical nerves). , or McArdle's diseasei [X]A rare genetic disorder that mainly affects skeletal muscles and causes painful muscle cramps and weakness. . While reaching out for prescribed painkillers or OTC pain relief ointments might be your first instinct when in pain, you can rather opt for natural muscle relaxers or natural remedies for muscle tension. There is an assortment of herbs and plant extracts that can help relax your muscles and relieve the pain and soreness ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5329173/)). We have rounded off a list of natural muscle relaxers to help you choose the most suitable option in times of need. 9 Natural Muscle Relaxers For Pain-relief 1. Chamomile Chamomile, an herbal muscle relaxer, is a therapeutic herb rich in anti-inflammatory flavonoids. It may help manage various issues, including insomniai [X]A common sleep disorder in which you have trouble falling and staying asleep due to poor sleeping habits, depression, and anxiety. , muscle spasms, menstrual cramps, hay fever, cold, and flu ( [3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2995283/)). Massaging chamomile essential oil onto the affected muscles helps improve blood circulation and provides relief from spasms. You may drink chamomile tea to relax the stiff and sore muscles ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5329173/)). Chamomile tea's anti-inflammatory and antispasmodici [X]A pharmaceutical drug or agent that is used to relieve muscle spasms (cramps or painful contractions). properties help reduce menstrual cramps and premenstrual syndrome ( [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6970572/)), ( [5](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286965003_Chamomile_tea_for_relief_of_primary_dysmenorrhea)). 2. Cherry Juice And Extracts Cherries are loaded with antioxidants and have anti-inflammatory properties, which may help relax muscles and reduce muscle damage and soreness ( [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5872786/)). A study showed that tart cherry juice and extracts could help athletes and marathon runners relieve muscle sprains and injuries ( [7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20459662/)). In addition, cherry juice helps reduce muscle damage and aids in faster recovery ( [8](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21233776/)), ( [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/19883392/)). 3. Blueberries Blueberries are rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory polyphenols that help relax muscles and boost recovery after exercise. Supplementing your diet with blueberries may help improve your exercise performance and decrease inflammatory markers ( [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6124147/)). A pre-and post-workout blueberry smoothie meal can aid faster recovery from any muscle damage ( [11](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22564864/)). Blueberries might also help ease chronic muscle pain and inflammation associated with osteoporosisi [X]A bone disease in which bones become weak and brittle due to loss of bone density, which increases the risk of fractures. and help improve posture and mobility in the elderly ( [12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30699971/)), ( [13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25909473/)). 4. Cayenne Pepper Capsaicin is naturally found in the pith (fleshy part) of cayenne pepper. This natural muscle relaxant may help relieve pain associated with fibromyalgia (a type of muscle pain disorder) ( [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5433031/)). While you can include cayenne pepper in various dishes, you can also find cayenne pepper extracts in capsules and creams. Research suggests that applying capsaicin cream to the affected areas may relieve muscle spasms and soreness ( [15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4470969/)). 5. Pomegranate Juice Consuming pomegranate juice is another healthy way to relieve muscle soreness. A study on weight-lifters found that drinking pomegranate juice reduced muscle damage and helped in recovery ( [16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5072630/)). Another study reported the beneficial effects of pomegranate juice on increasing strength and reducing soreness of elbow flexor muscles ( [17](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21659887/)). 6. Peppermint Menthol, the primary compound in peppermint is known for its analgesic properties and is widely used in many pain relief medications. Peppermint has antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory properties that help your muscles relax during contractions ( [18](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23820004/)), ( [19](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/24/9/1675/htm)). You can use peppermint in two ways: - Peppermint Tea: A 2018 review found that consuming peppermint tea infusions could relieve pain ( [20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5964621/)). You can make peppermint tea by adding a few leaves of mint to boiling water. - Peppermint Oil Massage: Research found that the topical use of peppermint oil for sprains could provide a cooling effect, relieve pain, and promote muscular relaxation ( [21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5751100/)). However, peppermint oil might not be suitable for people with prior health conditions affecting the liver, bile duct, or gallbladder ( [20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5964621/)). 7. Rosemary This herb helps relax muscles and heals joint pain. It is also highly effective in relieving menstrual cramps ( [20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5964621/)), ( [22](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25635991/)). You can use rosemary in the following ways: - Rosemary Bath: Soak in a warm water bath infused with rosemary leaves. - Rosemary Essential Oil: Massage the affected area with diluted rosemary essential oil to relieve body aches and relax the sore muscles. 8. Lavender Lavender essential oil is known for its calming and relaxing effects. It is also effective as a natural muscle relaxer and can help alleviate symptoms of sore muscles, knee pain, and menstrual cramps ( [23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5405632/)), ( [24](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27863613/)). A relaxing massage with lavender essential oil followed by a warm shower enhances blood circulation and helps ease the sore muscles, allowing them to relax. 9. Essential Oils And Aromatherapy Most essential oils are known for their soothing and relaxing properties. They help ease muscle tension and effectively relieve muscle pain ( [21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5751100/)). Aromatherapy utilizes the benefits of these essential oils to help soothe your muscles and alleviate pain ( [25](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/prt/2016/8158693/)). Other than the peppermint, lavender, and rosemary oils discussed above, other essential oils for muscle relaxation and effective for pain relief include lemongrass oil, frankincense oil, and cypress oil. However, always dilute the essential oils before application. You may add a drop of the essential oil to a teaspoon of any carrier oil (like almond, coconut, or jojoba oils). Follow this dilution method to combine massage oils. Other than the above, a few diet modifications and natural muscle relaxant supplements can help you reduce the frequency of muscle cramps and sprains. Increase your intake of: - Vitamin D Regular muscle spasms and pain might signify vitamin D deficiency ( [26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6730953/)). It is most commonly seen in women and people who don't get enough sunlight. Natural sources of getting vitamin D include sunlight and consuming foods like fish, eggs, and milk. Other than these, you can also consult a doctor and take vitamin D supplements. - Protein Adequate protein intake may help reduce muscle damage and exercise-induced inflammation. A review evaluating exercise-induced muscle damage in women found that consuming supplements with whey and casein, two types of protein, reduced muscle damage ( [27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5968901/)). In another study, marathon runners who took protein supplements reported reduced muscle soreness 72 hours after the marathon compared to those who did not ( [28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5872751/)). - Magnesium A magnesium deficiency might manifest as muscular pain and spasms ( [29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC2146789/pdf/canfamphys00077-0094.pdf)). You can help reduce the frequency of these pains and cramps by supplementing your diet with magnesium-rich foods like almonds, bananas, brown rice, spinach, black beans, edamame, and legumes. Bathing in warm water infused with magnesium-rich Epsom salt is another natural way to help relax your muscles and relieve soreness and pain. While muscle spasms are agonizing and affect mobility, you can soothe the sore muscles and help them relax with the help of several other methods. Other Ways To Reduce Muscle Spasms - Take Rest When you are in pain, a good sleep, drinking plenty of fluids, and resting the affected area may help the muscles recover. Most often, spasms are caused due to overworked muscles. Getting enough rest is vital to prevent muscle fatigue and long-term damage. - Massage A massage involves using the right pressure to untie knots and relax tight muscles. You can get it done at home or visit a licensed spa or physiotherapy center for professional treatment. A qualified massage therapist can help relieve tense muscles with proper deep tissue massage practices. - Use Warm Or Cold Compresses One common and beneficial practice to help relieve muscle pain and soreness is to apply heat or ice pack or compress. While heat improves blood circulation and helps relax your muscles, ice helps reduce inflammation and swelling. It is important to identify the type of pain to help decide which would be more beneficial. - Over-The-Counter Drugs Some people may choose to use medications and pain-relief ointments for instant relief. While this might come in handy to go through the day's tasks, it is not recommended for long-term use. Such pain-relieving medications and over-the-counter muscle relaxers might have unwanted side effects in the long term. Instead, you can try any of the natural muscle relaxers mentioned above to treat your sore muscles naturally.
