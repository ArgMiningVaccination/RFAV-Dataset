The increase can most easily be quantified by measuring increase in protein accumulation or the number of transgenic lies generated, and we have shown data for both of those. How will the developments presented translate to other commercial processes beyond Sapphire: We have added additional commercial partners, Heliae and Triton H&N, and generated protein co-product strains for both. We are also in discussion with several other algae companies to either generate strains for them, or help them with their developmental programs. We have also supplied our vectors to labs world wide. The nutrient recycling is dependent upon the HTL process, but this process is now used beyond Sapphire.
