It uses gentle palpation and traction to find areas of tension in the body and gently to release them. Most people who receive a ZB session report feelings of relief, release, peacefulness, lightness and spaciousness in their bodies, hearts and minds. For more information on ZB click QiGong Qigong (also spelled Chi kung) comes from the Chinese words \"Qi\" (usually translated as \"life force\" or \"vital energy\") and \"Gong\" (usually translated as \"cultivation\" or \"skill\"). Doctors in China have taught medical Qigong exercises based on the energetic meridian system of the body to their patients for centuries to enable them to accelerate and deepen their own healing. By using gentle movements, breathing techniques, and mental concentration, one can generate, circulate, strengthen, and cleanse the life force (Qi) within oneself. The practice of Qigong can lead to greater vitality and health, as well as a more peaceful state of mind. Between them, our instructors have several dozen years of experience studying and teaching qigong. In this spirit of passing on precious healing gifts, learned from esteemed teachers, we offer our qigong classes to the Bend community in the hope that these powerful exercises, based in ancient wisdom, will help you to reclaim (or maintain) the harmony, health and tranquility that are your birthright. | | Meditation We think of meditation as a set of tools for living, as well as a way of life. People need different tools at different times. Whether you're interested in focus, clarity, peace, healing, or simply a deeper connection to yourself and the world around you, we welcome you to try our different classes to see which is the best fit for you. Monday evening from 6:00 - 7:00 we offer a class called \"Essential Meditation,\" drawing on meditative principles from a variety of healing traditions. On Wednesday afternoon from 1-2 we offer moving meditation practices from the Taoist movement arts of qigong. Students of all levels are welcome at all classes. Please call us at 541-322-9642 if you have any questions. | | Prices With the onset of COVID we've decided to make all our classes free in an attempt to provide the community with tools to help with the stresses and challenges that so many of us are facing; donations are always welcome. | | | | Clinic Hours Acupuncture Monday, Wednesday: 9AM - 12:30PM ; 2 - 6PM Friday: "}
