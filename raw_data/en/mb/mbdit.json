Kay Hutchinson Founder of Aiki Healing: An Integrative Practice of Chinese Medicine I believe in a synthesis approach to healing and health. What does that mean exactly? It means that I love to weave a variety of energy healing modalities together to create a truly integrative body, mind and soul healing experience that resolves root issues, not just addresses symptoms. As an [advanced medical qi gong practitioner,](http://www.aikihealing.com/medicalqigong.php) I look at growth through the lens of qi gong in terms of energetic and spiritual transformation. I offer my individual clients and corporate clients a rich three pronged system of healing including: [Medical qi gong bodywork sessions](http://www.aikiheahttp://aikihealing.com/qi-gong-body-work/)integrating Chinese aromatherapy and Chinese stone/crystal healing. - Private instruction and group workshops focusing on how to use [qi gong movement](http://www.aikihealing.com/qigongclasses.php) [Professional medical qi gong certification program](http://aikihealing.com/certification/)that is taught one-on-one through customized modules that allow students to learn in a hands-on manner. I began my early career as an educator (certified K-12 in special education), obtaining my B.S. in Applied Learning and Development from the University of Texas at Austin. After working with children who had disabilities and emotional challenges, I was drawn to study Chinese medicine at the Acupressure Institute in Berkeley, and [Longevity Center](http://www.longevity-center.com) (Clinic and Institute) in San Jose. On this journey, I was blessed to be mentored by Dr. Arnold Tayam, head instructor of qi gong for integrative medicine programs at Stanford and professor of Five Branches Acupuncture college. What a world of wonder unfolded as I learned how ancient energy techniques from the field of Chinese medicine could effectively help all people overcome chronic health challenges and resolve emotional and spiritual blocks. Training at the California Institute of Integral Studies in their integral counseling program helped me to refine my empathic listening skills and develop a deeper understanding of the energetics underlying relationships and individual growth processes. Self Development When not working on Aiki Healing projects, I enjoy growing in new ways with advanced studies in qi gong and tai chi with Dr. Tayam. I also enjoy working with animals, hiking, creating art tapestries (third generation Japanese tapestry artist), and conducting outreach in my local community and on a global level. I served as the webmaster for the [Ann Foundation](http://www.annfoundation.org) for 8 years and helped to co found [El Tule Institute](http://www.eltuleinstitute.org), a non profit dedicated to the creative expression and growth of people.
