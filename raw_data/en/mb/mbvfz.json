We cover your health history and look for signs of imbalance based on your intake, and facial, tongue, and pulse analysis. This is a safe space for you to share your innermost self and sessions are completely confidential. Melanie has been in practice for 14 years and has successfully worked with stubborn digestive ailments, anxiety, depressive states, fatigue, addictions, chronic health conditions, problems with lymph, spiritual crises...etc. The cost of this session covers your appointment time with Melanie and any herbs you might need are additional. A starter protocol is typically around $40-$60. Herbal refills can either be mailed out as needed or can be picked up upon request for just the cost of the herbs. There is no other fee associated with picking up or mailing out herbs (just shipping). You will likely be on a protocol for a couple of months to see the full results. Zoom sessions are available. To set up a consult, please send an email to [mroseherbs@yahoo.com](mailto:mroseherbs@yahoo.com) or call 617-755-8063. Follow-up Appointments: $50 Follow-ups last 45 min. to one hour. During this time we address other health challenges and/or we reassess your current health care protocol, making any necessary changes to your formulas. Quick Reformulation Visit: $30 These are short visits for folks who just need an adjustment to their formula. They take no more than 30 minutes, but gives us the time to pulse test and/or dowse for herbs and have a brief check-in. I often tell people that herbs are like shampoo. After awhile your hair regimen needs a change! And herbs are just like that. Our bodies are always changing and adapting. It's good to reassess your herbal protocol every 3 months, or sooner, depending on what health goals you are working on. Most herbal tinctures are $10 per ounce. Herbal teas vary in prices. Medicinal mushroom powders are available as well as other organic and natural health-enhancing products. Bio: Melanie Rose Scofield is a Clinical Herbalist located in Rockport, ME, who works primarily with herbs, nutrition, healing movement, flower essences, supplements, and guided meditation. She provides custom herbal blends made only from organic, ethically wild-crafted, and home-grown herbs. Only the highest quality materials are used in the process from start to finish, ensuring you with excellent quality herbal medicine. Melanie works with people who are looking to address anxiety, depression, digestive issues, hormonal imbalances, chronic illnesses, fatigue, and many other health concerns. She is currently enrolled in a training on Compassionate Inquiry with highly acclaimed physician Dr. Gabor Mate. At the end of her year long certification training (February 2024), she will be offering therapeutic counseling sessions for those dealing with trauma, addictions, anxiety, depression, and spiritual crises. She is looking forward to providing therapy to those looking for a more multi-dimensional approach to talk-therapy based on energy awareness and deep self-exploration. Melanie's training in natural medicine began in 2002 when she contracted a severe case of dysentery in India. Western Medicine was of no help and she began the search to heal herself. This caused her to change the course of her life path from music to the healing arts. In 2005 she completed her Nutritional Consultant training with the Global College of Natural Medicine and also her first level herbal apprenticeship. In 2007 She earned a certificate as a Clinical Herbalist thru the Boston School of Herbal Studies. She opened the doors to her private practice in 2008 and has been in practice now for 15 years. Melanie has been leading herbal apprenticeships for the past 12 years, and The Earthwalk School of Herbal Traditions is now in it's 7th year of operation. Herbal Medicine is alive and well and it is her great joy and passion to be able to share it here in Midcoast Maine. "}
