Have you tried Electrolytes before? Electrolyte Powder can be a game changer for energy and hydration! Regular water sometimes does not \"quench\" our thirst because it lacks minerals. Electrolyte powder is a great way to get sodium, chloride, magnesium, and potassium that your cells need for energy and optimal functioning! Add a scoop of this great tasting lemon-orange electrolyte powder to your water and drink it before or after a workout! It also has ribose, which is great for muscle recovery. Are you truly hungry, or maybe just thirsty? Our brain often interprets thirst as hunger. So rather than a snack, we really just need hydration and minerals. This powder is a great way to curb the urge to snack. One scoop has over 1500 mg of vitamin C! This is one of my personal favorites. I drink a scoop of electrolytes in the morning (after my coffee) and another scoop at lunch and it makes a HUGE difference in my energy. If you're struggling with fatigue, give it a try! Warm regards, Rajsree Nambudripad, MD "}
