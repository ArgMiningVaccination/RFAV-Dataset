Revise 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMAR Y From bags to bottle caps, plastic garbage is littering coastlines, filling our oceans , and killing whales, seabirds , and fish around the world. And without major changes to how we use, produc e, and regulate plastic, the plastic pollution crisis is about to get much worse. As a first and necessary step to ending that crisis, t his petition urges the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to update the 26-year-old water pollution rules it use s to approve industrial facilities that create plastic and to eliminate plastic discharges from these plastic plants. The United States already creates more waste per capita than any other country . But in the next 10 years, the petrochemical industry plans to increase plastics production by at least 35 percent, with more than 300 new projects slated for the U nited States alone. Using fracked natural gas, the new and expanded facilities planned by the industry will produce the essential building blocks for an endless deluge of throwaway plastic. Nearly 50 percent of plastic produced is disposable packaging meant to be discarded within minutes. Much of it will end up in our oceans , smother ing corals, travel ing through the ocean food web, and pollut ing our beaches. But the pollution created by these facilities goes beyond plastic waste. The plastics industry is among the dirtiest and most toxic in the nation , fouling the air and water of some of our poorest communities. The facilities that convert fossil fuels into plastics release a host of toxic pollutants into waterways. They pollute our water with benzene \u2014a known human carcinogen \u2014and dioxins, best known as the toxic contaminant in Agent Orange. Other wastewater pollutants include phthalates, a known cause of developmental and reproductive toxicity in humans, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which cause cancer, damage organs , and suppress our immune systems. Plastics facilities also push massive quantities of plastic pellets and other plastic particles in to waterways through stormwater discharge \u2014affecting the recreational, aesthetic, biological, cultural, water quality, and economic values and uses of our shorelines and waterways . In addition to the water quality hazards created during production, irrever sible environmental problems stem from the skyrocketing use and disposal of consumer plastics. Threats from increasing plastic production include accumulation of plastic in natural habitats ; wildlife and human ingestion of plastics materials ; entanglement in discarded plastic products ; and the potential for plastics to transfer chemicals to wildlife and humans. The growth of plastic production has far out paced the ability of waste management to keep up, as demonstrated by the mountains of plastic that choke our waterways and oceans. Despite plastic production's harms, EPA is allowing this industry to expand its poisoning of our nation's waters. EPA only regulates a subset of wastewater pollutants produced by this industry under its current Clean Water Act r egulatory program, using unacceptably old technology -based standards. EPA must start more effectively regulat ing the plastics industry now. In light of the Clean Water Act's stated goal of ending the discharge of pollutants into the country's waterways, Petitioners formally request that EPA update the Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards applied to facilities that convert fossil fuels into plastics . The Effluent 2 Limitations Guidelines and Standards for th e plastics industry are largely unchanged from their original adoption in the 1970s and 1980s . In the meantime, plastic production and pollution have exploded, and monitoring and treatment technologies have advanced. An update is long overdue and necessary to comply with the Clean Water Act's mandate for effluent limitations , reflect updates in science , and ensure new technologies and treatment methods are used to address emerging pollutants of concern. Primarily, Petitioners request that EPA take these four actions : 1. Prohibit the discharge of plastic pellets and other plastic materials in industrial stormwater and wastewater; 2. Update Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for new facilities to eliminate the discharge of toxic priority pollutants from wastewater and stormwater streams; 3. For existing facilities , put into effect Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for pollutants of concern not currently regulated ; and 4. Update current Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for existi ng facilities to reflect advances in detection and treatment technolog ies since the last revision s decades ago. EPA has the duty and obligation to ensure that both wastewater and stormwater discharge s from petro -plastics facilities do not degrad e the health of the country's rivers , oceans , ecosystems , or communities. I. Notice of Petition The undersigned organizations hereby petition EPA to promptly review and revise the Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards that apply to the facilities th at convert natural gas liquids into plastics under the Part 419 Petroleum Refinin g industrial category (Subpart B Cracking and Subpart C Petrochemical )1 and Part 414 Organic Chemicals, Plastics, and Synthetic Fibers industrial category pursuant to the Admi nistrative Procedures Act (APA)2 and the Clean Water Act.3 The citizen right to petition the government originates in the First Amendment4 and is codified and applied to federal agency regulations through the APA's requirement that \"[e]ach agency shall giv e an interested person the right to petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule.\"5 The APA also imposes an affirmative obligation on EPA to respond to this petition in a timely manner , requiring that \"[w]ith due regard for the convenience and necessity of the parties or their representatives and within a reasonable time, 1 To the extent that EPA regulates facilities producing ethylene, propylene, or other monomers for Plastics under 40 C.F.R.

All along its lifecycle \u2014from fossil fuel extraction, transport, refining, and polymerization to consumer use, waste disposal, and degradation in the environment \u2014plastic is harming the health of people and the planet (CIEL 2019 a). Plastic contaminates species, communities, ecosystems, and food chains at a staggering scale. Despite these harms, according to the American Chemistry Council, the plastics and chemical industry is investing more than $202 billion in the United States for an estimated 333 projects (including new facilities and expansions) designed in large part to convert \"plentiful and affordable natural gas\" from shale into petrochemical and plastic products (Amer ican Chemistry Council 2018 a). The industry aims to increase North American plastics production by at least 35 percent by 2025 (CIEL 2017 ; CIEL 2019 ). These new plastics will be used to manufacture a variety of products, including water bottles, straws, utensils, food wrappers, packaging, shopping bags, and other single -use items that account for approximately 40 percent of plastic use (Geyer et al. 2017). Of the approximately 6,300 million metric tons of plastic waste already produced globally as of 2015, only 9 percent has been recycled, with 12 percent incinerated and the remaining 79 percent accumulating in landfills and the natural environment (Geyer et al. 2017). An additional 8 million tons of plastic pollution enters the water each year. Thousands of seabirds and sea turtles, seals, and other marine mammals are harmed and killed after ingesting plastic or becoming entangled in it. Plastic has been found in our drinking water , seafood , and farthest reaches of the oceans . And more plastic is on the way. If current trends continue, plastics in the ocean could outweigh fish by 2050 (World Economic Forum 2016). Aside from the legacy of pollution these products create, new and expanded \" petro - plastics \" facilities emit and discharge a variety of harmful air and water pollutants in the local communities and ecosystems where they are sited. This includes the discharge of plastic resin pellets, flakes, powders, and granules , as well as harmful pollutants including phthalates , dioxin, 6 Id. \u00a7 555(b). 7 Id. \u00a7 555(e); the APA further grants a right of judicial review to \"[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action\" id. \u00a7 702 which is defined to include the \"failure to act.\" Id. \u00a7 551(13).

Many of these pollutants are carcinogens and known to harm human health and the environment. Petrochemical companies are locating these plastics facilities near existing fossil fuel infrastructure , which means they are targeting Gulf C oast communities in Louisiana and Texas that already shoulder a heavy burden of oil and gas industry pollution. Across the U nited States , these facilities are often located in and have a disproportionate impact on low -income and minority neighborhoods (Bullard 2000; Collins et al. 2016). Studies dating back to the 1970s have documented a consistent pattern of siting facilities disproportionately where poor people and people of color live (Brown 1995 ). In the fenceline zones around industrial facilities t hat use or store hazardous chemicals , the percent age of Latinos is 60 percent greater and percent age of blacks 75 percent greater than for the U nited States as a whole (Environmental Justice and Health Alliance for Chemical Policy Reform 2014 ). EPA regulates t he discharge of pollutants into surface waters under the Clean Water Act 's national pollution discharge elimination system (NPDES) program and its Effluent Limitation s Guidelines and Standards. This program and standards are intended to ensure that wastewater and stormwater discharges from industrial facilities do not harm public health or the environment. However, EPA has not revised or updated the Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Standards for Petroleum Refining (Cracking and Petrochemical subcategories) in any way since 198 5 or the Organic Chemicals, Plastics, and Synthetic Fibers (\"Plastics\") industries in any way since 1993 . In the decades since , there have been advancements in scientific knowledge and technology as well as changes in the petro -plastics industry and related pollution , all of which warrant a thorough update of these technology - based standards to achieve the goals of the Clean Water Act .8 EPA has the authority and duty to rigorously review and update these regulations to ensure full compliance with the Clean Water Act and protection of public health and the environment. On behalf of our millions of supporters and members, the undersigned organizations petition EPA to promptly review and revise the E ffluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Part 419 Petroleum Refinin g industrial category (Subpart B Cracking and Subpart C Petrochemical ) and Part 414 Organic Chemicals, Plastics , and Synthetic Fibers industrial category pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and the Clean Water Act . 8 See, e.g. Sw. Elec. Power Co. v. U.S. EPA , 920 F.3d 999, 1003 (5th Cir. 2019) (\" By requiring BAT, the Act force s implementation of increasingly stringent pollution control methods\" (citation omitted) ).

II. Factual Background A. Plastic Production Overview 1. The Current Petrochemical Buildout More than 99 percent of all plastic in the world is produced from fossil fuels. Crude oil and fracked natural gas can be refined to make ethane and propane, which are key feedstocks for plastic s (Sadrameli 2015). The petrochemical industry converts ethane and propane into ethylene and propylene (also known as olefins), and from there produces the polyethylene and polypropylene polymers that are the basic building blocks for plastic products (IEA 2018). The process of breaking down fossil fuels into plastics is commonly referred to as \"cracking.\" The current oversupply of fracked natural gas from shale deposits in the U nited States has created economic incentives for the domestic and international petrochemical industry to invest in the expansion or new construction of petro -plastics plants. The fossil fuel and petrochemical industr ies are planning a massive expansion of petro - plastics facilities that would rapidly increase plastic production and its associated pollution. In its 2018 Annual Energy Outlook, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected that natural gas plant liquids production (including predominately ethane and propane) will double between 2017 and 2050, supported by an incr ease in global petrochemical industry demand and ethane availability in the U nited States (U.S. EIA 2018 a). In line with these projections and the oversupply of ethane, the petrochemical industry has been announcing a wave in investments in capacity expans ion and new facilities to process ethane since early 2011, with its current tally at $204B and 33 7 projects (ACC 201 9). 6 In 2015, there were 28 ethylene crackers in the U nited States producing 28.4 million metric tons of ethylene per year (Koottungal 2015). Two years later, there were at least six more new or expanded U.S. crackers : an OxyChem/Mexichem facility in Ingleside, T exas; a Shintech facility in Plaquemine, L ouisiana; two LyondellBasell plants in Corpus Christi and Channelview, Texas; and an Indorama (restart) in Lake Charles, L ouisiana (Petrochemical Update 2017). A second wave of U.S. petrochemical projects has emerged since that time, which includes expansions into the Appalachian region of the U nited States (starting with Pennsylvania and Ohio, with indications that West Virginia will soon follow) (ICIS 2017). Nine new et hane crackers alone are in the development pipeline, with plans to open by 2020 and churn out 10.7 million more tons of ethylene each year. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, more than 95 percent of U.S. ethylene production capacity is located in either Texas or Louisiana (U.S. DOE 2018). While production in the Appalachian region has been slower , it is projected to rapidly grow in the coming years, with other regions to follow (Id.). Overall, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects annual U.S. ethane consumption to grow from an estimated 1.2 million barrels per day in 2017 to 1.6 million in 2019 as new plants and infrastructure ramp up operations (U.S. EIA 2018 b).

Wastewater and Stormwater Characteristics of Petro -Plastics Facilities Production of p lastic monomers and polymer s occurs at both Petroleum Refining facilities as part of their overall refining processes and at facilities dedicated to processing petrochemicals into plastic resins (together referred to as \"petro -plastics facilities\") . As described in more detail below , EPA therefore regulates petro -plastics facilities under two Clean Water Act industrial categories: (1) Petroleum Refining; and (2) Organic Chemicals, Plastics, and Synthetic Fibers (\"Plastics\"). Common waste streams generated by Plastics facilities and Petroleum Refining facilities that perform pyrolysis, fluid catalytic cracking, and propane dehydrogenation include: - Benzene - and butadiene -containing waste streams associated with cracking (both are naturally occurring chemicals in crude oil and byproducts of cracking that are known human carcinogens ); 8 - Blowdown from cooling towers, boilers , and steam generators; - Dilution steam blowdown wastewater from quenching and compressing cracked gases; - Flushing of tank botto ms used for raw material storage; - Once -through cooling tower water; - Polymerization wastewater that includes caustic wash and sour water containing amines and mercaptans; - Sour water from distillation processes; - Sour water resulting from water being in direc t contact with hydrocarbo n streams containing sulfides, ammonia, phenols, and other organic chemicals in crude oil; - Source water treatment systems (e.g. Reverse osmosis wastewater); - Spent caustic waste used to remove acid gases; - Sulfur compounds from ethylene processing ; - Wastewater from cataly st regeneration containing metals; - Wastewater from dehydrogenation reactions; and - Wastewater from product washing . (EPA 2004; EPA MACT 2006 ; EPA Website ; U.S. DOL Butadiene; U.S. DOL Benzene). In 2016, EPA identified, ranked, and prioritized industrial categories with discharges that pose a substantial hazard to human health and the environment. The Petroleum Refining industrial category (which includes fracked gas crackers and petrochemical facilities) ran ked 4th and the Plastics industrial category (which includes facilities producing plastic polymers) ranked 5th on its list of the most harmful point source categories of water pollution (EPA 2016 ). Among EPA's long list of pollutants of concern from these facilities are acrylonitrile, dioxin, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), total residual chlorine, hexachlorobenzene, and nitrate compounds. These pollutants are known to harm human health and the environment. a. Wastewater Characteristics - Petroleum Refining Point Source Category Wastewater from the Petroleum Refining category (including the Cracking and Petrochemical subcategories) contains many pollutants of concern, several of which have no Effluent Limitations Guidelines or Standards.9 The makeup of this wastewater is changing with the changing nature of fuel feedstocks. Unconventional oil sources, including \"light tight oil, \" now account for approximately 50 percent of total crude oil produ ction (Kapustin 2018; U.S. EIA FAQ 2018). Though similar to conventional crude oil in hydrocarbon composition, the 9 40 C.F.R. Part 419. The cracking subcategory does not apply if a subsequent subpart applies. The petrochemical subcategory includes facilities that produce products from topping, cracking, and petrochemical operations, including olefins (which encompass e thylene and propylene) . 9 impurities in light tight oil differ and can ultimately impact the chemical contaminants found in treated wastewater discharges from Petroleu m Refining Facilities. For example, light tight oil and the waste streams associated with its processing contain higher concentrations of inorganic dissolved solids than conventional crude (Olsen 2015; McDaniels et al. 2016; EPA 2017 Study ; EPA 2004). This can adversely impact surface water qua lity in ways EPA has not adequately assessed (McDaniels et al. 2016). Cracking processes and associated distillation require large volumes of water, resulting in high rates of wastewater production : approximately 41 g allons of sour water per barrel of crude oil processed (EPA 2004) . This sour water typically contains hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, suspended solids, chlorides, mercaptans, oil, phenols, cyanides and other pollutants . EPA's review of the Petroleum Refining Category in its 2004 Effluent Guidelines Program Plan also revealed that several toxic chemicals are discharged from Petroleum Refining facilities. EPA's screening level analysis that found dioxin, polycyclic aromatic compo unds (PACs), and metals (specifically selenium, mercury, and vanadium) were the toxic and nonconventional pollutants of greatest concern in discharges from Petroleum Refining facilities (EPA 2004). Dioxin is produced at Petroleum Refining facilities as a b yproduct of catalyst regeneration operations used for fluid catalytic cracking and propane dehydrogenation. Dioxin is hydrophobic and readily attaches to solid particles in wastewater streams, including oils. Polycyclic aromatic compounds are present natur ally in crude oil and can form during the overall refining process due to incomplete combustion of organic compounds (Id.). Crude oil is also the primary source of metals in Petroleum Refining facility wastewater (Id.). Table 2. Petroleum Refining Categor y Select Wastewater Pollutants of Concern. (40 C.F.R. Part 419) Pollutants With Petroleum Refining Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Standards Other Pollutants of Concern Without Petroleum Refining Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Standards Phenolic compounds Total dissolved solids (i.e. Chlorides Lead Selenium Vanadium Polycyclic aromatic compounds (including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) 10 b. Wastewater and Stormwater Characteristics - Plastics Point Source Category Stormwater . In addition to wastewater discharges of pollutants, Plastics facilities discharge plastic pellets, powders, granules, and f lakes into surface waters during the process of transferring plastic pellets internally and while packaging and preparing plastic pellets for transport to outside facilities (EPA 1993; CalEPA 2014). As discussed in greater detail below, these plastic pell ets can adversely impact the aquatic environment in numerous ways, including from: - Ingestion by marine animals, including fish, sea turtles, birds, and marine mammals; - Becoming embedded in sediments and plant matter; - Introducing toxic plastic additives to the environment, such as bisphenol a and nonylphenol; and, - Accumulating other toxic chemicals on pellet surfaces, such as PCBs and dioxin, which end up in the aquatic food chain when ingested (CalEPA 2014). The dis charge of plastic pellets is the subject of many enforcement efforts, including those that San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper and former shrimp boat captain Diane Wilson brought against Formosa Plastics Corporation for illegal stormwater and wastewater discharges of plastics pellets ; polypropylene and polyethylene powders ; and other floating powders into Cox Creek and Lavaca Bay at Formosa's Point Comfort, Texas plant. Formosa's P oint Comfort facility has 16 production units that produce plastic products, including small pellets. Formosa manufactures caustic soda ; ethylene dichloride (EDC) ; vinyl chloride monomer (SPVC) blending, and copolymer resins ; ethylene ; ethylene glycol ; high density polyethylene (HDPE) ; liner low density polyethylene (LLDPE) ; and polypropylene (PP). Formosa has had persistent, systemic, and documented problems with containing plastic pellets and floating plastic powders at its Point Comfort Plastic powder in Cox Creek near outfall 6 of Formosa Plastics ' Point Comfort, T exas facility (2019) .

These discharges violate Formosa's p ermit, which includes the effluent limitation that \"[t]here shall be no discharge of floating solids or visible foam in other than trace amounts and no discharge of visible oil.\" (TCEQ 2016). Formosa has argued that this non -numeric permit term (\"trace amounts\") is not specific enough and thus unenforceable. Wastewater . The Plastics point source category is large and complex ; relies on a variety of feedstock and chemical processes ; and produces a wide range of final products and associated pollutants of concern. This petition is focused on those facilities involved with plastic production. Based on Toxic Release Inventory and Permit Compliance System data, wastewater pollutants associated with commonly produced plastics include those listed in Table 3 below. Table 3.

Plastic Production Endangers Public Health and the Environment As with other forms of petroleum refining, producing plastic from ethane crackers, dehydrogenation plants, and polymerization plants discharges pollutants that are detrimental to water quality, air quality, and public health. 1. Stormwater and User Plastic Pollution Plastic production results in the loss of millions o f plastic pellets to the environment. These plastic pellets are often spilled in outdoor areas, picked up in stormwater runoff, and discharged to surface waters. Once in the environment, plastic pellets are persistent and can be transported long distances from their source in flowing surface waters such as streams, rivers , and oceans . Similarly, user plastic accumulating on shorelines and in the oceans has become a staggering pollution problem. Trillions of pieces of plastic float in the world's ocean s (Eriksen et al. 2014; van Sebille et al. 2015; Derraik et al. 2002 ; Barnes et al. 2009; Rodrigues et al. 2019). The vast majority of marine debris \u2014including plastic \u2014originates from land -based sources like urban runoff ; inadequate waste disposal and management ; and industrial activity (Gordon 2006). Unfortunately, the plastic pollution problem continues to grow. Global trends reveal increasing plastic accumulations in aquatic habitats, consistent with the increasing trend in plastic production: a 560 -fold incre ase in just over 60 years (Thompson et al. 2004; Goldstein et al. 2013). Tragically, under a business -as-usual scenario, the ocean is expected to contain one ton of plastic for every three tons of fish by 2025, and more plastics than fish (by weight) by 20 50 (World Economic Forum 2016). We must find ways to stem the tide of plastic pollution, including pollution with the microplastic pellets that petro -plastics facilities produce. Microplastic Impacts - Local Of the 51 trillion plastic particles currently floating in the world's oceans (van Sebille et al. 2015), 92 percent are microplastics (Eriksen et al. 2014). Microplastics, generally defined as plastic particles less than five millimeters in length or diameter, constitute a major threat to marine wildlife and water quality. While some microplastics are the result of larger pieces breaking down, up to 30 percent of the ocean's microplastics originate as plastic pellets, or nurdles , that are used as a raw material to make plastic products (Boucher & Friot 2017; Karkarnorachaki et al. 2018). Microplastics are ubiquitous to coastal and marine environment s, found at sites worldwide from the poles to the equator and from the ocean Microplastic Pollution, Source: NOAA Office of Response and Restoration 14 surface to the sea floor (Barnes et al. 2009; Bergmann et al. 2015; Browne et al. 2011; Ferreira et al. 2019; Ivar do Sul & Costa Obbard et al. 2014; O'Donovan et al. 2018; Woodall et al. 2014). One California survey reported 118,705,732 plastic pellets on the state's beaches, and i n the Los Angeles area alone, 20 tons of microplastics are carried into the Pacific Ocean every day (Moore et al. 2011). Plastic pellets \u2014also known as p rimary microplastics \u2014have caused documented damage to freshwater, coastal, and marine ecosystems. They also represent one of the most common types of plastic pollution in these environments (Moore et al. 2011; Anbumani & Kakkar al. 2018; Rodrigues et al. 2019). Pellets frequently spill during handling at plastic factories as well as during loading and transportation both on land and at sea (Ashton et al. 2010). Road runoff and wind transfer also lead to pellet pollution (Rodrigues et al. 2019). Extant protective measures , including U.S. federal regulations , appear insufficient to curb the flow of pellet pollution. Formosa Plastic's Point Comfort, T exas, plastics manufacturing facility continues to release plastic pollution in violation of its discharge permit (Sneath 2016). The comp any explained that plastic can escape in loading areas , which \"unavoidably happens when billions of tiny polyethylene pellets are produced and are transferred from one materials handling unit to another.\" (Sneath 2016). In a recent federal court decision h olding Formosa liable for its plastic pollution discharges, the court noted that the company and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality had repeatedly failed to prevent discharges of plastics. Absent updated and more stringent regulations monitoring that reflect best available technology , plastic pollution from these facilities will continue . Microplastic Impacts - Global a. The scale and expanse of microplastic pollution A rapidly growing body of research suggests there is not one square mile of ocean surface anywhere on earth not polluted with microplastics (Eriksen et al. 2013). Microplastics comprise the majority of plastic pollution in the global ocean .10 (Boucher & Friot 2017). Ocean currents rapidly disperse microplastic particles , and scient ists have found microplastics accumulating in remote locations far from population centers, including Arctic and Antarctic waters (Isobe et al. 2016; C\u00f3zar et al. 2017; O'Donovan et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2019 ). Given the alarming amount of plastic polluting coastal and marine ecosystems worldwide, we must seek ways to reduce the flow of primary microplastics into our oceans. Existing regulatory schemes have proven insufficient to prevent this pollution , and cont inuing to permit new petro -plastics facilities under these schemes will only exacerbate the ongoing plastic pollution catastrophe. 10 To illustrate, a recent study on plastic particles flowing from two rivers into coastal areas in southern California found that microplastic particles were 16 times more abundant and had a cumulative weight three times greater tha n larger particles (Moore et al. 2011). 15 b. Microplastic impacts on aquatic wildlife 1. In General Plastics harm fish and wildlife both through physical effects of ingestion ( e.g. intestinal blockage) and by acting as a transfer agent for toxic chemicals (Hammer et al. 2012 ; CIEL 2019 b). Many plastics \u2014including pellets \u2014adsorb persistent environmental chemicals ,11 such as polychlorinated (PCBs), pesticides like dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polycyclic aromatic heavy metals, and dioxins (Teuten et al. 2009; Hammer et al. 2012; Van et al. 2012; Rochman et al. 2013; Wright et al. 2013; O'Donovan et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2019 ). Scientists began acknowledging plastic's role as a toxin vector as early as 1973 (CIEL 2019 b). Because of their large surface -area-to-volume ratio and their tendency to attract contaminants more readily than natural sediments, plastic fragments concentrate o rganic pollutants; these concentrations can be up to 1,000,000 times higher than that of the surrounding seawater (Rios et al. 2007; Bakir et al. 2018; Karkarnorachaki et al. 2018). The two types of plastic tha t the petro -plastics facilities discussed in this petition will primarily produce \u2014polyethylene and polypropylene \u2014show a particularly strong adsorption capacity for harmful chemicals , including PAHs and DDT (O'Donovan et al. 2018). Aquatic species may ingest t hese pollutant -laden plastic particles, resulting in lethal and sublethal harms. The absorbed toxins \u2014as well as plastic additives such as bisphenol A phthalate plasticizers, and flame retardants \u2014can leach from ingested plastics into animal tissues ,12 inducing adverse effects such as endocrine disruption (that is, the disruption of hormone systems), neurotoxicity, and carcinogenesis (Teuten at al. 2009; Hammer 2013; Anbumani & Kakkar 2018; O'Donovan et al. 2018). Scientists have documented over 2200 species impacted by ocean plastic pollution and at least 690 that have ingested microplastics (Gall & Thompson 2015; CIEL 2019 b; Litterbase 2019).13 Because of their small size and environmental persistence, microplastic s remain readily available to ingestion by a wide variety of marine organisms for an extended period of time (Nelms et al. 2019). Plankton, invertebrates, fish, sea birds, sea turtles, and marine mammals all are known to adsorb, ingest, or otherwise uptake microplastics (Anbumani & Kakkar 2018; Gall & Thompson 2015; Guzzetti et al. 2018 ; O'Donovan et al. 2018; Duncan et al. 2019; Herrera et al. 2019) . Trophic transfer of microplastics ( i.e., transfer up the food chain) also occurs, with the potential transfer of microplastics to humans when they eat shrimp, bivalves, fish, or other marine organisms containing these pollutants (O'Donovan et al. 2018; CIEL 2019 b; Donohue et al. 2019; Ferreira et al. 2019; Herrera et al. 2019) . 11 Adsorbed toxins are toxins that are \"stuck\" to plastic particles. Interestingly, toxin adsorption to plastic surfaces may reduce contaminant biodegradation \u2014meaning the contaminants do not break down and persist for an even longer time in the environment than they would were they not adsorbed to plastic ( Hammer et al. 2012). 12 These contaminants can be released into animal digestive tracts up to 30 times faster than to seawater (CIEL 2019b). 13 See also Table 2, \"Obse rved Ecotoxicity of Microplastics in Different Model Systems,\" in & Kakkar 2018. 16 Smaller and larger micropla stic particles harm wildlife in different ways. Larger particles may have longer residence time in the digestive tract, in turn leading to increased toxicant release (O'Donovan et al. 2018). Smaller micro - and nanoplastics may move into an organism's cells , causing a variety of harms discussed in more detail below (O'Donovan et al. 2018). Smaller particles may also carry more of a toxicant load, as their increased surface area to volume ratio allows them to adsorb more contaminants (Anbumani & Kakkar 2018; O'Donovan et al. 2018). Documented harms from ingestion of microplastics and adsorbed contaminants include but are not limited to decreased feeding and growth ; increased stress ; behavioral modifications ; reproductive harms ; immunotoxicity ; neurological har ms; alteration of gene expression ; cancer ; and increased mortality (O'Donovan et al. 2018). 2. Plankton Microplastics inhibit growth of planktonic marine microalgae; they also decrease growth, fertility , and fecundity, and increase mortality of copepods, an important zooplankton species (Anbumani & Kakkar 2018; Guzzetti et al. 2018) . Scientists observed a similar reproductive response, as well as reduced feeding, growth, and survival rates, in freshwater Daphnia species (Anbumani & Kakkar 2018; Guzzetti et al. 2018) . These impacts not only affect the planktonic organisms themselves, but also higher trophic level organisms that rely on plankton as a primary food source (Anbumani & Kakkar 2018; Guzzetti et al. 2018) . Finally, impacts to plankton species that uptake CO 2 from the atmosphere may significantly reduce the ocean's ability to absorb and store greenhouse gases, with serious implications for atmospheric warming (CIEL 2019 b). 3. Marine Invertebrates Scientists report microplastic ingestion in a variety of marine invertebrate species , including molluscs, sea worms, and crabs (Graham & Thompson 2009; Gall & Thompson 2015; Guzzetti et al. 2018; CIEL 2019 b; Duncan et al. 2019). Effects include inflammation ; reduced feeding activity ; suppressed immune system function ; reproductive harms ; damage to gills and digestive tract ; increased mortality ; and possible DNA damage (Browne et al. 2008; Mearns et al. 2013; Anbumani & 2018; Herrera et al. 2019; O'Donovan et al. 2018; Wright et al. 2013). Microplastics also harm corals by reducing calcification and inducing bleaching and tissue death (Gall & Thompson 2015; Chapron et al. 2018; Reichert et al. 2018; Donohue et al. 2019). 4. Fish Freshwater, estuarine, and marine fish ingest microplastics and their adsorbed pollutants either directly or through contaminated prey (Anbumani & Kakkar 2018; Duncan et al. 2019; Herrera et al. 2019). Such ingestion induces physiological effects and harm , including liver toxicity, endocr ine disruption, behavioral changes, and intestinal effects (Anbumani & Kakkar 2018; CIEL 2019 b; Guzzetti et al. 2018). 5. Seabirds Seabirds are among the most sensitive wildlife species to microplastics pollution due to high frequency of ingestion, impact s on body condition, and transmission of toxic chemicals 17 (Wilcox et al. 2015 ; CIEL 2019 b). Ingested plastic may stay in seabirds' stomachs for months, potentially interfering with feeding behavior and increasing leached contaminant loads (Gall & Thompson 2 015). Laboratory studies show that contaminants (including PCBs and DDT) from microplastics ingested by shearwater chicks are released once inside the bird's body (Ryan et al. 1988; Teuten et al. 2009; Hammer et al. 2012; Gall & Thompson 2015; O'Donovan et al. 2018). Plastic contaminants like endocrine -disrupting phthalates affect seabirds across the globe, even in remote environments like the Arctic (Sample 2019 ). Scientists estimate that by 2050, the percentage of seabird species ingesting plastic will reach 99.8 percent , resulting in increased mortality and decreased reproduction (Wilcox et al. 2015). 6. Sea Turtles Plastic pollution also poses a serious risk to sea turtles (See CIEL 2019 b). Scientists have documented ingestion of microplastic particles in all seven species of sea turtles (Guzzetti et al. 2018; Duncan et al. 2019; Garrison et al. 2019). This microplastic consumption exposes sea turtles to dangerous toxins and pathogens that affect reproduction and survival (Schuyler et al. 2012; Duncan et al. 2019; Garrison et al. 2019; Guzzetti et al. 2018) . 7. Marine Mammals Marine mammals, including whales and seals, likewise ingest and may be harmed by microplastics and adsorbed contaminants. Such ingestion occurs directly as a consequence of feeding activity or through predation on contaminated prey (Zhu et al. 2019). There also exists the possibility that whales inhale microplastics when they surface to breathe (Nelms et al. 2019). In addition to leaching contaminants, microplastics can clog baleen, which imped es feeding behavior, reduc es body condition, and suppress es immune response (Guzz etti et al. 2018). Nelms et al. (2019) found evidence of a possible relationship between a cetacean's body burden of microplastics and cause of death \u2014specifically that animals dying from infectious disease contained a higher number of plastic particles than those dying from other causes. See also Donohue et al. 2019; Gall & Thompson 2015) (discussing microplastics' effects on seals and sea lions). c. Human health risks associated with marine microplastic pollution Marine species from plankton to invertebrates to large pelagic fishes have been shown to ingest microplastics (or prey that contain them) (Romeo et al. 2015). Thus, people who ingest aquatic plants or seafood may be exposed to dangerous levels of contaminants (U.S. EPA 2006). Scientists have yet to fully investigate the human hea lth implications of microplastic ingestion from fishes and other seafood , but it stands to be serious, especially given the prevalence of microplastics in fish caught and sold for human consumption both nationally and internationally (See, e.g., Van Cauwen berghe & Janssen 2014; Bergmann et al. 2015; Rochman et al. 2015; Herrera et al. 2019) . Robust medical evidence links various persistent organic pollutants commonly found on microplastics with a host of human illnesses , including cancers ( e.g., breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, non -Hodgkin's lymphoma, adult -onset leukemia, and soft tissue sarcomas), neurological disorders ( e.g., attention deficit disorder, impaired memory, learning disabilities, and behavioral 18 problems), and reproductive disorder s (e.g., menstrual disorders, abnormal sperm, miscarriages, pre-term delivery, low birth weight, altered sex ratios, and shortened lactation period s) (CIEL 2019 a). Many of these persistent organic pollutants bioaccumulate and biomagnify up the food chain, posing a risk of harm for higher trophic -level organisms , including humans (Wasserman et al. 1979; Gobas et al. 1995; Rochman et al. 2013). An additional human health concern from microplastic pollution relates to plastics' ability to harbor infectious age nts (Wright et al. 2013; Donohue et al. 2019; Mearns et al. 2013; CIEL 2019 a; Rodrigues et al. 2019) . Both viruses and bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Vibrio (which cause gastrointestinal illness in humans), find refuge on pellets. The potential f or microbial contamination -related impacts grows as coastal regions warm from climate change; such warming increases both the range of pathogenic microbes and the likelihood that storm surges and other events bring contaminated pellets into contact with humans (Rodrigues et al. 2019). Another concerning development is the discovery that microplastic is contaminating drinking water supplies. Scientists have only recently studied plastic pollution in freshwater, but it is now documented in groundwater (Pann o et al. 2019), and it is at least as ubiquitous in rivers and streams as it is in marine environments (Koelmans et al. 2019; McCormick et al. 2016). For example, a scientist recently swam the length of the Tennessee River \u2014the drinking water source for 4.7 million people \u2014and found one of the highest concentrations of microplastics in the world (Tennessee Aquarium 2018). Samples showed 18,000 particles per cubic meter of water, which is 8,000 percent higher than measurements in the Rhine and 80 percent highe r than measurements in the Yangtze River \u2014the source of 55 percent of all river -born microplastic entering the ocean ( Id.). Recent studies have also found microplastics at the outflows of drinking water treatment facilities, and in tap water, bottled wate r, and even domestic beer (Eerkes -Medrano et al. Koelmans et 2018; Pivokonsky et al. 2018; Novotna et al. 2019). The first study that looked at microplastics in bottled water found concentrations as high as 10,000 plastic pieces per litre of water, with only 17 of 259 bottles test ing free of microplastics (Kosuth et al. 2018). d. Ecological impacts from microplastics In addition to the wildlife and human health impacts just described, microplastic pollution impacts ecosystem s tructure and function (Guzzetti et al. 2018; CIEL 2019 b). For example, microplastics affect seafloor and open ocean habitats by altering biogeochemical cycles, including carbon storage (with implications for climate change) (Guzzetti et al. 2018; CIEL 2019 b). Microplastics affect nearshore and inshore environments \u2014such as sandy beaches \u2014 through sediment contamination (Rios et al. 2007; Oehlmann et al. 2009; Gall & Thompson 2015). The presence of microplastics also alters physical properties of beaches , including heat transfer and water movement (Carson et al. 2011; Gall & Thompson 2015). These changes may have broad ecological implications for a wide variety of beach dwelling organisms and their eggs\u2014including crustaceans, molluscs, fish, and sea turtle s\u2014and climate change may exacerbate 19 these impacts (Carson et al. 2011; Valenzuela et al. 2019). These concerns are not merely theoretical : researchers recently found anthropogenic marine debris, including plastics, at 10 loggerhead sea turtle nesting beach es\u2014including protected areas (Garrison et al. 2019). In addition , because plastics do not readily degrade, they become vehicles for invasive species dispersal \u2014effectively serving as a raft for exotic species transport and as a colonizing surface in areas o therwise lacking one (Barnes et al. 2009; Gregory 2009; Hammer et al. 2012; Mearns et al. 2013; Wright et al. 2013; Gall & Thompson 2015; Guzzetti et al. 2018) . These invasive organisms can prove devastating when they move into a new area, wiping out native species , and also harm ing human health and local economies ( see discussion on viruses and bacteria, supra ) (Barnes et al. 2009). Environmental plastic pollution also directly contributes to climate change (CIEL 2019 b). When plastic particles are exp osed to the elements, they slowly break down. Id. Photodegradation ( i.e., degradation caused by exposure to sunlight) of plastic triggers the production of greenhouse gases; this off -gassing increases as the plastic particles become smaller. Id. The breakd own of low -density polyethylene, in particular, releases methane, ethylene (C 2H4), ethane, and propylene at a high rate. Id. As more plastic accumulates in the environment, so too will greenhouse gas emissions from this source increase. Id. Finally, plasti c pollution litters our beaches, harming the aesthetic, recreational, tourism, and economic values of our waterways and seashores. 2. Wastewater Pollution Along with creating the global plastics pollution problem, petro -plastics facilities pollute the water ; harm sensitive aquatic environments and wildlife ; and jeopardize human health in the areas where they are sited . The processes that turn fossil fuels into plastic produce numerous chemical byproducts, many of which are toxic to humans and wildlife , and so me of which cause cancer (Siemens 2007; Environmental Law Institute 2018) . A number of these chemicals are so hazardous that they never should be released into the environment. Yet the permits issued to petro -plastics operations allow just that \u2014the discharge of liquid waste streams laden with myriad hazardous chemical compounds into our rivers, streams, and oceans. In humans, these compounds are known to cause various cancers ; damage DNA ; increase inflammation ; induce reproductive harms , including fatal embryonic malformations ; disrupt hormone systems ; and/or damage key organs , including the brain, liver, and kidneys. In non- human animals \u2014including invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals \u2014 chemical exposure leads to many of the same problems: impaired reproduction, DNA damage, liver disorders, altered blood chemistry, immune deficiency, cancers, and death. The discussion that follows highlights some of the extremely toxic chemicals that petro - plasti cs facilities are permitted to discharge into the environment. However, these are only a handful of more than 150 compounds listed across a representative sample of NDPES permits for petro -plastics plants. The permitted discharges include substances rangin g from oil and grease to potent carcinogens. Here , we review a small subset of these contaminants and their known or suspected effects on living organisms \u2014polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) ; benzene 1,3-butadiene ; lead; and dioxin \u2014most of which EPA already considers Priority Pollutants (a subset of known toxic pollutants for which EPA has published analytical test methods). a. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) Many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)14 are carcinogenic, cause organ damage, and/or suppress the immune system. They also comprise one of the most ubiquitous classes of compounds that industrial facilities discharge into the air15 and water (CWQG PAHs 1999 ). EPA lists 17 PAHs as Priority Pollutants, including a number of chemicals commonly found in NPDES permits associated with petro -plastic s facilities Eisler 1987 ; Kannan & Perrotta 2008 ). The toxicity of PAHs has long been known. The scientific community first identified the carcinogenic nature of benzo( a)pyrene in 1918 . Albers 2003 and a 1987 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Report called PAHs \"among the most potent carcinogens known to exist, producing tumors in some organisms through single exposures to microgram quantities.\" (Eisler 1987 , at 4). When metabolized, PAHs byproducts can cause a host of problems in humans and animals , including inflammation, suppressed immune system function, endocrine (hormone) system disruption, genotoxicity, embryotoxicity, mutation, developmenta l malformations, tumors, and cancer (specifically , lung, skin, gastrointestinal, and bladder cancers) (Abdel -Shafy et al. 2016 ; Albers 2003; Albers & Loughlin 2003 ; Collier et al. 2014 ; Kabir et al. 2015 ; Kannan & Perrotta 2008 ; Rengarajan et al. 2015 ; Tro isi et al. 2016). As in humans, PAHs induce a wide variety of detrimental effects in aquatic organisms , including reproductive harm, compromised immune system function, cancer, and death (Eisler 1987 ; Albers 2003 ). These harms impact species across taxa, f rom bacteria to invertebrates, fish to reptiles, birds to mammals. Aquatic organisms exposed to PAHs may exhibit reduced growth ; deformities ; endocrine disruption ; inhibited reproduction and reduced survival of young ; toxicity to embryos ; suppressed immune systems ; liver and kidney toxicity ; cancers ; and mortality (Albers 2003; Albers & Loughlin 2003 ; Bell et , at 463 -64; Eisler 1987 ; Collier et al. 2014 ; Cousin & Cachot 2014 ; CWQG PAHs 1999 ; Goodale 2013 ; Malcolm & Shore 2003 ; Meador et al. 1995 ; Payne et al. 2003 ; Reynolds & Wetzel; Troisi et al. 2016 ; Zychowski et al. 2017). The most striking evidence for the effect of PAHs on marine mammals comes from an eight -year study on St. Lawrence Estuary beluga whales ( Delphinapterus leuc as). A quarter of 14 PAHs \"are aromatic hydrocarbons with two or more fused carbon rings that have hydrogen or an alkyl . . . group attached to each carbon.\" Albers 2002, at 343. 15 Even PAHs discharged into the air may ultimately contaminate water via deposition. \"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons released into the atmosphere have a strong affinity for airborne organic particles and can be moved great distances by air currents. The molecu les are eventually transported to earth as wet or dry particulate deposition.\" Albers 2002, at 347. 16 Naphthalene contains two coplanar six -member rings that share an edge. Technically, it is a \"bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon\" (Abdel -Shafy et al. 2016; Reng arajan et al. 2015), but it is often analyzed as a PAH. (Collier et al. 2014). 21 adult St. Lawrence Estuary belugas \u2014which are exposed to PAHs through the ingestion of contaminated worms \u2014die from cancer. (Albers & Loughlin 2003 ; Martineau 2012) . b. Benzene Benzene (C6H6) is a monocyclic aromatic compound that is a known \u2014and notorious \u2014 carcinogen for all routes of exposure (CSQG Benzene 2004 ; PHS Benzene ; NIH Benzene ). Nonetheless, EPA and state agencies often permit petro -plastics facilities to discharge benzene pursuant to their NPDES permits. Benzene exposure from petro -plastics pollution can cause cancer (including lymphoma) and other harmful effects in humans, fish, and wildlife. Effects of short -term exposure to benzene through inhalation are dose -dependent \u2014ranging from drowsiness, dizziness, rapid heart rate, he adaches, tremors , and confusion to unconsciousness and death (PHS Benzene ; NIH Benzene ). Longer term exposure can lead to hematologic neoplasm ; blood disorders , including myelodysplastic syndrome, and well as cancer (specifically , Hodgkin's lymphoma and other types of lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers ; acute myelogenous leukemia ; and chronic lymphocytic leukemia) (CSQG Benzene 2004 ; PHS Benzene ; NIH Benzene ). Animal studies suggest that benz ene also increases the risks for other forms of cancers, including oral and nasal, forestomach, liver, preputial gland, ovary, lung, and mammary gland (NIH Benzene ). Reproductive organ harm may also occur with prolonged exposure, and laboratory studies on animals show benzene exposure can cause fetal harm resulting in low birth weight, delayed bone formation, and bone marrow damage (PHS Benzene ; NIH Benzene ). Both benzene and its metabolites are genotoxic, inducing effects such as chromosomal aberrations in peripheral lymphocytes and bone marrow (PHS Benzene ). They also serve as immunosuppressants (Id.). Benzene is toxic to a number of aquatic organisms. For example, benzene has been shown to be toxic to juvenile striped bass ( Morone saxatilis )\u2014inducing res piratory effects and potentially causing death by narcosis, acute anemia, or ventricular fibrillation (Meyerhoff 1975 ; Norton et al. 1985) . Benzene sensitivity sharply increases during embryonic development in pink salmon and coho salmon ( Oncorhynchus kisu tch), with the egg stage being least sensitive, alevin stage moderately sensitive, and emergent stage most sensitive (Moles 1979) . This is attributed to benzene sequestration in and then liberation from the yolk sac as it is absorbed. Id. Outmigrants of pink salmon, sockeye (i.e., those transitioning to seawater) are twice as sensitive to benzene as those residing in freshwater (Moles 1979) . Struhsaker (1977) found that spawning females are extremely se nsitive to low levels of benzene. She also found that benzene, which is highly lipid -soluble, accumulates to high levels in ovarian eggs. This, in turn, leads to reduced fecundity and possible significant long -term population -level effects (Struhsaker 1977 ). Benzene also le ads to behavioral effects in both males and females (Id.). 22 Exposure of herring and anchovy larvae to benzene resulted in delayed egg development and abnormalities in larvae ; delayed larvae development ; decreased feeding and growth ; and increased respiration (NIH Benzene ). Benzene also harms shellfish. For example, blue crab juveniles exposed to sublethal concentrations of benzene needed substantially more time to complete a molt cycle, had a slower rate of growth of regenerating li mb buds, and exhibited depressed ATPase activity in mitochondria. Exposure also decreased the crabs' oxygen consumption (NIH Benzene ). c. Phthalate s Petro-plastics plants also commonly discharge phthalate s, a term encompassing a wide variety of compounds that are best known as endocrine disruptors (Barse et al. 2007 ; Kabir et al. 2015 ). These compounds can cause reproductive and developmental toxicity (NIH DEP ). Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is one of the most commonly employed chemicals used to make plastics more flexible. (ATSDR DEHP; Rowdhwal & Chen 2018). Annual global production of DEHP is approximately 2 million tons. (Rowdhwal & Chen 2018). As a class, phthalates have come under scrutiny for the ir role as endocrine disruptors. Di(2 -ethylhexyl phthalate) is known to disrupt the endocrine system as well as the immune system, and is classified as a probable human carcinogen. (ATSDR DEHP; Rowdhwal & Chen 2018). DEHP has been linked to cardiac irregul arities; it also induces brain, kidney, and liver toxicity in rodents. (Rowdhwal & Chen 2018). In aquatic ecosystems, DEHP adsorbs to sediments and may persist in this state or be taken up by aquatic biota. It is \"biodegraded very slowly in algae, larvae, snails, and clams\" and \"rapidly biomagnified by a variety of plants and animals\" in lipid tissue (Metcalf et al. 1973). Some researchers have likened its behavior to DDT and cautioned that further study and regulations governing its use a re warranted. ( Id.) Barse et al (2007) evaluated physiological effects of phthalate (DEP) on the common carp (Cyprinus carpio ). The researchers found myriad effects of DEP on carp, including increased liver size, decreased testis size, and increas ed levels of muscle vitellogenin in males (vitellogenin is normally synthesized in the liver of adult, female egg -laying vertebrates) (Barse et al. 2007). These findings corroborate those of other researchers that DEP imitates estrogen and acts as a potent endocrine disruptor (Id.). DEP also acts as bluegill sunfish ( Lepomis a high to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms (NIH DEP). d. Acrylonitrile Many petro -plastics facilities disch arge acrylonitrile, a highly toxic and carcinogenic compound that has been linked to brain damage in rodents and fish (EPA Acrylonitrile; NIH Acrylonitrile; Lin et al. 2018) . Acrylonitrile is a confirmed carcinogen (NIH Acrylonitrile ). Human workers exposed to acrylonitrile showed a statistically significant increase in lung and colon cancers (NIH Acrylonitrile; NTP Acrylonitrile ). Rats exposed to the compound developed malignant tumors of the brain and spinal cord (EPA Acrylonitrile; NIH Acrylonitril e). Malignant tumors of the stomach, tongue, eye, lung, ear canal , and small intestine also have been observed , 23 as well as the mammary gland and ovary in females , and in (EPA Acrylonitrile ). Rats exposed to acrylonitrile by inhalation gave birth to pups with fetal malformations , including missing or incompletely -formed vertebrae, a hole in the belly button through which abdominal organs (e.g., intestines) protrude, short tail, and short trunk (NIH Acrylonitri le). Reproductive harms were observed in mice exposed to acrylonitrile, including degenerative changes in testicular tubules and decreased sperm count (Id.). Acrylonitrile is harmful to aquatic organisms and has a moderate potential for bioaccumulation (NIH Acrylonitrile ). In a recent study, Lin et al (2018) observed the effects of acrylonitrile on juvenile flounder ( Paralichthys olivaceus ). Exposure reduced juvenile growth rates and led to tail deformation and, more alarmingly, DNA damage in the brain (Lin et al. 2018 ). This study highlights the potential of acrylonitrile to cause significant ecotoxicological effects. e. Trichloroethylene Trichloroethylene is another toxic and carcinogenic compound that petro -plastics facilities discharg e. It is a chlorinated hydrocarbon that contaminates up to a third of U.S. drinking water supplies (NIH Trichloroethylene). Chronic exposure can lead to sleepiness, dizziness, headache, and nausea. Scientists also suspect that trichloroethylene is an immune system toxicant and causes genetic defects (NIH Trichloroethylene; PHS Trichloroethylene). Residential proximity to industrial emissions of chlorinated solvents, including trichloroethylene, may be associated with miscarriage and birth defects , including he art defects, central nervous system defects, and low birth weight (NIH Trichloroethylene). Human exposure to trichloroethylene is linked to neurological impairment ; liver damage and cancer ; kidney damage and cancer ; cervical cancer ; cardiotoxicity ; non-Hodgkin lymphoma , Trichloroethylene ). Rodents exposed to trichloroethylene show an increased incidence of leukemia and tumors of blood -producing organs, lungs, liver, kidney, mammary glands, t estes, and pituitary gland (EPA Trichloroethylene; NIH Trichloroethylene ). Long -term exposure in rodents also results in increased liver weight, increased kidney weight, and renal dysfunction (NIH Trichloroethylene ). Trichloroethylene exposure produces lo ng-lasting, harmful effects on aquatic life (NIH Trichloroethylene ). Many aquatic species suffer harm upon trichloroethylene exposure. For example, aquatic invertebrates exposed to trichloroethylene experienced genetic effects that impaired metabolism, rep roduction, and growth (NIH Trichloroethylene ). Goldfish ( Carassius auratus ) exposed to trichloroethylene showed significantly reduced body weight and disease - associated tissue changes, while exposed fathead minnows displayed hemorrhaging and behavioral cha nges, including lost schooling behavior, swimming in a corkscrew/spiral pattern near the water's surface, and hyperactivity a dioxin -like chlorinated toxic to humans and aquatic life (NIH Hexachlorobenzene ). It is one of the most persistent environmental pollutants both on 24 land and in water due to its stability and resistance to degradation (PHS Hexachlorobenzene ). EPA classifies hexachlorobenzene as a probable human carci nogen based on animal testing showing an association between oral exposure and thyroid, liver, and kidney cancers (NIH Hexachlorobenzene ). Breast cancer models indicate that hexachlorobenzene exposure leads to metastasis (Chiappini et al. 2019 ). Reproduct ive harms also are associated with exposure, as is liver disease (NIH Hexachlorobenzene ). Hexachlorobenzene crosses the placenta and accumulates in fetal tissue, causing harm to developing embryos (including neurological, immune system, and liver damage , as well as physical malformations). It poses a risk to children exposed via breast milk and to young children exposed via contaminated food (NIH Hexachlorobenzene ). When released into water, hexachlorobenzene adsorbs, or sticks, to suspended sediments and so lids, increasing its persistence in the aquatic environment (NIH Hexachlorobenzene ). Once in the aquatic environment, hexachlorobenzene readily bioaccumulates (and may also biomagnify) in aquatic organisms , including plants, fish, shellfish, birds, and mam mals (PHS Hexachlorobenzene; NIH Hexachlorobenzene ). Its bioaccumulative properties made hexachlorobenzene a candidate for monitoring in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Pesticide Monitoring Program and in the National Study of Chemical Residu es in Fish (PHS Hexachlorobenzene ). This study revealed that the highest body burdens of hexachlorobenzene in fish were found near industrial facilities (PHS Hexachlorobenzene ). Bays feeding into the Gulf of Mexico \u2014a region targeted as sites for a number of new and expanded petro -plastics facilities \u2014already harbor concentrations of hexachlorobenzene sufficient to cause bioaccumulation in fish and shellfish. Scientists have measured such contamination in flounder (species unspecified), longnose ki collected near San Luis Pass of Bay, Texas, and in oysters ( Crassotrea virginica ) in the Houston (PHS Hexachlorobenzene ). Across animal species, hexachlorobenzene acts as a reproductive toxicant and endocrine disruptor, affecting the production of steroid and sex hormones , including thyroid hormone, progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol (Chiappini et al. 2019; Sun et al. 2019). Effects of such disruption in laboratory animals (rats and quail) include reduced egg production and endometriosis (Chiappini et al. 2019; Sun et al. 2019). g. Carbon Tetrachloride Carbon tetrachloride is a toxic compound that depresses central nervous system activity, causes liver and kidney damage, and is a probable human carcinogen (NIH Carbon Tetrachloride; PHS Carbon Tetrachloride ). Studies in laboratory animals show a relationship between carbon tetrachloride exposure and tumors of the liver and adrenal gland; there also exists evidence to suggest a relationship between humans exposed to carbon tetrachloride and liver cancer, lymphosarcoma, lymphatic leukemia, non -Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma Tetrachloride; PHS Carbon Tetrachloride ). Reproductive harms , including decreased fertility and testes degeneration , also have been observed in animals exposed to carbon tetrachloride, and in -utero exposure through drinking water may lead to low birth 25 weight , cleft palate , and other adverse birth outcomes (NIH Carbon Tetrachloride; PHS Carbon Tetrachloride ). While it tends to evaporate quickly, carbon tetrachloride can be found in surface water s and groundwater , posing a hazard to aquatic life (NIH Carbon Tetrachloride ). While bioaccumulation is not common, it is possible where exposure is constant (e.g., near discharge sites) (PHS Carbon Tetrachloride ). Carbon tetrachloride appears to be more h azardous to embryo -larval stages of fish and amphibians than to adults; this is of particular concern near areas of industrial discharge (NIH Carbon Tetrachloride ). Carbon tetrachloride causes liver damage in fish, including the common carp ( Cyprinus carpi o) and et al. 2005; ). h. Methyl Chloride Methyl chloride (chloromethane) produces a wide variety of wildlife and human health harms. High -concentration, acute exposure in humans causes severe neur ological effects, as well as effects on heart rate, blood pressure, liver, and kidneys (NIH Methyl Chloride ). Chronic exposure in animals induces liver, kidney (including tumors), spleen, and central nervous system effects (NIH Methyl Chloride ). Rainbow tr out and common carp also develop liver damage after exposure to methyl chloride (Yin et al. 2011; Jia et al. 2012 ). Studies done on rats reveal reproductive harms , including testicular lesions and decreased sperm production (NIH Methyl Chloride ). A growing body evidence indicates a potential role of methyl chloride as a carcinogen. Exposure preceded development of liver and adrenal tumors and abnormal tissue masses in mice and rats (Yin et al. 2011 ). One additional study on male mice reported kidney tumors (NIH Methyl Chloride ). In vitro studies suggest that atmospheric concentrations of 1 percent methyl chloride induce DNA damage and mutations to human lymphoid cells (NIH Methyl Chloride ). An increased occurrence of salivary gland tumors also has b een observed in humans after exposure to methyl chloride (NIH Methyl Chloride ). i. Acute exposure to 1,2,4 -trichlorobenzene results in shortness of breath and lung irritation in animals. ( NIH 1,2,4 -Trichlorobenzene). Rats subjected to long -term exposure to 1,2,4 - trichlorobenzene developed liver problems and enlarged adrenal glands. (NIH 1,2,4 - Trichlorobenzene). Mice exposed on their skin developed tum ors. (EPA 1,2,4 - Trichlorobenzene). 1,2,4 -trichlorobenzene has been deemed very toxic to aquatic life. (NIH 1,2,4 - Trichlorobenzene). Once released into water, some of the compound will volatilize and some will adsorb to sediments. PHS 1,2,4 -Trichlorobenzene). It easily bioaccumulates in fish and other aquatic life, posing a risk to humans that ingest contaminated freshwater or marine organisms. (NIH 1,2,4 -Trichlorobenzene; PHS 1,2,4 -Trichlorobenzene). j. 1,3-Butadiene Ninety -five p ercent of global butadiene production comes from steam cracking of hydrocarbons to produce ethylene. (IARC 1,3 -Butadiene). This substance \u2014the 36th highest volume chemical produced in the U.S. \u2014then can be used to make, inter alia , polymers, plastics and 1,3 -Butadiene). Short -term human exposure to 1,3 -butadiene causes irritation to the eyes and respiratory tract and, depending on the dose, central nervous system depression. (NIH 1,3 -Butadiene). Long - term exposure may dam age bone marrow and cause heritable genetic damage to eggs and sperm. (Id.). 1,3 -butadiene is a known human carcinogen (specifically with respect to leukemias) and causes a host of neoplasms in animals including heart, lung, forestomach, liver, Harderian g Lead poses well -known dangers to humans and wildlife. These harms are associated with even lo w levels of lead exposure. (NIH Lead). Such effects include neurotoxicity; gastrointestinal, kidney and bone marrow toxicity; and neurodevelopmental defects. (NIH Lead). The EPA classifies lead as a probable human carcinogen. (NIH Lead). Heavy metals inclu ding lead are some of the most widespread, toxic, and persistent contaminants in aquatic ecosystems. (Jackson, Baird & Els 2005). Some of the main sources of heavy metal pollution include industrial effluents and industrial sewage. (Jackson, Baird & Els 2005). Once released, these metals do not biodegrade into inert substances; they remain in the aquatic environment and pose an ongoing exposure concern to aquatic biota. (Jackson, Baird & Els 2005). Aquatic flora and fauna (including crustaceans, molluscs, and fish) bioaccumulate lead. (Jackson, Baird & Els 2005; Carocci et al. 2015). Adverse effects occur at concentrations as low as 0.2 mg/l. (Jackson, Baird & Els 2005). l. Dioxins EPA has neglected to set effluent limitations for dioxins, a highly toxic grou p of persistent environmental pollutant s. This omission is unconscionable given dioxins' known toxicity to humans and wildlife (WHO Dioxins ). Dioxin is p erhaps best known as a contaminant of Agent Orange \u2014an herbicide the United States broadly used during the Vietnam War that caused myriad health impacts on exposed veterans and Vietnamese . \"Dioxins are highly toxic and can cause cancer, reproductive and developmental problems, damage to the immune system, and can interfere with hormones.\" (EPA Dioxin Facts ). These compounds break down extremely slowly in the environment, underscoring the importance of preventing additional releases (EPA Dioxin Facts ). According to the National Institutes of Health, \" [e]xposure to dioxins has widespread effects in nearly every vertebrate species, at nearly every stage of development, including in the womb. \" (NIH Dioxins ). Short -term human exposure to dioxins may result in skin lesions and liver problems (WHO Dioxins ). Long -term exposure impairs immune system function ; nervous 27 system development in fetuses and children ; the endocrine system ; and reproduction (NIH Dioxins; WHO Dioxins ). The World Health Organization classifies dioxins as a \"known human carcinogen\" based on animal studies (WHO Dioxins ). Exposure also is linked to other diseases , including type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease (NIH Dioxins ). Table 4. Summary of Subset of Plastics Facility Pollutants With Known Toxic Effects Chemical Name Known Toxic Effects to Animal and/or Human Life 1,2,4 - Trichlorobenzene Shortness of breath; adrenal glands; bioaccumulation in fish and other aquatic life 1,3-Butadiene Cancer; depression of nervous system activity; reproductive harms Acrylonitrile Cancer; brain damage; reproductive harm Benzene Human and animal carcinogen; acute toxicity (mortality); blood disorders; reproductive harm; compromised immune system functions Carbon Tetrachloride Depression of nervous system activity; li ver and kidney damage; tumors; probable human carcinogen; phthalate system disruption; brain, kidney, and liver toxicity; probably human carcinogen Dioxins Immunotoxicity; thyroid and adrenal gland enlargement; mammary and harms; disruption marrow toxicity; and neurodevelopmental defects Methyl chloride Neurological harm; effects on heart rate, blood pressure, liver, spleen, and kidneys; testicular lesions and decreased sperm production; evidence of carcinogen ic effects Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) Acute toxicity (mortality); reproductive harm; compromised immune system function; cancer Trichloroethylene Altered metabolism, reproduction and growth; genetic effects; reduced body weight; tissue damage; behavioral effects; hemorrhaging 28 Dioxins bioaccumulate in fatty tissues, and these concentrations biomagnify up the food chain (WHO Dioxins ). Human exposure largely occurs through ingestion of contaminated food, including fish and shellfis h (WHO Dioxins ). Dioxins from chemical factory discharges also contaminate drinking water sources (EPA Dioxin Facts ). EPA must act, setting effluent limitations for this highly toxic pollutant to prevent additional discharges into our environment. While dioxin discharges from each factory ostensibly are capped by the facility's NPDES permit, sampling is infrequent (sometimes only once per year) so it is hard to know whether overall effluent limits are being exceeded. Further, with the significant projected increase in petro -plastics facilities in the United States, the total volume of chemical discharges will increase proportionally. The health and ecological risks of these chemicals outweigh our nation's need for more plastics facilities. And the risks of the plastics facilities do not stop with their production. The plastic pellets themselves present a host of environmental problems. 3. Environmental Justice Concerns As noted above, m any of the new and expanded petro -plastics facilities are being built in minority and low-income communities already suffer ing from high pollution levels; incidences of cancer, illness, and other health and environmental impacts ; depreciating property values ; and declining public services due to exist ing industrial facilities, terminals, and pipelines clustered in the same areas. A recent EPA report concluded that African -Americans and individuals living below the poverty level are more likely than others to live near pollution -emitting facilities, and that the racial correlation was stronger than the poverty -based one (Mikati 2018). One community in Texas illustrates this reality all too well. The historic African -American community of West Port Arthur is surrounded by oil refineries \u2014including the largest one in the country \u2014several petrochemical facilities, and an incinerator complex that handles up to 150,000 tons of hazardous and toxic waste per year. Total and No vealis Holdings Chemicals launched construction of a one million ton/year ethane cracker in Port Arthur in 2018 (Stickney 2018). Saudi Aramco's Motiva is in the planning stages of a multi -billion dollar expansion of its Port Arthur refinery to add a steam cracker to produce ethylene, with construction to begin in 2020 and operations in 2022 (pending regulatory approvals) (Luck 2018). Port Arthur also happens to be the end-of-the-line for the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline and the target for more industrial development , including a Port Arthur LNG liquification and export terminal and approximately 170 miles of pipeline (FERC 2019). Even with the heavy presence of industry, the community has a high unemployment rate . It also has a depressed economy ; higher than average pollution and illness rates ; and vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and extreme weather events (Stephenson 2014). For example , recent hurricanes devastated Port Arthur , and one petro -plastic s facility run by BASF TOTAL Petrochemic als was responsible for the single biggest post -Harvey wastewater spill, with over 100 million gallons released into neighboring communities and waterways connecting to the Gulf (Stuckey 2017). 29 St. James Parish, Louisiana , is another community that has se en its surrounding agricultur al lands increasingly occupied by petrochemical and other industrial facilities. Among the many new industrial projects targeting this community is the Formosa Plastics project , which is in the permitting stage for its new St. James Parish, Louisiana , location on the banks of the Mississippi River. This new Formosa plant will crack ethane, dehydrogenate propane, and produce the following end products: - Ethylene - Propylene - Ethylene glycol - Polypropylene - Various types of polyethylene (e.g., high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LPDE), and linear low -density polyethylene (LLDPE). (FG LA LLC 2018). There are a dozen other significant sources of air and water pollution clustered around th e predominatel y African -American community of St. James' 5th district.17 The region is so overburdened by industrial pollution that it has been nicknamed \"Cancer Alley.\" As a result of the concentration of petrochemical facilities around their communities, residents \u2014prim arily minority and low -income individuals \u2014are more vulnerable to cancer, autoimmune issues, and respiratory illnesses; decreasing property values; and disappearing public services (Rolfes 2018). EPA estimates that residents within a five-mile radius of the proposed Formosa Plastics facility are in the 99th percentile for the risk of cancer from air pollution when compared to the state, the rest of EPA Region 5, and the country (EJ Screen). EJScreen shows that 442 people live within a mile radius of the Proj ect site and 100 percent of them are black, with an average 17 Petro -plastics facilities discharge dozens of criteria, hazardous, and toxic air pollutants that are known to cause cancer and a host of other respiratory, neurological, dermatological, reproductive, and developmental illnesses. They also result in the at mospheric deposition of pollutants, exacerbate climate change, and reduce the ability of coastal areas to withstand future floods and severe weather (ATSFR 2018; Belli et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2018; Clean Air Council 2014; de Moraes et al. 2010; Globa l 2009; et Marinaccio 2011; Pasetto al. 2012; RTI 2015; Rovira Salerno et al. 2013; Shrum 2018; Suh 2000; Tsai et al. 2009 ; White et al. 2009; Wichmann et al. 2009;Yang et al. 2000; Yang et al. 2004; Yu et al. 2006). 30 per capita income of $20,876. The EJ Indexes for Diesel PM, Air Toxics Cancer Risk, Lead Paint Indicator, and Wastewater Discharge Indicator for the people who live within one mile of the project are all above 90 percent for the state . In other words , 90 percent of Louisiana residents have less exposure to these pollutants than the residents who live near the proposed Formosa facility. If this Formosa Plastics project is approved, low -income and mi nority populations would again bear the brunt of the air pollution, wastewater pollution, chemical spill risks, traffic, lighting, noise, odor, and aesthetic impacts of an other industrial project. III. EPA's Duty to Regulate Petro -plastics Facilities unde r the Clean Water Act The goal of the Clean Water Act is to eliminate the discharge of pollutants into waterways and \"to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.\"18 The Act seeks to guarantee \"water qual ity which provides for the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and provides for recreation . . . .\"19 To achieve these goals of eliminating water pollution and restoring water quality, the Clean Water Act prohibits \"the discharge of any pollutant by any person.\"20 It focuses on two types of controls for point source discharges of pollutants: (1) water quality -based controls that are established through state water quality standards, including numeric and narrative criteria; and (2) technology -based controls, implemented through Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards that EPA establishe s for industrial categories and subcategor ies regardless of their location across the country. Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for petro -plastics facilities are the focus of this petition. A. EPA's Duty to Establish Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for Stormwater EPA has t he authority and obligation to ensure that our nation's waterways, wildlife, and communities are not polluted by stormwater runoff from industrial facilities. Industrial stormwater results when rain and runoff comes in contact with industrial manufacturing , processing, or storage and then runs offsite and enters drainage systems or receiving waters. In light of the Act's expressed goal of eliminating the discharge of pollutants into the nation's waters,21 EPA must ensure that plastic (including but not limit ed to pellets, resins, flakes, granules, and powders) produced by petro -plastics facilities do not enter into the nation's waterways via stormwater runoff. In 1987, Congress amended the Clean Water Act to significantly expand the NPDES program to include industrial stormwater runoff conveyed directly through outfalls to receiving waters or indirectly through municipal separate storm sewer systems. In those areas under EPA's permitting authority, permitting is currently available under the agency's Multi -Sector General Permit for industrial stormwater discharges.22 The Multi -Sector General Permit covers over 4,000 facilities nationwide and includes industrial stormwater discharges associated with 18 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a). 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a). 22 See EPA website, Stormwater Discharges from Industrial Activities, https://www.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater - discharges -industrial -activities#msgpdocuments (last visited July 15, 2019 . 31 \"Chemical Manufacturing and Refining,\" which encompasses the pr oduction of plastics, synthetic resins , and other synthetics (SIC 2821 -2824) (EPA 2006).23 It serves as a model for states with delegated permitting authority (NAS 2019). Obtaining coverage under either EPA's Multi -Sector General Permit or a state industri al stormwater permit requires the applicant to develop a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan, a written assessment of potential sources of pollutants in stormwater runoff, and effluent limitations and/or Best Management Practices to minimize the discharge of pollutants in runoff from the site.24 B. EPA's Duty to Establish Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for Industrial Wastewater Pursuant to the Clean Water Act , EPA is required to establish Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards that are national in scope and based on pollutant reductions that can be achie ved by using available pollution treatment and prevention technologies. The Act defines effluent limitations as \"any restriction established by a State or the Administrator on quantities, rates, and concentrations of chemical, physical, biological, and other constituents which are discharged from point sources into navigable waters . . . .\"25 In general, EPA establishes technology -based Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standar ds for pollutants by evaluating (1) industry practices, (2) the characteristics of the discharges, and (3) the effectiveness and costs of demonstrated wastewater pollution control and treatment technologies.26 These technologies can include in -plant process and procedure changes, operating methods, end -of-pipe technologies, and other alternatives. Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards apply to industrial facilities that discharge pollutants directly to surface water and discharge pollutants indirec tly to surface waters through publicly owned treatment works. For direct dischargers, EPA or states authorized to administer the NPDES program must incorporate the Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards into NPDES permits.27 The Clean Water Act limit s the duration of NPDES permits to five years. Clean Water Act regulations establish technology -based numeric limitations for specific pollutants at the following levels of control for each industrial category:28 23See also National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit Application Regulations for Storm Water Discharges, 55 Fed. Reg. 47,990 (Nov. 16, 1990) (codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.26). 24 EPA Office of Water, EPA -833-F-06-018, December 2006, Industrial Stormwater Fact Sheet Series, Sector C: Chemical and Allied Products Manufacturing and Refining, https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015 - 10/documents/sector_c_c hemical.pdf 27 Id. \u00a7 1342. EPA has authorized most states to administer all or part of the NPDES permitting program, leaving EPA the permitting authority for industrial facilities in only a few states (Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico), the District of Columbia, as well as most territories. 28 Id. \u00a7 1314. 32 - Best Conventional Pollutant Control Technology (BCT) for conventional pollutants : Technology -based standard for discharge s from existing industrial point sources of conventional pollutants , including Biological Oxygen Demand , Total Suspended Solids, fecal coliform, pH, oil , and grease. The B CT is established in light of a two -part cost reasonableness test, which compares the cost for an industry to reduce its pollutant discharge with the cost to a publicly owned treatment facility for similar levels of reduction of a pollutant loading. The se cond test examines the cost -effectiveness of additional industrial treatment beyond BPT. EPA must find limits that are reasonable under both tests before establishing them as BCT. - Best Practicable Control Technology Currently Available (BPT) for all pollu tants : The first level of technology standards established under the Clean Water Act to control pollutants discharged to waters of the U nited States. BPT limitations are generally based on the average of the best existing performance by plants within an industrial category or subcategory. EPA looks at a number of factors when defining BPT, including the total cost of applying the control technology in relation to the effluent reduction benefits ; the age of the equipment and facilities ; processes employed by the industry and any required process change ; engineering aspects of the control technologies ; non-water quality environmental impacts, including en ergy requirements ; and other factors as EPA deems appropriate. - Best Available Technology Economically Available (BAT) for priority (toxic) and nonconventional pollutants : Technology standard s established under the Clean Water Act as the most appropriate means available on a national basis for controlling the direct discharge of toxic and nonconventional pollutants to navigable waters. BAT limitations in effluent guidelines, in general, represent the best existing performance of treatment technologies that are economically achievable within an industrial point source category or subcategory. - New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for new sources and all pollutants : Based on the best available demonstrated control technology (BADT) for conventional, toxic, and nonconventional pollutants. NSPS represents the most stringent controls attainable through the application BADT and may prohibit the discharge of pollutants. - Pretreatment Standards for New Sources (PSNS) and Existing Sources (PSES) : Apply to indirect discharges of nonconventional and priority pollutants to publicly owned treatment works . (EPA 2010) . 33 Figure 2 . Regulations for Direct and Indirect Wastewater Discharges. Source : EPA 2016 Effluent Limitations Guidelines Review, Figure 2.5, at 2-12. Along with numerical effluent limitations, NPDES permits contain monitoring , reporting, and other requirements necessary to comply with the Clean Water Act . In terms of monitoring, all NPDES permits must specify the (1) requirements for use, mainten ance, and installation of monitoring equipment and methods ; (2) required monitoring , including type, interval s, and frequency ; and (3) \"[a]pplicable reporting requirements based on the impact of the regulated activity. \"29 Compliance monitoring for NPDES permits largely takes place at the state level , with states reporting their data to EPA . EPA can also define and include \"Best Management Practices\" as permit conditions in place of or with effluent limitations to prevent o r control the discharge of pollutants. They may be included , for example , where numeric limitations are deemed infeasible. Best Management Practices are defined as schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and other manage ment practices to prevent or reduce the pollution of waters of the United States. They can include treatment requirements ; operating procedures ; and practices to control runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw material storage.30 29 40 C.F.R. dischargers). 34 C. Current Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for Plastic Production Petroleum Refining . EPA developed Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Petroleum Refining Point Source category in 1974 and last updated them in 198 5.31 The Petroleum Refining category covers wastewater discharges at over 140 refineries across the country , according to EPA. Subpart B of the Petroleum Refining category applies to facilities involved in cracking, one of the many processes performed at Petrol eum Refining facilities. Subpart C, the Petrochemical Subcategory, also applies to facilities that perform cracking, but adds specific requirements as a result of the particular refined products included in that subcategor y. EPA defines \"petrochemical oper ations\" as the production of second -generation petrochemicals (i.e. alcohols, ketones, cumene, styrene, etc.) or first -generation petrochemicals and isomerization products (i.e. olefins) when 15 percent or more of refinery production consists of first-generation petrochemicals and isomerization products .32 These refineries therefore can produce the monomers essential to making plastic , including ethylene and propylene . EPA currently regulates a surprisingly small number of wastewater pollutants under the Petroleum Refining category given the other pollutants these facilities discharge , the changing nature of these facilities and their feedstocks, and emerging pollutants of concern . The first column of Table 5 below lists the pollutants the EPA regulate s for the Petroleum Refining category subpart for Cracking and the pollutants currently regulated under the Organic Chemicals, Plastics, and Synthetic Fibers industrial category subpart for Thermoplastic Resins, discussed in more detail infra . Table 5. Regulated Pollutants under Part 419 Petroleum Refining (Cracking Subpart) and 414 Plastics (Thermoplastic Resins Subpart) Petroleum Refining Subpart B Cracking (40 C.F.R.

End-of-pipe treatment consists of treatment of process wastewaters directly prior to final discharge to receiving waters. In -plant technologies are considered part of the overall refining process and consist of treatment technologies employed before discharg ing to the end -of-pipe treatment facility . Table 6. Part 419 Petroleum Refinery In -Plant and End -of Pipe BAT Part 419 In-Plant BAT Part 419 End-of-Pipe BAT - Steam strippers (for sulfide, ammonia, and VOC removal from sour waters) - Elimination of once -through barometric condenser water through use of surface condensers or recycle streams - Storm sewer and once -through cooling water segregation from process wastewater streams to avoid unnecessary treatm ent of unpolluted waters - Elimination of polluted once -through cooling water, by monitoring and repair of surface condensers or use of wet and dry recycle systems - Flow Equalization - Additional oil separation through use of dissolved air flotation (DAF) - Biological treatment ( Biochemical Oxygen Demand , Chemical Oxygen Demand and Total Organic Carbon removal) - Effluent polishing (e.g. sand filters, polishing ponds) Effluent limitations for the Petroleum Refining category were established for \"contaminated stormwater runoff\" in 1985 due to a settlement between the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and EPA .42 The rule established BPT, BCT, and BAT effluent limitation s guidelines for contaminated runoff.43 \"Runoff\" is defined in the Petroleum Refining category as \"the flow of storm water resulting from precipitation coming into contact with petroleum refinery property.\"44 \"Contaminated runoff\" is runoff that comes into contact with any raw material, intermed iate product, by -product, or waste product located on petroleum refinery property.45 NSPS for runoff in the Petroleum Refining category have not been established to date.46 Plastics . EPA developed the Organic Chemicals, Plastics, and Synthetic Fibers (\"Plas tics\") Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards in 1987 , with the last amendment in 41 Petroleum Refining Point Source Category Effluent Limitations Guidelines, Pretreatment Standards, and New Source Performance Standards, 47 Fed. Reg. 46,434 (Oct. 18, 1982); Petroleum Refini ng Point Source Category; Effluent Limitations Guidelines, 50 Fed. Reg. 28,516 (July 12, 1985). 42 50 Fed. Reg. at 28,516. 43 Id. 44 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 419.11(g). 419.36 (e)( Effluent Limitation for Runoff --[Reserved]). 38 1993, twenty -six years ago.47 This category applies to wastewater discharges from a large and diverse set of facilities (or portions thereof) that manufacture plastic materials or product groups, including a petroleum refining facility where plastics are also synthesized (EPA OCSFP 2005). The Plastics category covers a wide range of products, raw materials, and chemical processes; large volume producers and smaller producers of \"specialty\" chemicals; and facilities producing a variety of products with product mix es that can change frequently . Part 414 applies t o plastics molding and forming processes, such as forming plastic pellets, when it occurs at plastics facilities only for shipment off -site. However, facilities that mold or form plastic independent of producing the raw plastic materials are regulated unde r Part 463, the Plastics Molding and Forming Point Source Category (Part 463) (EPA 1987) . According to EPA, the Plastics category includes more than 1,000 chemical facilities producing over 25,000 end products, such as benzene, toluene, polypropylene, pol yvinyl chloride, chlorinated solvents, rubber precursors, rayon, nylon, and polyester (EPA Overview). Subcategories regulated under the Plastics category are rayon fibers, other fibers, thermoplastic resins, thermosetting resins, commodity organic chemical s, bulk organic chemicals, and specialty organic chemicals. The resulting wastewater streams from these facilities contain a wide variety of pollutants requiring different in -plant and end -of-pipe treatment approaches specific to each individual plastics f acility (EPA 1987). As noted in Table 5, supra, EPA currently regulates the discharge of certain pollutants under the Plastics industrial c ategory, but this list has not been substantially revised since its original creation, fails to adequately regulate the pollutants it does include, and omits others altogether. The BAT analysis used to determine Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards under Part 414 was completed in 1987, over 30 years ago, identifying the following in-plant and end-of-pipe treatment technologies: Table 7. Part 414 Plastics In -Plant and End -of Pipe BAT Part 414 In -Plant BAT (for facilities that do not use biological treatment) Part 414 End -of-Pipe BAT (for facilities that use biological treatmen t) - Alkaline chlorination for cyanide removal - Carbon adsorption for base -neutral compound removal - Chemical substitution using fewer toxic chemicals or chemicals that are more easily treated - Coagulation/flocculation - Dissolved air flotation (DAF) - Distillation - Preliminary treatment typically consisting of flow equalization - Neutralization - Biological treatment for Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Chemical Oxygen Demand, and Total Organic Carbon removal. - Effluent polishing through use of sand filters, polishing ponds, clarifiers , and/or carbon adsorption to remove remaining Total 47 40 C.F.R. Part 414; amendments summarized by EPA on the Equalization - Hydroxide precipitation for metals removal - Biological treatment - Neutralization - Oil/water separation for oily waste removal - Process modification to reduce water use or waste discharges - Sedimentation - Solvent extraction and recycle - Steam stripping for volatile and semi -volatile organic compound removal - Water reduction and reuse Suspended Solids and biological flocs from the biological treatment process (EPA 1987; EPA 2004). EPA has not established e ffluent limitations for contaminated runoff/stormwater for the Plastics Materials, Synthetic Resins, and Nonvulcaniz able Elastomers industr y group, including the Organic Chemicals, Plastics, and Synthetic Fibers (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 414) or Plastics Molding and Forming (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 463) point source categories. Stormwater is only covered under Part 414 if it is combined with process wastewaters (EPA 1987; EPA 2004).48 In other words , there currently are no regulations promulgated under Part 414 regarding the treatment of direct stormwater runoff from plastics facilities. The only restrictions or treatment requirements for stormwater are found in the Best Management Practices contained in either state -issued industrial stormwater permit s or EPA's Multi -Sector General Permit. As discussed supra, Best Management Practices , which typically include measures such as minimizing exposure of pollutants to prec ipitation or managing runoff via swales and filtration devices, have been wildly ineffective at preventing plastic particles produced at plastics facilities from entering the nation's waterways . Plastic pellets, flakes, and powders regularly escape from petro -plastic s facilities, contaminating nearby beaches and waterways , and harming wildlife and communities. The toxins from these substances leach into the environment, exposing wildlife and human communities to hazardous compounds that can result in canc er, neurotoxicity, and death. Prohibiting the discharge of any plastic debris from these facilities is necessary to safeguard our rivers, coasts, and communities from harmful pollutants. EPA's failure to regulate plastic pellets, resins, and powders in s tormwater violates the Clean Water Act and the agency must promulgate new limits and standards to ensure that no plastic debris escapes into waterways through stormwater. EPA's past failure to promulgate standards to ensure plastic does not discharge from petrochemical facilities is dangerous to public health, aquatic life , and water quality . EPA regularly include s stormwater restrictions in effluent limitations guidelines for other categories, such as Petroleum Refining . It must do the same here. 48 40 C.F.R. Part 414. 40 D. EPA's Duty to Update Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for Wastewater and Stormwater As technology adva nces and industry changes , the Clean Water Act requires EPA to revise its regulations at set intervals to reflect progress towards achieving the Act's goals of eliminating pollution into our nation's waters. Specifically, EPA must review and , if appropriat e, revise the Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards at least annually ;49 it also must review and, if appropriate , revise the effluent limitations for these industrial categories at least once every five years .50 The Act requires EPA to publish a plan every two years for how it will annually review and revise the Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for new and existing industrial categories.51 EPA most recently published a Final 2016 Effluent Guidelines Program Plan in April 2018 through which it screens for industrial categories where new or revised Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards may be warranted (EPA 2018). EPA stated that it continued to evaluate three industrial categories that ranked high in the toxicity rankings analysi s\u2014including the Plastics category (with a focus on Total Residual Chlorine, Nitrate, and Total Phosphorous) (EPA 2018 at 3 -1)\u2014but it s final Plan identified just one new rulemaking for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category. EPA concluded that \"no other industries warrant new or revised effluent limitations guidelines and standards.\" (Ibid.). EPA generally considers four factors when analy zing whether to revise any Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards: - Amount and type of pollutan ts the industry is discharging, and the relative hazard posed; - Performance and cost of applicable and demonstrated wastewater treatment technologies, process changes, and pollution prevention alternatives; - Affordability or economic achievability of the opt ions identified; and - The opportunity to eliminate inefficiencies or impediments to pollution prevention or technological innovation (EPA 2018) According to EPA, it also looks for information on: - Emerging pollutants of concern or new pollutant discharges ; - New, more sensitive analytical methods ; - Industrial process changes ; 49 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1314(b) 50 Id. \u00a7 1311(d) ( \"Any effluent limitation required by paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of this section shall be reviewed at least every five years and, if appropriate, revised pursuant to the procedure established under such paragraph. \") 51 Id. \u00a7 1314(m)(1). 41 - Other regulations that may result in changes to discharges (like air pollution control regulations) ; - Advances in wastewater treatment technologies and pollution prevention practices ; and - Other hazard data and information not captured in the toxicity rankings analysis (EPA 2018). The petro -plastics boom raises concerns under almost every one of these factors. First, this Petition documents additional pollutants of concern and industry chang es in terms of growth, feedstocks, and concentration in low -income neighborhoods and communities of color. Second , the decades that have passed since EPA last updated these standards have produced new, more sensitive detection methods, treatment technologi es, and other scientific advancements that can remove pollutant s better than existing standards. This is true for a long list of pollutants , including but not limited to total and dissolved metals, chlorides, and persistent organic compounds that are not r eadily degraded by biological treatment, which is the most commonly used end -of-pipe treatment technology at Petroleum Refining and Plastics facilities. More advanced water treatment options are available, and in some cases , many Petroleum Refining and Plastics facilities are already using them. EPA should adopt such options as BAT for many pollutants , including the following : - Membrane filtration options such as reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration, and electrodialysis that result in lower effluent concentrations of dissolved solids, chlorides, and dissolved metals than traditional filtration methods or sedimentation/precipitation (EPA Membrane).52 - Other filtration processes for solids removal, activated carbon treatment, and extended s edimentation that are commonly used treatment systems at Petroleum Refining and Plastics facilities and have proven effective at removing dioxin (EPA 2004). - Advanced oxidation processes that effectively remove a wide range of organic compounds, including non-biodegradable organic compounds that can persist as pollutants in wastewater discharges from Petroleum Refining and Plastics facilities.53 52 Ultrafiltration is typically used to remove larger metal cations, like those resulting from calcium, and can also remove organic compounds and dioxin. Reverse osmosis can remove smaller dissolved solids than ultrafiltration, such as chloride ions, and is typically used f or overall total dissolved solids removal in wastewater streams. Electrodialysis is capable removing dissolved solids of any size. Membrane separation processes could be used most effectively as an in -plant treatment system for specific process wastewaters with high concentrations of dissolved solids, chlorides, and dissolved metals, such as desalting wastewater (EPA Membrane) 53 Advanced oxidation processes primarily rely upon ozone and hydroxyl radicals (OH -), commonly supplied by hydrogen peroxide or ti tanium oxide, to oxidize contaminants and UV light to further decompose the oxidized compounds. Advanced oxidation processes could be used most effectively as a final polishing step as part of the 42 - Ion exchange treatment systems that remove selenium from wastewater and could effectively serve as in -plant trea tment BAT for desalting wastewater, the main source of selenium in a Petroleum Refining facility (Reinsel 2016). EPA is cognizant of technologies that are currently available , achievable , and would significantly reduce pollution discharges from the Plastics industry. EPA cannot ignore what it knows to be the best available technology and must update its Effluent Limitations and Guidelines accordingly. For example, since EPA last revised the standards for the Petroleum Refining category in 1985, it has expressed concern about other pollutants without Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards , including dioxin, metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (EPA 1996; EPA 2004). The 2004 EPA Effluent Guidelines Program Plan documents concluded that dio xin \"might be produced in high concentrations at petroleum refineries during reformer catalyst regeneration processes,\" and that \"some dioxin congeners might be present in the treated effluent at some refineries,\" (EPA 2004 , at Section 7), yet EPA has not promulgated Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for dioxin. EPA instead recommended that permit writers use their b est professional judgment in drafting permits and committed to engage in further \"study\" of the Petroleum Refining industrial categ ory. According to EPA, its current study is focused on the discharge of metals and dioxin from petroleum refineries, the effects of new air pollution controls on wastewater discharges at refineries, and information on current and future trends in oil refin ing processes. EPA's \"study\" is wholly inadequate. As part of the \"study, \" EPA issued a questionnaire to nine refinery companies in 2017 to survey the wastewater characteristics of their 22 facilities (EPA Study 2017). The survey conta ins no questions specifically requesting information on monitoring of dioxin ; instead, it contains only a generic \"metals\" category and a generic \"other\" category when requesting information on pollutants routinely monitored in end -of-pipe wastewater treatment effluents. It also overlooks other pollutants of concern as discussed in this petition. EPA has failed to finalize its findings even on the limited scope of its study and update the outdated Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards accordingly. As an illustratio n of the technologies EPA has failed to include in its Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards , the table below lists some of the in-plant and end -of-pipe wastewater treatment technologies that have come into common use since the last Effluent Limita tions Guidelines revisions for the Petroleum Refining and Plastics industrial categor ies. end-of-pipe treatment train to remove non -biodegradable org anic compounds at Petroleum Refining facilities and Plastics (Suzuki et al. 2016). 43 Table 8 . In-Plant and End -of-Pipe Best Available Technology Not Yet Adopted In-Plant and End-of-Pipe BAT Not Yet Adopted - Neutralization of wastewater with acidic byproducts from cracking - Air stripping of sour water from cracking processes - Neutralization of wastewater with caustic byproducts from the polymerization process - Wastewater reuse for steam generation, cooling water, and other process needs - Membrane filtration options such as reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration, and electrodialysis for dissolved solids, chlorides, and metals - Chemical precipitation and filtration to remove total and dissolved solids - Activated carbon treatment and ex tended sedimentation for organic pollutant removal - Advanced oxidation processes to remove organic compounds - Ion exchange treatment - Additional conventional filtration, sedimentation, and precipitation options (EPA 1996; EPA 2004) Many of these in-plant and end -of-pipe wastewater treatment technologies were confirmed as BAT in 1982, yet the 1996 EPA Review and 2004 EPA Review conducted specifically for this industrial category contained no recommendations for the addition of new treatment techno logies (EPA 1996; EPA 2004). With respect to stormwater permitting, new limitations are similarly warranted to address the deficiencies of the regulations relating to stormwater runoff and the Multi -Sector General Permit for industrial sources, which is e ffective through 2020 . A recently published National Academies of Science report included a section titled \"Overarching Message \" that summarizes Petitioners ' concerns with EPA's regulation of industrial stormwater discharges generally and plastic pellets and other materials specifically : [T]he [Multi -Sector General Permit] should incorporate the best available science in the MSGP process. Science continues to improve our understanding of the environmental and human health impacts of in dustrial stormwater. Technologies for water quality monitoring, stormwater treatment, and modeling are advancing at rapid rates, and new data can inform understanding of the performance of stormwater control measures. New tools are being developed to impro ve toxicological assessments and data management and visualization... In general, EPA has been slow to adopt new knowledge into its [Multi -Sector General Permit] permit revisions, but the [Multi -Sector General Permit] should not be a static enterprise. Both permitted facilities and the nation's waters would be best served by a progressive and continuously improving [Multi -Sector General 44 Permit] based on analysis of new data and focused data -gathering efforts, advances in industrial stormwater science and tech nology, and structured learning to develop and evaluate permit improvements. (NAS 2019). Given the decades that have passed since EPA last updated these rules , the scientific and technological progress made in the intervening years, and the changes in th e Plastics industry stoked by the fracked natural gas boom in the U nited States , EPA has the opportunity and duty to support better pollution wastewater and stormwater prevention by this industry. IV. Requested Rulemaking to Revise Effluent Limitations Gu idelines and Standards for Plastics Facilities Petitioners request that EPA protect public health and the environment by ensuring its Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Plastics industry evolve with the significant expansion of the industry ; the changing nature of the petro -plastics feedstocks and products ; and advancements in pollution detection, prevention, and treatment technology. The Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Stand ards for this industry are almost unchanged from when EPA promulgated them in the 1970s and 1980s. This is contrary to the Clean Water Act's mandates to regularly review and update these standards ; implement improvements in science, technology, and economi cs; and progress toward the Act's ultimate goal of eliminating discharges of pollutants into aquatic ecosystems. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals recently addressed a similar situation related to outdated Effluent Limitation Guidelines for steam -electri c power plant s, stating, [f]or quite some time, ELGs for steam -electric power plants have been, in EPA 's words, 'out of date.' 80 Fed. Reg. 67,838 . That is a charitable understatement. The last time these guidelines were updated was during the second year of President Reagan 's first term, the same year that saw the release of the first CD player, the Sony Watchman pocket television, and the Commodore 64 home computer. In other words, 1982 .54 The same can be said for the Effluent Limitations Guidelines and S tandards EPA issued to plastic monomer and polymer manufacturers under Part 419 (Petroleum Refining) and Part 414 (Plastics) . An update of the Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards that apply to petro - plastics facilities is essential to achieve the purposes of the Clean Water Act to eliminate pollution discharges and protect public health and the environment. EPA must update its Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards to reflect : - Changes in plastics feedstocks ; 54 Sw. Elec. Power Co. v. U.S. EPA, 920 F.3d at 1003. 45 - Changes and growth in the plastics industry ; - The consequent changes in the amount and type of pollutants the industry is discharging and relative hazard posed, especially to minority and low -income communities who bear the heavy environmental, public health, social, aesthetic, and ec onomic costs of not regulating these pollutants ; - New, more sensitive analytical methods available to detect and analyze pollutants ; - New and emerging pollutants of concern, including microplastic pollution ; and - New best available wastewater and stormwater treatment technologies, process changes, and pollution prevention alternatives . Specifically, the petitioning organizations request that EPA initiate a rulemaking to update the Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards in the Part 419 Petroleum Refining industrial category (Subpart B Cracking and Subpart C Petrochemicals subparts )55 and Part 414 Plastics industrial categor y as follows: (1) Promulgate a Zero Discharge Effluent Limitation Guideline and Standard for Plastic Pellets, Po wders, Flakes, Granules, and Other Plastic Material in Industrial Wastewater and Stormwater A limit of zero plastic material in industrial wastewater and stormwater Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards is urgent and necessary. Plastic pellets , powders, and other materials are driving the plastic pollution crisis that is entangling and otherwise harming (in increasing cases , fatally) o ver 700 different marine species , including sea turtles, whales, fish, and sea birds . EPA must as a first step stop this plastic pollution at its source. Discharges from existing facilities and the lack of effluent limits that squarely apply to plastic pellets, powders, and other plastic materials make it clear that neither the existing Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards or the stormwater regulations and general permit s control or prevent plastic pollution . For example, while some permits might theoretically regulate wastewater discharges of plastics under the Total Suspended S olids limits, many plastic pellets and powders float and are therefore not subject to \"suspended solids\" regulation . And while some facilities, like Formosa's Point Comfort, T exas facility , include wastewater discharge permits with a \"trace amounts\" limit for \"floating solids,\" industry has argued , albeit unsuccessfully, that this can include vast quantities of plastic. A numeric limit of 0 discharge of plastic is needed to stop this pollution problem .56 Considering the adverse impacts of plastic pellets on the aquatic environment and human health , plastic pellets' specificity to plastics facilities, and its status as an emerging and persistent 55 As noted supra, to the extent that EPA regulates facilities producing ethylene, propylene, or other monomers for Plastics under 40 C.F.R. Part 419, subpart E (Integrated Subcategory), this Subpart should also be reviewed and updated as proposed below for subparts B and C. 56 San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper v. Formosa Plastics Corp ., Case No. 6:17 -cv-00047 (S.D. Tex.) (judge concluded in its June 27, 2019 opinion (at 11 of 21) that \"no expert evidence supports using [Formosa's] numbers as constituting a 'trace amount' for purposes of compliance.\"). 46 environmental pollutant, EPA must use its authority under Part 414 (Plastics) and Part 122 (provisions related to stormwater and authority to issue multi -sector general permits ) to prevent further degradation of water resources and harm to organisms from plastic pellets and other plastic material . EPA should add a subsection (c) to 40 C.F.R. sections 414.91, 414.10 1, and 414.11 1 to establish e ffluent limitations for runoff of 0 mg/l of plastic pellets or other plastic material . These limits must be reflected in all stormwater permits and general permits issued by EPA and state - delegated NPDES Programs in addition to ot her applicable limits and standards . EPA should also add \"total plastic pellets and other plastic material \" to the lists of regulated \" effluent characteristics\" in 40 C.F.R. sections 414.91, 414.101 , and 111 with \" effluent limitations BAT and NSPS\" set at zero for both the \"maximum for any one day\" and \"maximum for any monthly average\" limitations. Promulgating a zero stormwater and wastewater discharge limit for plastic pellets, powders, flakes, and other plastic material in the Effluent Limitation Guideline s and Standards under Part s 414 and Part 122 will set a federal standard that all state industrial stormwater permitting programs will be required to meet. A zero discharge limit for plastic pellets, powders, flakes, and other plastic material applied to existing and new Plastics facilities is a reasonable response to a problem that threatens the well -being and safety of both the natural environment and human health. Scientists estimate that the majority of plastic, including microplast ic, in the environment originates from land - based sources, with a significant portion made up of stormwater runoff (Gordon 2006). The only way to mitigate the dangers posed by microplastics is to ensure they do not enter our waterways in the first place. In addition, the technology necessary to prevent the escapement of plastic pollution is readily available. Some states currently require Best Management Practices that are easy and low-cost solutions to trap plastic pellets before they enter stormwater dra ins, such as the one- millimeter mesh screens California mandates for plastics manufacturers .57 Other methods that have been available for decades include settling or filtration ponds and are equally available and effective to achieve a zero discharge limit .58 (EPA 1992). The vast expansion of the plastics industry will add billions of plastic pellets and other materials into stormwater runoff unless EPA takes action now. The health of our birds, fish, and mammals , as well as our own human health, depends on clean waterways free of hazardous plastic pollution. In accordance with its authority under the Clean Water Act , EPA must 57 California NPDES General Permit for Storm Water Discharges Associated with Industrial Activities, effective July 1, 2015, Part XVIII, https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/stormwater/docs/industrial/2014indg enpermit/wqo2014_00 57_dwq_revmar2015.pdf. 58 See U.S. EPA, Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category, 80 Fed. Reg, 67,837 (Nov. 3, 2015). 47 therefore promulgate regulations ensuring that the plastics industry does not discharge any more plastic waste through stormwater and wastewater runoff.59 (2) Require Individual Stormwater Permit s for Plastics Facilities and Ensure Other General Permit s Include a Zero Discharge Limit for Plastic Pellets and Other Plastic Materials The plastic pollution crisis makes it essential for EPA to require individual stormwater permits for Plastics facilities instead of using an industrial General Permit. Individual permits must be tailored specifically towards the plastic materials the se facilities are producing and releasing in order to achieve the most effective pollution controls. Clean Water Act regulations r ecognize that the Multi -Sector General Permit benchmark monitoring requirements, S tormwater Pollution Prevention Plans, and Storm water Control Measure s may be inadequate to address pollution from industrial stormwater. Therefore, EPA (as well as State Directors) can and should exclude Plastics facilities from industrial General Permits and require individual NPDES permits for these facilities given their discharge of plastic materials and other high risk pollutants.60 An individual stormwater permit can be required for any number of reasons, including a change in demonstrated technology or practices that better control pollutants, Eff luent Limitation Guidelines promulgated for point sources, and the nature of the discharge.61 Here, as demonstrated above, existing technology makes it feasible to completely eliminate plastic debris from a plastic facility's stormwater. An individual permit can better regulate these facilities by requiring more extensive monitoring and coverage of a greater number of pollutants relative to the General Permit , where benchmark monitoring is determined by standard industrial classification (SIC) code (NAS 2019). Individual permits can also be structured with enforceable discharge criteria expressed as numerical effluent limits, which then trigger a permit violation when exceeded (Id.) As the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conclu ded in a 2019 review of EPA's stormwater regulations, \"[t]his stricter enforcement of pollutant exceedances can be helpful for sites that represent a high public concern or that raise environmental justice issues. \" (NAS 2019). Plastics facilities are of hi gh public concern, and their proliferation in low -income communities of color raise s environmental justice concerns. Each facility should be required to receive an individual NPDES permit. For other industrial facilities, including facilities that do not produce plastic but may use pellets and powders in their manufacturing processes, the General Permit must include a zero discharge limit for plastic pellets and other plastic materials along with monitoring and reporting requirements to ensure compliance w ith the zero discharge limit . 59 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.26(a)(4). 60 40 (applicable to State NPDES programs) subsection on requiring an individual permit). 61 Id. 48 (3) Prohibit Any Detectable Priority Pollutants in Wastewater or Stormwater Discharge s for New Plastics Facilities Unless and Until EPA Can Justify Higher Limits Using Best Available Technology EPA must ensure that the boom of new petro -plastics facilities built in the coming decade are equipped with the most stringent control technology to minimize toxic pollutants in their wastewater and stormwater streams. This is necessary to lessen the chemi cal burden these facilities discharge and ensure they do not unduly burden surrounding communities and the environment with compounds known to harm human health and wildlife. The Clean Water Act mandates that new source performance standards (NSPS) reflec t \"the greatest degree of effluent reduction\" that is achievable based on the \"best available demon strated control technology, . . .including, where practicable, a standard permitting no discharge of pollutants.\"62 Owners of new facilities have the opportun ity to install the best and most efficient production processes and wastewater treatment technologies. As a result, NSPS generally represent the most stringent controls attainable through the application of control technology for all pollutants (conventional, nonconventional, and toxic). In establishing NSPS, EPA can consider the cost of achieving the effluent reduction and any non -water quality environmental impacts and energy requirements. 63 EPA should prohibit any detectabl e discharge of priority pollutants from new sources in the Petroleum Refining and Plastics categories unless and until it can justify other limits using updated best available demonstrated control technology . (4) Promulgate Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for Wastewater and Stormwater Pollutants of Concern Not Currently Regulated for Existing Petro - Plastics Facilities Under Parts 419 and 414 EPA currently allows the Plastic s industry to discharge unlimited quantities of certain toxic chemicals into our waters. Many of these chemicals cause cancer, impair reproduction, and cause immune deficiencies in humans and wildlife . EPA's failure to regulate these chemicals violates the Clean Water Act . EPA must update the existing Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for pollutants that do not currently have limitations , including but not limited to selenium, dissolved solids (including dissolved metals like vanadium and selenium64), chlorides,65 and organic pollutants like dioxin and dioxin , di(2- ethylhexyl)phthalate , 1,3-butadiene, lead, and plastic pellets facilities. 62 33 U.S.C. 1316(a)(1). 63 Id. \u00a7 1316(b)(1)(B). 64 The 2004 EPA Review determined that vanadium and selenium in Petroleum Refining facility discharges were of particular concern; however, the only metals EPA has currently promulgated Effluent Limitation Guidelines for under Part 419 is total chromium and hexavalent chromium. The 2004 EPA Review concluded that since effluent limits for vanadium have not been issued through the permitting process, this \"indicates\" that vanadium from wastewater discharges from Petroleum Refining facilities has not been identi fied as a water quality issue. Vanadium has been shown to have potential adverse impacts on aquatic life ( See, e.g. Environment Canada 2016). 65 While EPA has acknowledged that chlorides have one of the greatest pollutant mass loads from end -of-pipe wastewa ter discharges from Petroleum Refining facilities, it has not established Effluent Limitations Guidelines for chlorides under Part 419 (EPA 1996; EPA 2018). 49 For some of these pollutants, th ere is no established safe level of discharge, and limitations for wastewater and stormwater must be set at zero. For example, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded the following in 2019 with respect to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in stormwater : [N]o benchmark has been set for PAHs for any of the industrial sectors. Analytical methods for determination of PAHs are standardized and readily available (EPA, 2015c). It may appear that [Chemical Oxygen Demand ] can be used as a surrogate for PAHs, but PAHs can be toxic at concent rations orders of magnitude lower than the [Chemical Oxygen Demand] benchmark (120 mg/L). Canadian water quality guideline values for PAHs for the protection of aquatic life range from 0.012 g/L (anthracene) to 5.8 g/L (acenaphthene) (Canadian CME, 1999) . Currently, EPA has no recommended aquatic life criteria for individual or total PAHs. (NAS 2019 at 43 ). EPA must remedy these omissions from its current regulations. (5) Update Existing Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards Under Parts 419 and 414 to Reflect Best Available Technology and Progress Toward the Eliminat ion of Pollutant Discharges as the Clean Water Act Requires EPA has not met its duty to work toward the elimination of pollution discharges to waters of the U nited States . Its decades -old Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for petro - plastic s facilities do not r eflect the best available technology ; advances in laboratory detection and analytical methods ; or improved scientific understanding of the public health and environmental threats of these pollutants. Requirements for b est available technology were intended to drive technological innovation and to ultimately eliminate water pollution. Instead, EPA has not required polluters to keep pace with technology at all \u2014let alone innovate. As the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals stated decades ago, The BAT standard reflects the intention of Congress to use the latest scientific research and technology in setting effluent limits, pushing industries toward the goal of zero discha rge as quickly as possible. In setting BAT, EPA uses not the average plant, but the optimally operating plant, the pilot plant which acts as a beacon to show what is possible.66 In fact, t echnologies do not have to be in use by the industry to be best available technology . As the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals recognized , \"a technological process can be deemed 'available' for BAT purposes 'even if it is not in use at all' or if it is used in unrelated industries.\"67 EPA must revise a ll existing Effluent L imitations Guidelines and Standards to reflect best available technology and analytical methods and to achieve the no discharge objective of the 66 Kennecott v. U.S. EPA, 780 F.2d 445, 448 (4th Cir. 1985). 67 Sw. Elec. Power Co. v. U.S. EPA, 920 F.3d at 1031. 50 Clean Water Act . Updated Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards will help achieve the most protective pu blic health and water quality standards. In addition, EPA must ensure that all Plastics facilities include chronic and acute whole effluent toxicity monitoring for chronic and acute toxicity to ensure that pollutant -specific limits for the effluent are suf ficient to attain numeric and narrative water quality standards. Based on a review of permits for petro -plastics facilities, several states , including Ohio and Texas , require facilities covered under Part 414 to perform whole effluent testing.68 EPA must require these tests, which are the best indicators of toxicity in wastewater effluents from Plastics facilities and will be most protective of aquatic life in surface waters receiving discharges from Part 414 and 419 facilities. (6) Ensure No Facili ties Are Exempted and No Regulations Are Withheld from the Plastics' Effluent Limitation Guidelines EPA must rigorously review anything previously deemed \"reserved,\" \"exempted,\" or otherwise relegated to best professional judgment. For example, in Part 414 , EPA reserved BCT, which is purportedly a more stringent standard than BPT, instead defaulting to the original 1977 BPT baseline standards for conventional pollutants. Also, EPA has not established BAT limits in Part 414 for Plastics facilities that produ ce less than five million pounds annually. EPA finalized its development document for Plastics under Part 414 in October 1987 \u2014over 30 years ago \u2014and concluded that achieving BAT Effluent Limitations Guidelines for priority pollutant removal was not economic ally achievable by facilities under that production threshold. In the over 30 years since EPA made that determin ation , treatment technologies and their associated costs have changed. These and any other exemption s or reserved provisions must be revisited. V. Proposed Regulatory Changes A. Revise 40 CFR Part 414 As F ollows: Apply Best Available Technology (BAT) limitations in Part 414 to facilities that produce less than or equal to five million pounds of products per year. Amend the limitations and standards for direct and indirect discharge point sources to add a subsection 414.91(c), 414.101(c), and 414.111(c) that states: Effluent limitations for runoff. Runoff from facilities regulated under this Part may not contain more than 0 mg/l of plastic pellets or other plastic materials. This requirement must be reflected in all stormwater permits and general permits issued by EPA and state - delegated NPDES Programs in addition to other applicable limits and standards . Amend all Best Available Technology (BAT) a nd New Source Performance Standards in Part 414 to reflect updated and revised Best Available Technology and Best Available 68 See, e.g., Exxon -SABIC, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, Permit to Discharge Wastes Under Provisions of Section 402 of the Clean Water Act and Chapter 26 of the Texas Water Code, GCGV Asset Holding LLC, TCEQ Docket No. 2018 -0663 -IWD, TPDES Permit No. WQ0005228000, August 3, 2018 (Texas Permit). 51 Demonstrated Control Technology. Amend 414.91(b), 414.101(b), and 414.111(b) tables for New Source Performance Standards to state: Pollutant or pollutant property Effluent limitations NSPS Maximum for any 1 day (mg/l) Maximum for any monthly average (mg/l) The 126 priority pollutants (listed at 40 CFR Part 423, Appendix A) (1) (1) 1No detectable amount unless and until EPA can justify higher limits using best available demonstrated control technology. Add plastic limits to the tables for BAT and NSPS in 414.91(b), 414.101(b), and 414.111(b) : Pollutant or pollutant property Effluent limitations BAT and NSPS Maximum for any 1 day (mg/l) Maximum for any monthly average (mg/l) Total plastic pellets and other plastic material 0 0 B. Revise 40 CFR Part 419 as follows: Amend all Best Available Technology (BAT) and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) in 40 C.F.R. 419.2 419.36 ( Petrochemical subcategory) to reflect updated BAT and Best Available Demonstrated Control Technology for all pollutants .69 Amend 419.26(a) and 419.36(a) tables to reflect: 69 As noted supra, to the extent that EPA regulates facilities producing ethylene, propylene, or other monomers for Plastics under 40 C.F.R. Part 419, subpart E (Integrated Subcate gory), this Subpart should also be reviewed and updated as proposed below for subparts B and C. 52 Pollutant or pollutant property NSPS Maximum for any 1 day (mg/l) Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed (mg/l) The 126 priority pollutants (listed at 40 CFR Part 423, Appendix A) (1) (1) 1No detectable amount unless and until EPA can justify higher limits using best available demonstrated control technology. Amend 419.26(e) and 419.36(e) to include runoff limitations that reflect Best Available Demonstrated Control Technology . In sum , EPA must thoroughly review and revise its Part 414 and Part 419 Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards to reflect the best available science and technolog y and to protect human health and the environment from the petro -plastic s buildout . It must adopt zero discharge limits for plastic and adopt the stringent standards for priority pollutants proposed here unless and until it can justify higher limits using best available demonstrated control technology. VI. Severability If any provision of this petition is found to b e invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or lack of legal obligation shall not affect other provisions of the petition. Thus, the provisions of this petition are severable. VII. Conclusion The petrochemical industry is embarking on a massive expansio n of plastics facilities that will drastically increase plastic production in this country and abroad . The associated wastewater and stormwater pollution from these plants is expected to skyrocket in tandem , jeopardizing wildlife, aquatic ecosystems, and s urrounding communities. EPA has a duty to minimize water pollution and ensure that toxic chemicals do not harm human health and the environment . Accordingly, Petitioners respectfully request that EPA grant this petition and comply with its overdue obligation under the Clean Water Act to update the Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Standards for wastewater and stormwater discharges from petro -plastics facilities . EPA must : (1) prohibit the discharge of any plastic pollution in stormwater and wastewater ; (2) prohibit the discharge of toxic pollutants in wastewater from new facilities; (3) promulgate limitations for wastewater pollutants of concern that ar e not currently regulated; (4) update the Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Standards t o reflect scientific and technological advancements in the decades since their last revision; and (5) ensure all plastics facilities are covered by the updated BAT and NSPS effluent limitations. Granting these requests will allow 53 EPA to meet the objectives of the Clean Water Act and protect public health and the environment from this rapidly expanding and increasingly polluting industry . Any responses and all correspondence related to this petition should be directed to the Center for Biological Diversity at the email and address provided below .
