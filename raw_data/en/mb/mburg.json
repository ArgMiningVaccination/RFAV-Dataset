On April 6, 2021, the Board provided Second Draft Transcripts, along with Errata Sheets that noted minor corrections to the transcripts from March 15, 16, 18, and 19, 2021.1 2 The Board adopts the History of the Case, Issues, Evidentiary Ruling, Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order contained in the Proposed order in their entirety, except for modifications provided herein and identified via footnotes. The Board also makes minor modifications to reflect that it, and not the Administrative Law Judge, is issuing the order. On April 21, 2021, ALJ Rackstraw issued a Proposed Order, recommending the Board find that Licensee 's continued practice of medicine constitutes an immediate danger to the public and a serious danger to the public health or safety. The Proposed Order also recommended that the Board confirm its December 4, 2020 Order of Emergency Suspension of Licensee 's medical License. 3 On May 1, 2021, Licensee submitted written exceptions to the Proposed Order. The Board has reviewed and considered these exceptions to the extent they did not attempt to introduce new evidence, and finds they are without merit. /// 1 Pursuant to OAR 137-003-0560(4), at the January 20, 2021 prehearing conference, the parties agreed to extend the deadline for issuance of the Proposed Order from 15 days to 20 business days, given the anticipated duration and potential complexity of the hearing.

Exhibits Al, A4 through A13, A15 through A19, A21, A22, and A24 Exhibits A2, A3, A14, A20, A23, and A25 were admitted over Licensee 's various objections. Pleadings Pl through P25 were also made a part of the record. FINDINGS OF FACT Licensee 's Relevant Background 1. After high school, Licensee enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. He thereafter obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from Boise State University (Boise State). While pursuing his undergraduate degree, he was active in the Idaho Air National Guard. He also attended Boise Bible College and Cincinnati Bible Seminary. He subsequently entered a Ph.D. program in Microbiology at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, where he had a teaching assistantship and taught general microbiology and pathogenic bacteriology. He left the Ph.D. program (prior to obtaining the advanced degree) to begin an aviation career in the U.S. Air Force, where he became a commissioned officer. (Tr. Ill at 7-9; Tr. V at 82-83.) 2. In 1997, Licensee received his Medical Degree from Loma Linda University School of Medicine, where he co-taught medical microbiology. He completed an internship and residency in the Family Medicine Program at Wheeling Hospital in Wheeling, West Virginia. He received extensive training in rural family medicine, as well as training in surgical obstetrics, dermatology, intensive care, psychiatry, and the performance of upper and lower endoscopies. (Tr. Ill at 9-10; Tr. V at 83; see Ex. Al at 1-2.) 3. In April 2000, Licensee obtained his Oregon medical license and started a Family Medicine practice, South View Medical Arts (the clinic), in Dallas, Oregon. (Tr. I at 84, Tr. Ill 4 We modify the administrative rules cited to reflect those that apply to a final order, rather than a proposed order. 5 We modify this phrase to reflect the now-relevant date. 6 See footnote 4, FINAL ORDER Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 3 of72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46at 11; see Exs. Al at 1, A2 at 4.) Shortly thereafter, he joined the Oregon National Guard, where he served as a Medical Review Officer, Chief of Pharmacy, and Chief of Medicine. (Tr. Ill at 11.) 4. Dallas is a small quasi-rural community located approximately 20 to 25 minutes from Salem. The geographic area is underserved with regard to Psychiatry, Pain Medicine, and Addiction Medicine. For the past decade, Licensee has spent approximately 50 percent of his time practicing Pain Medicine and Addiction medicine. The remainder of his practice consists of providing full-spectrum care to all ages, from newborn to geriatric patients. (Tr. I at 42, 84; Tr. Ill at 12-14.) He is approved as a supervising physician, and he has trained multiple physician assistants at the clinic. (Tr. I at 47; Tr. Ill at 17; see Exs. Al at 5, A2 at 4.) 5. Licensee is board certified in Family Medicine. (Tr. Ill at 11-12; Ex. Al at 1-2.) He has lectured on the topics of Pain Medicine and Addiction Medicine in Southern Oregon and Oregon 's Willamette Valley, and he has published an article regarding central pain. (Tr. Ill at 11.) He previously held clinical privileges at Salem Hospital and the North Bend Surgery Center, where he performed minor surgeries and endoscopies. (Tr. I at 43, 48; Tr. 3 at 14; Tr. V at 83-85; see also Ex. Al at 6-8.)7 6. Excluding complaints related to the current matter, the Board has received 11 complaints regarding Licensee. All but two of those 11 complaints closed without any Board action. One complaint closed in 2009, after the Board issued a Letter of Concern to Licensee regarding his treatment of a 17-year-old patient who he had diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. One complaint, pertaining to an allegation of failing to adhere to prescribing guidelines, is still in the investigatory process. (See Exs. Al at 3, A2 at 4.) COVID-19 Pandemic 7. SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that causes COVID-19, an infectious disease. (Tr. I at 120, 122.)8 8. On February 28, 2020, the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) confirmed Oregon 's first presumptive case of COVID-19. (Ex. Al6 at 1; Tr. I at 147.) On March 8, 2020, Oregon Governor Kate Brown declared a state of emergency pursuant to ORS 401.165. (See Elkhorn Baptist Church v. Brown, 366 Or 506, 512 (2020) (discussing Governor Brown 's issuance of Executive Order No. 2020-03 on March 8, 2020).) On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. (Tr. I at 122.) 9. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 4.9 percent of all COVID-19 infections have resulted in hospitalization. Between March 1 and May 2, 2020, 7 During his hearing testimony, Dr. LaTulippe did not specify the name of the article or the publication in which it appeared, and the remainder of the record is silent on those facts. 8 At hearing, the terms \"COVID-19 \" and \"COVID \" were sometimes used by hearing participants (myself included) as a catch-all for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 disease or pandemic. Unless expressly stated herein, we make no relevant distinction between the uses of those terms in the record.

That figure has improved over time, but in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 remains higher than for influenza. (Tr. I at 159.) 10. On May 9, 2020, the OHA issued an update to its \"Clinical Care, and Healthcare Prevention and Control Guidance for COVID-19 \" recommending universal source control (z.e., masking) for both patients and providers in all healthcare settings and advising that healthcare providers wear a face covering or face mask at all times while in a healthcare facility, unless alone in a private office. (Tr. I at 115-116, 186, 190-191.) 9 11. Effective June 5, 2020, Governor Brown issued Executive Order No. 20-27, which states, in part: 2. [P]ursuant to ORS 401.168(1), ORS 401.175(3), ORS 401.188(2) to (3), and ORS 433.441(3): b. Individuals must comply with any public health directives set forth in my Executive Orders. c. Individuals should maintain physical distancing of at least six feet from any person who is not a member of their household, when possible, and should adhere to any applicable Oregon Health Authority (OHA) guidance, including but not limited to guidance on physical distancing and face coverings. OHA guidance is available at . https://govstatus.egov.com/OR-OHA-COVID-19 9. Guidance. At my direction, and under the authority of this and other Executive Orders, OHA and other appropriate agencies have issued and will continue to issue and revise detailed guidance for the public, for employers, and for particular sectors of the economy[.] 25. Legal Effect. This Executive Order is issued under the authority conferred to the Governor by ORS 401.165 to 401.236. Pursuant to ORS 401.192(1), the directives set forth in this Executive Order shall have the full force and effect of law, and any existing laws, ordinances, rules and orders shall be inoperative to the extent they are inconsistent with this exercise of the Governor 's emergency powers. 9 The OHA created the first version of its \"Clinical Care, and Healthcare Prevention and Control Guidance for COVID-19\" in March 2020, (Tr. I at 186.) FINAL ORDER - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 5 of 72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 4626. Enforcement. The directives in this Executive Order and any guidance issued by OHA or other state agencies to implement this Executive Order are effective statewide, unless otherwise specified. This Executive Order and any guidance issued by OHA to implement this Executive Order are public health laws, as defined in ORS 43IA.005, and may be enforced as permitted under ORS 431A.010. In addition to any other penalty that may be imposed under applicable laws, any person, business, or entity found to be in violation of this Executive Order or any guidance issued by OHA or other state agencies to implement this Executive Order is subject to the penalties described in ORS 401.990. (Oregon Executive Order No. 2O-27.) 10 12. On June 9, 2020, the CDC issued updated guidance for healthcare facilities, titled \"Healthcare Facilities: Managing Operations During the COVID-19 Pandemic \" (June 9, 2020 Guidance). (See Ex. A10 at 1-5.) The CDC noted in the June 9, 2020 Guidance that previous guidance \"was preventative and meant to help healthcare facilities prepare for community transmission, while current guidance is for managing operations during the pandemic. \" (Id. at 1.) The June 9, 2020 Guidance recommended that healthcare systems adjust their standard delivery approaches to reduce the need for in-person care by optimizing the use of telehealth and managing mildly ill patients at home. (Id. at 2-3.) To prevent the transmission of COVID-19 by COVID-19 infected persons who may or may not be showing symptoms, the June 9, 2020 Guidance recommended that healthcare facilities use source control for all persons (e.g.> staff, patients, and visitors) who enter a healthcare facility. The June 9, 2020 Guidance specified that cloth masks are considered source control (and not personal protective equipment (PPE)), and while cloth masks may be appropriate for patients and visitors, healthcare personnel should wear PPE. (Id. at 3.) 13. On July 22, 2020, after receiving citizen complaints alleging that some providers were not masking in healthcare settings, 1' the OHA issued a stand-alone document making clear that all healthcare personnel were required to wear masks at all times in all healthcare settings, unless they were alone in a private office. (Tr. I at 116-118, 182-184.) Also on July 22, 2020, the OHA updated its \"Statewide Mask, Face Covering, Face Shield Guidance for Health Care Offices \" (July 22, 2020 OHA Guidance). The July 22, 2020 OHA Guidance states, in pertinent part: Authority: Executive Order No. 20-27, paragraphs 9 and 21, ORS 433.441, ORS 433.443, ORS 431A.010 Applicability: This guidance applies statewide to: 10 Pursuant to ORS 183.450(4) and OAR 137-003-0615(1), the ALJ takes notice of this executive order, available online at <https.7/www.oregon.gov/gov/Documents/executive orders/eo 20-27.pdf >. Any party objecting to such notice was authorized to file an objection with the ALJ no later than three days after the issuance of the Proposed Order. No party filed an objection. !l At hearing, Dr. Sutton estimated that the OHA had received between 10 and 20 such complaints throughout Oregon. (Tr. I at 118-119.) She opined that, despite those complaints, by July 2020, \"almost all healthcare providers were masking at all times in all healthcare settings \" in Oregon. (See id.)

Have policies and enforce policies that require HCP to wear* appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for the care of patients with suspected COVID-19, confirmed COVID-19, or a known exposure to COVID-19 (See \"PPE for Healthcare Personnel \" Section). Health care personnel are required to: Wear a face mask or face covering that covers the nose and mouth at all times while in the health care office, except when in a private office by themselves. Face masks should be prioritized over face coverings because they offer both source control and protection for the HCP from potentially infectious droplets, splashes, or sprays. Cloth face coverings may not be worn instead of a respirator or face mask if more than source control is needed. a Face shields should be worn in addition to, but not in place of, face masks for the purposes of eye protection and additional layer of splash protection. a Face masks or face coverings are not required while eating or drinking, but strict physical distancing should be maintained while face masks, face shields, or face covering are not worn.

A face mask, face covering or face shield is required to be worn as soon as the examination or procedure in question has completed. Face masks, face shields or face coverings can be briefly removed in situations where identity needs to be confirmed by visual comparison. If possible, limit speaking while the cover is off as speaking generates aerosols and droplets that can contain viruses. Use of a face shield alone should be limited to situations when wearing a face mask or face covering is not feasible in the following situations: When a person has a medical condition that prevents them from wearing a face mask or face covering. When people need to see mouth and tongue motions in order to communicate (e.g., teachers of children in certain developmental stages or when communicating with people with hearing impairments).

(Ex. A23 at 1-4; bold emphasis in original.) Licensee 's Clinic Practices 14. For at least the last two years, Emily Miles worked as the clinic 's receptionist, and Mrs. LaTulippe, Licensee 's wife, worked as Licensee 's medical assistant and office manager. (Tr. I at 47-48; Tr. II at 236; Tr. Ill at 16-17.) Ms. Miles had no formal medical training. (Tr. V at 127.)12 15. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the clinic maintained a seasonal cold and flu protocol that included heightened sanitation standards. (Tr. I at 53; Tr. Ill at 41; Tr. V at 52.) The clinic also had an air ventilation system that filtered and recirculated air at least every hour. (Tr. V at 123-124.) After COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, Licensee added the following to his typical cold and flu season clinic protocols: social distancing of patients in the waiting room (/. e., six-foot rule); taking patients to examination rooms quickly; trafficking patients through the clinic in designated directions so they would not cross paths with one another; placing hand sanitizer at the receptionist window and in the common area behind the receptionist for patient/visitor use; scheduling patients with complaints of cough, congestion, fever, anosmia, and/or other symptoms suggestive of viral illness either at the end of the workday or during the lunch hour when no other patients were present at the clinic; taking such patients immediately to an examination room; and increasing the clinic 's already heightened cold and flu season sanitation procedures. (Tr. I at 53-54, 60-62; Tr. Ill at 45-48, 91; Tr. V at 37-38, 51-52, 122, 125, 128.)13 16. The clinic 's written \"Coronavirus Protocol \" states: 1. Direct to ED\u2014all patients with severe presumptive COVID symptoms: fever, chough [sic], muscle aches, chest tightness/pain, shortness of breath. 2. Keep distance of 6 feet between all patients. 3. Minimize contact between and with patients. 4. One-way entry and exit for all patients. 5. Only one patient per room. 6. Don a mask on any patient with a cough, fever, or any suspicious viral illness. 12 The record is silent as to whether Mrs. LaTulippe has any formal medical training. !3 At hearing, Licensee clarified that the sanitizer was present and made available to patients year-round, but that he and clinic staff actively encouraged patients to use it during cold and flu season.

Clinic staff conducted an initial screening of patients for COVID-19 illness when a patient first called the clinic to make an appointment. Mrs. LaTulippe would conduct a \"telephone triage\" ' and ask questions about the patient 's symptomology and course of illness. (See Tr. V at 45.) The clinic 's COVID-19 screening protocol did not include calling patients prior to their regularly scheduled appointments to screen for potential COVID-19 symptoms. Licensee instead relied upon \"common sense \" and expected that if a patient with a regularly scheduled appointment was \"significantly sick, \" the patient would call prior to their appointment to report such illness. (Id. at 46.) Licensee 's COVID-19 screening protocols did not include taking temperatures on all patients who presented at the clinic. (Tr. I at 60; Tr. Ill at 43-44.) Licensee 's COVID-19 screening protocols did not include asking patients if they had been in close contact with any person who had COVID-19 symptoms or who had tested positive for COVID-19. (Tr. Vat 47-49.) 18. As of approximately March 2020, when a patient arrived at the clinic for a routine scheduled appointment, Licensee relied upon Ms. Miles to assess whether the patient had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. (Tr. V at 46-47.) Licensee had trained Ms. Miles \"to look at [the patient] and just take a look at them and see if they look sick, \" and, if the patient was \"smiling and happy, \" Ms. Miles was instructed to ask how the patient was feeling. (Id. at 46-47.) If the patient indicated that they \"felt fine\" and they were \"not ill,\" Ms. Miles would direct the patient to sit in the waiting area (maintaining social distance) until Mrs. LaTulippe led them to an examination room. (Tr. I at 60.) If Ms. Miles made a visual determination that a patient looked sick, or the patient indicated that they had symptoms of COVID-19 or they were not feeling well, the patient was immediately taken to a designated examination room. (Tr. V at 47.) 19. When performing invasive surgical procedures on patients, whether at the clinic (or historically at a surgical center), consistent with standard protocol for surgical suites, Licensee wore a surgical mask. (Tr. I at 43-44, 75-76.) However, in Licensee 's opinion, \"there is no medical evidence that proves that masks are even of benefit during surgery. \" (Id. at 45.) 20. Absent surgical procedures, Licensee did not wear a mask when treating patients at the clinic between March 2020 and December 2020. Licensee did not require patients or clinic visitors to wear masks during that time period, unless they were \"acutely ill, coughing, [or] Hl FINAL ORDER - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 11 of72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46congested, \" or otherwise had signs suggestive of respiratory illness. 14 (Tr. I at 50-52, 54, 60-61; Tr. V at 19-20.) Licensee estimates that at least 95 percent of his patients chose not to wear a mask while at his clinic. (Tr. IV at 90.) Licensee has never demanded that a patient remove their mask at the clinic. (Tr. I at 55.) Mrs. LaTulippe and Ms. Miles did not wear masks at the clinic between March 2020 and December 2020. 15 (See Tr. V at 19, 160.) 21. Licensee acknowledges that a person does not have to be coughing to pass respiratory droplets infected with SARS-CoV-2 to other persons, and he acknowledges that masks can capture large respiratory droplets. However, he believes that masks do not capture small respiratory droplets and aerosols, and that respiratory aerosols account for approximately 80 percent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. (Tr. V at 95.) Because Licensee believes masking does not protect a wearer from aerosols, when treating a COVID-19 infected patient at the clinic in 2020, Licensee never wore a mask. But because Licensee was \"concerned \" about his exposure to such patients, he employed other, non-masking measures, which he considered \"survival tactics, \" while treating the patients. (See id. at 36-41.)16 22. For example, on one occasion, Licensee treated a male patient who had developed \"SARS-CoV-2 full-blown syndrome. \" (Tr. V at 36-37.) The patient was \"coughing like crazy; \" he had nausea, severe muscle aches and fever; and he complained of feeling as though he was going to die. (Id. at 36-38.) Licensee had the patient don a mask \"to just make any attempt to decrease his exposure as he was coughing as I am directly in front of his face examining him. \" (Id. at 38,120.) 23. After an initial evaluation of the patient, Licensee thought to himself, \"[O]kay, this is the day that I'm going to contract Coronavirus illness myself. And so my precautions were to use my so-called survival tactics. \" (Tr. V at 37; see also id. at 38. ) Licensee left the door to the examination room open during the entire patient encounter and, while taking the patient 's history, Licensee maintained a distance of approximately nine to ten feet from the patient (and the patient 's wife, who had accompanied him and was displaying milder symptoms of COVID- 19). (Id. at 38-39, 116.) Licensee is a swimmer and has good respiratory endurance. (Id. at 39.) During the multiple instances where Licensee had close physical contact with the patient \u2014to listen to his heart, lungs, and bowels; to examine his nasal cavity, oral cavity, and ears; and to perform other routine checks \u2014Licensee held his breath, and then released his breath once he was again nine to ten feet away from the patient. Licensee had the patient remove his mask17 14 At hearing, Licensee explained that he asked patients with symptoms of respiratory illness \u2014 such as chest tightness, cough, fever, shortness of breath \u2014 to wear a mask \"[f]or the large respiratory droplets, \" even though he did not believe that the mask made any significant difference. (Tr. I at 61-62; Tr. V at 35.) 15 At hearing, Licensee testified that Ms. Miles was \"very highly intolerant of mask wearing. She would get severe panic attacks. She would develop headaches, and * * * she ha[d] * * * a three- to four-foot distance between patients and her sitting position at the window, and I deemed that to be adequate. \" (Tr. I at 61.) 16 At hearing, Licensee testified that the medical literature supports that aerosols constitute the predominant mode of COVID-19 transmission. (Tr. V at 10, 109.) 17 At hearing, Licensee testified that as the patient was profusely coughing, Licensee thought, \"[O]kay, this is going to be my day that 1 get infected. \" (Tr. V at 38.) And then Licensee testified, \"(A]nd I had other days like that. \" (Id.) FINAL ORDER - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 12 of 72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46during certain portions of the physical examination, and then put the mask immediately back on. (See id. at 39-41, 112-113, 119-120.) 24. Licensee has never been tested for COVID-19 and he has \"never manifested any COVID-19 symptoms, \" but he \"would not be at all surprised if [he] tested positive for IgG, which is the long-term exposure antibody suggesting prior infection at some time. \" (Tr. V at 36, 41, 121, 135, 143. )18 25. It was Mrs. LaTulippe 's responsibility to bring patients with known or presumed COVID-19 from the waiting room to an examination room, where she was then in close contact with the patients while talcing their temperature, blood pressure, and other vitals. Licensee informed Mrs. LaTulippe that she was at risk in caring for such patients and he urged her to take \"all precautions. \" (Tr. V at 128-130.) \"All precautions \" did not include Mrs. LaTulippe wearing a mask. (See id. at 19.) After Licensee treated a patient with COVID-19 symptoms, such as the male patient previously described, Mrs. LaTulippe would sanitize the room and make sure it was not used for other patients for some period of time \"to allow * * * for any miniscule respiratory droplets to settle and for the air to recycle again. \" (Id. at 41.)19 26. In Licensee 's opinion, there are studies showing \"absolutely no benefit when comparing an N95 respirator to a cloth mask or to a surgical mask, * * * [and] that the infectivity rate was completely identical, [and] in other words, the masks, regardless of material, made no difference whatsoever. \" (Tr. I at 80.) In Licensee 's opinion, masks have been \"proven scientifically not to be a barrier to the spread of aerosols. \" (Tr. IV at 88.) In Licensee 's opinion, universal masking is contributing to an increase in the spread of COVID-19. (Tr. I at 101.) Licensee believes there are increased COVID-19 infection rates \"in the areas or regions of our country where there is increased masking and good compliance. \" (Id. at 80-81.) Licensee believes there are \"at least 17 well-designed randomized controlled trials that eliminated any question about masks being effective, and they were shown to be of no effect whatsoever. \" (Id. at 82; Tr. Ill at 26, 28-29.) In Licensee 's opinion, there is \"no medical evidence to substantiate wearing a mask to protect yourself ' from COVID-19; there is \"not a single randomized controlled study that shows any benefit to wearing a mask to prevent COVID transmission; \" there are \"fairly conclusive studies [pertaining to influenza] that showed no benefit to wearing a mask as a source of reducing * * * upper respiratory viral disease transmission; \" and mask \u00ad wearing may cause harm to the wearer, particularly if the wearer is elderly or has comorbidities such as emphysema. (Tr. I at 56-58, 86; Tr. V at 30, 32.) Licensee was open and candid with 20 18 At hearing, Licensee testified that \"there is a very good chance that I have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 * * * [because] I was exposed to some very sick patients and a good number of them. \" (Tr. V at 143.) 59 Licensee testified at hearing that Mrs. LaTulippe cannot \"tolerate wearing a mask, \" and he explained that after flying while masked on two occasions, she was left wheezing and exhausted. (See Tr. V at 19.) The record also demonstrates, more likely than not, that Ms. LaTulippe shares Licensee 's views regarding masking harms and ineffectiveness. (See, e.g., Tr. I at 126, 141-142; Tr. II atl46-150, 155-156; 237-238,244; Tr. V at 170.) 20 At hearing, Licensee testified that in 2020, he treated \"a significant number of comorbidities directly associated with the mask wearing, \" including depression, panic/anxiety, fatigue, headache, confusion, lightheadedness, impetigo, parotitis, and conjunctivitis. (Tr. I at 58, 89-92; Tr. V at 33; see also Tr. IV at 84.) He testified that when he treated a patient with symptoms that he determined were caused by increased CO2 levels in the body because of mask wearing, he \"absolutely \" communicated to the patient that masking was responsible for the harm they experienced. (Tr. V at 33.) FINAL ORDER - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 13 of72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46his patients and the public at large regarding his views on masking harm and ineffectiveness. (See, e.g.t Tr. I at 54-58, 62-64; Tr. IV 59-60; Exs. A3 at 3, A5 at 3.) 27. In Licensee 's opinion, the body 's natural immune system is a more effective defense against COVID-19 than a mask, even an N95 mask. Licensee believes that entities such as the CDC and the OHA have not issued guidance on the issue of immune defense because such entities have \"an alternative agenda \" that is \"comprised primarily of money and power and politics and control of the population. \" (Tr. V at 142.) Licensee believes that government entities and agencies have \"severely weaponized and politicized \" COVID-19 guidelines for masking and other measures. (Tr. I at 56.) In Licensee 's opinion, the Governor 's COVID-19 Executive Orders and associated OHA guidelines are \"unscientific. \" (Id. at 87.) 28. From March to December 2020, Licensee engaged in an informed consent process with each patient \"to establish whether or not they should be wearing a mask, \" based on his opinions of the medical evidence pertaining to mask-wearing (as detailed in the findings above). (Tr. I at 54-58; Tr. IV at 104; Tr. V at 21-22.) Licensee routinely directed patients to watch a YouTube video titled, \"Tammy K. Herrera Clark on Face Mask Effectiveness. \" (Tr. I at 62-64; Tr. V at 23-24, 27; see Exs. A5 at 3, A6 at 1.) He made available to patients a small paper document advertising Ms. Clark 's YouTube video, which stated:21 SCIENTIFIC MASK FACTS YouTube Video \"Tammy K. Herrera Clark On Face Mask Effectiveness \" (Only the truth will make you free) (See Ex. A5 at 3, 9; Tr. V at 23, 27-29.) Ms. Clark 's positions on masking are congruent with Licensee 's belief that the sum of the medical evidence shows that masks are not an effective barrier for reducing the transmission of respiratory disease. Licensee believes that Ms. Clark is a 21 At hearing, Licensee provided the following example: So when I would discuss the risks and benefits, I had * * * elderly people with comorbidities such as emphysema, asthma or just debilitated because of advanced age * * *, and they would be in a panic saying I can't breathe with this mask on. So, what did I tell them? I said * * * take off the mask, you are harming yourself. And again, I would reaffirm, what does the medical evidence show? No benefit. \" (Tr. I at 58; see also id. at 64.) License also testified that he would inform a patient that wearing a mask could cause them harm \"by increasing the body 's carbon dioxide content \" if he felt such information was relevant to that patient. (Tr. V at 32.)

I at 63-64; see Tr. V at 23-24.) 29. In Licensee 's opinion, he has been \"a strong asset to the public in educating them on the real facts about this pandemic, and likewise * * * none of my patients were placed in immediate danger. I would say that at least * * * 98 percent of my patients were so extremely thankful that I did not wear a mask or demand wearing a mask in my clinic [.] They did not perceive an immediate danger. \" (Tr. V at 59-60.) 30. In Mrs. LaTulippe 's opinion, masked elderly patients were \"usually distressed \" and had difficulty breathing when presenting at the clinic. (Tr. II at 244.) Ms. LaTulippe routinely told those patients they could remove their masks. (See id. at 244, 237-238.) 23 31. In approximately late February or early March 2020, a letter carrier with the U.S. Postal Service who was assigned to deliver mail to the clinic questioned Ms. Miles as to why clinic staff did not wear masks. In response, Ms. Miles informed the letter carrier that masks did not work and she provided him with a link to a website that discussed the dangers of masking. At some later date, while again delivering mail to the clinic, the letter carrier engaged in a heated exchange with Ms. Miles and/or Licensee regarding the clinic 's position on masking. Thereafter, the mail carrier requested that the Postmaster alter his route so that he would no longer be required to deliver mail to the clinic. Dr. LaTulippe and/or clinic staff also filed a complaint regarding the mail carrier with the Postmaster. (Tr. II at 155-174, 241-242.) 32. In approximately May or June 2020, Licensee informed a patient who was experiencing elevated blood pressure that wearing a mask might be contributing to her condition. (Tr. V at 168, 172-173; Tr. VI at 20-21.) Licensee also told the same patient that she was at greater risk from CO2 toxicity from mask wearing than she was from getting COVID-19. (Tr. V at 170-171.) On at least one occasion, Mrs. LaTulippe told that patient that COVID-19 was no different than a cold and that the flu was more hazardous. (Id. at 170.) 33. On June 8, 2020, Mrs. LaTulippe immediately directed an elderly patient, DE, to remove her mask when DE presented for her examination. Mrs. LaTulippe then told DE and DE's adult daughter who had accompanied her to the appointment, Ms. Ellis-Kelemen, that the mask would cause CO2 issues and compromise DE's breathing. A short time later, while observing that Ms, Ellis-Kelemen continued to wear her mask during the appointment, Mrs. LaTulippe made a comment such as \"Oh, you're one of those people. \" (Tr. I at 126-127, 141\u00ad 142.)24 22 Exhibit R92 identifies Ms. Clark as having 20 years of experience as an \"Environmental Health and Safety Compliance Specialist. \" (See Ex. R92 at 4.) She did not testify at the hearing, and her qualifications as an expert on masking effectiveness were not otherwise established in the record. 23 At hearing, Mrs. LaTulippe testified, \"[A] lot of these elderly people come in having so much trouble breathing with those masks that when I take them back * * * to get weighed, I let them know that they have permission to take it off if they would choose to, if they would like to, if they are having trouble breathing. \" (Tr. II at 237-238.) 24 At hearing, Mrs. LaTulippe denied directing DE to remove her mask on June 8, 2020, and she denied making a comment to Ms. Ellis-Kelemen along the lines of, \"Oh, you're one of those people. \" (See Tr. II FINAL ORDER - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 15 of 72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 4634. In July 2020, a patient who had previously established care with Licensee called the clinic to seek medical advice following a potential COVID-19 exposure. Mrs. LaTulippe spoke with the patient, who reported that she had recently been camping with friends, outdoors and unmasked. Upon hearing that the patient was not experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19, Mrs. LaTulippe informed the patient that she did not need to get a CO VID- 19 test, that she did not need to isolate, that being exposed to other people would provide immunities from COVID- 19, and that masks are ineffective for reducing the spread of COVID-19. The patient was concerned about the advice she received from Mrs. LaTulippe, so she called the clinic again the following day, with the hope of obtaining medical advice from someone different. The patient again spoke with Mrs. LaTulippe, who reiterated that masks do not work. Mrs. LaTulippe also directed the patient to a YouTube video from Tammy K. Herrera Clark, titled \"Destroying the Mask Narrative. '* (Tr. II at 146-150, 155-156.) One or two days later, the patient again called the clinic, with the goal of learning the full name and credentials of the woman (/'.c. , Mrs. LaTulippe) with whom she had spoken on the previous occasions. The patient was again routed to speak with Mrs. LaTulippe, who appeared displeased with the patient 's request for identifying information. {Id. at 150.) A few days later, the patient received a letter from the clinic, stating at 237-238.) Given the conflict in the record over these matters, it is necessary to assess the credibility of Mrs. LaTulippe and Ms. Ellis-Kelemen. While a witness is presumed to speak the truth, the presumption may be overcome \"by the manner in which the witness testifies, by the character of the testimony of the witness, or by evidence affecting the character or motives of the witness, or by contradictory evidence. \" ORS 44.370. A determination of witness credibility may also be based on the inherent probability of the evidence, whether the evidence is corroborated, whether the evidence is contradicted by other testimony or evidence, whether there are internal inconsistencies, and \"whether human experience demonstrates that the evidence is logically incredible. \" Tew v. DMV, 179 Or App 443, 449 (2002), citing Lewis and dark College v. Bureau of Labor, 43 Or App 245, 256 (1979) rev den 288 Or 667 (1980) (Richardson, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). Given the various factors discussed above, Mrs. LaTulippe 's denials regarding her alleged statements to DE and Ms. Ellis-Kelemen on June 8, 2020, are not persuasive. The cumulative evidence in the record demonstrates that Mrs. LaTulippe actively encouraged patients not to wear masks at the clinic, and that she readily communicated her strong opinions about the dangers and lack of efficacy of masking to clinic patients and visitors. Directing an elderly patient to remove her mask, espousing the dangers of masks to such patient, and making a negative remark to an accompanying person who insisted on remaining masked at the clinic appear consistent with Mrs. LaTulippe 's fervent and freely expressed masking opinions. In addition, Mrs. LaTulippe has significant motive to minimize and mischaracterize her conduct in this proceeding, given the seriousness of the Board 's action against her husband and the attendant consequences to their careers and livelihoods. Conversely, Ms. Ellis-Kelemen has no known motive to be untruthful in this matter. Moreover, her hearing testimony was sufficiently detailed, logical, and plausible. Overall, when weighed against the seemingly reliable testimony of Ms. Ellis-Kelemen, Mrs. LaTulippe 's denials about her statements to DE and Ms. Ellis-Kelemen on June 8, 2020, are not persuasive. Furthermore, where Mrs. LaTulippe 's testimony conflicts with other, more reliable evidence elsewhere in the record, the administrative law judge accorded greater weight to that other evidence. We agree.

A24 at 1.) 35. Although Licensee believes it is \"theoretically possible \" that an asymptomatic person infected with SARS-CoV-2 could transmit the virus to other persons by speaking and breathing, he believes that such an occurrence is unlikely. (Tr. V at 96.) In his opinion, asymptomatic spread has not been sufficiently demonstrated in the medical literature and is not a significant factor in the spread of COVID-19. (Id. at 9, 49; see also Tr. I at 103-104.) 36. Licensee believes that approximately 75 patients he treated at the clinic in late October 2019, early November 2019, late January 2020, and early February 2020 had COVID- 19. (Tr. I at 68-69; Tr. Ill at 19, 51-52; Tr. V at 85, 97-98, 101-104.) Between late November 2020 and early December 2020, Licensee treated approximately 125 patients with COVID-19 in the clinic. (See Tr. I at 70; Tr. Ill at 53; Tr. V at 99, 106-107.) 26 37. Licensee did not recommend masking to any COVID-19 infected patients he treated in 2020. Rather, he recommended isolation, distancing, avoiding contact with shared objects and people, and increased frequency of hand washing. (Tr. V at 107-109, 111.) 38. Licensee did not perform COVID-19 testing at the clinic. The patients he treated with confirmed COVID-19 infections were tested elsewhere. (See Tr. Ill at 53; Tr. V at 106\u00ad 107.) Licensee believes that the widely-used PCR test for COVID-19 detection has resulted in a \"tremendous amount of false positives. \" (Tr. I at 104, 106-107.) Licensee is not aware of any person who contracted COVID-19 from his clinic. (Id. at 98.) The Board is not aware of, nor has it identified, any person who contracted COVID-19 from visiting Licensee 's clinic. (Tr. II at 121.) 25 The letter to the patient is dated July 23, 2020 and states, in relevant part: Due to recent issues of conflict regarding medical care and I believe that a congenial patient-doctor relationship is critical to good care. And due to resent phone call stating that you were no longer a patient here. I feel it would be in our mutual best interest to terminate your services effective immediately, as a patient at South View Medical Arts. We ask that you do not call or show up at our office, as of now you are no longer a patient, this includes spouse as well. We will cancel all appointments. We wish you the best of care and good health in your future. Best regards, Office management/Personal CC Includes all family/household members/and spouses/boyfriends/etc (Ex. A24 at I; letter appears in its original form, with no grammatical or spelling corrections.) 26 At hearing, Licensee testified that between February 10, 2020 and late November 2020, not a single patient presented at his clinic with symptoms of respiratory illness. (See Tr. 1 at 65-68, 70, 85; Tr. Ill at 52-53; Tr. V at 99, 106.) Licensee further testified that no clinic staff ever worked while ill (or while having a cough, fever, or other respiratory symptoms). (Tr. I at 68.)

Beginning in July 2020, the Board received four complaints regarding Licensee and his alleged failure to comply with masking mandates at the clinic. (See Ex. A3 at 1-4; A2 at 1, 4\u00ad 5, 7; Al at 4; Tr. I at 223, 237-238.) On July 16, 2020, the Board opened an investigation into the complaints and assigned Board Investigator Jason Carruth to the case. (Ex. A2 at 1; Tr. I at 223, 239.) 40. In a letter dated August 13, 2020, Investigator Carruth notified Licensee of the Board 's investigation and summarized the allegations against Licensee as follows: It is alleged that Licensee is not following social-distancing guidelines in his practice and care of patients. It is also alleged that Licensee is advising patients and the public that masks required under the current guidelines do not work and should not be worn. It is further alleged that Licensee has been posting to social media statements discouraging citizens from adhering to distancing guidelines specific to COVID-19. (Ex. A5 at 1; Tr. I at 223, 240.) In the letter, Investigator Carruth requested that Licensee respond to the allegations in detail, describe his adherence to social distancing guidelines in the practice setting, explain why he has encouraged \"non-compliance with a government order to limit the spread of COVID-19, \" provide documentary support for his position that \"masks and social distancing are not effective preventive measures, \" and answer specific questions relating to his experience, practice sites, and any privileges he holds. (Ex. A5 at 1.) 41. On September 3, 2020, the Board received Licensee 's response to Investigator Carruth 's letter, consisting of a letter from Licensee dated August 31, 2020, nine attachments, and an attestation page addressing the specific questions posed by Investigator Carruth regarding Licensee 's experience, practice sites, and privileges. (See Ex. A5 at 2-11; Tr. I at 223, 240.) In his August 31, 2020 letter, Licensee denied posting statements to social media that discourage citizens from adhering to COVID-19 social distancing guidelines, and he denied not following social distancing guidelines in his practice and care of patients, stating, \"I have followed reasonable social distancing guidelines. I also implemented my standard clinic cold/flu season protocol that has served me very well for over 20 years. \" (Ex. A5 at 2.) In the same letter, he admitted to advising patients and the public that masks required under the current COVID-19 guidelines are ineffective and should not be worn, specifically confirming, \"As a medical professional with a former background in microbiology, I stand firm on this assertion. \" (Id.) Licensee 's letter also states, in part: I have a sign conspicuously posted in my office waiting room stating that our office is following a COVID-19 protocol, and I solicit cooperation. Furthermore, I have this protocol typed out in detail and posted at the receptionist and nurse stations. * * *. We have strictly followed our protocol, and it has worked very well.

Incidentally, the very last presumed COVID case I treated was in early February. I treated perhaps 75 cases, and all fully recovered without sequelae. I have seen no viral upper respiratory infections in my clinic since that time. [I] have extensively educated myself on the characteristics of various mask types, their efficacy, utility, limitations, [and] associated risks of physical and psychological harm. My conclusion is that the mask affords minimal or no protection against viral upper respiratory infections. * * *. The best N-95 mask has a mask filtration diameter of 0.3 micrometers (microns), and coronavirus has a diameter of 0.125 microns. Thus even the most highly filtering N-95 mask is incapable of filtering out the coronavirus. It is a worthless viral barrier, even if you assume the unlikely event that the mask has a perfect seal over the face. Furthermore, the lifespan of this mask is only twenty minutes. Few people are actually wearing an N-95 mask, and of these, many fewer wear it properly. None replace the mask every 20 minutes. The rest of the population who actually comply with this \"government order \" are wearing either paper masks or home-made cloth masks, having the efficacy comparable to putting up a chain-link fence to keep mosquitoes out of the yard. Are these masks providing any viral protection? Most definitely not. A fishnet stocking mask would be as effective as any paper or cloth mask \u2014completely worthless. Add to this the fact that most people wear the masks improperly, and the declaration of being \"worthless \" degrades to the status of ridiculous. * * *. Does wearing a mask have any scientific validity as a viral barrier to respiratory infection? Absolutely not. The claim that it may reduce the spread of respiratory droplets is irrelevant to real-life scenarios. People are rarely close enough to be contaminated by spit or bronchial secretions from a cough. And virtually every mask wearer is perfectly healthy. If one is acutely ill, they should stay home and convalesce until no longer infectious. The mask is worthless as a viral barrier. [I] share with you a 50-minute YouTube video presentation by a career PPE expert who actually trains OSHA personnel. The title is \"Tammy K. Herrera Clark on Face Mask Effectiveness. \" This is an excellent and thorough presentation that expounds on the real science of PPE. Finding no flaws in her presentation, I tested it further. * * *, This is the information I have been disseminating to my patients and to the public.

Remember, I have not seen a single viral upper respiratory infection in my clinic since early February 2020. Yet I have treated hundreds of mask- related problems in my clinic since people have started wearing masks. What medical problems do[es] a mask directly cause! The morbidity is extensive. We have an abundance of well-documented cases of COPD and asthma exacerbations, heart attacks, stroke, collapsed lungs (even in youth), migraine headaches, facial impetigo, nasal pustulosis, Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA)[,] pneumonia, fainting, fatigue, shortness of breath, confusion, nausea, dizziness, claustrophobia, mild narcosis, tremor, elevated blood pressure (hypertension), panic attacks, anxiety, and other psychosocial manifestations.

I cannot compromise my personal integrity, moral standards, or my reputation as a caring and competent physician, for the sake of perpetuating a lief.] [I] have always promoted the common sense principles of reducing infection, and this does include social distancing. The practicality of social distancing remains elusive. * * *. How effective is social distancing? I don't believe we will ever have the true answer to this question. But what I do see are the abundant discrepancies regarding social distancing. * * *. Any physician who examines a patient, of necessity, violates the [social distancing] guideline. For this reason, some physicians still choose to \"see\" patients via telemedicine only. Is this good? No. I had to rescue a good number of my patients during the COVID season who would have died without my direct intervention. They were advised to not go to the emergency department, and were unable to make any contact (even leave a message) with their specialists. * * *. We as physicians need to practice universal precautions, but physicians avoiding all contact with severely ill patients is, in my estimation, dereliction of duty, and may be pure cowardice. The [Board] cites allegations of \"not following guidelines \" and \"noncompliance with a government order. \" What exactly is the purpose of guidelines? If a face mask is completely ineffective against disease transmission, but a state governor seeks to enforce such guidelines, should we just oblige her?

Governor Kate Brown has no legal jurisdiction under Oregon State constitutional law to issue such an order. The state Executive Branch has jurisdiction to declare, in a state of emergency, a 30-day order to directly deal with a crisis. This 30-day window ended on April 7, 2020, if memory serves me correctly. This means that this \"government order \" is unlawful; and this is why it cannot be (and is not) enforced by police departments. Her action is that of Marxist totalitarianism. * * *. [I]f a guideline is unlawful, has no medically-based validity, and is detrimental to personal health, I cannot accept such a guideline, mandate, order, regulation - or whatever other name you choose to assign it[.] (Id. at 3-5; italicized emphasis in original.) 42. On November 5, 2020, the Board 's Investigative Committee directed the Board 's medical director to ascertain Licensee 's implementation of, and adherence to, applicable COVID-19 guidelines at his clinic and to remind him of his professional responsibilities pertaining to such. (See Ex. A2 at 2, 4; Tr. I at 224, 240, 245; Tr. II at 19, 91-92, 97.) 43. In a letter to Licensee dated November 9, 2020, Board Medical Director David Farris, MD, stated, in part: It has come to the attention of the [Board] that you may be in direct and active violation of current Governor Executive Orders, to include Executive Order 20-22 and 20-59. These Executive Orders specify that elective and non-urgent procedures across all care settings that utilize PPE are allowed, but only to the extent they comply with guidance or administrative rules issued by the Oregon Health Authority. These rules require all people to wear properly fitted facemasks when indoors in any care setting. Masking has been shown to significantly reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus responsible for the current worldwide pandemic. It is the expectation of the Board that you immediately comply not only with the legal mandate, but with practices and professional conduct appropriate to the standards of medical care expected for a licensed medical professional in the state of Oregon. The current standard of practice in a primary care setting includes, at a minimum, pre-appointment and pre-entry screening of all patients to identify those who are or may be infectious with SARS-CoV-2; appropriate sequestration of such patients; appropriate protection of all staff with PPE; and thorough cleaning of instruments and surfaces between patients.

I am not a novice to virology, disease transmission or epidemiology[.j [M]y patients are my family and I would never do anything to compromise their health. * * . I strive to seek out the best medical principles and the best scientific evidence to promote whole person care. * * *. Providing top quality care to my patients has been my life goal as a physician, and I cannot help but feel attacked without just cause. I do not see where I have failed my patients or the public in any way. In all my years of medical practice, I have strictly abided by universal precautions, and I have always maintained a rigid cold/flu season protocol that has served my patients, my staff, and the public very well. I do take the COVID-19 pandemic seriously and have proactively instituted an office \"coronavirus protocol \" that has minimized patient infection risk. I have had zero problems with infectivity. None of my office staff or patients have become infected throughout the entire pandemic timeframe, despite having never closed my office. I have treated about 75 COVID-19 patients prior to mid-February 2020, and all recovered quickly and completely. None were hospitalized. Just last week I saw my first two COVID cases of this fall, and the day after starting treatment they were already greatly improved. Thus, both my office protocol and therapies have proven to be highly effective, designed to protect both my patients and the public. [I] shall continue to maintain high standards of proven infectious disease prevention in my medical practice, and I anticipate, as I have demonstrated with a past perfect record, having no problems whatsoever. (Ex. A5 at 12-13.) 45. On December 2, 2020, Board Investigator Carruth made an unannounced visit to the clinic. As of that date, the Board had not yet received Licensee 's November 23, 2020 letter. (See Ex. A2 at 3-4; Tr. I at 224-225, 252-253.) As he entered the clinic, he observed no easily visible signage setting forth COVID-19 protocols or stating that masks or other measures were27 27 Licensee provided Investigator Carruth a copy of his November 23, 2020 letter during the site visit on December 2, 2020.

He observed no visible hand sanitizer available to patients and visitors, and he observed no obvious screening measures being implemented as patients entered the clinic. (Ex. A2 at 3; Tr. I at 226-230, 256-258.) Affixed to the exit door of the clinic, and visible as patients and visitors exited, Investigator Carruth observed three posted documents: one document stated that the clinic was adhering to COVID-19 protocols, but it did not specify any such protocols; 28 one document explained the symptoms of carbon dioxide toxicity; 29 and one document referenced a CDC guideline on COVID-19, with two sentences highlighted emphasizing that only people with comorbidities experience issues with COVID-19. (See Exs. A2 at 3, A6 at 3-4; Tr. lat 226, 256-258.) 46. Ms. Miles, who was sitting behind a sliding glass window and not wearing a mask, slid open the glass window and greeted Investigator Carruth. He observed other individuals behind her, including one patient who was making a follow-up appointment, who were also not wearing masks. He noted that as patients (and accompanying individuals) came and went, the receptionist performed the same action of sliding the glass barrier open to speak to them with no mask in place. While sitting in the waiting room, prior to meeting with Licensee, Investigator Carruth observed six patients and accompanying individuals entering and exiting the clinic, as well as a UPS delivery person entering the clinic. None of the patients and accompanying individuals wore masks, and he never saw the receptionist wear a mask. (Ex. A2 at 3; Tr. I at 227-229, 254.) 47. Investigator Carruth subsequently met with Licensee in his private office, whereupon Licensee, who was not masked, greeted him with an extended hand. When Investigator Carruth declined a handshake, License crossed his arms, smiled, and asked how Investigator Carruth felt about COVID-19 policies and protocols. Licensee told Investigator Carruth, who was masked, that he could remove his mask if he wanted. Licensee explained his opinion that the masking protocols were not based on science. He told Investigator Carruth that he and his staff do not wear masks, but that the clinic 's strict sanitation protocols had successfully prevented any COVID-19 outbreaks in the clinic. He told Investigator Carruth that his patients are welcome to wear masks if they choose to do so, but he admitted that he takes the opportunity to educate them on the futility of doing so. He told Investigator Carruth that he had treated more patients experiencing complications due to mask wearing than patients with COVID-19. Licensee stated that he had successfully treated approximately 75 patients who were COVID-19 positive, with none of those patients needing hospitalization. Licensee expressed that he had no intention of changing his practice with regard to not requiring masks in the clinic. Licensee also told Investigator Carruth that he had researched the Oregon Constitution and determined that Governor Brown 's executive orders were not legal or enforceable. (Ex. A2 at 3; Tr. I at 230\u00ad 232, 253.) In his subsequent investigative report, Investigator Carruth noted that Licensee was30 28 The one-page document states: \"Our office is following Corona Virus (COVID-19) protocol.

(Ex. A6 at 4.) 30 A preponderance of the evidence establishes that Licensee \"educates \" patients on the alleged futility and dangers associated with mask wearing (/>., provides informed consent on mask wearing) even when patients do not ask about mask wearing or they do not complain of adverse symptoms related to mask wearing.

Licensee told Investigator Carruth that he would not agree to meet remotely with the Board and that if he were to meet with the Board in person, he would not wear a mask. (Id. at 4.) 48. On December 3, 2020, the Board 's Investigatory Committee referred the matter to the full Board for action. On that date, the full Board convened via conference call at 5:00 p.m., and a majority of the members voted to issue an Order of Emergency Suspension to Licensee. (See Exs. Al4 at 1-2, A2 at 2; Tr. I at 255-256.) 49. On December 4, 2020, the Board issued an Order of Emergency Suspension of License and Notice of Opportunity for Hearing to Licensee (Emergency Suspension Order). (Pleading Pl.) The Emergency Suspension Order states, in part: By order of the [Board], the license of [Licensee] to practice medicine is hereby suspended, effective December 3, 2020, at 5:15 p.m. Pacific Time. As of this date and time, Licensee must stop practicing medicine until further order of the Board. [T]his order is made pursuant to [ORS] 677.205(3), which authorizes the Board to temporarily suspend a license without a hearing when the Board has evidence that indicates that Licensee 's continued practice constitutes an immediate danger to the public, as well as ORS 183.430(2), in that the Board has found that Licensee 's continued practice of medicine by a physician presents a serious danger to the public health or safety. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW The Board finds Licensee 's continued practice constitutes an immediate danger to the public, and presents a serious danger to the public health and safety as follows: 5.1 During the pandemic, patients will inevitably present to Licensee 's clinic with known, suspected, or occult infection with SARS-CoV-2; and 5.2 Such patients present a clear and present health risk to other patients and staff; 5.3 Licensee 's active discouragement of mask wearing by patients and elimination of mask wearing by staff and Licensee represent a failure to FINAL ORDER - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 24 of 72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46take appropriate steps to reduce the risk of transmission, thereby posing an unnecessary and preventable risk to patients, staff, and Licensee; and 5.4 Licensee 's instruction and example to patients to shun masks actively promotes transmission of the virus within the extended community; and 5.5 Licensee 's advice to patients regarding the failure of masks to prevent viral transmission and potential harm due to masks, are counter to basic principles of epidemiology and physiology and undermine acceptability among Licensee 's patients and the general populace of one of the primary measures known to significantly diminish viral transmission; and 5.6 Licensee 's OHP patients are assigned to physicians by OHP and, if assigned to Licensee, have limited ability to transfer their care to a different provider. These particularly vulnerable patients are, therefore, largely forced to endure Licensee 's unsafe practices while his medical license remains active. {Id. at 1, 6-7.)

Her data analysis skills include linear and longitudinal regression, logistic regression and propensity score analysis, survival analysis, meta-analysis, data mining, and risk prediction. (Ex. A7 at 5.) 55. Asa Senior Health Advisor for the OHA on COVID-19 matters, Dr. Sutton conducts daily reviews on the latest evidence and literature pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic. (Tr. I at 115.) In her opinion, peer review of medical literature \u2014 whereby colleagues with appropriate expertise are selected to review an article, provide feedback, and ultimately weigh in on the appropriateness of publication \u2014 is an important process that protects against bias and misinformation. (Id. at 129-130.) 56. Dr. Sutton had a significant role in updating the OHA 's \"Clinical Care, and Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Guidance for COVID-19, \" particularly with regard to outpatient and general clinic settings. (Tr. I at 115-116.) In her opinion, a healthcare setting such as a primary care clinic \"presents a great opportunity for a super spreader event, \" given that a primary care physician (and any ancillary staff) might treat as many as 40 patients in a day; between 40 and 60 percent of people infected with COVID-19 may be asymptomatic but infectious; and many people who visit a healthcare facility have underlying comorbidities that may place them at greater risk of harm from COVID-19. (Id. at 119-120.) 57. Viral particles called virions exit a host body in droplets (e.g., saliva, sputum, nasal secretions). The term \"droplet \" is often used to mean droplets that are at least five microns in size, while the term \"aerosol \" may be used for droplets that are less than five microns. (Tr. I at 136-137.) Many scientists think that the smaller droplets (z.e., aerosols) are the most dangerous because they are the most common and because they can shrink significantly via evaporation after leaving the host body and remain suspended in the air. These small suspended particles can accumulate in confined spaces, travel around in air flow, and be easily inhaled. (Id. at 123-124, 137.) Large droplets, in contrast to smaller droplets, travel in projectiles and may land in a person 's eyes, nose, or mouth.

The SARS-CoV-2 virion ranges in size, with the average size being approximately 0.1 microns. (Tr. I at 120, 123, 136-137.) In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, COVID-19 produces a large number of viral particles in saliva and sputum, with studies showing that 10 times more virions are produced by COVID-19 than by SARS-CoV. {Id. at 138.) 59. In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, the size of the droplet determines whether a virion will pass through a mask, and not the size of the virion itself. (Tr. I at 142.) In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, masks block large droplets \"really, really well. \" {Id. at 139, 200.) How well masks block small droplets or aerosols is determined primarily by fit. {Id. at 139; see also id. at 200-201.) 60. While recognizing that physical distancing, handwashing, surface cleaning, and minimization of contact between non-household members is important, Dr. Sutton believes the most important measure to mitigate against the risk of COVID-19 transmission in a healthcare clinic setting is masking. (Tr. I at 123-124.) The role of masking in a clinic setting is to protect patients, healthcare personnel, and the community. {Id. at 120-121.) In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, healthcare personnel who do not mask in a clinical setting would almost certainly become infected with COVID-19 over time, and such infection might not result in symptoms, placing patients at risk of contracting the virus from such personnel unknowingly. {Id. at 122.) 61. Dr. Sutton believes that masks have two potential benefits: 1) they serve as source control by blocking droplets from the wearer 's mouth and nose; and 2) they serve as protection by blocking droplets from entering others ' mouths and noses. (Tr. I at 120-121, 138-139.) In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, the primary role that masks play is with regard to source control. {Id. at 143.)31 62. In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, masks may stop droplets in two different ways: 1) mechanically; and 2) electrostatically. With cloth and non-medical grade masks that do not utilize electrostatic capture, droplets that are larger than the hole (z.e., pore) size in the cloth are stopped. If a mask has electrostatic capture, even droplets that are smaller than the pore size in the cloth can be stopped or caught by the mask. (Tr. I at 140.) 63. Dr. Sutton does not believe that cloth masks have the effect of aerosolizing the droplets exhaled by the wearer. (Tr. I at 202-203.) In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, any mask is better than no mask because even a poorly fitting cloth mask \"will block large droplets quite well. \" {Id. at 143.) In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, homemade double-layered cloth masks that fit well can filter even small particles effectively, potentially even down to two microns. {Id. at 140-141.) 64. Moisture captured in a mask is evidence that the mask is working to capture droplets from a person 's mouth and nose. Moisture affects the efficacy of masks, so the general recommendation (including from the CDC) is to change out a mask when it becomes soiled or wet. In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, cloth masks should be washed after a single use. In her opinion, failure to do so can lessen the protective effect of the mask, but it does not pose a hazard to the wearer, absent some extreme circumstance. (Tr. I at 141 -142, 215-216.) 31 Dr. Sutton testified at hearing that \"when you wear a mask you are actually protecting others more than you are yourself. '' (Tr. I at 143.)

Dr. Sutton acknowledges that masks do not eliminate the risk of transmission of virus particles, but in her opinion, masks reduce such transmission \"by a significant proportion, \" particularly when both the infected person and the person who may potentially become infected are masked. (Tr. I at 144.) In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, there is \"absolutely no debate at this point in time [regarding] whether masks reduce COVID-19 transmission. \" (Id. at 124-125, 173.) She believes that masking is now known to be so clearly protective against the transmission of COVID-19 that a researcher could not obtain ethical board approval for a randomized control study in which a \"control \" group of individuals is asked not to wear a mask because it would clearly represent harm to the group. (Id, at 125.) She believes that the degree of effectiveness of masking varies by the type and fit of the mask, the conduct of the wearer, and other external circumstances. (Id. at 124, 139.) 66. Although randomized controlled trials have traditionally been considered the gold standard for research, in Dr. Sutton 's opinion, randomized controlled trials may not be feasible for an emerging pathogen in a fast-paced pandemic like the current one. She believes that observational studies and research \u2014 while typically considered to be of lower quality than randomized controlled trials \u2014 when accumulated over time can constitute compelling evidence. In her opinion, there is accumulated evidence from observational research showing that masking is associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 transmission. (Tr. I at 134-135.) 67. In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, the benefit of a systematic review is that it consists of an exhaustive review of all available literature regarding an issue, and the benefit of a meta-analysis is that all the data from all the different studies is pooled to produce a pooled effect estimate. (Tr. I at 127-128; see also id. at 171.)32 68. In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, masks have long been used in healthcare settings safely, masking for both healthcare providers and patients is the standard of care in influenza and respiratory disease outbreaks, and there is \"no evidence that masks are not safe when used appropriately. \" (Tr. I at 144-145.) She recognizes that some people do not tolerate masks well, and she supports the masking exemption for patients and caregivers who are unable to tolerate wearing masks. (Id. at 152, 162.) 69. In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, there can be long-term health consequences for people who contract COVID-19. She believes it is common for COVID-infected persons to have persistent symptoms at 30 days, and some people (referred to as \"long haulers \") have experienced persistent, sometimes disabling, symptoms many months after infection. (Tr. I at 160.) Some COVID-19 infected patients have experienced scarring of the lungs, which can have long-term consequences and cause persistent symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue. (Id, at 161.) 70. In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, the PCR test is the best test for COVID-19, but \"it is in no way perfect. \" (Tr. I at 194.) Dr. Sutton disagrees with Licensee 's assertion that the PCR test produces a significant amount of false positives. On the contrary, Dr. Sutton believes that the 32 Dr. Sutton explained that an advantage of a pooled effect estimate is that if, for example, you have a small study that shows no benefit but a larger study that does show benefit, there is a process to average and weigh the studies to get \"a better idea of what 's going on.\" (Tr.

In Dr. Nolt 's opinion, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily through respiratory droplets and airborne contact. (Tr. II at 182.) In Dr. Nolt 's opinion, although there are no randomized controlled trials showing that masks protect against transmission of COVID- 19, there is \"an accumulation of very good evidence showing that masks do decrease COVID-19 transmission. \" (Id. at 184-185, 226.) In Dr. Nolt 's opinion, masking reduces the risk of transmission of COVID-19, and it is the standard of care for healthcare workers to wear masks in clinical settings, including direct patient care, during the COVID-19 pandemic. (Id. at 190-191.) 79. In Dr. Nolt 's opinion, masking is important for two reasons: 1) it serves as source control for the person who may be talking, coughing, or singing and inadvertently extruding virus; and 2) it serves as a barrier to protect people who are exposed to the source of virus.

The threshold of virus that causes infection is unknown. But once some threshold is achieved, there is an incubation period for the virus to replicate, and then the person who is infected can pass the infection on to other people. (Tr. II at 182-184.) 80. In Dr. Nolt 's opinion, transmission of SARS~CoV-2 is based on three factors: dose; duration; and distance. Dose refers to the amount of respiratory secretions that are expelled by a source, duration refers to exposure over time, and distance refers to how far you are from the source. Dr. Nolt believes that dose can be controlled by masking. (Tr. II at 186-187.) 81. Dr. Nolt acknowledges that wearing a mask, particularly a tight-fitting mask such as an N95, could cause a pressure headache and that prolonged mask wearing could cause contact dermatitis or acne. She points out that such issues are minor and treatable. In her opinion, numerous studies show that there is no risk of increased CO2 toxicity or decreased 02 from mask wearing. (Tr. II at 199-200.) 82. In Dr. Nolf s opinion, Licensee 's manner of managing his clinic during the COVID- 19 pandemic constituted a danger to the health and safety of clinic patients, clinic staff, and the public. (Tr. II at 212.) Dr. Nolt opined as follows: Mask wearing has been proven to inhibit virus transmission and particle transmission between people, and during this ongoing pandemic, we use the best available evidence we can to stem this pandemic and so we should use all measures. Mask wearing is not perfect, but mask wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene, cleaning surfaces, all those should be employed to not only keep our patients safe but to keep the healthcare staff that we have * * * safe and keep the community safe; so masking is very important and should be practiced. {Id. at 212-213.) In Dr. Nolt 's opinion, if Licensee returned to practice and followed his same clinic protocols regarding masking, his patients and the public would be subject to risk of harm. {Id. at 213.) C.

He has been published in the Journal of the American College of Emergency Physicians (1979), Clinical Toxicology (1980), and Anesthesia & Analgesia (1988 - letter). (Id. at 2-3.) 85. Since 2019, Dr. Farris has served as the Board 's Medical Director. (Ex. Al 9 at 1; Tr. II at 11.) As the only medically-trained person out of the approximately 40 Board employees (which does not include Board members), he is involved in the medical aspects of Board investigations and licensing matters, and he serves as a resource for medical issues. He reviews each investigation and investigative report before it is presented to the Board 's Investigative Committee. If a particular investigation does not require his input regarding medical care, he simply signs off on the investigator 's report and forwards the matter to the Investigative Committee. If, however, an investigation involves matters such as substandard medical care, Dr. Farris will prepare a summary for the Investigative Committee to accompany the investigator 's report. (Tr. II at 11-12.) 86. As an anesthesiologist, Dr. Farris has expertise in monitoring CO2 levels and in the concepts of CO2 retention and dead space inhalation. (Tr. II at 12.) The CO2 blood level for a typical person is 40 mm/Hg (millimeters of mercury). A person with lung disease might have a CO2 blood level of 50 mm/Hg. (Id. at 53.) Dr. Farris opines, as follows: The level of carbon dioxide in the body in an awake, healthy person is one of the most tightly regulated parameters we can measure. The body compensates unconsciously by controlling the amount of air that we exchange minute by minute to maintain carbon dioxide within a very tight range, generally expressed as 40 millimeters of mercury[.] /// FINAL ORDER - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 33 of 72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46[I]f you think about the way that we breathe, it is piston-like. We take in air, we exhale air; so there is not a continuous flow past the gas exchange part of the lungs. The alveoli of the lungs, the tiny saccules deep in the lungs are where gas exchange occurs. So it is only that air, that gas, that is delivered to the alveoli where gas exchanges occurs. As we inhale, there is a certain amount of air that sits in the nose, mouth, and trachea and the major airways of the lungs that is not exposed to any gas exchanging tissue. So that volume of gas is called dead space ventilation. It is not participating in gas exchange. So the typical breath that a person takes is 450 to 500 milliliters. Of that volume, about 150 mLs is generally considered dead space ventilation[.] (Id. at 12-14.) In Dr. Farris ' opinion, wearing a mask, particularly a well-fitted one, can double the dead space ventilation, requiring the body to increase the amount of gas the person is exchanging minute to minute to tightly regulate and maintain the CO2 level at approximately 40 mm/Hg in the aiteries and approximately 44 or 45 mm/Hg in the veins. This can be accomplished by breathing more deeply or more frequently, and \"it is the product of those two that produce the amount of gas that you exchange in a given minute, \" which is referred to as \"minute ventilation. \" (Id. at 14-15; 78.) In Dr. Farris ' opinion, if a person is wearing a loosely fitted mask, then there is likely some degree of cross-ventilation and fresh air displacing some of the exhaled carbon dioxide, and the body would not have to increase its minute ventilation as much as with a tight-fitting mask. (Id. at 15-16.) 87. In Dr. Farris ' opinion, symptoms of CO2 toxicity would only be expected to occur if a person 's CO2 level reached as high as 90 mm/Hg, which is the equivalent of holding one's breath for one hour. In Dr. Farris ' opinion, symptoms of CO2 toxicity would not occur under conditions created by mere mask-wearing, and would only occur at a level of CO2 \"not achievable short of an unconscious person or a person basically being suffocated. \" (Tr. II at 53\u00ad 54.) 88. In Dr. Fams ' opinion, although some vital sign parameters have been shown to change in trivial directions from mask wearing, the body quickly compensates, there is no significant increase in CO2 levels or decrease in 02 levels, and masks do not cause physiologic harm to mask wearers. (Tr. II at 49-50.) He opines that even if masks cause retention of CO2, the oxygen level as measured does not change and, despite increasing the acidic state of the body, there is no physiologic harm caused. (Id. at 50, 52.) He believes that side effects caused from mask-wearing such as skin breakdown or impetigo, though minor, may warrant exemption from masking mandates. (Id. at 51.) 89. In Dr. Farris ' opinion, a literature review, which summarizes known data, is highly useful for clinicians because it provides a summary of what is known and what is not known about a subject. A literature review is not itself a scientific study but, rather, a summation of scientific studies. (Tr. II at 65-66.) 90. Dr. Farris describes the factors that inform the quality of a meta-analysis as follows: /// FINAL ORDER - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 34 of 72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46A meta-analysis * * * takes the data from a number of studies and creates a pooled set of data so that you might have a study that involved a thousand patients and four studies that involved 200 patients, and if you determine that the patients are similar enough in their characteristics, then you can analyze a pool of 1800 patients, which obviously has far more reaching implications than any of the studies individually[.] [Determining that the patients ' subpopulations in the different studies are similar enough and that all the parameters that you are interested in have been measured * * * [is] what complicates the idea of a meta-analysis, what complicates the execution. The idea is * * * to pool all the subjects in a number of studies and draw conclusions on a much broader basis, but the complicating factors in the execution are that not all the studies may have measured all the relevant parameters in the way that you want them to, may not have been controlled in the way that you want them to. [I]f you find that the study populations that you are pooling do have a high degree of similarity, then the validity of the meta-analysis can be considered quite good. If you are trying to draw from subject populations that are quite disparate and you are missing data sets in a number of them, then the conclusions would be suggestive, less convincing. (Tr. II at 66-68.) 91. In Dr. Farris ' opinion, it is fundamental general medical knowledge that respiratory viruses are primarily transmitted through \"respiratory droplets. \" (Tr. II at 27.) Based on his knowledge, experience, and review of medical literature, Dr. Farris opines that the principal mode by which people are infected with SARS-CoV-2 is through exposure to respiratory droplets from the lungs, trachea, oropharynx, and saliva, which all contain fluid known to carry infectious virus. {Id. at 16, 27; see id. at 34-45 (discussion of the medical literature he reviewed).) 92. In Dr. Fams ' opinion, \"there is little doubt that masks are effective \" in reducing the transmission of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. (Tr. II at 19-20.) 93. In Dr. Farris ' opinion, \"if we decrease the amount of virus we are emitting into the atmosphere, we are decreasing the likelihood that anyone will contract an infection and * * * likely decreasing the severity \" of any such infection due to considerations of the viral load. (Tr. II at 20-21.) In Dr. Farris ' opinion, no one has yet quantified the number of viral particles that are required to produce an infection in a person. He believes that although it is theoretically possible that a single virion attached to cells in the lining of a lung could eventually replicate /// .

Dr. Farris opines as follows: [IJt stands to reason that if a person inhaled * * * a dozen respiratory droplets and exposed a given segment of the lung to * * * [for example,] a million viral particles and a virus set up shop in one small part of the lung, as it spreads over time, it would be a slower spread than if the person inhaled 10 times that many respiratory droplets and the virus set up shop in 10 parts of the lung. It stands to reason that the slower spread could be more readily contained by the immune system than the person who inhaled 10 times that much virus and would potentially, then, be subjected to an overwhelming disease load before the immune system caught up. So the concept of the viral load is highly relevant in terms of not only the likelihood of a person developing any infection at all but developing a symptomatic infection and * * * the ability to pass the infection along. So as a mask diminishes, without eliminating, * * * the number of respiratory droplets and aerosols in the air, then it stands to reason that the viral load would decrease even for those who were exposed. And that is why the masks are known to diminish * * * measurable contagion. It's probably that it is not only diminishing measurable disease but viral burden in those who are asymptomatic. (Zd. at 21-22.) 94. In Dr. Farris ' opinion, although not impossible, it is highly unlikely that none of Licensee 's patients contracted COVID-19 while under his care at the clinic. Dr. Farris questions how Licensee would even know whether any patients contracted COVID-19 from the clinic because Licensee did not do any cultures or testing, making it highly unlikely that he would know of a patient 's asymptomatic infection. In Dr. Farris ' opinion, patients who treated with Licensee at the clinic during the pandemic could have developed a COVID-19 infection with a median time of five days after potential exposure at the clinic, and Licensee would not necessarily know about it. (Tr. II at 56-57.) 95. In Dr. Farris ' opinion, the PCR test has a high rate of false negatives. (Tr. II at 58.) 96.

He holds board certifications in Sleep Medicine, Pulmonary Medicine, and Critical Care Medicine. He is licensed as a physician in North Carolina. He is not licensed as a physician in Oregon. (Tr. IV at 174-175.) 98. Dr. Stern currently oversees a Pulmonary, Sleep, and Clinical Research office, where he primarily practices Sleep Medicine and Pulmonary Medicine, consults on clinical trial designs, and runs research trials for pharmaceutical and medical device companies. He has expertise regarding clinical trials and research. (Tr. IV at 175-176, 234.) In approximately 2018, he was part of a team that designed \"the most efficient air filtration system in the world. \" (Id. at 177.) The process involved conducting extensive research into the data regarding the use of masks in preventing respiratory disease and collaborating with a group of design engineers. The filtration system is currently sold under the company name Celios. Dr. Stern did not receive direct compensation for his work in helping to design the filtration system, but he did receive Celios stock. (Id. at 177, 244-245.) 99. Dr. Stern follows the directives of his state and wears a face mask as required in the clinic. His facemask of choice is a cloth face mask because he considers it the most comfortable of the various types. All staff at his clinic wear face masks when having patient contact, with the exception of one employee who is immunized against COVID-19, and wears a face shield in place of a mask. In the waiting room of the clinic, patients practice social distancing. Every patient is screened immediately at the front desk, and such screening includes temperature and pulse readings. If a patient shows any signs of COVID-19, the patient is isolated in a room with a Celios air filter. Most of Dr. Stern 's patients (and accompanying visitors) wear masks at the clinic. (Tr. IV at 223-224, 234-237, 242.) 100. In the hierarchy of studies, Dr. Stern believes that the best individual study is a randomized controlled clinical trial. In his opinion, multiple randomized controlled clinical trials that all came to the same conclusion would constitute even stronger evidence. He believes that retrospective cohort studies can be useful to come up with a question to design a randomized trial, but he is opposed to making policy decisions based on such studies alone. He believes that case-controlled studies and observational studies have some value, but he does not think it is wise to rely on them to make policy decisions. (Tr. IV at 200-202, 228; see also Ex. R43 at 2.) For scientific research purposes, Dr. Stern believes there is no real substitute for a randomized controlled clinical trial. (Tr. IV at 202.) 101. In Dr. Stern 's opinion, research between June 2015 and 2017 demonstrates a \"clear understanding \" that masks are not an effective method of curtailing respiratory diseases, and he believes that remained the prevailing opinion until June 2020. (Tr. IV at 177.) On June 5, 2020, the WHO published an interim guidance document titled \"Advice on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19. \" (Ex. R81 at 1-16; Tr. IV at 177-178.) With regard to the issue of continuous use of medical masks by healthcare workers in areas of known or suspected community transmission, the document states, in part: /// FINAL ORDER - Steven Arthur LaTulippe.

Despite the lack of evidence the great majority of the WHO COVID-19 IPC [Guidance Development Group] members supports the practice of health workers and caregivers in clinical areas (irrespective of whether there are COVID-19 or other patients in the clinical areas) in geographic settings where there is known or suspected community transmission of COVID-19, to continuously wear a medical mask throughout their shift, apart from when eating and drinking or changing the mask after caring for a patient requiring droplet/contact precautions for other reasons (e.g., influenza), to avoid any possibility of cross-transmission. (Ex. R81 at 4.) In Dr. Stern 's opinion, the above does not constitute evidence-based medicine, and the WHO 's recommendation for universal masking by healthcare workers despite a lack of evidence does not constitute sound decision-making. (Tr. IV at 177-178, 222-223.) 102. In Dr. Stern 's opinion, COVID-19 is transmitted via direct contact with droplets and via aerosol, and there is no \"definitive data\" to show that one method of transmission is more common than the other. (Tr. IV at 176.) He believes that COVID-19 \"spreads like wildfire. \" (^) 103. In Dr. Stern 's opinion, with regard to disease transmission by respiratory routes, the only respiratory particles that really matter are the ones that are smaller than 10 microns. (Tr. IV at 185; see Ex. R36 at 12.) In his opinion, the smaller the viral particle, the more infectious it is. He believes that for masks to work effectively, they must be capable of blocking particles that are two microns or less in size. Because SARS-CoV-2 has a particle size of 0.12 microns, he believes a mask must be capable of filtering out 0.5 microns or less to be effective. (Tr. IV at 186-187.) 104. In Dr. Stern 's opinion, the second SARS-CoV-2 droplets leave a person, the droplets are under the influence of their surrounding environment. The fluid in the droplet is completely evaporated in a second, so just the virion is remaining. (Tr. IV at 183.) He believes that coronavirus and flu virus are \"extremely similar \" in physical properties, so they can be expected to behave similarly according to the laws of physics. (Id. at 181-182, 209-210; see Ex. R45.) 105. In Dr. Stern 's opinion, there is \"a wealth of data\" showing that masks are not effective for viral respiratory diseases. (Tr. IV at 179.) He believes the data overwhelmingly supports a conclusion that masks do not prevent the spread of respiratory droplets, and that cloth masks can actually do more harm than good by increasing the number of respirable particles. (See id. at 184, 222, 241.) Dr. Stern opines that because there is currently no data to show that masks prevent the spread of COVID-19, it would not be unethical to do a randomized controlled study regarding COVID-19 masking. (Id. at 214-215.) /// FINAL ORDER. - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 38 of 72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46106. In Dr. Stern 's opinion, different masks perform differently in capturing respiratory droplets. In Dr. Stern 's opinion, a surgical mask could be expected to capture approximately 50 percent of the respiratory droplets that come from a mask worn by a SARS-CoV-2 infected source. (Tr. IV at 242.) 107. Dr. Stern believes the filter material on N95 masks \"does a good job catching droplets. \" (Tr. IV at 242-243, 184.) In his opinion, it is very difficult to make an airtight seal between a mask and a person 's face. He believes that even though an N95 mask does \"a much better job sealing against the face than a cloth mask, * * * they still fail the majority of times in clinical trials when they are trying to block out viruses. \" {Id. at 189.) 108. When evaluating the efficacy of masks to block the transmission of viral respiratory particles, the gold standard to which Dr. Stern compares masks is that of the filter system he helped to design that can filter out \"99.999996 percent of all particles 10 nanometers in size and largerf,] so 1/12 the size of the virus. \" (See Tr. IV at 190; see also id. at 241 -242. )33 109. The highest respirator efficiency is a powered air purifying respirator, called a PAPR, which costs approximately $1,200. (Tr. IV at 189.) In Dr. Stern 's opinion, given the level of protection afforded by a PAPR, every healthcare worker should ideally have access to this type of respirator to protect themselves from viral respiratory illness on the job. (See Tr. IV at 215.) E. Kristen Meghan Kelly 110. Ms. Kelly has 18 years of experience in the field of Occupation and Environmental Toxicology, specifically in the field of Industrial Hygiene. As a disabled Veteran, she is now medically retired from field work. She is currently a \"Health Freedom and Informed Consent \" Educator and Volunteer, and she publicly presents on topics such as health hazard controls, respirator protection, PPE, vaccine risk, and \"Constitutional Oath Accountability. \" (Ex. 108 at 1; Tr.

DR. STERN: Yeah. So the system we designed filters out 99.999996 percent of all particles 10 nanometers in size and larger[,] so 1/12 the size of the virus. That 's what I determine is effective or how I would define effective control. I would be comfortable wearing. (Tr.

In 2014, Ms. Kelly obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Occupational Safety and Health and in 2017, she obtained a Master 's Degree in Occupational Safety and Health from Columbia Southern University. She has received job training on topics such as hazardous waste operations, hazardous materials awareness, OSHA supervisor and construction safety, bioenvironmental engineering, advanced industrial hygiene measurements, emergency response operations, the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program, industrial and administrative ergonomics, and FEMA Incident Command System and Response Plan. She has obtained certificates in Industrial Hygiene Management, Occupational Safety and Health, and Public Health. (Ex. R108 at 1-3.)35 112. From November 2012 to 2016, Ms. Kelly worked as a Senior Industrial Hygienist for Commonwealth Edison/Exelon, the largest electrical utility company in Illinois. She managed Industrial Hygiene programs for approximately 6,000 employees; conducted inspections, risk assessments, and field health and safety audits to mitigate and/or control industrial hygiene and safety hazards; oversaw industrial hygiene and environmental contracts; approved sampling strategies; interpreted quantitative and qualitative data; facilitated accident and mishap investigations; approved cost proposals; and developed and presented formal training and instructional sessions. She specialized in reasonable accommodations in the workplace as related to safety and health issues, working with both Human Resources and union personnel to accommodate workers with disabilities and religious restrictions/needs. (Ex. R108 at 1.) 113. From 2001 to May 2012, Ms. Kelly worked as an Industrial Hygienist, Environmental Manager, and Construction Safety Officer for the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center. She managed Hearing Conservation, Confined Space, Blood-Borne Pathogen, and Ergonomics surveillance programs for more than 2,400 employees; managed and implemented OSHA 's Respiratory Protection Program; oversaw construction projects; facilitated project modifications and provided risk assessment data during project development and implementation; repaired major program deficiencies in the Respiratory Protection Program; responded to and investigated OSHA/EPA inquiries; presented formal training and instructional sessions; supervised employee/contractor safety training; implemented Environmental Safety & Occupational Health Policies within the VA network; responded to indoor air quality issues, unknown odors, and potential gas leaks; chaired the Hazardous Materials/Environmental Committee and the Laser Safety Committee; and served as a member of the Medical Executive, Safety, and Infection Control Committees. (Ex. R108 at 1-2.) 114. From 2002 to 2010, Ms. Kelly worked as an Industrial Hygienist, Environmental Specialist, Emergency Responder, and Training Manager as an Active-Duty Member of the U.S. Air Force. (Ex. R108 at 2-3; Tr. IV at 13.) She conducted occupational health surveillance, radiological monitoring, and environmental surveys for 80,000 military and civilian workers at 700 workplaces; evaluated, sampled, and implemented control measures for cadmium, lead, asbestos, and strontium chromates; created training initiatives and employee education specific to employees ' work areas; calibrated, operated, and utilized a wide variety of industrial hygiene and environmental sampling devices; assessed work area tasks and processes for worker health hazards; ensured safety programs were correct and control measures were adequate; provided 35 This Final Order refers to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration as \"OSHA, \" and the Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Division as \"OR-OSHA. \" FINAL ORDER. - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 40 of 72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46guidance in selecting PPE; detected violations of published health standards/regulations and made corrective recommendations; tracked and managed workplace exposures; and performed environmental compliance sampling for proper waste disposal and safe drinking water. (Ex. R108at2-3.) 115. Per federal OSHA regulations, a health risk assessment must be conducted for each task and workplace before a conclusion may be reached that PPE, such as respiratory protection, is required in a workplace setting. (Tr. IV at 15-16, 23.)36 116. An industrial hygienist 's goal is to find the safest and most effective way to protect an employee, with consideration of other available controls. (See Tr. IV at 54-55.) When selecting any form of PPE, an industrial hygienist considers both the effectiveness of the PPE and the safety of the PPE for the specific conditions, given the parameters of its use (e.g., duration it will be worn; whether it can be changed out; the likelihood of cross-contamination). (Id. at 19, 23.) 117. When an industrial hygienist performs pandemic planning, workers are placed into tiered exposure groups. N95 masks could, for example, be appropriate for workers in nutritional services or registration, but PAPRs and CAPRs would be required for workers with close contacts \u2014 such as surgeons operating on infectious patients. (Tr. IV at 28.) 118. In Ms. Kelly 's opinion, if an industrial hygienist ever approved or recommended the use of cloth masks, surgical masks, or ear loop masks as a form of source control or respiratory protection for the wearer against infectious diseases, the industrial hygienist would \"probably be fined by OSHA, written up, and * * * lose * * * credentialing[.] \" (Tr. IV at 25.) In her opinion, CDC guidance and state-level guidance/requirements pertaining to mask wearing for the COVID-19 pandemic contravene existing OSHA practices and standards. (Id.) 119. In Ms. Kelly 's opinion, there are no reliable scientific studies to date that support the efficacy of masks in curtailing the spread of viruses. (Tr. IV at 70.) When dealing with certain unnamed infectious diseases in healthcare settings, in Ms. Kelly 's experience, Air Force healthcare workers did not wear N95 masks \"due to the micron size of some of these viruses. \" (Id. at 18.) Instead, the workers wore respiratory protection devices such as PAPRs and controlled air purifying respirators (CAPRs). (Id.) In Ms. Kelly 's opinion, PAPRs and CAPRs are considered the \"top-tier selection \" for respiratory protection in infectious disease wards. (Id. at 27.) In Ms. Kelly 's opinion, N95 masks \"cannot filter aerosols at a safe level to where you have the most confidence as a control. \" (Id. at 26.)37 120. In Ms. Kelly 's opinion, surgical and cloth masks have not been historically used as respirators. In her opinion, surgical masks have been viewed historically only as source control 36 At hearing, Ms. Kelly testified as to various federal standards in OSHA 's respiratory protection program; her experience implementing such standards as an industrial hygienist; the regulatory requirements for initial and annual medical questionnaires; and the training requirements related to storage, cleaning, and usage of personal protective devices. (See Tr. IV at 14-18,23.) 37 Ms. Kelly testified that a PAPR can range in cost from approximately $1,100 to $2,000, and a single N95 mask might cost around $50. (Tr. IV at 66.)

(Tr. IV at 28.) In Ms. Kelly 's opinion, a typical surgical mask can only stop large droplets. (Id. at 56.) 121. In Ms. Kelly 's opinion, cloth contamination and self-contamination are significant factors in the failure of cloth and surgical masks to prevent or contain the spread of SARS-CoV- 2. (Tr. IV at 32-33.) She believes that because, generally speaking, members of the public are not trained on how to properly don and doff such masks, when to change them out, and how to dispose of them properly, mask wearing provides people with a false sense of security as to masking 's efficacy in mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2. (Id. at 33.) 122. In Ms. Kelly 's opinion, allowing patients to choose whether to wear a mask in a healthcare setting \"respects a multitude of issues with medical intolerance and individual ADA disabilities where some people cannot don a mask. \" (Tr. IV at 35.) Relevant Medical Literature 123. The peer-reviewed journal Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease published an article in May 2020, titled \"Efficacy of face mask in preventing respiratory virus transmission: A systematic review of meta-analysis. \" (See Ex. All at 2-10; Tr. I at 127-129.) The systematic review and meta-analysis consisted of 21 studies and almost 9,000 participants. It included 13 case-control studies, 2 cohort studies, and six cluster randomized trials \u2014seven involving SARS, five involving H1N1, four involving influenza virus, four involving respiratory viral illness, and one involving SARS-CoV-2. It considered face mask use in both healthcare workers and non\u00ad healthcare workers. (Ex. Al 1 at 4-5; Tr. I at 127-129.) In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, all of the data \"best practices \" for performing systematic reviews and meta-analyses were followed. (Tr. I at 127. ) The meta-analyses of the 21 studies demonstrated that masking reduced the overall risk of respiratory virus transmission by 65 percent, with an 80 percent reduction for health care workers and a 47 percent reduction for non-healthcare workers. (See Ex. All at 2-8; Tr. I at 128. ) The results suggest that mask use provided \"a significant protective effect \" on the spread of respiratory viruses. (Ex. All at 2.) The authors concluded that while more evidence is still needed to better clarify the effectiveness of masking in various circumstances, the systematic review and meta-analysis \"showed the general efficacy of masks in preventing the transmission \" of respiratory viral illness. (Id. at 8.) 124. The Lancet, a widely recognized and respected journal in science and health, published \"Physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection to prevent person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis \" on June 27, 2020.

This systematic review and meta-analysis looked at 172 observational studies across 16 countries and 44 comparative studies in healthcare and non-healthcare settings, including 29 studies specific to mask-wearing, involving SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. (Ex. R77 at 1-2, 7; Tr. II at 186.) The results \"suggest that wearing face masks protects people (both health-care workers and the general public) against infection by these coronaviruses. \" (Ex.

Raina MacIntyre, who is well- respected in the field of masking and infectious diseases, on June 1, 2020, titled \"Physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection for prevention of COVID-19?' (Ex. R76 at 1-2; Tr. II at 194.) The commentary focuses on the June 27, 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis, which has been designated as Exhibit R77. (Tr. II at 194-195.) Dr. MacIntyre notes that the results of the systematic review and meta-analysis support universal face mask use \"because masks were equally effective in both health-care and community settings when adjusted for type of mask use.\" (Ex. R76 at 2.) Dr. MacIntyre also notes that \"[g]rowing evidence \" of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-21 provides further support for both universal face mask use and distancing. (Id.) Dr. MacIntyre concluded that \"[ujntil randomised controlled trial data are available, this study provides the best specific evidence for COVID-19 prevention. \" (Id.)38 126. Acta Informatica Medica published an article (\"Professional Paper \") on September 22, 2008, titled \"Evidence Based Medicine - New Approaches and Challenges. \" (Ex. R43 at 1\u00ad 7; Tr. IV at 198.) The author states, in part: One of the greatest achievements of evidence-based medicine has been the development of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, methods by which researchers identify multiple studies on a topic, separate the best ones and then critically analyze them to come up with a summary of the best available evidence. (Ex. R43 at 1.) 127. The Annals of Internal Medicine published an article on June 24, 2020, titled \"Masks for Prevention of Respiratory Virus Infections, Including SARS-CoV-2, in Health Care and Community Settings: A Living Rapid Review. \" (Ex. R68 at 1-15; Tr. IV at 220-222.) The article examined the effectiveness of N95, surgical, and cloth masks in community and health care settings for preventing respiratory virus infections by reviewing 18 randomized controlled trials and 21 observational studies. (Ex. R68 at 1.) The evidence on SARS-CoV-2 was limited to 2 observational studies \"with serious limitations. \" (Id.) The authors found that community mask use was \"possibly associated with decreased risk for SARS-CoV- 1 infection in observational studies. \" (Id.) In high- or moderate-risk health care settings, observational studies found that risk for infection with SARS-CoV- 1 and MERS probably decreased with mask use versus nonuse and possibly decreased with N95 versus surgical mask use. The authors concluded that \"[e]vidence on mask effectiveness for respiratory infection prevention is stronger in health care than community settings, \" and while \"N95 respirators might reduce SARS-CoV- 1 risk versus surgical masks in health care settings, \" the applicability to SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain, (/d.) 38 Dr. Nolt explained at hearing that for studies that seem quite seminal, frequently another expert (who is not affiliated with the study) will write a commentary highlighting the significance of the study.

The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) published an article in January 2021 (submitted for review in July 2020), titled \"An Evidence Review of Face Masks Against COVID-19. \" (See Ex. A13 at 1; Tr. II at 35-36.) The authors conducted a narrative review of mask usage, and synthesized the relevant literature with regard to multiple areas, including population impact, transmission characteristics, source control, wearer protection, sociological considerations, and implementation considerations. The authors noted that the primary route of COVID-19 transmission occurs via respiratory particles and the virus is known to be transmissible from presymptomatic, paucisymptomatic, and asymptomatic persons. The authors concluded that a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that mask wearing \"reduces transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected respiratory particles in both laboratory and clinical contexts. \" (See Ex. Al 3 at 1; Tr. II at 35-43.) The authors recommend that public official adopt masking mandates, reasoning that a masking mandate is not only more effective in generating mask use, but it is perceived as being more fair and socially responsible by the general public and reduces the stigma associated with wearing a mask. (Tr. II at 42-43.) 129. Lancet Respiratory Medicine published an article by Kevin P. Fennelly, M.D., on July 24, 2020, titled, \"Particle sizes of infectious aerosols: implications for infectious control. \" (Ex. R103; Tr. IV at 30-31.) The author reviewed the scientific literature on the aerosols generated by persons with respiratory infections and discussed how such data might inform the optimal use of masks, respirators, and other measures to protect healthcare workers. (Ex. R103 at 1.) The author determined there is \"no evidence to support the concept that most respiratory infections are associated with primary large droplet transmission. In fact, small particle aerosols are the rule, rather than the exception. \" (R103 at 7; Tr. IV at 31.) With regard to SARS-CoV-2 specifically, the author concluded that the virus \"has the potential to be spread by all modes of transmission: direct contact (i.e., person-to-person) and indirect contact (e.g., via contaminated objects and aerosol) \" but it \"is not yet clear which mode occurs most frequently. \" (Ex. R103 at 6.) The author noted that \"(t]here is mounting evidence suggesting that the wearing of masks can reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in community and health-care settings. \" (Id. at 8.) The author concluded that, with regard to infectious aerosols in general, \"[sjurgical masks might offer some respiratory protection from inhalation of infectious aerosols, but not as much as respirators. However, surgical masks worn by patients reduce exposures to infectious aerosols to health-care workers and other individuals. \" (Id. at 2.)39 130. The American Society for Microbiology (mSphere) published a study in October 2020, titled \"Effectiveness of Face Masks in Preventing Airborne Transmission of SARS-CoV- 2.\" (See Ex.

Using an airborne transmission simulator (and mannequins), and a \"relatively high dose of virus, \" the study assessed the transmissibility of infectious drop!ets/aerosols of SARS-CoV-2 and the ability of cotton, surgical, and N95 masks to block the transmission. (Ex. All at 25, 29; Tr. II at 30-31.) The simulations showed that \"cotton masks, surgical marks, and N95 masks had a protective effect with respect to the transmission of infective droplets/aerosols and that the protective efficiency was higher when masks were worn by the vims spreader. \" (Ex.

Dr. Farris believes that the study likely underestimated the effectiveness of the masks because the study used a relatively thin non\u00ad physiologic fluid and a continuous stream of gas through the source mask that was intended to mimic normal, mild, and moderate coughing for 20 minutes at the point of measurement. Dr. Farris opined: I don't want to contemplate [coughing] continuously for 20 minutes because it sounds like I would die, but that is the model that they used; so I find it not the least bit surprising that they measured a relatively low, compared to other epidemiologic studies, * * * success rate for these masks. I believe that they did that to try overwhelm the masks and * * * basically test their breaking point. Twenty minutes of a continuous stream of a non-protein containing fluid, a relatively thin fluid in other words, would basically stress any mask to the breaking point. So if you still find a 20 percent containment at that point with even a cloth mask, it stands to reason that you are going to find a significantly higher rate of containment in someone who is speaking or coughing, even saying the word healthy. (Tr. II at 32-33.) 131. The peer-reviewed journal Annals of Internal Medicine published a study in November 2020, titled \"Effectiveness of Adding a Mask Recommendation to Other Public Health Measures to Prevent SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Danish Mask Wearers: A Randomized Controlled Trial \" (the Danish Study). (Ex. A6; Tr. Ill at 24; Tr. II at 25-27.) The Danish Study is the only randomized controlled trial specifically pertaining to SARS-CoV-2. (Tr. Ill at 25-26.) The study sought to determine whether recommending surgical mask use outside of the home reduced the wearers ' risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a setting where masks were uncommon and were not a recommended health measure. The participants were comprised of adults who spent more than three hours per day outside of the household. They were encouraged to follow social distancing measures, plus either a no-mask recommendation or a recommendation to wear a surgical mask when outside the home among other persons. (Ex. R6 at 1.) The results showed that out of 4,862 participants who completed the study, SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 42 participants for whom masks had been recommended and in 53 participants in the non-mask recommended control group. (Id. at 2.) The authors noted the following limitations of the study: \"Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others. \" (Id.) The authors concluded that the recommendation to wear surgical masks as an adjunctive public health measure did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among the study participants by more than 50 percent in a community with modest infection rates, some social distancing, and uncommon general mask use. (Id.) The authors noted, however, that the study findings should not be used to conclude that a recommendation for everyone to wear masks in the community would not be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections. (See Tr. I at 155.) /// FINAL ORDER - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 45 of 72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 45 46132, In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, the Danish study is a \"really nice example of why a randomized controlled trial is not always perfect despite being considered the gold standard and how they can fail.\" (Tr. I at 153.) In her opinion, the issue with the study is that \"compliance with the interventions was very low.\" (Id. at 154.) Only 46 percent of the study subjects reporting wearing the mask as recommended, and 47 percent reported wearing it as predominantly recommended. (Id. at 154, 219.) In addition, 20 percent of the participants dropped out of the study. In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, that is a high drop-out rate. (Id. at 154-155.) In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, the study was not designed to determine the effectiveness of source control. Rather, the study was confined to testing the protective effect of masking, and it failed to reliably test that due to poor participant compliance. (Id. at 155.) 133. Dr. Farris believes that one limitation of the Danish study is that it did not measure the spread of disease from people wearing masks (z.e., source containment or spreader effect), which other studies have shown to be the primary role of masks in preventing SARS-CoV-2 contagion. (Tr. II at 25, 27.) In Dr. Farris ' opinion, instructing 3,000 people to wear masks as opposed to not instructing them to \"was a pretty weak intervention, \" with no mechanism to reliably measure compliance. (Id. at 26.) In Dr. Farris ' opinion, although the study failed to demonstrate that masking reduced the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among the study participants by more than 50 percent in their particular community, the study did not conclude that masking is ineffective. (Id. at 25.) Dr. Farris believes the study demonstrated some effect from wearing masks in the current pandemic, and he opines as follows: What is done in virtually all scientific experiments is a statistical analysis to try to estimate the likelihood that * * * [any] measured difference was * * * purely due to random fluctuation as opposed to a real effect. [Here,] the statistical analyses, one showed about a 30 percent likelihood that it was due to a random effect, and * * * the other was 34 percent. That certainly does not pass scientific rigor. The generally accepted cutoff for scientific rigor is about a 5 percent chance or less that the effect measured was due to random variation. So you will see P values in virtually every scientific study, and a P of less than 0.05 or 5 percent is the standard scientific cutoff. You will see some studies where the P value is shown at less than 0.001. In other words, the chance of that being due to a random fluctuation is something like one in 10,000[.] [Here,] that P value of 0.3 or 0.34 states that the statistical analyses show that the likelihood that this was due to a random set of fluctuations was 30 percent or 34 percent, meaning that the likelihood that the effect was real was either 70 percent or 66 percent. So I'm not sure if 70 percent or 66 percent passes the legal muster of the preponderance of the evidence, but it does state that it is more likely than it is less likely that even that small effect was real.

First of all, the study was not designed to show that, and it did not measure what is generally assumed to be or generally shown to be the predominant effect of masks, and that is * * * source containment. (L/. at 25-27.) In Licensee 's opinion, the Danish Study came to \"the exact same conclusion \" as 17 randomized controlled studies regarding influenza or influenza-like illness \u2014 that masks have \"very little or no benefit whatsoever in containing the spread of Coronavirus or influenza. \" (See Tr. Ill at 26, 28.) 134. PNAS published an article on June 30, 2020, titled \"Identifying airborne transmission as the dominant route for the spread of COVID-19. \" (Ex. R17 at 1-21.) The authors state, in part:41 Here we show that airborne transmission is highly virulent and represents the dominant route to spread the disease. We conclude that wearing of face masks in public corresponds to the most effective means to prevent interhuman transmission, and this inexpensive practice, in conjunction with simultaneous social distancing, quarantine, and contact tracing, represents the most likely fighting opportunity to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. (Id. at 2.) Dr. Stern disagrees with the above conclusion. (See Tr. IV at 240.) 135. JAMA published an article on February 10, 2021, titled \"Effectiveness of Mask Wearing to Control Community Spread of SARS-CoV-2. \" (Ex. Al5 at 1-2.) The authors note that an estimated 50 percent or more of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions \"are from persons who never develop symptoms or those who are in the presymptomatic phase of COVID-19 illness. \" (Id. at 1.) The authors also note that \"[c]oncerns about reduced oxygen saturation and carbon dioxide retention when wearing a mask have not been supported by available data. \" (Id.) The authors opine that the Danish Study \"has been improperly characterized by some sources as showing that cloth and surgical masks offer no benefit. \" (Id.) The authors explain: This randomized trial in Denmark was designed to detect at least a 50% reduction in risk for persons wearing surgical masks. Findings were inconclusive, most likely because the actual reduction in exposure these masks provided for the wearer was lower. More importantly, the study was far too small (i.e., enrolled about 0.1% of the population) to assess the community benefit achieved when wearer protection is combined with reduced source transmission from mask wearers to others. (Id.) The authors determine that \"[compelling data now demonstrate that community mask wearing is an effective nonpharmacological intervention to reduce the spread of this infection, 41 Exhibit R17 is a duplicate of Exhibit R38.

Nature Communications, a peer-reviewed journal, published a study on November 20, 2020, titled \"Post-lockdown SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid screening in nearly 10 million residents in Wuhan, China \" (Wuhan study). (Ex. R13 at 1-7.) The study looked at the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection following the release of stringent COVID-19 control measures in Wuhan, China. Nearly 10 million residents participated in the study. The results showed no new symptomatic cases and 300 asymptomatic cases, with no positive tests among 1,174 close contacts of asymptomatic cases. (Id. at 1; Tr. I at 197-198.) The authors summarized the study as follows: The detection rate of asymptomatic positive cases in the post-lockdown Wuhan was very low (0.303/10,000), and there was no evidence that the identified asymptomatic positive cases were infectious. These findings enabled decision makers to adjust prevention and control strategies in the post-lockdown period. Further studies are required to fully evaluate the impacts and cost-effectiveness of the citywide screening of SARS-CoV-2 infections on population 's health, health behaviors, economy, and society. (Ex. A13 at 6.) In Licensee 's opinion, the Wuhan study supports his position that asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 is not significant. (Tr. V at 9; see also Tr. I at 103.) And, he believes that the Wuhan study is supported by other studies showing that the spread of COVID-19 from asymptomatic patients \"appears to be absolutely insignificant. \" (Tr. I at 103.) In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, the Wuhan study does not persuasively bolster Licensee 's position regarding a lack of asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2. She believes that the primary takeaway from the Wuhan study is that the lockdown and masking policy were very effective. In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, her takeaway is consistent with the authors ' conclusion, which was that the prevalence of SARS- CoV-2 infection in Wuhan was very low five to eight weeks after a period of lockdown. (Id. at 197-198; see Ex.R13atl.) 137. The New England Journal of Medicine published a letter on April 15, 2020, titled \"Visualizing Speech-Generated Oral Fluid Droplets with Laser Light Scattering. \" (Ex. Al 5 at 3\u00ad 4; Tr. II at 28-30.) The letter discussed a study demonstrating, through a laser light scattering simulation, visual evidence of the droplets created through normal speech, both with and without the use of a crude mask (i.e., a damp washcloth held in place with rubber bands). (Ex. Al5 at 3\u00ad 4; Tr. II at 28-30.) The study showed, among other things, that wearing the crude mask while speaking decreased the number of forward-moving droplets. (See Ex. Al 5 at 4.) In Dr. Farris ' opinion, the laser light scattering study is \"absolutely demonstrative of the effects of masks. \" (Tr. II at 29.) 138. The journal PLOS One published an article on February 24, 2021, titled \"The effects of wearing facemasks on oxygenation and ventilation at rest and during physical activity. \" (Ex. A22 at 1-7; Tr.

The results showed that among the 50 adult hospital FINAL ORDER - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 48 of 72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46employee volunteers (32 percent of whom had a significant co-morbidity), 42 there were \"no episodes \" of hypoxemia (z.e., low oxygen level) or hypercarbia (i.e., increased CO2 level). (Ex. A22 at 1-2, 4; Tr. I at 152-153.) The authors concluded that \"[t]he risk of pathologic gas exchange impairment with cloth masks and surgical masks is near-zero in the general adult population. \" (Ex. A22 at 2; Tr. I at 152-153.) The authors noted several prior studies of smaller cohorts that similarly found that surgical masks \"cause statistically insignificant or clinically insignificant effects on heart rate and gas exchange. \" (Ex. A22 at 5; internal citations omitted.) 139. The Annals of the American Thoracic Society published a study titled, \"Effect of Face Masks on Gas Exchange in Healthy Persons and Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, \" which involved 15 healthy physicians and 15 patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). (Tr. I at 145-147.) In the study, markers of respiration were measured at baseline, resting with no mask, after masking and sitting for five minutes at rest, after sitting for 30 minutes at rest, and then before and after a \"six-minute walk test.\" (Id. at 146.) The study showed that, as measured by oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, masking did not affect respiration in either the 15 health physicians or the 15 patients with severe COPD. (Id.) 140. The journal Respiratory Physiology and Neurobiology published a January 24, 2012 article titled \"Absence of consequential changes in physiological, thermal and subjective responses from wearing a surgical mask. \" (Ex. A12 at 1-7; Tr. I at 145-146.) The study consisted of 20 healthy people who exercised at a low-moderate rate on a treadmill for one hour, with and without a mask, while being monitored for heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, transcutaneous CO2, SpO2, core and skin temperatures, mask deadspace heat and relative humidity, and skin temperature under the mask. The results showed that surgical mask use for one hour at a low-moderate work rate was \"not associated with clinically significant physiological impact or significant subjective perceptions of exertion and heat. \" (Ex, A12 at 1-4; Tr. I at 146-147.) The authors concluded that any intolerance to wearing surgical mask \"is not likely related to an increased physiological burden, but may reflect [surgical mask]-related neurological or physiological effects. \" (Ex. A12 at 6.) 141. The Journal of Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation and Prevention published an article on January 1, 2021 titled, \"The Physiological Impact of Masking is Insignificant and Should Not Preclude Routine Use During Daily Activities, Exercise, and Rehabilitation. \" (Ex. A13 at 1-2; Tr. II at 45-46.) The authors concluded that masking during daily activities, exercise, and rehabilitation is safe for healthy individuals, as well as for individuals with underlying cardiopulmonary disease, and determined that the benefits of masking during the COVID-19 pandemic \"far outweigh the risks, and increased frequency of mask use invokes adaptive responses that make long-term masking tolerable. \" (Ex.

R29 at 1-11; Tr. II at 23-24.) Hypercapnia refers to excessive CO2. (Tr. II at 23.) The authors measured the changes in gene expression in cell culture by taking cells from the airway epithelium and exposing the cells to 20 percent CO2 versus normal, which is five percent. (Ex. R29 at 1-2; Tr. 42 For example, six study participants had asthma and four study participants had hypertension. (Ex. A22 at 3.)

In Dr. Farris' opinion, 20 percent CO2 corresponds to a level of CO2 achievable in the human body \"by holding one's breath for about two hours, \" which he posits is not possible. (Tr. II at 24.) In Dr. Farris ' opinion, the study measured gene expression in the bronchial epithelial cells \"at an absolutely extraordinary level \" of CO2, and he therefore finds \"no relevance whatsoever in terms of the question of masking. \" (Id:, see also id, at 77.) 143. The MMWR, an epidemiological digest published by the CDC, published a July 17, 2020 article titled \"Absence of Apparent Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from Two Stylists After Exposure at a Hair Salon with a Universal Face Covering Policy \u2014Springfield, Missouri, May 2020. \" (Ex. A25 at 1-3; Tr. I at 125-126.) The article discussed a public health investigation that revealed no signs of COVID-19 transmission to 139 exposed hair salon clients by two salon hair stylists infected with COVID-19. The two stylists and all 139 clients had worn masks during the exposures, which ranged in duration from 15 to 45 minutes. Stylist A had worked with clients for eight days while symptomatic (but before testing positive for COVID-19) and wore a double-layer cotton face covering each of those days during client encounters. Stylist B worked with clients for five days while symptomatic (but before testing positive) and wore either a double-layer cotton mask or a surgical mask during her client encounters. The 139 clients wore either cloth face coverings, surgical masks, or N95 respirators. Contact tracing occurred for all 139 exposed clients, and none of the clients reported any signs or symptoms of COVID-19 for 14 days after their last salon exposure. Out of a total of 67 exposed clients who volunteered to be COVID-19 tested at least five days after their last exposure, all 67 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. All four of Stylist A's close contacts identified for contact tracing purposes (her cohabitating husband; and her daughter, son-in-law, and their roommate who lived together in another household) all subsequently developed symptoms and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. (Ex. A25 at 1-2; Tr. I at 125-126.) The authors of the article concluded that the findings support the role of source control in preventing COVID-19 transmission and can inform the development of public health policy during the pandemic.

Scientific Reports published a study on September 24, 2020, titled \"Efficacy of masks and face coverings in controlling outward aerosol particle emission from expiratory activities. \" (Ex.

The study is summarized, in relevant part, as follows: [W]e measured outward emissions of micron-scale aerosol particles by healthy humans performing various expiratory activities while wearing different types of medical-grade or homemade masks. Both surgical masks and unvented KN95 respirators, even without fit-testing, reduce the outward particle emission rates by 90% and 74% on average during speaking and coughing, respectively, compared to wearing no mask, corroborating their effectiveness at reducing outward emission. *****. Further work is needed to establish the efficacy of cloth masks at blocking expiratory particles for speech and coughing at varied intensity and to assess whether virus-contaminated fabrics can generate aerosolized fomites, but the results strongly corroborate the efficacy of medical-grade /// FINAL ORDER - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 50 of 72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46masks and highlight the importance of regular washing of homemade masks. While the efficacy of cloth and paper masks is not as clear and confounded by shedding of mask fibers, the observations indicate it is likely that they provide some reductions in emitted expiratory particles, in particular the larger particles (> 0.5 pm). We have not directly measured virus emission; nonetheless, our results strongly imply that mask wearing will reduce emission of virus-laden aerosols and droplets associated with expiratory activities, unless appreciable shedding of viable viruses on mask fibers occurs. The majority of the particles emitted were in the aerosol range (< 5 pm). * * *. Our observations are consistent with suggestions that mask wearing can help in mitigating pandemics associated with respiratory disease^] (Ex. R67 at 1; italicized emphasis added.) In Dr. Stern 's opinion, this study is strong evidence that people should not be wearing cloth masks during the Covid- 19 pandemic. (Tr. IV at 211\u00ad 213; see Ex. R67.) In his opinion, the study showed that, with respect to porous cotton masks, \"if you take fluid and you force it through the mask, you take big particles and make them small particles. You increase the count of respirable particles. You turn people into sprinklers and so if someone has COVID and they are wearing a cloth mask, they are increasing their respirable particles when they cough which is very concerning. \" (Tr. IV at 212-213; see also id. at 184.) Dr. Stern disagrees with the conclusion that mask wearing can help in mitigating pandemics involving respiratory disease. (See Tr. IV at 252-253.) 145. MMWR published a June 12, 2020 article titled \"SARS~CoV-2 Infection and Serologic Responses from a Sample of U.S. Navy Service Members \u2014 USS Theodore Roosevelt, April 2020. \" (Ex. All at 13-24; Tr. I at 130.) The article discusses a COVID-19 outbreak aboard a Navy vessel that was subsequently investigated by the Navy and the CDC. (Ex. All at 13; Tr. I at 130-131.) The investigation involved having 382 of the 1,417 service members involved in the outbreak fill out a questionnaire regarding demographic characteristics, exposure, COVID-19 protective behaviors, health history, and symptoms. Masking, with self\u00ad reported use of face coverings, was associated with a 70 percent lower odds of infection in the study group. The limitations of the study include the small study size and the fact that information was obtained from the study subjects by self-report, raising the possibility of selection and recall bias. (Ex. All at 14-15; Tr. I at 131.) In Dr. Stern 's opinion, there are many opportunities for bias in this study, as the authors could not control for social distancing or for different ventilation in various parts of the ship. (Tr.

BMJ Open, an online peer-reviewed medical journal, published a study on April 22, 2015, titled \"A cluster randomised trial of cloth masks compared with medical masks in healthcare workers. \" (Ex.

This study aimed to determine the efficacy of cloth masks compared with medical masks in healthcare workers in high-risk hospital wards, against the prevention of respiratory infections. The study involved 1,600 people in 72 wards over 14 hospitals. A cluster randomized design was utilized (with the hospital wards FINAL ORDER - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 51 of72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46serving as the clusters). The hospital wards were randomized to medical masks, cloth masks, or a control group (with subjects following their usual masking practices). 43 The main outcome measures pertained to clinical respiratory illness (CRI), influenza-like illness (ILI), and laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection (Ex. A69 at 1-2; Tr. IV at 193.) The rates of infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm compared with the medical mask arm. Cloth masks also had significantly higher rates of ILI compared with the control arm. An analysis by mask use showed ILI and laboratory-confirmed virus were significantly higher in the cloth mask group compared with the medical mask group. The authors concluded that the results \"caution against the use of cloth masks, \" but they noted that \"[fjurther research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. \" (Ex. R69 at 1.) In Dr. Stern 's opinion, the study is \"probably the highest quality clinical research on the use of masks in protecting people from respiratory viruses in the healthcare setting. \" (Tr. IV at 193.) Dr. Stern found the study \"quite alarming \" when he originally read it. (Id. at 194.) In his opinion, the study shows that \"not only do cloth masks not protect, they increase the likelihood you are going to get an infection if you wear them in a healthcare setting. \" (Id. at 194.) However, with regard to various limitations of the study, the authors noted the following: [T]he control [healthcare workers] * * * used medical masks more often than cloth masks. The study design does not allow us to determine whether medical masks had efficacy or whether cloth masks were detrimental to [healthcare workers] by causing an increase in infection risk. Either possibility, or a combination of both effects, could explain our results. It is also unknown whether the rates of infection observed in the cloth mask arm are the same or higher than in HCWs who do not wear a mask, as almost all participants in the control arm used a mask. [W]e did not measure compliance with hand hygiene, and the results reflect self-reported compliance, which may be subject to recall or other types of bias. Another limitation of this study is the lack of a no-mask control group and the high use of masks in the controls, which makes interpretation of the results more difficult. (Ex. R69 at 6-7; italicized emphasis added.) 147. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) published an article on October 4, 2020, titled \"Features, Evaluation, and Treatment of Coronavirus. \" (Ex. R40 at 1-30; Tr. IV at 180.) The article states, in part: 43 It was deemed unethical to have a \"no mask \" control group. (Ex. R69 at 2.)

Aerosol transmission is also possible in case of protracted exposure to elevated aerosol concentrations in closed spaces. Analysis of data related to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in China seems to indicate that close contact between individuals is necessary. Of note, pre- and asymptomatic individuals may contribute up to 80% of COVID-19 transmission. (Ex. R40 at 3.) 148. The British Medical Bulletin published an article on December 15, 2020, titled \"Narrative Review of Non-Pharmaceutical Behavioural Measures for the Prevention of COVID- 19 (SARS-CoV-2) Based on the Health-EDRM Framework. \" (See Ex.

The authors concluded that the quality level of evidence for ten non-pharmaceutical behavioral measures (including, for example, hand washing, crowd avoidance, and mask wearing) was relatively weak.

The results showed that transmission clusters occurred within platoons, that most recruits who ultimately tested positive were asymptomatic, and that the risk of virus transmission was increased in settings where mask use or proximity were not followed (among roommates and within platoons).

II at 192\u00ad 193.) The author discusses the evidence and ethics of universal masking for COVID-19, and makes the following primary points: 1) policy makers must rely on the best available evidence rather than awaiting the strongest evidence when devising urgent policies that can potentially save human lives during a pandemic; 2) there is \"no shortage of mechanistic evidence and observational studies that affirmed the benefits of wearing a face mask in the community, \" and such evidence should drive urgent public health policy until further research yields results; and 3) there is \"no valid scientific evidence \" to support that face mask use in the community may pose a higher risk of infection due to improper use or false sense of security.

The authors concluded that \"[t]o offer adequate respiratory protection for the wearer, a face mask must not only be made of high filtration, low resistance material, but must also fit the wearer.

The American Journal of Infection Control published an article on April 30, 2008, titled \"Surgical mask filter and fit performance. \" (Ex. R60 at 1-7; Tr. IV at 216-217.) The study evaluated the filter performance and facial fit of a sample of surgical masks typically used in dental offices. All 20 subjects failed the unassisted qualitative fit test on the first exercise, and 18 subjects failed the assisted qualitative fit tests. None of the surgical masks tested exhibited adequate filter performance and facial fit characteristics to be considered respiratory protection devices. (Ex. R60 at 1.) The authors concluded that \"surgical masks do not offer protection comparable with that of respiratory protective devices (and are not certified by NIOSH as such). \" (Id. at 6.) The authors recommend that the FDA evaluate the use of surgical masks for their original intended purpose of preventing wound infection, and that healthcare settings seeking both wound infection prevention as well as respiratory protection consider the use of surgical N95 respirators. (Id.) In Dr. Stern 's opinion, the filter efficiency of a mask is irrelevant without a good fit. (Tr. IV at 217.) 153. JAMA published a \"Research Letter \" on June 4, 2020, titled \"Correlation Between N95 Extended Use and Reuse and Fit Failure in an Emergency Department. \" (Ex. R65 at 1-4; Tr. IV at 219-220.) The authors performed a cross-sectional study of N95 mask fit at an emergency department where PPE shortages necessitated reuse of the masks. (Ex. R65 at 1.) Among 68 participants, 38.2% of participants failed the fit test. The authors noted that the study was designed to detect mask failure based on qualitative fit testing, and that \"[fjailed fit tests may not necessarily result in increased rates of infection. \" (Id. at 3.) In Dr. Stern 's opinion, the N95 mask is the only mask that even has the potential to have an airtight seal, and the fact that a third of them failed to fit properly in this study supports his position that masks fail at respiratory viral protection.

Alexander on February 11, 2021, titled \"Masking: A Careful Review of the Evidence. \" (Ex. R98; Tr. II at 197-198.) The author concludes that, \"when we look at the science, there is emerging and troubling evidence of harms from mask use in the absence of any benefits. \" (Ex. R98 at 24.)

Dr. Blaylock is a retired neurosurgeon who now devotes his attention to nutritional research. (Ex. R4 at 10.) In Dr. Nolf s opinion, Dr. Blaylock 's lack of an infectious disease background diminishes the persuasiveness of his article. In her opinion, someone without expertise in infectious disease likely lacks a breadth of knowledge as to germs, how they grow, how they are transmitted, and how they would manifest in a patient; what testing is appropriate to detect if an infection is present; how best to treat an infection; and how best to prevent it.

Rancourt, PhD, on June 11, 2020, titled \"Masks Don 't Work: A Review of Science Relevant to COVID-19 Social Policy. \" (Ex. R7 at 1-14; Tr. II at 204.) Dr. Rancourt is a former professor of physics, and it is unknown whether he has a medical education. (Tr. II at 204.) In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, the article is \"quite biased, \" and would not pass peer review. (Tr. I at 156.) The author 's position is that masks are ineffective and that there are no credible studies that support masking. (See Ex. R7 at 2.) In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, the author \"cherry picks \" takeaways from various studies. (Tr. I at 156.) The article is not peer-reviewed and it does not appear in a scientific, medical, or clinical publication.

The authors assert that the CDC has generated inaccurate data regarding death statistics for COVID-19, thereby grossly overestimating the number of COVID-19 caused deaths, and then advocating for restrictive mitigation policies based on the inaccurate data. The Abstract states, in part: For a nation tormented by restrictive public health policies mandated for healthy individuals and small businesses, this is the most important statistical revelation of this crisis. This revelation significantly impacts the published fatalities count due to COVID-19. More importantly, it exposes major problems with the process by which the CDC was able to generate inaccurate data during a crisis. The CDC has advocated for social isolation, social distancing, and personal protective equipment use as primary mitigation strategies in response to the COVID-19 crisis, while simultaneously refusing to acknowledge the promise of inexpensive pharmaceutical and natural treatments.

In a February 15, 2021 open letter to leaders at the White House, the CDC, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), multiple signatories in the health and science fields encouraged the federal government to increase production of N95 respirators and higher-quality surgical masks, and strengthen recommendations for higher level respiratory protection for healthcare workers and the general public based on science indicating that \"inhalation of small aerosol particles is an important and significant mode of SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission. \" (Ex.

The CDC 's publication, \"2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings, \" which was last updated in July 2019, states, in part: Droplet transmission is, technically, a form of contact transmission, and some infectious agents transmitted by the droplet route also may be transmitted by the direct and indirect contact routes. However, in contrast to contact transmission, respiratory droplets carrying infectious pathogens transmit infection when they travel directly from the respiratory tract of the infectious individual to susceptible mucosal surfaces of the recipient, generally over short distances, necessitating facial protection. *****. Based on these considerations, it may be prudent to don a mask when within 6 to 10 feet of the patient or upon entry into the patient 's room, especially when exposure to emerging or highly virulent pathogens is likely[.] (See Ex.

The CDC has published a slide deck titled \"The Science of Masking to Control COVID-19, \" which was valid as of November 16, 2020, and states, in part: COVID-19 infection is spread primarily exposure to respiratory droplets exhaled by infected people when they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing. Most of the droplets are less than 10 microns, and are often referred to as aerosols. An estimated 40 to 45 percent of COVID-19 infected people never develop symptoms. Among people who do develop symptomatic illness, transmission risk peaks just before symptom onset and for a few days thereafter. It is estimated that more than 50 percent of all COVID-19 infections are transmitted by people not exhibiting symptoms. Cloth masks block most large (/.<?., greater than 20 to 30 microns) exhaled respiratory droplets. Multilayer cloth masks \"substantially \" (/>., possibly as much as 50 to 70 percent) block respiratory droplets between 1 and 10 microns in size, which comprise the greatest fraction of exhaled respiratory droplets. The performance of cloth masks in filtering inhaled small droplets is not as effective as their performance in blocking exhaled small droplets. Cloth masks are comparable to surgical masks when used in tandem for community control (z.e., when used for both source control and personal protection). (Ex. Al8 at 1-4, 7-8, 11, 18; Tr. I at 150.)

ORS 183.430(2); ORS 677.205(3); and OAR 137-003-0560(1). 2. Circumstances at the time of this final order hearing justify confirmation of the Board 's December 4, 2020 Order of Emergency Suspension of License.47 OPINION 48 Legal Framework It is well-settled that \"the police power of the states extends to the regulation of certain trades and callings, particularly those which closely concern the public health. \" Dent v. W. Va., 129 US 114, 122 (1889). With respect to current pandemic, the Oregon Supreme Court has made clear that the Governor and the government of Oregon have the authority to enforce emergency regulations and emergency orders to protect the health and safety of the people of Oregon. Elkhorn Baptist Church v. Brown, 366 Or 506 (2020). By law, the responsibility of the Oregon Medical Board is to protect public health and safety by regulation of the medical profession. As ORS 677.015 provides: Recognizing that to practice medicine is not a natural right of any person but is a privilege granted by legislative authority, it is necessary in the interests of the health, safety and welfare of the people of this state to provide for the granting of that privilege and the regulation of its use, to the end that the public is protected from the practice of medicine by unauthorized or unqualified persons and from unprofessional conduct by persons licensed to practice under this chapter. 46 At hearing, when addressing whether he would currently change anything about his medical practice with regard to masking, Licensee testified, in part: If I have to sacrifice my medical license versus sacrificing my personal integrity as a physician before God, I choose to sacrifice my medical license with no hesitation. If I have to pay the price of the emotional trauma to my wife and to myself and to my patients just in order to maintain my personal integrity because I dared to defy the unlawful mandate of what I consider to be a rogue governor, Kate Brown, an authoritarian totalitarian ruler of Oregon who is going to tell me how to practice medicine, I am going to pay whatever price it takes. I will * * * never compromise my integrity before God. I will never compromise my responsibility to my patientsf.] (Tr.

That is what the Board has done here: protect the public health and safety. As the Supreme Court has noted, \"a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members. \" Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 US 11, 27 (1905). Such an emergency requires that states have the power to enact health laws and policies \"of every description. \" Id. at 25. See, e.g., Compagnie Francaise de Navigation a Vapeur v. Bd. of Health of State of La., 186 US 380 (1902) (upholding quarantine law against constitutional challenges); Rasmussen v. Idaho, 181 US 198 (1901) (permitting a ban on certain animal imports if evidence of disease was found); see also Elkhorn Baptist Church v. Brown, 366 Or 506 (2020) (upholding Governor 's and government 's right to enforce emergency regulations and orders to protect public health and safety); Benson v. Walker, 274 F 622 (4th Cir. 1921) (upholding board of health resolution that prevented carnivals and circuses from entering a certain county in response to the 1918-1919 influenza epidemic); Hickox v. Christie, 205 F Supp 3d 579 (D. N.J. 2016) (upholding the eighty-hour quarantine of a nurse returning from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone). Although Licensee questions the wisdom of the Board (and OHA, and OSHA) on the use of masks, it is not the Board 's burden to prove masks work. Licensee 's argument that he is correct on the science of masks is analogous to a lawyer in front of a disbarment procedure arguing that the Oregon State Bar is wrong to prohibit communication with a represented party. Disagreeing with the substance of the regulation is not a basis for Licensee to prevail. That said, it is the Board that is following the credible, evidence-based, and overwhelming majority of accepted science. Wearing and requiring patients and staff to wear masks protects public health in a global pandemic and saves lives. The Board is statutorily vested with the authority to regulate the practice of medicine in Oregon. ORS 677.265 states, in part: In addition to any other powers granted by this chapter, the [Board] may: (1) Adopt necessary and proper rules for administration of this chapter including but not limited to: (c) Enforcing the provisions of this chapter and exercising general supervision over the practice of medicine and podiatry within this state [.] (2) Issue, deny, suspend and revoke licenses and limited licenses, assess costs of proceedings and fines and place licensees on probation as provided in this chapter. /// FINAL ORDER - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 59 of 72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46(10) Administer oaths, issue notices and subpoenas * * *, hold hearings and perform such other acts as are reasonably necessary to carry out its duties under this chapter. On December 4, 2020, the Board issued an Order of Emergency Suspension of License, immediately suspending Licensee 's license to practice medicine in Oregon until further order of the Board, after concluding that Licensee 's continued practice constitutes an immediate danger to the public and presents a serious danger to the public health and safety. The Board 's statutory authority for issuing an emergency suspension order is set forth in ORS 183.430(2) (generally) and ORS 677.205(3) (Board-specifically). ORS 183.430(2) states, in pail: In any case where the agency finds a serious danger to the public health or safety and sets forth specific reasons for such findings, the agency may suspend or refuse to renew a license 49 without hearing, but if the licensee demands a hearing within 90 days * * * then a hearing must be granted to the licensee as soon as practicable after such demand, and the agency shall issue an order pursuant to such hearing as required by this chapter confirming, altering or revoking its earlier order[.] ORS 677.205(3) states, in relevant part: [T]he [B]oard may temporarily suspend a license without a hearing, simultaneously with the commencement of proceedings under ORS 677.200 50 if the [B]oard finds that evidence in its possession indicates that a continuation in practice of the licensee constitutes an immediate danger to the public. 49 The term \"license \" is broadly defined to include \"any agency permit, certificate, approval, registration or similar form of permission required by law to pursue any commercial activity, trade, occupation or profession. \" ORS 183.310(5). 50 ORS 677.200 is titled \"Disciplinary procedure \" and states, in part: Except as provided in ORS 677.202 or 677.205(1 )(a), any proceeding for disciplinary action of a licensee licensed under this chapter shall be substantially in accord with the following procedure: (1) A written complaint of some person, not excluding members or employees of the Oregon Medical Board, shall be verified and filed with the board.

For purposes of this rule, such an order is referred to as an emergency suspension order. An emergency suspension order must be in writing. It may be issued without prior notice to the licensee and without a hearing prior to the emergency suspension order. (6) At the hearing regarding the emergency suspension order, the administrative law judge shall consider the facts and circumstances including, but not limited to: (a) Whether the acts or omissions of the licensee pose a serious danger to the public health or safety; and (b) Whether circumstances at the time of the hearing justify confirmation, alteration or revocation of the orderf.] Here, the Board must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it was entitled to suspend Licensee 's license to practice medicine without prior notice and opportunity for hearing, and that circumstances at the time of the hearing and issuance of final order 52 justify continued suspension. See ORS 183.450(2) (\"The burden of presenting evidence to support a fact or position in a contested case rests on the proponent of the fact or position \"); Harris v. SAIF, 292 Or 683, 690 (1982) (general rule regarding allocation of burden of proof is that the burden is on the proponent of the fact or position); Dixon v. Board of Nursing, 291 Or App 207, 213 (2018) (in administrative proceedings, the preponderance standard generally applies). Proof by a preponderance of the evidence means that the fact finder is persuaded that the facts asserted are more likely than not true. Riley Hill General Contractor v.

For the reasons that follow, such arguments are not persuasive. First, Licensee argues that the July 22, 2020 OHA Guidance regarding Covid- 19 protocols in healthcare settings lacks the force of law and was therefore not binding upon him and his practice of medicine. He contends that the term \"guidance \" denotes a suggestion and not a mandate with which he was required to comply. See Licensee 's Closing Argument at 1-2; see also Transcript I at 39 (Licensee 's Opening Statement) (asserting that \"there was never any rule imposed upon [Licensee] directing him or other medical professionals that they are required to wear a mask or impose masks upon their patients \"). Second, Licensee argues that the Board is seeking to enforce the July 22, 2020 OHA Guidance against him, contrary to the enforcement provisions set out in the guidance document itself (stating that it is enforceable as specified in Executive Order No. 20-27), Executive Order No. 20-27 (stating that executive orders and OHA guidance are considered public health laws and may be enforced under ORS 431A.010 and ORS 401.990), ORS 431A.010 (authorizing the OHA to issue administrative compliance orders, seek civil penalties, maintain civil actions, and refer matters for criminal prosecution), and ORS 401.990 (designating certain knowing violations of ORS Chapter 401 as class C misdemeanors). Licensee asserts that neither the July 22, 2020 OHA Guidance nor Executive Order 20-27 constitutes a \"public health law\" under ORS Chapter 431 A, and even if they could be construed as such, suspension or revocation of a professional license is not a permitted penalty under ORS 431 A.010 or ORS 401.990. See Licensee 's Closing Argument at 2-4. Licensee 's arguments are based on the mistaken premise that the Board has sought to discipline him under the provisions of Executive Order No. 20-27 for failing to comply with the provisions of that executive order or the OHA guidance issued therefrom. That is not correct. As stated in the Emergency Suspension Order, the Board suspended Licensee 's medical license, pursuant to ORS 677,205(3) and ORS 183.430(2), after determining that his continued practice of medicine constituted an immediate danger to the public and a serious danger to the public health or safety. See Pleading Pl at 1 (italicized emphasis added). The Board explained in the Emergency Suspension Order that when making determinations regarding public health and safety, the Board \"relies upon sources that are well recognized in the medical community and are relied upon by physicians in their delivery of care to patients. \" Id. at 1 -2. In this matter, the Board relied upon \"basic principles of transmission of respiratory viruses and respiratory pathology, \" as well as OHA guidelines pertaining to COVID-19 and other sources to inform its determination. See id. at 2. Notice of Masking Requirements and Potential Disciplinary Actions 53 Licensee argues that the Board failed to provide him with sufficient notice of his obligation to follow the OHA 's guidance on masking for healthcare workers and patients in healthcare settings. He also asserts that the Board failed to sufficiently apprise him of \"the punishment that may befall him if he failed to comply \" with the masking requirements, urging 53 The Board modifies this portion of the analysis to accurately reflect the standards for orders of emergency suspension, which apply here, rather than for pre-deprivation notice, which do not.

It is a well-established principle that due process requires notice and opportunity to be heard. See California ex rel. Lockyer v. FERC, 329 F3d 700, 708 n.6 (9th Cir. 2003). But \"[p]recisely what procedures the Due Process Clause requires in any given case is a function of context. \" Brewster v. Board ofEduc. Of Lynwood Unified Sch. Dist., 149 F.3d 971, 983 (9th Cir. 1998). \"[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. \" Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 US 471,481, 92 SCt 2593, 2600 (1972). The U.S. Supreme Court \"has recognized, on many occasions, that where a State must act quickly, or where it would be impractical to provide pre-deprivation process, post-deprivation process satisfies the requirements of the Due Process Clause. \" Gilbert v. Homar, 520 US 924, 930-31, 117 S. Ct. 1807, 1812 (1997) (listing cases). The Board is subject to APA and Model Rules. When there is a serious danger to the public and the State must act quickly, as was the case here, it is authorized to issue an emergency order of suspension, which provides the appropriate post-deprivation process. 54 ORS 183.430, OAR 137-003-0560(2)(b). Specifically, the notice required by OAR 137-003-0560(2), which must be provided within the Order of Emergency of Suspension, must include: (A) The effective date of the emergency suspension order; (B) Findings of the specific acts or omissions of the licensee that violate applicable laws and rules and are the grounds for revocation, suspension or refusal to renew the license in the underlying proceeding affecting the license; (C) The reasons the specified acts or omissions seriously endanger the public's health or safety; (D) A reference to the sections of the statutes and rules involved; (E) That the licensee has the right to demand a hearing to be held as soon as practicable to contest the emergency suspension order; and (F) That if the demand for hearing is not received by the agency within 90 calendar days of the date of notice of the emergency suspension order the licensee shall have waived its right to a hearing regarding the emergency suspension order. The Board included all of these items in its Order of Emergency Suspension. See P. 1. Prior to issuing its Order of Emergency Suspension of License, the Board was under no obligation \u2014 under the APA, Model Rules, or general principles of due process \u2014 to personally notify Licensee of any or all laws, rules, guidelines, ethical standards, practice standards, or disciplinary sanctions that might govern licensee 's exercise of his license to practice medicine in Oregon. Moreover, as a practical matter, it is simply not credible that Licensee was unaware as late as August 2020, when Board staff first contacted him regarding an investigation into the 54 See also Ex. A20 (LaTulippe v, Harder et al., Case No. 3:21-cv-00090-HZ, Federal District Court, District of Oregon (February 4, 2021)), FINAL ORDER - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 63 of 72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46current matter, that there were masking requirements (or \"guidelines, \" or \"mandates \") in place for healthcare providers in healthcare settings. Even if Licensee was not in receipt of, or had not actually read, the Governor 's executive orders or the OHA 's guidance documents pertaining to masking in healthcare facilities by August 2020, it is disingenuous for him to assert in this proceeding that he was unaware up until that time of any obligation to comply with masking requirements in his clinic. Nonetheless, at the very least, Licensee was placed on notice of such requirements upon receiving Board Investigator Carruth 's August 13, 2020 letter, which stated that the Board was investigating complaints against him that included \"advising patients and the public that masks required under the current guidelines do not work and should not be worn. \" See Exhibit A5 at 1. Indeed, in Licensee 's September 3, 2020 letter to the Board, he admitted to advising patients and the public that masks \"required under the current COVID-19 guidelines \" are ineffective and should not be worn. See id. at 2. Licensee 's letter also specifically addressed Board allegations of \"not following guidelines \" and \"noncompliance with a government order, \" stating, in part: What exactly is the purpose of guidelines? If a face mask is completely ineffective against disease transmission, but a state governor seeks to enforce such guidelines, should we just oblige her? What motive has Kate Brown in declaring such a mandate? Does she have authority to do so? [I]f a guideline is unlawful, has no medically-based validity, and is detrimental to personal health, I cannot accept such a guideline, mandate, order, regulation - or whatever other name you choose to assign it[.] Id. at 5. Subsequently, in a November 9, 2020 letter to Licensee, Dr. Farris notified Licensee that he might be in \"direct and active violation \" of the Governor 's executive orders, OHA guidance, and/or OHA administrative rules that \"require all people to wear properly fitted facemasks when indoors in any care setting. \" Exhibit A4 at 1. Dr. Fanis further stated that the Board expected Licensee to \"immediately comply not only with the legal mandate, but with practices and professional conduct appropriate to the standards of medical care expected \" for a licensed physician in Oregon. Id. Dr. Farris closed the letter by stating that Licensee could be \"subject to administrative sanctions. \" See id. Licensee 's purported failure to understand, prior to receiving the Board 's Order of Emergency Suspension, that the range of administrative sanctions available to the Board includes significant actions such as license suspension and revocation, 55 as specifically set forth in ORS 677.190, is immaterial to the Board 's exercise of its authority in the current matter. ORS 677.205(3) and ORS 183.430(2) grant the Board the authority to immediately suspend a Licensee 's license upon its determination that the Licensee 's conduct endangers public health and safety. There is no legal requirement for the Board to provide advance notice to a Licensee that their conduct endangers public health and safety. 55 See Licensee 's Closing Argument at 5 (stating that Licensee \"did not understand 'administrative sanctions ' to include license suspension \"). FINAL ORDER - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 64 of 72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46Finally, based upon Licensee 's interactions with the Board since August 2020 and his hearing testimony, Licensee was aware of the Governor 's Executive Order and the guidance and recommendations for mask wearing in health care settings, as well as the Board 's concerns, but chose to disregard the order, recommendations, and concerns. As late as the date of the hearing in this contested case proceeding, Licensee insisted that he would rather lose his license than comply with the Executive Order or the OHA Guidance on masking requirements in the health care setting. The record establishes that Licensee was aware of the potential consequences of his refusal to change his masking practices and, even after becoming fully cognizant of those consequences, has maintained his refusal to change his practices regardless of the outcome of this proceeding. The Role of Masking in Preventing the Transmission of SARS-Co V-2 In March 2020, the OHA issued \"Clinical Care, and Healthcare Prevention and Control Guidance for COVID-19, \" recommending masking for both patients and providers in all healthcare settings. The OHA issued a revision to that guidance in May 2020, requiring all patients and visitors (unless unable to tolerate masking) to wear a face mask or face covering while in a healthcare setting, and requiring all healthcare providers and healthcare personnel to wear a face mask at all times in such a setting (unless alone in a private office). In July 2020, the OHA issued another revision to the guidance to clarify the masking requirements for healthcare offices that were already in place. See Transcript I at 115-118, 182-184,186, 190-191; Exhibits A9 and A23. The record persuasively establishes that by at least July 2020, consistent with recommendations from the WHO, 56 the CDC, 57 and the OHA, the standard of care for healthcare professionals in Oregon was for healthcare providers to mask at all times in all healthcare settings (unless alone in a private office). See Transcript I at 118-119 (Dr. Sutton 's testimony); Transcript II at 190-191 (Dr. Nolt 's testimony). Licensee contends that there is no benefit to wearing cloth masks, surgical masks, or N95 masks to prevent or reduce the transmission of COVID-19. He contends that SARS-CoV-2 virus is spread predominantly through aerosols, and that masks are incapable of blocking aerosols. He asserts that universal masking is contributing to an increased spread of COVID-19 and that mask wearing poses risk of harm to wearers, particularly if they are elderly or have certain comorbidities. He contends that asymptomatic spread has not been sufficiently demonstrated in the medical literature and is not a significant factor in the transmission of COVID-19. Finally, he asserts that there are \"at least 17 well-designed randomized controlled trials that eliminated any question about masks being effective. \" See Transcript I at 82, 56-58, 86, 101; Transcript III at 26, 28-29; Transcript IV at 88; Transcript V at 30, 32. Licensee 's positions on masking differ starkly from the positions of the CDC and the OHA, a significant number of peer-reviewed studies and medical journal articles (including 56 See Exhibit R81 at 1-16 (WHO 's June 5, 2020 interim guidance document titled \"Advice on the use of masks in the context of COVID- 19\"). 57 See Exhibit AI0 at 1-5 (CDC 's June 2020 guidance for managing operations of healthcare facilities recommending that healthcare personnel in healthcare facilities wear face masks and that patients and visitors to healthcare facilities wear face coverings or face masks). FINAL ORDER - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MB Page 65 of 72 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46several offered by Licensee to prove the inverse), and the consensus of the medical community, which was represented at hearing through the expert testimony of Drs. Sutton, Nolt, and Farris. The documentary evidence offered by the Board to support the safety of masking and its efficacy in providing protection from the spread of viral respiratory pathogens, including SARS- Co V-2, consists primarily of peer-reviewed articles and studies published in respected medical and scientific journals and other medical publications (e.g., Exhibits All, A12, A15, A17, A21, and A22) and guidance documents from the CDC and the OHA (e.g, Exhibits A9, A10, A18, and A23). To support his positions on masking, Licensee offered testimony at hearing from Dr. Stern, a pulmonologist licensed in North Carolina with no expertise in public health, infectious disease, or epidemiology, and Ms. Kelly, an individual with 18 years of experience as an industrial hygienist but no formal medical training or medical licensure. The documentary evidence offered by Licensee to show that mask wearing is unsafe and inefficacious in preventing the spread of viral respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, ranges from randomized controlled trials and other studies published in respected peer-reviewed journals (e.g., Exhibits R6, R17, R23, R39, R65) to online articles written by non-medical and non-scientific experts in non-medical and non-scientific publications of Licensee 's documentary evidence has unknown significance to the relevant issues (e.g., Exhibits R29, R73, R74), some articles were anonymously written or failed to identify an author (e.g., Exhibits R5, RIO, Rll), one article involved a study only available on Twitter (Exhibit R8), one article was withdrawn (Exhibit 101), and multiple articles were marked by strident advocacy and obvious bias (e.g., Exhibits R7, R8, Rll, R98, R100). Articles that are not authored by medical or scientific experts, Twitter articles, withdrawn articles, and articles with significant bias provide no legitimate support for Licensee 's position. Additionally, the limited number of peer-reviewed journals that cast some doubt on the efficacy of masks fails to outweigh the predominance of the medical literature that supports the use of masks during this pandemic. Lacking any formal medical education, Ms. Kelly 's opinions and assessments of the medical studies and articles in the field of epidemiology, especially virus transmission, are not persuasive. Although an expert about the available types of PPE, her goal as an industrial hygienist is to make recommendations to an employer of the safest and most effective ways to protect employees. Thus, she supports the use of PAPRs and CAPRs in close contact settings and N95 masks in other settings involving viral contamination. However, she has no expertise in making recommendations for the safety of the public masses, who cannot be expected to have the funds to purchase the expensive respirators or even the N95 masks. Even with her limited area of expertise, Ms. Kelly 's expert opinion on the efficacies of masks do not support Licensee 's position. Licensee is a doctor in a healthcare setting having close contact with patients, including patients with symptoms of COVID-19. In such a setting, Ms. Kelly 's opinion is that Licensee should be wearing a PAPR or a CAPR, something Licensee and his staff refuse to do. Licensee and his staff are even refusing to wear N95 or surgical masks, items commonly available in his field. Pursuant to Ms. Kelly 's opinions, Licensee 's FINAL ORDER - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 66 of 72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46conduct in having close contact with COVID-19 infected patients during this pandemic without using a respirator endangers himself and his patients. As to cloth and surgical masks, Ms. Kelly 's primary concerns are their reduced efficacy (in comparison with respirators) and the public 's lack of knowledge on the proper care and use of such masks. Licensee is in the position where he could provide instruction and guidance to his patients in the proper care and use of cloth and surgical masks, something he refuses to do. Ms. Kelly also supports letting patients make the choice to wear masks in consideration of their potential disabilities and intolerances. However, Licensee is not letting patients make that choice. Instead, he is actively dissuading his patients from wearing masks by advising them of his beliefs that masks are harmful and lack efficacy. He is also passively dissuading them by his and his staffs failure to wear masks in the clinic. A physician 's refusal to wear a mask is an example to their patients. Thus, Licensee 's failure to wear a mask when providing care to his patients further encourages them to not use masks. Dr. Stern holds board certifications in Sleep Medicine, Pulmonary Medicine, and Critical Care Medicine and he has a Master 's Degree in Clinical Research. In Dr. Stern 's opinion, the data overwhelmingly supports a conclusion that masks do not prevent the spread of respiratory droplets and that cloth masks can actually do more harm than good by increasing the number of respirable particles. See Transcript IV at 179, 184, 222, 241, At hearing, when opining on the efficacy of masks to block the transmission of respiratory particles, Dr. Stern was critical of any device that was not \"effective, \" which he defined as having 99.999996 percent effectiveness in blocking viral pathogens. See id, at 190, 241-242. He did, however, concede that a surgical mask could be expected to capture approximately 50 percent of the respiratory droplets coming from a mask worn by a COVID-19 infected source. And, while he considers N95 masks capable of blocking even more respiratory particles than surgical masks, he nonetheless believes that due to poor fit, even N95 masks are ineffective in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. Id. at 242-243, 184, 189. Ultimately, Dr. Stem 's opinion is akin to Ms. Kelly 's opinion: transmission is best controlled by PAPRs and CPARs with only limited control from N95 masks and surgical masks. However, as noted above, Licensee refuses to use any masking devices; does not require his staff to wear any masking devices; and advises his patients against using any masking devices. As the OHA 's Medical Director of Respiratory Viral Pathogens and a Senior Health Advisor for the OHA on COVID-19 matters, Dr. Sutton acts as a subject matter expert on testing strategy and policy and conducts daily reviews on the latest evidence and literature pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic. In her opinion, the most important measure to mitigate against the risk of COVID-19 transmission in a healthcare clinic setting is masking. Transcript I at 123-124. She opines that masks reduce the risk of transmission of virus particles \"by a significant proportion, \" particularly when both the infected person and the person who may potentially become infected are masked. Id. at 144. In her opinion, the primary role that masks play is with regard to source control and any mask is better than no mask because even a poorly fitting cloth mask \"will block large droplets quite well. \" Id. at 143, 120-121, 138-139.

She is an expert in infectious diseases and serves as the Co-Chair of OHSU 's Infection Control Committee. In her opinion, a COVID-19 infected person can be contagious even if they are showing no signs or symptoms of infection. Transcript II at 182-184, Although there are no randomized controlled trials showing that masks protect against transmission of COVID-19, Dr. Nolt believes there is \"an accumulation of very good evidence showing that masks do decrease COVID-19 transmission. \" Id. at 184-185, 226. In her opinion, transmission of COVID-19 is based on dose, duration, and distance, with dose capable of being controlled by masking. Id. at 186-187. In her opinion, masking reduces the risk of transmission of COVID-19, and it is the standard of care for healthcare workers to wear masks in clinical settings, including direct patient care, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Licensee contends that there is \"ample evidence \" that mask wearing is contraindicated for curtailing the spread of COVID-19. Licensee 's Closing Argument at 6. To support this contention, Licensee relies on his own anecdotal accounts of patient harm from mask wearing, 58 Ms. Kelly 's hearing testimony regarding the role and importance of federal OSH A requirements pertaining to PPE, 59 and documentary evidence such as R4 (a non-peer reviewed article from a non-scientific, non-medical, and non-clinical source), R29 (a study involving CO2 and gene expression in bronchial epithelial cells with no clear significance to masking), R50 (educational website addressing skin issues from mask wearing), R52 (article discussing that face masks may lead to ocular dryness and irritation), R73 (a study regarding respiratory pressure in adults with no mention of or clear significance to masking), R73 (a non-published meeting abstract with no clear significance to masking), and R98 (a non-peer reviewed article from a non-medical, non- scientific source). As an anesthesiologist, Dr. Farris has expertise in monitoring CO2 levels and in the concepts of CO2 retention and dead space inhalation. In his opinion, symptoms of CO2 toxicity would only be expected to occur if a person 's CO2 level reached as high as 90 mm/Hg, which is the equivalent of holding one's breath for an hour. He opines that symptoms of CO2 toxicity would not occur under conditions created by mere mask-wearing, and would only occur at a level of CO2 \"not achievable short of an unconscious person or a person basically being suffocated. \" Transcript II at 53-54. In his opinion, although some vital sign parameters have been shown to change in trivial directions from mask wearing, the body quickly compensates, there is no significant increase in CO2 levels or decrease in 02 levels, and masks do not cause physiologic harm to wearers. He believes that side effects caused from mask-wearing such as skin breakdown or impetigo, though minor, may warrant exemption from masking mandates. Id. at 49-51. Dr. Nolt acknowledges that masking could cause minor, yet treatable, issues such as contact dermatitis, acne, and pressure headache. However, in her opinion, numerous studies show that there is no risk of increased CO2 toxicity or decreased 02 from mask wearing. Transcript II at 199-200. In Dr. Sutton 's opinion, there is \"no evidence that masks are not safe when used appropriately. \" Transcript I at 144-145. The persuasive medical literature supports the opinions of Drs. Farris, Nolt and Sutton that mask wearing does not cause CO2 toxicity or decreased 02 levels, contrary to Licensee 's assertions. 58 See Transcript I at 58, 61, 89-92; Tr. IV at 84; Tr.

Risk of Harm to Patients, Visitors, and Staff through Exposure to SARS-Co V-2 at Clinic Except when performing surgical procedures, Licensee did not wear a mask at the clinic when treating patients \u2014 including those with known or suspected COVID-19 infection \u2014 between March 2020 and December 2020. During that time period, Licensee did not require his staff, Mrs. LaTulippe and Ms. Miles, to wear masks at the clinic, and Licensee did not require patients or clinic visitors to wear masks unless they were acutely ill or otherwise had signs suggestive of respiratory illness. He estimates that at least 95 percent of his patients chose not to wear a mask while at the clinic. See Transcript I at 50-52, 54, 60-61; Transcript IV at 90; TranscriptV at 19-20, 36-41. Between late November 2020 and early December 2020, Licensee treated approximately 125 patients with known or presumed COVID-19 in the clinic. He did not wear a mask when treating those patients, and he did not recommended to those patients that they wear masks outside of the clinic to contain the spread of their illness. See Transcript I at 70; Transcript III at 53; Transcript V at 36-38, 99, 106-109, 111. On more than one occasion, when treating a patient with known or presumed COVID-19 (particularly if the patient was exhibiting profuse symptoms of the illness such as coughing), Licensee believed it was likely he would contract the virus from the patient. Despite having that belief, Licensee did not wear a mask during any of those patient encounters, including when he was in close physical contact with such patients, or during subsequent patient encounters. See Transcript V at 37-41, 112-113, 119-120. At hearing, Licensee conceded that there was a \"very good chance \" that he has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, from his exposures to \"some very sick patients \" at the clinic. See id. at 143, 36, 41, 121, 135. Despite that concession, Licensee has never been tested for COVID-19. See id. The record persuasively establishes that despite his regular contact with infectious patients and being aware of the likelihood that he had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the course of treating patients in 2020, Licensee did not undergo any periodic testing for the virus, he continued to treat patients without wearing a mask, he did not require clinic staff to wear a mask, and he and his staff continued to interact with patients and clinic visitors without requiring that those individuals take the basis precautionary measure of wearing a mask. Licensee 's conduct, more likely than not, exposed his patients to a serious risk of harm of contracting COVID-19. /// FINAL ORDER - Steven Arthur LaTulippe, MD Page 69 of 72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46Risk of Harm to Patients and the Public by Actively Discouraging Mask Use Licensee contends that he did not actively discourage his patients from wearing masks. See Transcript V at 63-64. However, that contention is contradicted by the preponderance of evidence in the record. From March to December 2020, Licensee engaged in what he deemed an \"informed consent \" process with his patients \"to establish whether or not they should be wearing a mask, \" based on his opinions of the medical evidence pertaining to mask-wearing. See Transcript I at 54-58, 64; Transcript IV at 104; Transcript V at 21-22, 32. The record demonstrates, more likely than not, that Licensee discussed the alleged futility and dangers associated with mask wearing with patients, even when the patients did not ask about mask wearing or complain of adverse symptoms related to mask wearing. See, e.g, Transcript I at 54-58; Transcript IV at 104; Transcript V at 21-22. The record also establishes that Licensee routinely directed patients to watch a YouTube video titled, \"Tammy K. Herrera Clark on Face Mask Effectiveness \" and he made available to patients a document advertising Ms. Clark 's YouTube video. See Transcript I at 62-64; Tr. V at 23-24, 27-29; Exhibits A5 at 3, 9 and A6 at 1. Between March and December 2020, Licensee informed a patient who was experiencing elevated blood pressure that wearing a mask might be contributing to her condition and that she was at greater risk from CO2 toxicity from mask wearing than she was from getting COVID-19. See Transcript V at 168, 170-173; Transcript VI at 20-21. I conclude that by not wearing a mask at the clinic, not requiring clinic staff to wear masks, not requiring clinic visitors to wear masks, not requiring clinic patients to wear masks (except for those with known or suspected COVID-19), posting information in the clinic about the alleged harms of mask wearing due to CO2 toxicity, 60 verbally counseling patients about the alleged harms of mask wearing, advising patients that the medical evidence does not support mask wearing, and recommending that patients view Ms. Clark 's YouTube video critical of mask wearing, Licensee actively discouraged patients from wealing masks, both at the clinic and in the greater community. In addition, the record persuasively establishes that Mrs. LaTulippe (his wife, clinic manager, and medical assistant) advised patients that masks do not work, directed patients to watch Ms. Clark 's YouTube video, and \u2014 at a minimum - suggested that patients remove their masks at the clinic. See Transcript I at 126-127, 141-142; Transcript II at 146-150, 155-156, 244, 237-23; Transcript V at 170. Although the record falls short of establishing that Licensee specifically directed these communications between Ms. LaTulippe and clinic patients, a preponderance of credible evidence supports a finding that Licensee knew of and indorsed such communications and general practices. Additionally, as noted above, Licensee is the clinic 's physician. As such, his failure to wear a mask and his constant verbal denunciations of mask wearing encouraged his patients and his staff to not use masks. Consequently, when assessing whether Licensee 's practice of medicine posed an immediate danger to the public or a serious danger to the public health and safety, it is reasonable to consider not only Licensee 's own volitional conduct, but also staff conduct that he allowed and condoned. 60 See Exhibit A6 at 4.

The Board argues that putting others at risk of infection with a communicable disease and risk of death by failing to comply with COVID-19 protocols that are designed to protect healthcare providers and patients falls within those definitions, particularly while in the midst of an ongoing pandemic that has already killed more than 500,000 people in the United States. The Board 's argument is persuasive. Licensee is subject to and answerable to the laws, regulations, and orders issued under lawful authority in this state, as well as the Board, which is charged with the responsibility to protect the public from unprofessional conduct, to enforce the provisions of the Medical Practice Act, and to exercise general supervision over the practice of medicine. See ORS 677.015; ORS 677.265(l)(c). When it comes to the practice of medicine in Oregon, the Board is the arm of the state charged with protecting its citizens against an epidemic of disease. Under ORS Chapters 183 and 677, the Board has the statutory authority to decide when a physician 's continued practice poses a serious and immediate danger to public health and safety, and to emergently suspend that physician 's license accordingly. See ORS 183.430(2); ORS 677.205(3). Here, the Board correctly concluded that Licensee posed an immediate and serious danger to the public health and safety and exercised its discretion and authority by emergently suspending his license. In sum, the record persuasively establishes that Licensee 's refusal to wear a mask, his refusal to ensure that his staff wore masks, and his insistence on advising his patients to not wear masks endangered public health and safety by placing Licensee 's patients, his staff, and Licensee himself \u2014 plus all other individuals with whom they came in contact \u2014 at risk of infection of a highly communicable and deadly disease. Because of Licensee 's insistence that he will not alter his conduct no matter the outcome of this proceeding, the circumstances at the time of the issuance of this order 61 justify the continued suspension of his medical license. However, the serious and immediate danger posed by Licensee is related directly to the COVID-19 pandemic and, in Oregon, the declared state of emergency. Therefore, once Oregon 's current declared state of emergency is terminated, Licensee 's refusal to wear a mask, refusal to ensure his staff wears masks, and insistence on advising his patients not to wear masks, will no longer constitute a serious and immediate danger to the public, or to the public health and safety, under this order. 62 61 The now-relevant date, 62 An emergency suspension of a medical license is temporary under ORS 677.205(3); therefore, the Board sets forth the events that will trigger lifting of this order of emergency suspension.
