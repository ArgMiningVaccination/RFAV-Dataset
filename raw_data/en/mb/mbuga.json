Two COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 from Pfizer/BioNTtech and Moderna \u2014 have received emergency use authorization in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Many more are in various stages of development around the world. Several of these are in the final stage of clinical trials and could be submitted for formal authorization in the U.S. as early as this spring.

It remains important to continue taking precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 until experts tell us otherwise. These steps will help reduce the risk of becoming exposed or spreading the virus until the pandemic is over. True.

These steps will help reduce the risk of becoming exposed or spreading the virus until the pandemic is over. True. Neither of the vaccines now authorized for use for COVID-19 contain any live virus. It is impossible to get the disease from the vaccine. True. Neither of the vaccines now authorized for use for COVID-19 contain any live virus. It is impossible to get the disease from the vaccine. True. Neither of the vaccines now authorized for use for COVID-19 contain any live virus. It is impossible to get the disease from the vaccine. True. The vaccines reduce the risk of developing symptoms and getting ill from the virus by about 95 percent after getting both doses. However, no vaccine, including the COVID-19 vaccines, guarantees protection against illness. True.

However, no vaccine, including the COVID-19 vaccines, guarantees protection against illness. True. The two COVID-19 vaccines appear to be similar in terms of efficacy and safety. All people who get a COVID-19 vaccine should be monitored on site for at least 15 minutes after getting the injection. Those with a history of severe allergic reactions or those who have had any type of immediate allergic reaction to a vaccine or injectable therapy should be monitored for at least 30 minutes after vaccination.

Unknown. We do not yet know for sure if getting vaccinated prevents us from becoming infected and spreading the disease to others. This is why we still need to follow safety precautions like wearing masks and physical distancing. Unknown.

You will not test positive on a nasal swab test since that looks for proteins or genetic material made by the COVID-19 virus. However, when your body develops antibodies as a result of vaccination, you may test positive on some antibody tests. False.

It is possible to get re-infected with COVID-19, though we do not know how often this happens. Until researchers know more about how long the protection lasts following a natural infection, you should get a vaccine even if you have a history of infection. False.

The mRNA does not become part of your own DNA or change it. Instead, the mRNA from the vaccines instruct cells in the body to simply build copies of the virus's spike protein that our bodies recognize as foreign. As a result, we develop antibodies against it to protect us from becoming sick if we come in contact with the virus that causes COVID-19. False.

Many patients notice soreness, redness, or pain in the arm where they got the shot. Others may have fatigue, a mild fever, headache, or body aches for a day afterward. Side effects are more common after the second dose. These reactions are expected and will disappear quickly. True. Many patients notice soreness, redness, or pain in the arm where they got the shot.

Currently, the Pfizer vaccine can be given to people ages 16 and older. The Moderna vaccine is authorized for those ages 18 and older. However, clinical trials are underway with both vaccines in children ages 12 and older. The immune system of children responds differently than that of adults. For that reason, testing is essential to see how teenagers, young children, and infants react to any vaccine, even if it is proven safe and effective in adults. True.

Currently, the Pfizer vaccine can be given to anyone 12 and older. The Moderna vaccine is authorized for those ages 18 and older. However, clinical trials are underway with both vaccines in children under age 12 for Pfizer and under 18 years for Moderna. The immune system of young children responds differently than that of adults. For that reason, testing is essential to see if young children and infants react to any vaccine, even if it is proven safe and effective in teens and adults.
