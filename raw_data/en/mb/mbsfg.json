(2) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 also provides for newtasks for the Agency. Furthermore, the existing taskshave also been changed following amendments to Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament andof the Council of 6 November 2001 on theCommunity code relating to veterinary medicinalproducts ( 4) and to Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6November 2001 on the Community code relating tomedicinal products for human use ( 5). (3) In view of the experience gained since 1995, it is appro-priate to maintain the general principles and overallstructure of the fees, as well as the main operationaland procedural provisions established by Regulation(EC) No 297/95. In particular, the calculation of thelevel of fees charged by the Agency should be based on the principle of the service actually provided and should be related to specific medicinal products. Theproportionality between the fees and the assessmentrelated costs of each application, as well as theprovision of the service requested, should also beensured. (4) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 lays down provisions fornew post-authorisation activities to be carried out by theAgency. These tasks include the recording of the actualmarketing of medicinal products authorised inaccordance with Community procedures, the main-tenance of marketing authorisation dossiers and of thevarious databases managed by the Agency, as well as thecontinuous follow-up of the risk-benefit balance ofauthorised medicinal products. In addition, it isnecessary to reduce the Agency 's dependence on fees related to new applications. The annual fee shouldtherefore be increased by 10 % to accommodate thosechanges. (5) New categories of fees have to be created to cover new,specific tasks now provided by the Agency, such as new types of scientific opinions related to a medicinal product.EN 23.11.2005 Official Journal of the European Union L 304/1 (1) OJ L 35, 15.2.1995, p. 1.

In particular, since the levels offees laid down in this Regulation are set as maximumfees, the Management Board should establish, for certainservices for which this is laid down in the Regulation, detailed classifications and lists of reduced fees. (7) The Executive Director should also keep the competence to decide, in exceptional circumstances, on reductions ofthe fees, in particular as regards certain cases related tospecific medicinal products and where a reduction isnecessary for imperative reasons of public or animalhealth. Likewise, the Executive Director should have thepossibility to decide on exemptions from the obligationto pay a fee in the case of medicinal products for thetreatment of rare diseases, for the treatment of diseasesaffecting minor animal species and for the addition of animal species in the case of the determination of maximum residue limits in accordance with theprocedure laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Communityprocedure for the establishment of maximum residuelimits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs ofanimal origin ( 1). (8) In accordance with Article 70(2) of Regulation (EC) No726/2004, the circumstances under which small andmedium-sized enterprises may pay reduced fees, deferpayment of the fee or receive administrative assistanceare not to be covered by this Regulation. (9) In order to allow an immediate budgetisation, the feesshould be due on the date of validation but should bepayable within a certain number of days. (10) Provisions should be laid down to report on the imple-mentation of this Regulation after experience has beengained and to review, if necessary, the level of the fees. (11) It is appropriate to include an indexation mechanism forautomatically adjusting the fees in relation to officialinflation rates indices.
