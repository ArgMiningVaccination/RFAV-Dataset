The fruit of slowing down and just watching our thoughts has been incredible. - Beau Brandon - USA Wow, how awesome the first session was!.... And I love that you are doing this online instead of at a physical location. Thank you Jesus for leading me to follow wow life church since last month, I have been so blessed by Kirby's teachings every week. Love it! - Candy Malcho - Thailand I am so completely grateful for your compassion on us to teach us the ways of the Mystic. I have been seeking past the doors of the mundain church and rarely found life inside those walls. I was jumping down new age rabbit holes looking past the joojoo just to see if I could grasp something that represented God. I did find Him but never knew if I could trust what rabbit hole was jumping into. I look forward to joining you for more teachings but even more I look forward to the life that has been planted in me and has been protected for many decades now, to blossom and come forth into this world in which we live. Again, Thank you ever so kindly. Have a perfectly blessed day. With all my heart and love to both you and Fiona. - Deb Patton - USA Glad I made the investment to be transformed by these truths. I want to listen to them over and over. Thank you Lord for Your life bringing life to my mortal body and soul. - Diane Bhone - USA This is SO worth waking up super early for.
