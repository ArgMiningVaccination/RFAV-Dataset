Who is a keto diet plan for?A keto diet plan is for people who want to simplify their lives while getting all the benefits of keto eating: appetite suppression, weight loss, better blood sugar control, and other health improvements.

Skip breakfast and sip a coffee instead.6 This saves time and money. - Prep your meals: Cook at least two servings for dinner, eat one \u2014 and refrigerate the other \u2014 for tomorrow's lunch. Freeze other portions for later.
