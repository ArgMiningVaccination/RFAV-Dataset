The School's undergraduate and postgraduate nursing degrees also train professionals who are able to work effectively with their medical and allied health colleagues in managing the full spectrum of diseases that afflict Singaporeans and Asians. Along the way, the School has burnished its reputation as a crucible of significant research spanning the basic as well as clinical sciences. Its faculty comprise academic clinicians and scientists who have forged their credentials locally and internationally. A transformational gift in 2005 from the Yong Loo Lin Trust further enabled the School to map new pathways of scientific enquiry into various causes and origins of key illnesses like cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity, epigenetics and neurocognition. The gift also enabled a far-reaching revamp of the undergraduate education curriculum. This places the patient squarely in the centre of focus of everything that is now taught and done at the School, which was renamed in honour of its far-sighted benefactor. The School strives to fulfil its mission of contributing to excellent clinical care, training the next generation of healthcare professionals, and fostering research that will help transform the practice of medicine. Its 18 departments in the basic sciences and clinical specialties work closely with the Centre for Medical Education and the Centre for Biomedical Ethics to ensure that teaching and research are aligned and relevant to Singapore's healthcare needs. In 2008, the School became an integral part of the National University Health System (NUHS), which also groups the National University Hospital, the NUS Faculty of Dentistry and the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. The NUHS aims to develop and provide innovative, sustainable and value-driven healthcare for Singaporeans.Page 12 Key Contact Information (For up-to-date information, please visit the School's website at http://nusmedicine.nus.edu.sg/about ) Mr TEO KAMALSenior Director (NUS Medicine International Council)6149 medraja Mr Nigel Ignatius YEUNG Kwok KheuDirector (Continuing Education & Training - Executive Education)3724 medniykk Departments/Divisions The following departments are involved in teaching the undergraduate courses and/or graduate programmes.

Practice-based Learning and Improvement Demonstrate intellectual curiosity and the habit and skills for life-long learning and professional development. Develop the skills necessary to investigate and evaluate patient care based on scientific evidence, and proactively contribute to improve patient care. Systems-based Practice Develop a sound knowledge of the system of healthcare, and be able to garner resources for optimal treatment and quality delivery of healthcare to patients. Longitudinal Tracks There are several broad-based curricular components that are integrated with biomedical sciences and clinical teaching, running through various Phases of the undergraduate medical course: Health Ethics, Law and Professionalism The Health Ethics, Law and Professionalism (HELP) longitudinal track aims to develop ethical sensitivity, theoretical understanding, reflective and critical skills, and professional attitudes in medical undergraduates through all five years of the curriculum. It is student- and patient-centred; case-related, multidisciplinary and inter-professional; fully integrated into all phases of the curriculum; and regularly assessed, both formatively and summatively. Information Literacy This longitudinal track aims to enable all students to gather and critically evaluate research information and health informatics data, effectively incorporate the selected information into their knowledge base and apply the knowledge in patient care, and also to lay the foundation for future training to conduct high quality research. Medicine and Society This longitudinal track aims to expose students to the concepts of preventive healthcare at the individual and population level, with emphasis on the epidemiology of common communicable and non- communicable diseases, as well as on vulnerable groups. It also aims for students to gain an understanding of the influence and relevance of behavioural, social, cultural, environmental andPage 3economic factors in local and global settings, which will assist in their promotion of health and management of illness as future doctors. Patient-based Programme and Clinical Skills Foundation Programme These two Programmes aim to give medical students an introduction to the Singapore healthcare system, the practice of medicine, foundations in clinical skills and the importance of the preclinical sciences. Students will be trained to become practitioners with skills in listening and questioning, and who understand and reflect on patient-centred care. Examples of skills that the students are expected to achieve are the ability to conduct and manage an open interview; introduction to the physical examination; the ability to evaluate and reflect on their interviewing skills; and to understand another person from that person's point of view. These longitudinal tracks begin in Phase I (Year One) and will run through to the end of Phase II (Year Two) of the curriculum. Integrated Care As the School places strong emphasis on preparing medical students to work in an integrated healthcare system with an integrated care mind set, Integrated Care aims for students to gain a perspective of and own patient care across time, space, acuity, and discipline. Teaching pedagogies are inter-disciplinary in nature, combining knowledge from Family Medicine, General Medicine, Palliative Medicine, Rehabilitation Medicine, Geriatric Medicine and other community-oriented specialties. This training begins in Phase I with students undergoing a caregiver training session. This provides students with a better appreciation of the multi-dimensional nature of care provision for patients. Combined Teaching Sessions (CTS) in Phases III and IV, conducted in a case-based discussion fashion, will enhance students' integration of discrete patient interactions into a complete and holistic view of a patient's health journey. Course of Study Satisfactory completion of all components of the curriculum is required for graduation. The course of study for students admitted from AY2019/20 onwards is as follows:Page 5Phase I (Year 1)Introduction to Health & Disease Longitudinal Tracks: Health Ethics, Law & Professionalism; Medicine & Society; Information Literacy; Patient-based Programme; Clinical Skills Programme; Integrated Care.Foundations of Human Biology: The Cell Musculoskeletal System Blood, Respiratory & Cardiovascular Systems Renal, Fluid & Electrolyte Systems Gastrointestinal, Nutrition & Metabolism Systems Endocrine & Reproduction Systems Neuroscience with Head & NeckPage 6Phase II (Year 2)Genetics and Genomics Cancer Biology Immunology Clinical Microbiology & Infection Principles of Pharmacology and Systemic Pharmacology Principles of Pathology and Systemic Pathology Diagnostic Radiology Neuroscience & Musculoskeletal Foundations in Geriatric Medicine Clinical Skills Foundation Programme Phase III (Year 3)General Medicine Medicine Family and Community Medicine, including Ambulatory Paediatrics and Integrated Care for Older People General Surgery Orthopaedic Surgery Community Health Project Electives Phase IV (Year 4)Obstetrics and Gynaecology Paediatrics Acute Care comprising Anaesthesia and Emergency Medicine Psychological Medicine Forensic Medicine Otolaryngology Ophthalmology Electives Phase V (Year 5)Medicine Student Internship Programme Surgery Student Internship Programme Paediatrics Student Internship Programme Geriatric Medicine Student Internship Programme Orthopaedic Surgery Student Internship Programme Dermatology Infectious Diseases Clinical Skills and Life Support Training Electives Examinations At the end of each year of study, examinations leading to the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) are held as set out below.

The programme, which is completed in 2 years, aims to equip clinicians with basic methodological and practical skills to design and conduct clinical investigations that are relevant to patient care. The MCI programme will also provide a good foundation for those aiming to pursue advanced clinical research training, including training programmes leading to a PhD degree. Degree Requirements An MBBS or equivalent degree from a recognised university Candidates have entered specialist training or residency programme At least two years of post-registration clinical experience Curriculum Structure The MCI programme caters only for part-time students with a candidature period of two years, open to extension to a maximum of three years if more time is required for the research component. The 40- modular credit (MC) programme structure comprises 8 modules (32 MCs) for coursework (80%) and a research component (20%) of 8 MCs. For the research component, students work under the supervision of a group of mentors (established clinical investigators/researchers).Page 14.4 Research Programmes in Nursing Opportunities abound for nursing research to make a substantial impact on population health and improve approaches to patient care. The shift in emphasis from treatment to prevention of illness and from acute illness to chronic conditions, as well as an urgent need to translate successful research findings into clinical practice has led framed the research training agenda at the Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies (NUS Nursing). Teaching processes in the graduate research programmes aim to develop a dynamic, vital, and productive community of investigators who conduct rigorous research to establish the scientific and evidence base for patient care. Objectives: The MSc (Nursing) and PhD programmes aim to develop graduates characterised by their: ability to identify, formulate, and address problems through research; drive for evidence-based nursing research and practice; creative and strategic approach to lead the nursing profession nationally and internationally; entrepreneurial spirit to lead innovation which will impact on the profession and the health care industry. 4.4.1 Degrees Offered 4.4.2 Admission Requirements 4.4.3 Degree Requirements and Curriculum Structure 4.4.4 Financial Assistance and AwardsPage 14.4.1 Degrees Offered The following degrees will be offered: Master of Science (Nursing) [MSc (Nursing)] Doctor of Philosophy [PhD] The MSc (Nursing) degree is designed to provide research training specifically for nurses who have a Bachelor degree without an Honours component.
