His ayurvedic journey began following his brother's passing. Gunny was consumed by debilitating panic attacks and bouts of deep depression. Diagnosed with PTSD and desperate for relief, he found no comfort in traditional Western therapy. He was lost. It was there, at his wits end, that Gunny would rediscover his roots. On the advice of his family, he began supplementing his diet with Ashwagandha and other time-tested Ayurvedic remedies. Meditation and yoga became daily practices. Within six weeks, his anxiety faded and his depression lifted. Watch the full Webinar or read the summary below followed by a few Questions asked by attendees. What is Ayurveda? Ayurveda is a 5,000 year old science founded in India. Many believe it to be older, but documents find it to be around this time. - Ayu = Life & Veda = Science/Knowledge What is the Goal of Ayurveda? To promote consistent balance between the mind, body and spirit, to prevent disease and to maintain optimal physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health Ayurvedic Science is based on 5 basic Elements: - Ether (Space) - Air - Fire - Water - Earth The five elements are present in nature and in the human body on many levels. At the most basic level, however, they take the form of chemicals such as Carbon, Oxygen, Hydrogen and Nitrogen. The Five Elements that Come Together to Compose the Doshas: - Vata = Ether + Air - Pitta = Fire + Water - Kapha = Water + Earth Five Senses & their Relationship to the Body: Element Sense Organ Ether Sound Ears Air Touch Skin Fire Sight Eyes Water Taste Tongue Earth Smell Nose The Five Senses are all Connected to the: Mind - Ego - Intellect - Unified Whole The Ayurvedic Definition of Health: It is an overall balance in MIND + BODY + SPIRIT. The mind has the power to heal, as the mind thinks and believes the body follows. (Deeper explanation in the questions section.) So how can we use the power of Ayurveda to help us on our healing journey: First off, remember the power of your breath. It is 100% free. Next, do you best eat what is available in season.

Check out Dr. Vasant Lad's work. He has more advanced knowledge in Ayurveda. Not only does he offer different publications her offers online classes for a higher level of understanding into Ayurveda. Please explain the idea behind as the mind thinks and behaves the body follows. Belief is that emotion that gets you to thinking and as soon as you have that the body begins to behave and miracles are produced. So as the mind begins to think the healing of the body will follow. As Gunny's father likes to say, your body is your greatest pharmacy and knows exactly what to do. If the mind is connected to healing and doshas, is a specific dosha more prone to excessive chitta vitti that impacts our inability to heal as easily? Within the constitutions and Gunny's experience, Vata and Pitta will be more so affected. They are prone to that inability to heal. How can someone assess their dosha and is this something to reassess over time to see if it changes with any mind/body/spiritual work done? A lot of people have Dosha quizzes online. If you want an accurate answer, visit a dosha/ayurvedic practitioner. An ayurvedic practitioner will check your pulse, even check your tongue (can see certain patterns in relation to digestion, imbalances in the body) , check skin color, and nails. Then 6 months to year later check back. There is an entity called [NAMA](https://www.ayurvedanama.org/), they can help you find a practitioner. There is also a quiz by [SaharaRose](https://www.iamsahararose.com/) that is quick and can help you get started. If I want to consult with Gunny, are they located in Texas? Do they see patients? Gunny Sodhi is not a Ayurvedic practitioner. He has extensive knowledge because Ayurveda has become his life passion. His expertise is in the supplementand product side of the practice. If you are located in Texas, you can [Contact YouVeda](https://www.youveda.com/contact/) and they will get you in touch with the right practitioner as they have connections within that area only. Does it matter what time a day you take adaptogens? It is different and relative to the person. Gunny takes Ashwagandha in the morning and Triphala at night. But again, he suggests trying it out for yourself and listening to your body. Will there be a workshop or the like to help us figure out which stage we are in? Please reach out to an ayurvedic practitioner. Gunny's father has an [Ayurvedic Medical Clinic](https://www.ayurvedicscience.com/). They do over the phone consultations. His phone number is (425) 453-8022. Also right now, Telehealth options are expanding so there are many different options. Any Ayurveda books that you recommend for beginners? Check out the [Sahara Rose website](https://www.iamsahararose.com/books) for guides and books for beginners. Also, [Cate Stillman](https://yogahealer.com/) offers great resources. Can you provide a free, reliable resource/test that will help us determine what our dosha is? Check out [Sahara Rose's Dosha Quiz](https://eatfeelfresh.com/new-quiz/). About Gunny Sodhi and YouVeda: Gunny had experienced the healing potential of Mother Nature first- hand and, in doing so, found a new purpose. Out of a desire to help change people's lives the way his life had been changed, YouVeda was born. Its mission is simple: produce the best Ayurvedic products on the planet. By tapping into the intelligence of Mother Nature, Gunny has found a way to honor the memory of his brother while helping others on their own journeys toward healing and happiness. "}
