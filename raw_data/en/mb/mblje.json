Since that time, the Committee has been instrumental in collecting, abstracting, and sunnnarizing a great deal of material dealing with new or unproven diagnostic or treatment methods, with a view to establishing and maintaining an information center which would be concerned with the collection and distribution of material in this field. As a first step in this direction, the attached Index of material in the American Cancer Society files has been prepared. The Committee has attempted to make the Index complete and compre\u00ad hensive for the information and assistance it may render to the medical profession. Naturally, therefore, there is included in this Index the names of men and names of materials which have been recognized as proven or even outstanding in other fields, They are included in this Index because either the material has been suggested but not proven in the cancer field or the men whose work has been outstanding in other fields have made statements or written articles with reference to can\u00ad cer which are in the unproven area. No conclusion should be drawn by the reader from the mere appearance of any name in this Index. Inquiry should be made of the American Cancer Society as to the material in its files before you reach any conclusions. The Index has been divided into three sections, as follows: Section I -Index of American Cancer Society File Material on Unproven Methods of Cancer Management. (p.1-105) Section II -Index of Organizations Identified with Unproven Methods of Cancer Management. (pp.107-122) Section III -Index of Periodicals which Carry Advertisements, Articles or other Information Concerning Unproven Methods of Cancer Managem ent. (pp.123-138) NOTE Dates in parenthesis represent the last year in which significant informa tion was received by the Society. *Reprint from Ca - A Cancer Journal for Clinicians is available on this subject. ** American Cancer Society Circular Letter is Available on this Subject.
