Concepts such as ancestral conditioning and healing, [awakened consciousness](https://www.lindanardelli.com/category/spiritual-emergence/), collective agreement of reality, and probable realities can be found in this glossary of spiritual healing words. I love how spiritual and therapeutic language can unite us through being so compassionate and magical. Spiritual healing words are powerful and beautiful. They have the potential to uplift, inform, awaken, and transform our perceptions of reality. Words go in deep, shake the foundation of our existence and compel us to break free from limiting beliefs. Spiritual Healing Glossary Ancestral Conditioning Ancestral Conditioning or Programming, or Ancestral Shadows, is the belief system passed down through generations, which we are a part of, which influences our attachment, dissociative behaviours, and choices we make, the emotional pain we endure, as well as genetic predispositions. Each of us began our biological development in our grandmother's womb, and she began her development in her grandmother's womb. According to biologist [Greg Hampikian](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnfarrell/2012/08/29/biologist-asserts-your-life-began-before-fertilization/#40574b9b3922), \"your life as an egg actually started in your mother's developing ovary, before she was born; you were wrapped in your mother's fetal body as it developed within your grandmother.\" Essentially, our life experiences and beliefs are programmed in our biology by previous family generations. The programming doesn't mean that we have to follow our ancestral footsteps or develop the same coping mechanisms, addictions, and hereditary health issues. It does mean that we are born with these traits and patterns at birth and live out these patterns until we begin to question and define our values and what is truly wanting to emerge in our lives. Ancestral traits are not meant to determine our life choices but rather provide us with a foundation on which we can evolve our own soul-purpose. Ancestral Healing Ancestral healing uncovers hidden dynamics that unknowingly impede the flow of love and life-vitality in our lives. It's a healing process that addresses the unconscious beliefs and suffering passed down through generations and clears a path for new family systems and conscious relationships. Every member of the family and society has a right to belong and feel safe, seen, and understood. Ancestral Healing is a way of releasing the conditioned-patterns from our lineage that inhibits our sense of safety, value and personal power. By releasing the outmoded conditioning, we free cellular memories connected to the patterns and tap into inherent gifts indwelling in our genealogy. Some Native Americans believe that our family beliefs, actions, and trauma affect seven generations in the past and future. By healing ourselves, we are helping to improve seven generations forward and back. In a [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/healing-the-wounds-of-you_b_853632) article, [Judith Rich](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/healing-the-wounds-of-you_b_853632) suggests that when \"we break the chain of addiction, violence or other inherited, limiting beliefs, our children and their children and those who follow them are given access to possibilities not available to the ancestors. And thus, the entire lineage evolves.\" Related blog articles for more in-depth information on ancestral healing Awakened Awareness Awakened awareness is a daily practice of self-observation and conscious choice that requires the combination of skill and surrender. It's the ability to simultaneously apprehend and welcome our reactions so that we can move from insecure coping strategies to secure integration. With constant rededication of our focus and intention, we can better navigate the push and pull of stimuli and reactions to find the centre point of our authentic expression. Rumi's poetry portrays this so perfectly, as translated by [Coleman Barks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman_Barks) in [The Essential Rumi](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/965212-essential-rumi). \"Your hand opens and closes, opens and closes. If it were always a fist or always stretched open, you would be paralyzed. Your deepest presence is in every small contracting and expanding, the two as beautifully balanced and coordinated as birds' wings.\" Our awakened presence occurs at the centre point of every contraction and expansion. By being attentive to our multifaceted experiences, thoughts, feelings and felt-senses, we move beyond habitual patterns and reactions; we balance the rational mind with emotional maturity and spiritual wisdom. In this way, we become nonjudgmental witnesses who view life through the eyes of compassion and curiosity and be responsible for our personal experience. [Loch Kelly](https://lochkelly.org/what-is-awake-awareness/), from the [Open Hearted Awareness Institute](https://lochkelly.org/open-hearted-awareness-institute/), also describes awakened awareness beautifully. He writes, \"Awake awareness is invisible, content-less, formless, boundless, and timeless, but it is the ground of our being. When you shift out of your conventional sense of self, there's a gap of not-knowing. Awake awareness is who we are prior to the personal conditioning we usually turn to for our identity. Rather than looking to our thoughts, memories, personality, or roles to identify ourselves, we learn to know awake awareness as the primary dimension of who we are, the ground of Being.\" Awakened Consciousness Awakened Consciousness is a spiritual impulse towards divinity. Awakening is when the whole becomes aware of itself. It is not a state of flawless perfection or getting cured of sin or false ego. Awakened consciousness is a state of welcoming all that is with curiosity and willingness to see and sense more and recognizing that our human nature is intrinsically sacred. Awakened Consciousness has nothing to do with becoming better or happier, explains [Adyashanti](https://www.adyashanti.org/), A Zen Buddist, in his teachings about awakening. \"Enlightenment is the crumbling away of untruth. It's seeing through the facade of pretense. Enlightenment is, in the end, nothing more than the natural state of being.\" [Eckhart Tolle](http://enlightened-people.com/eckhart-tolle-quotes-enlightenment/), another well-known teacher of enlightenment, explains that one still uses the thinking mind in the enlightened state, but in a much more focused and effective way. He, too, recognizes that at a deeper level, we are already complete. He writes, \"when you realize that, there is a playful, joyous energy behind what you do.\" Cellular Repatterning Cellular repatterning integrates spiritual and personal psychology with body/mind awareness to release limiting cellular memory patterns. All of our beliefs, attitudes, thoughts, and emotions send energy waves to every cell in the body, which shape the level of cell balance and affect the health of all operating systems. Cellular health becomes depleted when our mental focus is highly negative and fear-based, and when we are affected by adverse conditions, which results in physical illness and lack of mental and emotional clarity. In [Anatomy of the Spirit](https://www.amazon.ca/Anatomy-Spirit-Seven-Stages-Healing/dp/0609800140), international speaker [Caroline Myss](https://www.myss.com/about-caroline-myss/) explores how our cell tissues hold our attitudes and beliefs' vibrational patterns. She expands on this theory in her article [Take Charge of Your Health](https://www.myss.com/free-resources/take-charge/take-charge-of-your-health/), where she writes about how our emotional energy contributes to cell tissue formation. She describes how every thought we have travels through our biological system and activates a physiological response. She also explains that our body contains our history - every chapter, line and verse of every event and relationship in our lives. She writes, \"As your life unfolds, your biological health becomes a living, breathing biographical statement that conveys your strengths, weaknesses, hopes and fears.\" Cellular repatterning is a natural healing process that Myss refers to as \"an active and internal process that includes investigating one's attitudes, memories, beliefs, and relationships to power.\" She also describes healing as the \"desire is to release all negative patterns that prevent one's full emotional and spiritual recovery.\" Channeler & Channeling [chan\u00b7nel\u00b7er | \\ cha-n-lr](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/channeler) A person who conveys thoughts or energy from a source believed to be outside the person's body or conscious mind specifically: one who speaks for nonphysical beings or spirits. [channeling [chan-l-ing]](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/channeling) Esoteric communications - the practice of entering a meditative or trance-like state to convey messages from a spiritual guide Channelling is a healing tool, a gift from Spirit to help us evolve our consciousness. In my experience, it is as natural as breathing. Like inhaling and exhaling oxygen, channelled guidance moves in and through me with my willingness to surrender. In its essence, channelling is as familiar to me as bringing a visitor a cup of tea and an encouraging word and as formidable in the way it demands that I expand and trust. Related blog articles for more in-depth information on what channelling is Collective Agreement of Reality The Collective Agreement of Reality, also known as Consensus Reality and the Collective Unconscious, is a concept initially defined by psychoanalyst [Carl Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung). \"It refers to the idea that a segment of the deepest unconscious mind is genetically inherited and is not shaped by personal experience,\" explains [Lisa Flitscher](https://www.verywellmind.com/lisa-fritscher-2671480), a freelance writer. She explores Jung's teachings in [Understanding the Collective Unconscious](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-collective-unconscious-2671571). Collective Consciousness refers to what human beings believe reality is. It's an agreed-upon concept of socially fabricated existence and based on shared perceptions and experience of the material world. The collective agreement is limited to the acceptance of reality. Ancestral and historical beliefs define the reality passed down through generations and implicitly shaped by our primary senses, not by multidimensional awareness such as intuition and the paranormal. Jung believed that the collective unconscious is made up of instincts and archetypes that manifest fundamental pre-existing images, symbols, or forms repressed by the conscious mind. Humans may not consciously know of these archetypes, but they hold strong feelings about them. Compassion & Empathy The words compassion and empathy are often used interchangeably, yet they are not synonymous with one another. Compassion is the ability and willingness to alleviate the suffering of another. Empathy is the visceral awareness of the other's feelings; the ability to understand what he/she is experiencing. On the difference between compassion and empathy, I appreciate how [Mindvalley](https://blog.mindvalley.com/compassion-vs-empathy/), a Global School for Personal Transformation, explains that \"empathy refers more generally to our ability to take the perspective of and feel the emotions of another person. Compassion is when those feelings and thoughts include the desire to help.\"... \"Where empathy puts you in the shoes of another person's feelings or experiences, compassion spurs you to action.\" As I contemplate these differences, I want to address the tendency that many of us have towards fixing other people's perceived problems in response to our desire to help. We do the same with our own perceived problems - which is, in essence, control, not compassion. The moment we try to change another person's experience, we are not providing compassionate understanding. We are not tuning into their experience with empathy; we tell them what to do and who they should be. As I mentioned already, we behave the same way towards ourselves, impeding the compassionate support that we need. In essence, compassion is generous and understanding, coupled with an empathic sense of what others need and one's own personal boundaries. It's the desire to alleviate suffering and yet not become enmeshed. Conditioned Behaviour Conditioned Behaviour influences our present-day relationships and is composed of habitual thoughts, emotions, and actions shaped in our developmental years. The brain develops neural pathways within the first seven years of our lives, affecting how we think and feel in relationships with others and impacting our adult lives. Conditioned Behaviour is, in essence, the mind's survival strategy based on limiting and fear-based beliefs. These beliefs are influenced by our childhood and early adult life. Neglect, loss, trauma, and abandonment play significant roles in our fear-based behaviour. Life experience shapes brain activity, influencing the whole body, endocrine system, nervous system, immune system, organ health, and structural alignment. As [Tony Robbins](https://www.tonyrobbins.com), inspirational speaker and author writes in his book, [Awaken the Giant Within](https://amzn.to/2NFR2rp), \"It's not the events of our lives that shape us, but our beliefs as to what those events mean.\" Limited Beliefs are based on mental distortions about oneself and the world around us that can lead to anxiety, low self-esteem, depression, and conflicts, as well as physiological conditions. Some limited thinking-patterns are hinged to disparaging thoughts, such as the discouragement that comes with comparing ourselves to others, fixating on negative details while ignoring positive aspects, or seeing things as either good or bad. With this narrow mindset, we believe we have to be perfect or perceive ourselves as failures. Limited thinking can also be associated with overgeneralizing, catastrophizing, and taking things personally. Another aspect can be unreasonable expectations of ourselves and others. We try to measure up to an idealized version of who we think we're supposed to be and how others should behave. Related blog article about limited beliefs Divine Timing I often hear myself say, \"This is divine timing,\" especially when things seem to go awry, or I think that I've made an incorrect choice or taken a wrong direction. A close friend once avoided a freak storm by getting lost. He didn't intend to take the wrong turn to avoid the storm. He didn't know there was a storm up ahead on the British Columbia Coquihalla highway and was quite upset with himself for getting lost, until he arrived at the Coquihalla toll booth and was told by the operator, \"you just missed the worst of the storm!\" Is that coincidence? I don't think so. Our spirit is continuously aligning outcomes that best serve our wellbeing and growth but not necessarily our level of comfort. Our attachment to comfort drives us to measure up to ideals, which causes so much suffering. We try to control outcomes; we judge ourselves and one another and inevitably create conflict where there is no need. If only we could be patient with life and accept that some things follow an organic time-cycle that we cannot control or meddle with. Some things are indeed in \"God's hands,\" as the saying goes. In a [HuffPost](https://bit.ly/2Tx1qW2) article, the author of [The Karma Queens' Guide to Relationships](https://www.amazon.ca/Karma-Queens-Guide-Relationships-Truth/dp/0399173900), [Alexandra Harra](https://www.huffpost.com/author/alexandra-harra), explores how timing is everything and everything in time. I love how perfectly she describes that \"trying to work against the Divine timing of your life is like trying to walk against a strong headwind. But when you understand and use universal timing to your advantage, the wind is blowing from behind you, ushering you forward in the right direction. Truly, time then becomes your eternal ally.\" Related blog article for guidance on divine timing Emotional Intelligence Emotional intelligence, also called emotional maturity, is the ability to understand and welcome our emotions in life-affirming ways and be vulnerable and real with ourselves and others. It's about not suppressing our feelings or expressing them only partially, but instead becoming fully alive as a deeply feeling person, intimate with our exquisite sensitivity without explanation, justification, self-defence, or blame. Honesty, integrity, and healthy boundaries are signs of emotional maturity, as is cultivating empathy, compassion, and self-responsibility. Emotional maturity requires pausing before reacting, slowing down to become aware of how agitated we have become, and communicating with clarity. It's about being resourceful in how we respond to stimuli. We can recognize emotions as guideposts and allies with emotional maturity, rather than overshadow our feelings with logic. Emotional intelligence allows us to attune to our internal state and others' inner world, supporting a shift from reactivity into calm decisiveness, which defuses conflict and relieves stress. Related blog articles about emotional maturity Evaluating Mind The Evaluating Mind, or in other words, the critical mind, distinguishes between right and wrong and good and bad and defines our values, wants, and needs. It can be highly beneficial for establishing healthy relationships and boundaries; however, it can also become overly identified with an idealized version of reality. From an idealized perspective, the evaluating mind becomes biased and judgmental, measuring our worth or the value of others based on who we think they or we should be. We then compare our life experience with this flawless version, which robs us of seeing the true meaning in our lives. When the evaluating mind becomes overly critical, it acts as a protective force against failure and potential harm. Judging others or ourselves attempts to preserve our false, idealized identity to safeguard against perceived threats and insecurity. It's a guarding against anything that may trigger feelings of inferiority and aloneness. Felt Sense I first heard the term felt sense when I studied [Focusing-oriented therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focusing_(psychotherapy)) in my counsellor training in 1998. Psychotherapist [Eugene Gendlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Gendlin) developed Focusing to hold space for a person's thoughts and emotions in a fluid and non-attached way. Through this process of engaged and nonjudgmental attention, one's inner experience, the [unconscious](https://www.lindanardelli.com/mind-inner-wisdom/) and [subconscious](https://www.lindanardelli.com/mind-inner-wisdom/), and deeper truths can naturally emerge to the surface of one's awareness. Felt senses are the embodiment of the awareness of one's ever-changing emotional landscape and the connection point with one's instinctual and spiritual knowledge. A felt sense is a combination of emotions, physical sensations, conscious awareness, and intuition and functions as a connection between the mind, body, and spirit. A felt sense can be initially unclear; people are not always able to explicitly verbalize what they are experiencing. Clients will often tell me that they have no words until a deepening awareness unfolds, beginning with a vague sensation, thought, idea, or emotion, which evolves into an in-depth realization of past trauma, clarity about one's life, or burgeoning inspiration. To find out more about felt senses, read blog article: Idealized Persona Social expectations define the idealized persona and one's needs to be accepted and to feel safe in the world. Most of us grew up believing that we were not good enough. Many of us were not given the message that we are worthy of love just the way we are. Instead, we grew up with criticism and life-circumstances that contributed to deep feelings of insecurity. To cope with abandonment and pain and to ensure our survival, we developed a masked self. Shaped by our upbringing, life experiences, losses, and challenges, we develop an idealized version of who we think we're supposed to be to safeguard from failure and hurt. Invariably, some situations in life do not measure up to our expectations, and we fall short of our idealized selves. Consequently, the sense of not being enough can cause a person to create a false persona. For instance, someone may be overly identified with spiritual hierarchy and display false leadership, exhibiting authority over others. Whether conscious or unconscious of their motives, they seek to hide their shame and insecurity from others and even from themselves. Some people believe that success is defined by money. In contrast, others attach their sense of self-worth to marriage, thereby fueling a false sense of identity and security based on what they have gained in life. \"Feelings of failure, frustration, and compulsion, as well as guilt and shame, are the most outstanding indications that your idealized self is at work,\" explains Eva Pierrakos in The Pathwork of Self-Transformation. \"The basis for the tyranny of the idealized self-image is the sense of false shame and false guilt that this image produces when one cannot live up to it. In addition, the idealized self also manifests false needs, which are superimposed and artificially created, like the need for glory, the need for triumph, to satisfy vanity and pride.\" Instinct Instinct comes from the word instinctus, or, \"impulse,\" meaning it's a biological tendency. It's the transient reaction that happens in our bodies, apropos of right now. - [Scott Ginsberg] In essence, instinct is directly related to body sensations, such as tightness in the chest or an uneasy feeling in the belly, which offers us instant feedback about how we feel about someone, a situation, or a decision we need to make. Instinct is an alarm system in the body designed to keep us safe. It is intrinsically connected to our human nature - our biological intelligence, organs, and cells working synchronously to keep our bodies in good working order. However, while instinct alerts us to what is out of balance and invokes speedy response, it can quickly be superseded by reaction and distrust, bringing about anxiety and conflict rather than alerting us to what we need at any given moment. The key to heeding our instinct's natural impulse is to be attentive and aware of our body sensations. Intuition The word intuition comes from the Latin verb intueri translated as \"consider\" or from the late middle English word intuit, \"to contemplate\"... Intuition is the ability to acquire knowledge without recourse to conscious reasoning. - [Wikipedia] Intuition is unexplained feelings you have that something is true even when you have no evidence or proof of it. - [Collins Dictionary] Intuition relates to deep-feeling and sensing beyond the mind or body and comes with a profound resonance and knowing. It is not instinctively quick, but rather a state of surrendered and elevated consciousness. Intuition is a spirit-lured and heartfelt experience. It's a movement from within that is inexplicable yet deeply fulfilling, a subconscious and all-knowing feeling that permeates the senses. In [Gut vs. Intuition](https://psychcentral.com/blog/gut-vs-intuition-theyre-not-the-same/), [Valerie Varan](https://psychcentral.com/blog/gut-vs-intuition-theyre-not-the-same/) describes intuition as the voice of our soul, the highest part of us that exists before birth and continues beyond death. It is subconscious awareness of information that goes beyond the reaches of the rational mind into subliminal communication with the unknown. Empath & Intuitive Empath An empath is a highly sensitive person who can pick up the feelings and thoughts of others. They have a remarkable sense of whether people are truthful or misleading. However, many empaths struggle with other people's experiences because they tend to assimilate others' feelings, thoughts, and even beliefs as their own. They often become confused and emotionally unstable because they cannot differentiate between their emotions and the feelings of others. For instance, if they encounter someone anxious and shy, they too can become nervous and shy. The same occurs when facing people who are angry, sad, or lack confidence. An empath can become equally upset, sorrowful, or self-doubting. An intuitive empath is a person who senses others' feelings and thoughts and intuits what the other person needs for rebalancing or to feel seen and understood. Intuitive empaths can differentiate between their emotions and others' feelings because they are in tune with their own inner experience. Therefore, despite sharing other people's experiences, they do not absorb others' energies because they are more adept at self-regulating. Intuitive empaths receive input from their unconscious and subconscious awareness through instinctual body-signals and soulful guidance, which provides them with a clearer understanding of their feelings and what other people may be feeling.

I have frequently heard people say, \"I have such bad karma; I must have done something dreadful in another lifetime.\" People are under the impression that if only they could rectify what they did in another lifetime, their lives would be better. The notion that one must have done something bad is connected to the belief that wrongful deeds require punishment or that our impurities must be admonished. If there is anything that we can learn from our karma, it quickly gets overshadowed by our uncompromising limited beliefs. From what Masiandia has taught me, karma is not the sum of our past shame but rather the blueprint of our soul-purpose and has everything to do with growth cycles. There is no such thing as retribution or blame for a past action; there is only the promise of learning, discovery, empathy, and expansion. Ultimately, karma is the gathering of all your life experiences and their influence on your life-path and purpose. Longing We often think of longing as obsessing over something that we do not have, which we interpret as a weakness that we must overcome and control. When I speak of longing, I am not referring to the struggle we go through in acquiring what we want or the emptiness we feel when our wants and needs aren't fulfilled. I am referring to longing from a new perspective - the rich felt-sense experience of one's desire. In our forceful attempts to actualize what we want in life, we miss embracing our yearning. In contrast, connecting with our longing takes the \"pining\" and \"have to\" out of our lives, leaving us utterly accessible to what we want. An excellent illustration of this is when I let go of the pressure I had held within myself towards creating a relationship. My yearning for a connection then became delightful and sweet, as I was confident that its manifestation was inevitable. Otherwise, why would my longing be so intense? As [Masiandia](https://www.lindanardelli.com/spiritual-guides-masiandias-identity/) says, we wouldn't long for something if it couldn't be fulfilled. And so I stopped being anxious and lonely, and instead, I felt secure in my longing. When you allow your longing entry into your inner experience, rather than seek outwards to fulfill it, you become an open vessel, a strong magnetic conduit for its fruition.

Related Book about developing an intimate relationship with your longing Linear Thinking The word \"linear\" comes from the root word \"line.\" Linear thinking supports our collective relationship with time, social structures, and family systems. It provides a framework by which we share a common thread of thoughts, beliefs and consensus reality with humanity. Linear thinking offers an outline for our lives and aspirations and is inherently part of our conditioning, from our developmental years to elderhood. Our rational mind serves us in gathering information, making plans and abiding by the social order. However, because linear thinking is primarily deductive, it can become inflexible, thus overriding creative thought and intuition. The limitations of the rational thinking mind inhibits higher sensory perception, which leads to the inability to solve problems creatively. The linear thinking mind becomes fixated on well-known concepts, despite how those concepts are repetitive and not receptive to change and growth. Nonlinear thinkers employ imagination along with innovative and multidirectional approaches that draw from internal and subconscious processes. We are powerfully creative beings who are intrinsically linked with nature. Therefore, sequential thinking alone cannot support integration and purpose. We need intuition, imagination, risk-taking, and emotions to create the balance that underpins true integration and vision. Prayerful Living Prayer is deep inner listening and living by the honour code of your true nature. Through prayer, you remember that you are more than the sum of your personality; you are part of collective humanity and soul-vibration. You are more than your reactions, defences, justifications, and troubles. You are expansive and sacred and can call on your spirit, the beauty of Universal consciousness, God, Goddess, and All That Is, for support and connectivity. \"Prayer is a funny sort of thing,\" writes author and international speaker [Caroline Myss](https://www.myss.com/) in her blog: [Is Prayer Something Real for You](//www.myss.com/is-prayer-something-real-for-you/), \"It is like talking to air and musing with the stars at night. And yet, a presence is there, hiding behind the walls of the imagination.\" Divine presence exists whether we are consciously aware of it or not. Our imagination and invocations allow us to see and sense far more than our consensus sense of reality permits. It's freeing to live prayerfully - to love more deeply, trust with ease, and welcome divinity in all aspects of our lives. Prayer is a way of life and spiritual practice that supports integration with spirit and ultimately helps us embody our divinity. Energetically, prayer unifies polarities; it is the fulcrum between yin and yang energies, rest and action, thought and expression, and ultimately rebalances our vitality and magnetic energy. Through prayer, we become a broadcasting station that emits a steady frequency of faith and devotion into our lives. We conduct magnetic energy-currents that ultimately draw us back to the heart of what is important to us and to what makes us feel whole and supported. By living prayerfully, we become receptive to all facets of life experience, which opens us to life's abundance, beauty, and grace. You can read more about prayerful living in my book [Mystical Intimacy](https://www.lindanardelli.com/book-mystical-intimacy/) Related blog article about living prayerfully Probable Realities Probable realities are parallel dimensions of existence that give shape to your soul purpose amidst a spectrum of continuous time and space that is interconnected with your lifetime and yet separate. This expansive exploration of the self within many selves provides the soul with a broader breadth of expression of its purpose and intent. Every soul is born in more than one reality, and each reality reflects the soul-essence. Therefore every single moment offers you a multitude of choices that can lead to multiple expressions and probabilities, and your choices have rippling effects in other dimensions of existence. It doesn't matter if these choices are good or bad; they influence necessary changes contributing to these different dimensions' evolution. For instance, you could choose to enter into a committed relationship in this current reality, which then influences a profound sense of family solidarity in another probable reality. You could decide to leave an unfulfilling job, which encourages a probable self to engage in fulfilling work as well. Conversely, one of your probable selves may be experiencing poverty, which then serves to help you appreciate what you have and influence the choices you make around money. This past, future, or parallel reality may contribute to an investment or opportunity that lands in your lap. I find immeasurable solace knowing that my soul branches out into a myriad of possibilities and that my purpose doesn't depend solely on me. I'm part of a larger whole that comprises the many nuances of my soul expression, each a piece of the greater puzzle. I can also connect with my future self and draw on her experience and wisdom for guidance. \"Many people have at one time, or another changed their present behaviour in response to the advice of a 'future' probable self, without ever knowing they have done so,\" explains [Seth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Material), channelled by [Jane Roberts](https://sethcenter.com/products/seth-dreams-and-projections-of-consciousness-seth-book-jane-roberts), in [Dreams and Projections of Consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Roberts). \"We're all born with various gifts and talents, but of course we don't have time to pursue them all in one lifetime,\" writes [Chaki Kobayashi](http://www.dingtwist.com/probable-selves-and-alternate-realities/) in [Probable Selves and Alternate Realities](http://www.dingtwist.com/probable-selves-and-alternate-realities/). Kobayashi writes that there are \"other probable selves in different branches of reality no different from this one where we are pursuing each of our many talents. Also, whenever we have a big decision to make, especially one charged with a lot of emotional energy, reality branches into two and we continue life as if we had made both decisions. But each of our selves is unaware that reality has branched, that other selves exist in parallel worlds. In each reality, these identities are fully independent and exist within their own psychological framework. In other words, we are not singular, separate human beings that exist within our perception of reality; we exist in a multitude of perceptions simultaneously, which serves a greater whole. We are multidimensional beings who exist in an infinite number of universes, in myriads of probable realities. Related blog article on probable realities: Quantum Energy Quantum Energy is multidimensional, in all space and all time and not perceived with our five senses because it is none physical. From a quantum physics perspective, reality is an infinite field of energy that exists as a possibility but does not manifest as anything until consciousness observes which possibility will transpire. When consciousness observes reality, it projects an expectation of what it thinks will emerge. This expectation locks into that particular possibility, setting in motion the expected manifested reality. It's only natural that as we observe reality through the lens of spiritual integrity, being inspired and living our dream fully, we direct our creative energy towards manifesting that reality. Each moment holds infinite possibilities, and we, in turn, hold the key to which reality we experience based on what we perceive and, therefore, what we give to reality Reflective Listening Reflective listening is a powerful communication skill that genuinely embraces the speaker's perspective without having to agree with it. It's a nonjudgmental and non-directive approach that creates a safe and welcoming environment for others to speak freely. To truly listen, we must be willing to suspend our perceptions, beliefs, conditioning, and judgments. Otherwise, we filter everything through our personal biases. It's impossible to listen when we are interrupting, expressing our opinion, correcting mistakes, or problem-solving. You cannot listen to the word another is speaking if you are preoccupied with your appearance or impressing the other, or if you are trying to decide what you are going to say when the other stops talking, or if you are debating about whether the word being spoken is true or relevant or agreeable. - [William Stringfellow] Listening requires slowing down and giving the person time to speak so that you can pay attention to the more profound meaning inherent in what he/she is sharing. It's important to understand that reflecting another person's expression is not the same as parroting the message word for word, but instead offering your understanding of what the other person has shared. Maintaining eye contact, breathing, and being aware of body language and facial expressions are helpful, as well as verbal affirmations such as \"uh-huh,\" which reassure the speaker that you are following what he/she is saying.

For example, when a stringed instrument starts to vibrate and produce sound after a different instrument has been struck, we say a resonance field exists between the instruments. People experience this field of resonance when relating harmoniously and when something just feels right. Inner Resonance relates to our experience of another person who aligns with our thoughts and feelings and is intuitive to our needs. Resonance also occurs when our thoughts and emotions are in accord and align with our intrinsic values and needs. When something resonates, we have an inherent and unquestioned understanding - we know without explanation. Sympathetic resonance, on the other hand, is when one merges fields through over-identification with another person's experience, which is often the case for highly sensitive empaths who become angry when others are angry or fearful when others are worried and anxious. It's essential to learn to differentiate between oneself and other people's experience, to cultivate a deeper understanding of one's inner resonance.

The word responsibility means \"response-ability,\" which is to possess the ability to respond and choose how best to do so. By being accountable, we are resourceful and can make self-aware and discerned decisions because we do not react and project our needs and feelings onto others. We're taking responsibility for our psychological, physical and spiritual wellbeing, Self-responsibility is then an essential element to emotional maturity, awareness, personal empowerment, and success. When we become accountable for our thoughts, feelings, and wellbeing, our lives change; we awaken to who we truly are, our relationships improve, and we are more at peace with our lives. Self-responsibility is only really another face of learning how to love yourself. - [Aletheia Luna] Shadow Work Whatever we perceive as inferior, undesirable, unacceptable becomes a shadowed aspect of ourselves that we invariably reject. Yet, our shadow cannot be eliminated, as it is an intrinsic part of our life experience. The dark side of our personality shows up as defensiveness and overt criticism towards oneself and others. When we are unconscious of our shadow - our judgements, rage, envy, selfishness, and greed - we fail to uncover the trigger's source and limiting beliefs. By denying our negative feelings and thoughts, we invariably negate our light and misread our intrinsic needs. When we reject aspects of ourselves that we deem incompatible with our idealized version of who we think we are or should be, we cannot know the inner strengths that lie beneath the surface of our disowned self. Shadow work is a process of becoming engaged with our dark side, identifying and healing core wounds, and effectively navigating our fears, anxiety, shame, guilt, and anger, as well as profound grief. Knowing our shadow and working in depth with it are not just sideline pursuits, but rather necessary practices if we \u2014 both personally and collectively \u2014 are to really get on track, unchaining ourselves from our Conditioning and embodying a life in which our differences only deepen our shared humanity. - [Robert Masters] Related blog article about shadow work Spiritual Emergence Within us is a spiritual intelligence that is far wiser than our everyday, conscious, rational mind. Spiritual emergence refers to moving beyond the rational thinking mind into higher levels of awakened perception and transpersonal awareness. In a spiritual emergence experience, the relational mind assumes a different role than its usual cerebral functioning. Instead of constructing our experience, it becomes the witness, curious and trusting in the creative work of our more in-depth intelligence. Powerful inner experiences, felt-sense, and images and physical sensations and energies transpire with spiritual emergence. It can be a mystical experience - a merging with one's soul-essence and alignment with the ultimate unity of all life. Spiritual emergence allows us to embrace all facets of our human experience with receptivity, thus supporting inner expansion - a shifting within that leads to external resolution, increased creativity, and feelings of deep calm, peace, and compassion for self and others. According to the [Center for Spiritual Living](http://www.centerforspiritualemergence.com/spiritual-emergenceemergency.html), spiritual emergence is \"a natural opening and awakening that many people experience as a result of coming to terms with the difficulties of life, through an established faith tradition, as a result of systematic spiritual practices or through unexpected peak experiences.\" Spiritual Integrity Spiritual integrity is a choice, a way of life that begins with the self. It's a path of consciousness for those who wish to reclaim their sense of wholeness and being at home with the self. It requires devotion, vulnerability, and authentic expression. Spiritual integrity is all about following your true nature, which incorporates right action, walking your talk, and making sure you are energetically clear. It is the state of brutal self-honesty that demands depths of awareness and respect for your needs and the needs of others. Compassion, self-responsibility, and the willingness to learn and grow are all qualities that support spiritual integrity. The key is not to seek perfection but rather to embrace humanity and love what is. When humans resonate spiritual integrity, they divinely respect the life of every human being and everything that breathes life on earth. - [Cindy Eksuzian] Related blog article about Spiritual Integrity Related video series with channelled messages Soul Purpose Soul purpose seeks to fulfil itself in physical form. It is the intention behind the materialization of our longing and dreams. Soul purpose isn't just woven into what we do for a living. We often think that soul purpose is a vocation, something we have to accomplish or succeed at. Rarely is it seen as a way of \"being.\" Even more seldom is soul-purpose recognized as a gift that we are ordained to grant every part of our life. [Masiandia](https://www.lindanardelli.com/spiritual-guides-masiandias-identity/), the group-spirit I channel, describes soul purpose as higher intelligence and evolution, intrinsically woven into our personality, relationships, and creative endeavours, not just into what we do for a living. Purpose sets our soul in motion and provides it with the expression it needs to fulfil its incarnation, embodying who we are and what we need. Just as our physical bodies need oxygen to be alive, the soul cannot live without purpose. \"Your human nature acts as a source of organized mental energy, transmitting universal frequencies that support interplanetary evolution. Your soul purposefully merges with human nature in order to activate higher levels of magnetic energy within the physical body and Earth. By embracing your soul purpose, you activate the higher consciousness within your physical body, infusing all of your biology with the essence of your soul. This not only helps restore and rebalance your biology, your nervous system and overall physical structure, it also helps connect you to your mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing.\" - [Masiandia](https://www.lindanardelli.com/spiritual-guides-masiandias-identity/) in [Mystical Intimacy](https://www.lindanardelli.com/book-mystical-intimacy/) Related blog article about Soul Purpose Spiritual Seeing Close both eyes to see with the other eye. - [Rumi], Translated by [Coleman Barks] Spiritual sight is the ability to see and sense more, to bring to light the unobserved and undetected aspects of life. It's the ability to recognize beauty with an appreciation for what life has to offer. Spiritual seeing is the art of drawing out the good in people. With spiritual sight, one can notice inexplicit qualities and gifts in others and appreciate them, such as complimenting them for the difference they make in the world, acknowledging the challenges inherent in their work, and recognizing their courage and devotion. When people feel seen, they feel understood and valued. And when we allow spirit to see through our eyes, we feel uplifted and purposeful. \"Spiritual sight is the ability to notice energetic aspects, patterns, blocks to, and free expressions of God... basically it is an expanded awareness of what is truly happening,\" writes [Andrew Shykofsky](https://www.meditatecenter.com/teacher/meditation-teacher-andrew-shykofsky/) in [Meditate, a Centre for Healing Arts](https://www.meditatecenter.com/what-is-spiritual-sight/). \"When you hear someone say, \"I see what you mean,\" they aren't talking about physical sight but referring to understanding.\" Survival Response A survival response is a hyper-alert state of anxiety, triggered by a perceived threat, real or imagined. In response to acute stress, a chain of quick reactions occurs within the body to help mobilize resources that deal with dangerous circumstances. Fear-perceptions set the nervous and endocrine systems in motion in preparation for the fight, flight, or freeze response, which transmits neural frequencies to the kidneys and activates the adrenal hormones. The body's sympathetic nervous system is activated by the sudden release of hormones, which sends a danger signal to the cells. \"This chain of reactions results in an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate,\" writes [Kendra Cherry](https://www.verywellmind.com/kendra-cherry-2794702) in [How the Flight-or-Fight Response Works](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-fight-or-flight-response-2795194).\"After the threat is gone, it takes between 20 and 60 minutes for the body to return to its pre-arousal levels.\" While the survival response plays a critical role in dealing with actual danger, in the absence of real threat, prolonged heightened anxiety affects the body's homeostasis, lessens cell vitality, and depletes the immune system. Psychologically, it wreaks havoc on our emotional wellbeing, relationships, and work-life. To mitigate the physiological and psychological effects of prolonged stressors and cultivate life-experiences that are fulfilling, we must become aware of our triggers. Otherwise, we erect barriers to protect ourselves, which then become guards against the love and support we need to thrive. By becoming conscious of how we defend against life, we cultivate a deeper connection with ourselves and others and uncover what we need to feel safe and loved. Vibrational Field \"Everything in Life is Vibration\" - Albert Einstein All matter emits vibrational energy, referred to as the vibrational field or energy field. The human body, animals, plants, water and the earth, and even inanimate objects encompass energy-producing particles that are in constant motion pulsating and creating electrical and magnetic energy. \"Vibrations refer to the oscillating and vibrating movement of atoms and particles caused by energy. Even solid objects like tables are actually made up of microscopic vibrating atoms that receive, store, and emit energy. Because of this, all humans and objects have an energy field that has its own vibrational frequency.\" [- Christina Sessums](https://purelysimpleorganicliving.com/vibrations-frequencies/) The vibrational field is also referred to as spiritual vibration, or the web of energy or life force that interconnects us all, and represents a state of being - the energetic quality of a person, place or object. Vibrational Medicine Vibrational medicine, also referred to as energy medicine or energy healing, uses energy generated by and around your body to optimize health and well-being. Within our human body, cells vibrate at an amazing lightning speed, constantly following a rhythm of internal and external movements. These movements are governed by our every thought and emotion. There is an energy message sent to every cell in our bodies from our beliefs, attitudes and behaviour. The message we send shapes the level of cell balance, which affects the health of all operating systems in our bodies. Vibrational medicine seeks to reverse the adverse effects of negative-prone messages that come from trauma and limit conditioned programming, and ultimately help the body and mind integrate fragmented aspects of the self.
