Wray, PhD, Trent D. Buskirk, PhD, Keri Jupka, MPH, Pascale Wortley, MD, MPH Context: Vaccination can decrease the morbidity and mortality caused by influenza, yet vaccination rates remain low, especially among minority groups. Previous studies have found that important barriers to vaccination include the fear of adverse reactions and concern that the vaccine causes influenza. Background: This research aimed to assess the effects of messages designed to address concerns about the safety and effectiveness of vaccination among blacks aged /H1135050 years. Design: In a randomized controlled trial conducted in 2007 with pre-exposure and post-exposure measurements, participants were randomly assigned to read either the vaccine safety messages (VSM) developed for the study (treatment condition) or the vaccine information statement (VIS) currently given to those getting the vaccine (control condition). Setting/ participants:A total of 108 participants participated in the study. Data were collected in either participants' residences, community settings, or university conference rooms. Main outcome measures:Influenza vaccine-related beliefs and intention to receive vaccination were assessed. Results: Data analysis in 2007 and 2008 found that the randomization hypotheses of equal groups were retained. Participants exposed to the VSM showed greater improvement in post- exposure beliefs about how the vaccine works ( p/H110050.0006) and the transmission of the flu (p/H110050.0034) as well as greater post-exposure disagreement with the belief that the vaccine causes influenza (p/H110050.0411). Conclusions: The VSM affected beliefs about vaccine safety and effectiveness to a greater degree than did the VIS. These ndings show that VSM are effective in changing beliefs empirically linked with influenza vaccination and vaccination disparities. The dissemination of VSM to older blacks may increase vaccination rates and reduce vaccination disparities. (Am J Prev Med 2009;36(5):429-434) \u00a9 2009 American Journal of Preventive Medicine Introduction Influenza is a major cause of morbidity and mortal- ity in the U.S.,1where an estimated 36,000 individ- uals die each year from the disease.2Vaccination is an effective and economical tool for decreasing the bur- den of influenza in the U.S. population.3,4Populations at high risk of serious illness and death from influenza and related complications include older adults, immuno-compromised individuals, and people with chronic med- ical conditions.5The Advisory Committee on Immuniza- tion Practices recommends annual influenza vaccination for all adults aged /H1135050 years.6The U.S. Public Health Service established a Healthy People 2010 vaccination cov- erage objective of 90% for those aged /H1135065 years and 60% for high-risk adults aged 18-64 years.7Despite recom- mendations, usage rates remain low\u2014at 66% on average8\u2014 with even lower use among minority groups.9Several studies have shown that blacks have lower vaccination rates than whites.10-15One nationally representative sur- vey found that only 47% of older blacks were vaccinated, compared to 68% of older whites and 62% of older Hispanics.13 Previous studies9,16-19found that the fear of adverse reactions and the concern that vaccination may actually cause the disease were important barriers to influenza vaccination.9,19Other barriers included concerns about vaccine effectiveness and a perceived lack of physicianFrom the Department of Community Health (Wray, Buskirk, Jupka), Saint Louis University School of Public Health; the George Warren Brown School of Social Work (Lapka), the Health Communication Research Laboratory (Jacobsen), the Alvin J.

This article reports on the development and eval- uation of messages addressing safety concerns about vac- cination among blacks aged /H1135050 years. Background Working with partners from the CDC, the study team used a theory-and-evidence-based approach to message development and evaluation.23To understand concerns about influenza vaccine safety among older blacks and to develop messages to allay those concerns, the study team conducted qualitative formative research with two audi- ences in the rst year of the study. Four focus groups and ten in-depth interviews were conducted with blacks aged /H1135050 years to assess their beliefs about vaccine safety and effectiveness and their intentions related to vaccination. Five key-informant interviews and one focus group were conducted with employees of clinics that offered the vaccine to older blacks to identify providers' perceptions of patients' vaccination concerns and their strategies for addressing them.24 Long applied in public health research and programs related to vaccination, the health belief model25,26in- formed the present study and informational materials. Consistent with the model, formative-research partici- pants identied several important reasons not to get vaccinated: perceived risks of the vaccine; perceived lack of benets; low perceived susceptibility to and severity of influenza; and low self-efcacy to make a vaccination decision. The ndings showed that a limited understand- ing of both influenza transmission and how the vaccine builds immunity contributed to the belief that the vaccine causes influenza.24This older population also expressed concern about interactions of the vaccine with medica- tions. For formative-research participants, concerns about the vaccine and its effectiveness far outweighed concerns relating to flu severity and susceptibility. Based on these ndings, the study team drafted vaccine safety messages (VSM) that sought to address these concerns. The VSM emphasized information related to vaccine safety and effectiveness encapsulated in three topics: how the vac- cine works, why the vaccine is safe, and why the vaccine does not cause influenza. The VSM also sought to enhance self-efcacy for making an informed vacci- nation decision, summarizing the risks and benets of the vaccine and emphasizing informed choice. Given the emphasis on vaccine safety and effective- ness, the VSM did not highlight information related to susceptibility and severity. Message comprehen- sion was assessed in pre-tests through a combination of in-depth and cognitive-response interviews, and the VSM were revised accordingly.27 This article presents the results of a randomized controlled trial that sought to test the effectiveness of the VSM in affecting participants' safety and effective-ness beliefs about the vaccine and their vaccination intention. The trial assessed whether the VSM im- proved on the vaccine information statement (VIS) distributed by the CDC in changing beliefs about vaccine safety and effectiveness. A VIS is required by federal law to be given with each dose of routine vaccine with the purpose of informing recipients in simple terms about the risks and benets of the vaccine being administered. It is not specically designed to persuade people or to allay fears, but was selected for the comparison condition because it addresses vaccine risks and benets and, for the purposes of this study, was considered standard care. As no informational materials were identied that were identical in content or intent with the VSM, it was concluded that the VIS was the best available comparison stimulus. The study aimed to test two hypotheses: (1) that respondents exposed to the VSM would have, from baseline, greater changes in their positive beliefs re- lated to the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine\u2014but not to susceptibility and severity\u2014compared to respon- dents exposed to the VIS materials, and (2) that respondents exposed to the VSM would have greater changes over time in vaccination intention compared to respondents exposed to the VIS materials. Methods This randomized controlled trial assessed vaccine-related beliefs and intentions with pre-tests and post-tests from 108 participants who were randomly assigned to read either the VSM (treatment condition) or the VIS (control condition).28 Participants answered questions just before (i.e., pre-exposure) and 2 weeks after (i.e., post-exposure) reading the materials. The Saint Louis University IRB approved this study in January 2007. A convenience sample of black men and women aged /H1135050 years (n/H11005111) was recruited from community centers, resi- dential facilities, advertisements in local black media, and fliers posted at local businesses. Interested individuals were asked In general, do you get a flu shot every year? followed by Why or why not? Individuals were eligible to join the study if they reported not getting vaccinated for influenza every year and were concerned that the vaccine causes influenza, doesn't prevent influenza, has side effects, interacts with medications, or may be contaminated (i.e., individuals concerned about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, not those express- ing low perceived susceptibility to and severity of the flu). The sample size of 50 per group was powered to detect a medium effect size (0.25 SD) for the chance-intention outcome, with power/H110050.83, /H9251/H110050.05, and p/H110050.1. Three individuals were lost to follow-up: one in the VIS group and two in the VSM group. An average of four telephone calls was made to each participant. See Figure 1. Data were collected from January 2007 to June 2007 in university conference rooms, community settings, or partici- pants' residences. Participants read and signed a consent document and then completed a baseline (pre-exposure) questionnaire before reading either the VIS or the VSM. The 430 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 36, Number 5 www.ajpm-online.netVSM were professionally prepared and modeled after the VIS in form, style, and typography. (The VIS and VSM appear in Appendixes A and B, available online at www.ajpm-online. net.) Two weeks after exposure to the materials, participants were contacted by telephone to complete a follow-up (post- exposure) questionnaire. Participants received a $10 grocery- store gift card after each contact. Both the pre-exposure and post-exposure questionnaires contained measures of vaccine-related beliefs and intentions. The pre-exposure questionnaire included demographic vari- ables; the post-exposure questionnaire included questions on the appeal of the materials. Participants responded to questions about vaccine safety and effectiveness, susceptibility, severity, self-efcacy, and the appeal of materials, using a 7-point Likert scale with strongly disagree and strongly agree as anchors. The intention to get vaccinated was measured in two complementary ways. The rst used the recommended method from the theory of reasoned action,29with a dichotomous (yes/no) item: Do you intend to get a flu shot this flu season? The second used a published-likelihood scale: With 100 being extremely likely and 0 being extremely unlikely, what is the chance that you willget a flu shot this season?30Randomization provided protection against in- ternal validity threats of likely confounders, but demograph- ics were measured to test group equivalence. The appeal of the materials was assessed, using seven created items. Individual belief items were combined using post hoc exploratory-factor analysis in which six factors emerged, ex- plaining 60.65% of the overall variance observed for these items. The six factors were vaccine benets and safety, vaccine effectiveness, self-efcacy, recommendations for the flu shot, susceptibility, and severity. Seven items not clearly loading on any particular factor were included in the analysis as individ- ual items. These questions appear in Appendix C, available online at www.ajpm-online.net; belief measures are organized by factors and single items. Differences between groups for the baseline categorical intention measure as well as demographic variables wereassessed using chi-square tests. Differences in beliefs and intentions across groups at baseline (pre-exposure) and the appeal of the materials (post-exposure) were assessed using independent-samples t-tests. The overall effects of vaccine- information group over time were explored rst by tting a doubly multivariate ANOVA model31that explored the rela- tionship between groups over time for the six composite scores (created by summing the items loading on each factor); seven single items; and the chance-intention item. For this model, multiple indices were measured for partici- pants (multivariate) repeated across two time points (doubly multivariate). For each effect in the doubly multivariate ANOVA model, the Pillai's trace-test statistic was reported because it is the most robust and conservative multivariate statistic32and the signicance of effects assumes a 5% Type I-error rate. Signicant multivariate effects were then explored via a series of univariate repeated-measures ANOVAs derived via general linear mixed models that also had a Type-I error rate xed at 5% for each of these models.33This approach results Table 1.

In all cases, the primary emphasis involved testing the inter- action between time (pre-exposure versus post-exposure) and group (VIS versus VSM) in the general linear mixed model. The interaction between time and group for the binary- outcome measure Do you intend to get a flu shot this flu season? was evaluated using a generalized estimating equation.34,35 All p-values presented herein are unadjusted. All analyses were conducted in 2007 and 2008, using SAS version 9.1. Results A majority of study participants were women (83%); aged 50-60 years (60%); with health insurance (76%; Table 1). Chi-square tests found no signicant differences in demographics between the VIS and VSM groups. The comparison of belief and intention measures for the two groups at baseline also showed no signicant differences (allp-values/H110220.05). No signicant between-group differences were found for items measuring the appeal of the materials, nor for the scale summing all the appeal items (results notshown). The appeal for both sets of materials was high, with responses averaging from 4 to 6. The lack of differences in appeal between the VIS and the VSM groups suggests that the differences in outcomes found between groups are not related to design or formatting. The doubly multivariate ANOVA comparing the six com- posite scores, seven single items, and the chance-intention item between groups over time revealed a changes in the flu compos- ite scores and single-item values differed over time by the two vaccine-information groups. The main effect of time was highly signicant in this model (Pillai's trace /H110050.7387; F[(14,61]/H11005 12.32; p/H110210.0001) and the main signicant (Pillai's trace/H11005 signicant multivariate interaction was explored in more detail via a series of univariate repeated- measures models (Table 2). The vaccine-effectiveness com- posite score changed from baseline approximately 4.6 units more on average for VSM participants compared to VIS participants (F[1,96.8]/H11005 12.68; p/H110050.0006).

Disagreement with the I think the flu shot causes the flu single item changed from pre-exposure to post-exposure in the VSM group approximately 0.75 units more on average compared to the VIS group (F[1,106]/H11005 4.28; p/H110050.0411). Differences between the groups over time were not signicant for the benets-and-safety composite or single items measuring concerns about side effects. These ndings provide partial support for Hypothesis 1: participants exposed to the VSM had a greater level of belief in vaccine safety and effectiveness than those exposed to the VIS. Participants in the VSM group were 2.97 times more likely to report an intention to vaccinate post-exposure compared to pre-exposure; participants in the VIS group were 1.72 times more likely. Similar results hold for the chance-intention measure. Neither of the uni- variate between-group comparisons for the intention measures was signicant, however (p/H110050.211 and p/H110050.302). Finally, it should be noted that changes from pre- exposure to post-exposure were higher, on average\u2014 while not always signicant\u2014in the VSM group com- pared to the VIS group for all composite scores (except susceptibility and severity of flu); all single items (ex- cept for The flu shot is not a cure for flu item); and both intention items. Discussion This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the VSM in changing beliefs related to the safety and effectiveness of influenza vaccine but not beliefs related to suscepti- bility and severity, consistent with the model of effects. But the belief changes of individuals exposed to the VSM did not, as hypothesized, go on to influence their intention more than those exposed to the VIS. The sample for the study was a convenience sample of older blacks in a Midwestern city, so generalization to all older blacks is not appropriate. A threat to the validity of the results is the potential for test sensitiza- tion with both groups in explaining changes in out- comes from pre-tests to post-tests. It is possible that completing the pre-test prompted individuals to pay more attention to, or to seek out more, information about the vaccine from other sources, such as the Internet. Another important weakness in the study is the use of a comparison stimulus that was not precisely matched in persuasive intent. Concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness im- pede the acceptance of the influenza vaccine by older blacks. This study showed the potential of a theory-and- evidence-based message-development process to affect beliefs linked empirically with influenza vaccination and vaccination disparities. Specically, message argu-ments in the VSM regarding flu transmission and how the vaccine works achieved greater gains than the VIS and are likely to have contributed to the diminished belief that the vaccine causes influenza. The ndings suggest that the new messages go further than available materials in allaying concerns about the vaccine. The literature9,16-21suggests that concerns about vac - cine safety and effectiveness are common. Further re- search is needed to improve message elements to achieve greater impact on intention and to determine whether these messages are effective with other populations.

Anyone who is sick with a high fever (higher than 101 F) 2. People with an egg allergy (those who have rashes, hives, or problems breathing when eating eggs) 3. People with Guillain- Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a rare but serious muscle disease. If you have GBS, your doctor will tell you. Talk with a doctor to decide if you should get a flu shot. It's your choice whether or not to get a flu shot. The CDC recommends that every adult 50 years and older get a flu shot, especially those in high-risk groups. Weigh the benets over the risks and decide if the flu shot is right for you. The best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu shot every year. While a healthy lifestyle, good hygiene and staying away from others may help, the flu shot is the best way to prevent the flu. The flu can be a very serious illness. Complications from the flu can lead to hospitalizations and even death. The flu shot can prevent all of these by preventing the flu. People feel miserable when they are sick with the flu. Flu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, headache, chills, muscle aches, and fatigue. People with the flu may feel so sick that they have to miss work and stop caring for loved ones. They may also spread the flu to others and make them sick. People who get a flu shot protect both themselves and others from the flu. The flu shot does not contain a live virus and cannot give you the flu. However, the flu shot sometimes has side effects.
