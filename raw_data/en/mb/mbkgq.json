Using a picture of Alex Echols, 14, from Eugene, Oregon, Carrey attacked California Governor Jerry Brown after he signed a bill introducing one of the nation's strictest immunization laws. Alex's mother Karen Echols was shocked to discover that Carrey had tweeted the picture to his 14.7million followers, and the family say they are 'disgusted and sickened' to see it used for anti-vaccination propaganda. Fight: Jim Carrey (above in April at the LACMA 50th Anniversary) attacked California Governor Jerry Brown on Twitter after he signed a strict immunization bill into law Jim Carrey illustrated his tweet with a picture of autistic teenager Alex Echols to attack the new California law. Alex's mom, Karen, responded to the movie star asking him to remove the photo Alex in a photo shared on his [website](http://www.alexneedshelp.com/) and Facebook page which is used to advocate for the use of medical marijuana. His family members have made it clear that they have never spoken against vaccination Carrey's rant came in response to the new law which strikes down personal belief exemptions for immunization and requires all school-age children to be vaccinated by kindergarten and then again by seventh grade. 'California Gov says yes to poisoning more children with mercury and aluminum in mandatory vaccines. This corporate fascist must be stopped,' Carey wrote. He followed that up moments later, writing; 'They say mercury in fish is dangerous but forcing all of our children to be injected with mercury in thimerosol is no risk. Make sense?' He later posted a series of tweets illustrated by crying children supposedly suffering from autism, one of which included a picture of Alex Echols. 'A trillion dollars buys a lot of expert opinions. Will it buy you? TOXIN FREE VACCINES, A REASONABLE REQUEST!,' the 53-year-old Dumb and Dumber actor wrote. Alex's aunt, Elizabeth Echols wrote on her Instagram that Carrey 'tweeted out an image of my nephew who suffers from Autism and tuberous sclerosis as an example of anti-vaccinations. Alex had these conditions before he was ever vaccinated'. Alex is pictured above However, not only did Carrey use the photograph without permission, Alex's autism is a result of a genetic condition and his parents have never claimed that it has any connection to vaccinations. Alex, born in 2001, suffers from Tuberous Sclerosis, a condition which causes mainly benign tumours to develop in different parts of the body, including the brain, with autism is a common side effect. Ms Echols and her husband Jeremy have been campaigning for Alex to get access to medical marijuana to help him with his condition, which causes seizures, self-harming, and anxiety. They use their [website ](http://www.alexneedshelp.com/)and [ Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/alex.autism.rage.mmj)to advocate for the use of medical marijuana, and family members have made it clear that they have never spoken against vaccination. 'Jim Carrey (yes that one) tweeted out an image of my nephew who suffers from Autism and tuberous sclerosis as an example of anti-vaccinations. Alex had these conditions before he was ever vaccinated,' Alex's aunt Elizabeth Echols wrote on her Instagram. The tweets from Carrey, above, are in response to the new law which strikes down personal belief exemptions for immunization and requires all school-age children to be vaccinated by kindergarten and then again by seventh grade 'I'm very disgusted and sickened that a celebrity would use a photo like this that was used in the first place to spread awareness of Tuberous Sclerosis to mock him and and my sister for vaccinations. Even if that was not his intended outcome, it is what happened.' The photograph has been removed by Twitter, but no action has been taken from Carrey himself. Carrey has been against mandatory vaccinations ever since his relationship with Jenny McCarthy, who believes that vaccines caused her son's autism. While the two dated from 2005 to 2010, Carrey was very involved in the cause, participating in walks and marches in support of 'green vaccines' and supporting his then girlfriend as she gave speeches around the country. Inspiration: Carrey became an advocate for the cause after he began dating Jenny McCarthy (couple above with McCarthy's son Evan and Carrey's daughter Jane at a 2008 march) in 2005, who believes vaccines gave her son autism The current California law meanwhile still provides some loopholes, with children able to avoid being vaccinated with a medical exemption or if their parents agree to keep them in homeschool. There had been some question as to whether Brown would in fact sign or veto the bill as he did not make his opinion on the matter public. Carrey, who also called the Centers for Disease Control 'corrupt' on Twitter, believes that the chemical additives in vaccines are causing a host of problems in young children. He and others, like McCarthy, believe that toxins should be eliminated from children's vaccines and that there needs to be a change in children's vaccination schedules. They frequently point to the growing number of autism cases in the country to support their belief. New rules: All children in California will now have to be vaccinated unless they have a medical exemption or are homeschooled after Brown (above at an April conference) signed the bill After signing the California bill into law, Brown also added a message, saying: 'The science is clear that vaccines dramatically protect children against a number of infectious and dangerous diseases. 'While it's true that no medical intervention is without risk, the evidence shows that immunization powerfully benefits and protects the community.' The CDC has supported Brown's statement, claiming their is no link between 'thimerosal-containing vaccines' or the measles vaccine and autism.
