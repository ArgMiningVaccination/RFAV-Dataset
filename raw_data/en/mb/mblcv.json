In the absence of a shared language of \"words,\" energetic healing can connect a human more closely to an animal while at the same time working on the physical body, the chakras, and the different layers of the animal's aura or energy field. In this book, animal communicator and healer Diane Budd shares her intriguing journey, research, and experience of working with animals energetically. She explains how, together with a healer colleague, she set out to document the effects of animal communication and healing on the energy field of the animal and the communicator, which led to further in-depth research. Detailing her findings, she reveals how to work with the energy fields, auras, and chakras of horses, cats, and dogs as well as what benefits energetic healing work can offer to animals. Sharing many case studies from her healing practice, the author explores what High Sense Perception (HSP) reveals about the relationship between an animal and human and how to make sense of what you are receiving on an intuitive level. Full-color illustrations clearly show the energy field, the energy flow between animals' chakras, and what happens in the energy fields of a human being and an animal when they connect telepathically. The illustrations also help guide you, step-by-step, through the use of the healing tools and practices described. The author explains how zoopharmacognosy--animal self-selection of remedies such as essential oils or herbs--can support emotional release and physical healing, not only for animals but for humans too. She details animal personality types and their soul evolvement levels and explores the influence of an animal's past life on present-day issues, whether it be a past-life connection with the current owner or an issue the animal needs to work with in this present lifetime. Full of animal communication stories and ground-breaking research on animal energy fields, this book shows how, just as we humans are all here on this earthly plane to learn and grow, so are our animals.
