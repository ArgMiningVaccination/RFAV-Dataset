FDA simplifies COVID-19 vaccination schedules On April 18, the US Food and Drug Administration moved to simplify the COVID-19 vaccination schedules for most people. As part of these changes, the current bivalent vaccines (original and omicron BA.4/BA.5 strains) are now used for all doses for anyone 6 months of age and older, including for an additional dose or doses for certain populations. The original monovalent Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines are no longer authorized for use in the United States. If you have been fully vaccinated and previously received required boosters, you do not need an additional booster at this time. What You Need to Know - Everyone aged 6 years and older should get one updated Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to be considered up to date. - People aged 65 years and older may get a second updated Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 booster dose. - People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised may get additional updated Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 booster doses. - Children aged 6 months-5 years may need at least one updated dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, depending on the number of doses they've previously received and their age. Vaccinations following these new guidelines are available at multiple UK Retail Pharmacy locations as well as the UK PharmacistCare Clinic at 245 Fountain Court, Room 220. Fountain Court is located just off Man O'War near Richmond Road. Vaccinations for children under 18 are given only at the Fountain Court location, and all minors must be accompanied by a parent or guardian.
