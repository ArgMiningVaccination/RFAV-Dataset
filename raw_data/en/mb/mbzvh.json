Now, What? You just finished your cycle (IUI, TDI, or Timed Intercourse) and begin the waiting game. The next couple of weeks are spent anticipating the moment when you can take a home pregnancy test. Excited and nervous, you take a pregnancy test and it is positive! A positive pregnancy test is the ultimate goal for any couple undergoing fertility treatment, but the influx of emotions can be overwhelming. Our staff at Michigan Reproductive Medicine understands and will be with you every step of the way. Each journey starts with a single step, and a positive pregnancy test is the first step that gets you closer to the goal of having a baby. After the initial shock and happiness wears off, you are left with the question, \"now what?\" The first step is to call our office at 248-593-6990 to make an appointment to have your blood drawn for a BhCG level (also known as a \"beta\"). BhCG is a hormone made by the placenta during pregnancy. This is the same hormone that you test for when you do a urine pregnancy test at home. The at home test is a qualitative test and detects the presence of hCG in your urine. The BhCG testing we do in our office is a quantitative test and gives the precise level of the hormone in your blood. Once we know your BhCG level, we repeat this testing every 3-4 days to monitor your progress. The number of days is important because the level of BhCG in the bloodstream doubles every 3-4 days. We monitor your progress for about 2-3 weeks. After that time, you will schedule an ultrasound with either the doctor or one of our nurse practitioners. An early pregnancy ultrasound is scheduled approximately 5 weeks after your last menstrual period to determine embryo placement and number of developing embryos. During this ultrasound, the gestational sac, a cavity of fluid within the uterus surrounding the developing embryo, is measured. This measurement is used to determine the age and progression of the embryo. Sometimes more than one gestational sac is seen, which indicates a twin pregnancy. This ultrasound is done very early in the pregnancy, so a heartbeat or fetal movement is usually not seen at this time (don't worry, it's just too early in development!). Another pregnancy ultrasound is scheduled 2 weeks later, and again 2 weeks after that. The embryo is measured to confirm growth is occurring at the expected rate. A heartbeat and some fetal movement is usually seen during these ultrasounds. By 10 weeks pregnant, you will be instructed to transition your care to your Ob/Gyn. You are officially graduated from our office! If you are uncertain of whom to see for your local Ob/Gyn care, we'll be happy to give you a referral. Congratulations on your pregnancy and we hope that you send us belly photos, as well as a birth announcement! We have been cheering for you throughout your journey and are so excited to have you achieve your family goals.
