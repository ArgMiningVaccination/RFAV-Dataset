Medical Review The Medical Review team performs review of promotional and non-promotional materials as well as scientific/medical materials to ensure they are truthful and non-misleading; medically/scientifically accurate and relevant; supported by substantial evidence; and consistent with good medical practice and ethics. Medical reviewers are responsible for partnering and communicating effectively with cross-functional colleagues including Legal, Regulatory, Commercial/Marketing, and Compliance in order to support organizational initiatives.
