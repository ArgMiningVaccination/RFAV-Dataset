Practitioners of Ayurveda, India's 5,000-year-old system of health and healing, would say yes, and that the key to a long and healthy life is achieving a balance between body, mind and spirit. Health problems occur, say Ayurvedic practitioners, when the pace of modern living does not allow us enough time to properly \"digest\" our life. Over time, this destabilizes our internal balance and causes us to store unnecessary toxins physically, mentally and emotionally. In Ayurvedic speak, the excess toxicity is called ama and releasing our body of this ama is key to maintaining health and vitality. The Ayurvedic prescription to regain balance is a treatment called panchakarma, which means \"five therapies.\" During panchakarma, you ready the body for treatment, then experience deep detoxification during a variety of treatments and eventually enter rasayana, a post-treatment phase meant to nourish the body and mind. \"Panchakarma is a conscious letting go of business-as-usual for at least a week, affording us a return to our naked, or more naked spirits and unadulterated rhythms,\" says Claudia Welch, an Ayurvedic practitioner, doctor of Chinese medicine and author of Balance Your Hormones, Balance Your Life. \"It restores health to the tissues and organs in our body, through the relaxation, cleansing and rejuvenating panchakarma therapies.\" Each regimen is tailored to the individual and includes oil massages, enemas, purgatives and detoxifying steams in a cedar steam box called a swedana. While Kerala, India, is still a major destination for travellers seeking panchakarma, Ayurvedic practitioners across Canada offer authentic treatments, too. If you're feeling fatigued, out of sorts or are suffering from a chronic imbalance, here are some excellent Ayurvedic options to choose from. Transformation Ayurvedic Center in Montreal, Que.
