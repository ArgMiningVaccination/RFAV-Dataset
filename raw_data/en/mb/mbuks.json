The warmed stones are also placed along the energy centers of the body and are able to connect paths of energy to balance the mind, body, and spirit. In addition to the warmed basalt stones other tools of the earth can be integrated into the massage such as crystals and healing essential oils. This service is extremely therapeutic and is beneficial for those that suffer from chronic pain including fibromyalgia and arthritic conditions. Hot stone massage has been around for a very long time. The Chinese used heated stones for healing more than 2,000 years ago. The practice is also found in other ancient cultures including the Egyptians and Native Americans. I feel a great connection with the stones when using them, as being from the earth, they emit and transfer a soothing, grounding energy. A hot stone massage is very much like your usual therapeutic massage but heated smooth flat stones are used. In my massage, I first place large stones over a towel along the spine to warm and relax the muscles, help sedate the nervous system, and align the energy centers. Crystals can also be placed along the energy centers of the body. I then hold the warm stones and use them the same way as I do my hands. Hot stone massage is great for those like me who are always chilly and the heat from the stones will warm you to your core. It is also wonderful for relaxing muscle tension, just like applying a heat wrap would be, and can help to improve a wide range of conditions. The calm, relaxing application of the heated stones also promotes the release of endorphins that help to reduce stress and lower blood pressure. The warm stones will also help to open up the pores of the skin which can increase oxygen intake and improve circulation. Combined with specially selected essential oils for you, your aches and pains will melt away! Hot stone massage is one of my favorite types of massage to get so it's natural for me to want to think that everyone should feel the same way, but I am actually surprised at the amount of people who tell me they have never tried one. I do find, however, that once someone does, it's usually their favorite massage too! Hot stone massage is generally safe for everyone however there are certain situations or health conditions where it may not be right for you. A review of your health history intake form would be done to make sure. "}
