I have never visited a chiropractor before today, but I am so glad I did. Dr. Carter was thorough, informative, and she was able to relive my back pain with a combination of techniques. I will definitely be going back and I recommend her to anyone who is in need of an adjustment. The office was clean and she is pleasant and highly skilled. - 9/21/2018 I was drawn into this office by social media. A few of my friends opened up a gym. Muscleheadz gym, and they posted some photos of some educational tips Dr. Carter gave. I was curious about seeing a chiropractor, but a little afraid to go. Some time went by and I finally mustered up the courage to go.. so glad I did. I called the office to schedule, appointments were pretty easy to schedule. when I arrived, it was a little confusing, but you can tell the office building has multiple small owned businesses inside. As I walk through the halls in this small quiet building, all the way down the hall, I see a calm & welcoming environment through the clear glass door. Dr. Carter greeted me in with a warm smile. I filled out all paperwork (also available online), and discussed all my concerns with her. Anything, including but not limited to, difficulties in range of motion, daily exercising habits, diets, muscle spasm, work related motions with repeated movements and more. Dr. Carter listened attentively and addressed each concern. The first visit takes a little longer so that she can do a full assessment with baselines for you. She has different equipment to help your muscles relax, I can't remember the exact terminology. A lot of people are drawn in with the suction cups, and it may be an option if she feels that is necessary for you. The whole visit was very seamless, everything fits together based upon you and your concerns. It's definitely important to let her know if your muscles feel better or worse. she will definitely talk to you along the way about everything. I asked her at the end of my visit to go over recommended stretches for me. Since it was my first visit she recommended I come a few more times every two weeks until I'm at \"maintainable\" status. So today was my second visit, and I thought I felt fine but honestly it was a visit I never knew I needed. I'm glad I went, and love for my friends & family to be treated with the same hospitality. - 7/8/2018 I absolutely love Infinite Energy. Dr.Tamara is amazing , she doesn't make you feel like you're just another walk in . She truly cares about how you're feeling , if anything has changed since the last visit ! She's so knowledgeable , friendly & her prices are competitive ! The office was very clean , with new modern equipment . There was no long wait time .I came in at my appointment time and seen shortly after ! I have a really bad shoulder and back so I got an adjustment an cupping with some scrapping \"sorry I forgot he name \" . We started with the cupping first an it's almost works soon as she takes them off an you feel the relief . Then we did the adjustment she's so good at informing you what she's about to do so there's no surprises. Overall I'm so happy with my experience and the prices ! I'm always skeptical going to places with lower prices cause I'm so used to \" you get what you pay for \". And this was not the case ! I got way more then I paid for ! I will be going back in two weeks - 7/11/2018 I strained my back lifting a heavy box at work and was in excruciating pain. I found Dr. Carter online and decided to give her a try and that turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made! Prior to seeing her, I was hardly able to walk. I could not stand for long periods of time and was just overall uncomfortable. Dr. Carter was very thorough and explained everything that she was doing. She took her time and also gave me exercises to do at home. Although I will resume care with the exercises at home, I do plan to see her weekly until I am fully functioning again. Dr. Carter is absolutely amazing! I highly recommend her. - 7/3/2018First to Review First time visiting a chiropractor and it was an amazing experience. Very personal and knowledgeable. More than just an adjustment and took the time to explain every treatment. Will be going back very soon.
