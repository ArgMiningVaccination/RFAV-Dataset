Most people have been to or know someone who has been to a chiropractor. Traditional Chiropractic typically has the following goals: 1. Decrease muscle spasms 2. Improve range of motion 3. Temporarily reduce pain While these goals are wonderful and most traditional chiropractors do a good job at accomplishing them, we at Complete Wellness believe there is far more that can be done for our patients' daily and lifelong wellness. Neuro-Structural Chiropractic By focusing on identifying and correcting Neuro-Structural Dysfunctions, not only do we look further than traditional chiropractic goals, we achieve long-term strength and wellness for the spine, for the body's nervous system which runs through the spine, for every organ and system in the body.
