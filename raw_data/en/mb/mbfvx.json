In doing so, therapists believe that they are consciously directing or modulating an individual's energies by interacting with his or her energy field. The focus is on balancing the energies of the total person and stimulating the body's own natural healing ability rather than on the treatment of specific physical diseases. Therapeutic Touch is based on the following assumptions: - The human being is an open energy system composed of layers of energy that are in constant interaction with self, others, and the environment. - Illness is an imbalance in an individual's energy field. - Clearing or balancing the energy field promotes health. - All humans have natural abilities to heal and enhance the healing in others.
