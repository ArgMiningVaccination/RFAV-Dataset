Introduction [Figure 1](#medicines-06-00087-f001). 2. Acupuncture Point Localization [1](#B1-medicines-06-00087)], a system using Augmented Reality (AR) is proposed to localize the acupuncture points. The proposed system includes three stages: Symptom input, database search and acupuncture point visualization. - (1) - Symptom input: The user interacts with a chatbot on the smartphone to describe her/his symptoms. - (2) - Database search: According to the symptom described by the user, a TCM database is searched and symptom-related acupuncture points are retrieved. - (3) - Acupoint visualization: Symptom-related acupoints are visualized in an image of the human body. [2](#B2-medicines-06-00087), [3](#B3-medicines-06-00087)] that propose similar ideas (the use of AR for acupoint localization), they did not consider the effect of different body shapes and changes of the viewing angle on the accuracy of acupoint localization. In this project, several techniques, including facial landmark points, image deformation, and 3D morphable model (3DMM) are combined to resolve these issues. Due to clarity, the focus of the discussion on localizing acupoints should be on the face, because it is one of the most challenging parts of the human body, with regards to RCA. 2.1. Image-Based Acupoint Localization [2](#B2-medicines-06-00087)] for acupoint localization and visualization. They created a reference acupoint model for the frontal face, and the acupoint coordinates are expressed as a ratio to face bounding box (returned by the face detector). The reference acupoints are rendered on top of the input face based on the height and width of the subject's face and the distance between the eyes, relative to the reference model. They used Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) feature descriptors to match feature points from the current frame and the reference frame, to obtain the estimated transformation matrix. Instead of scaling the reference acupoints like [ [2](#B2-medicines-06-00087)], Chang et al. [ [3](#B3-medicines-06-00087)] implemented a localization system based on cun measurement. Cun is a traditional Chinese unit of length (its traditional measure is the width of a person's thumb at the knuckle, whereas the width of the two forefingers denotes 1.5 cun and the width of four fingers side-by-side is three cuns). They used the relative distance between landmarks to convert pixel into cun, assuming that the distance between hairline and eyebrow is 3 cun. The acupoint can be located based on its relative distance (in cun) from some landmark point. However, there are issues with the above approaches for acupoint localization, including: - (i) - The differences of face shape between different people are not considered - (ii) - A conversion of pixel to cun, based on the frontal face, cannot be directly applied to locating acupoints on the side of the face. [3](#B3-medicines-06-00087)]). In the current project, landmark points are used as the control points for image deformation, and the locations of acupoints can be estimated by deforming a reference acupuncture model. In addition, the reference acupuncture model is allowed to be changed dynamically to match different viewing angles. More specifically, a 3D model with labeled acupoints is created so that the 3D model can rotate to match the current viewing angle. Finally, a 3D morphable model for different face shapes is provided. In other words, a 3D morphable model is deformed to best fit the input face, and the acupoints are projected to 2D as the reference acupuncture model. A summary of previous studies in acupoint localization is shown in [Table 1](#medicines-06-00087-t001). 2.2. Landmark Detection [4](#B4-medicines-06-00087), [5](#B5-medicines-06-00087)], and the Dlib [ [6](#B6-medicines-06-00087)] implementation by [ [4](#B4-medicines-06-00087)] is used in the present work. 2.3. Image Deformation [2](#B2-medicines-06-00087)] used the distance between eyes and the height of the face as the scaling factor of the x and y directions. Then the same transformation is applied to every pixel on the reference acupoint model. However, given that their scaling factors are based on a frontal face model, it cannot be applied to the side face. In addition, they did not consider difference face shapes. In the present work, we use a weighted transformation based on moving least squares [ [7](#B7-medicines-06-00087)]. The distance between the control points is used as the weight during the transformation. Here, the control points are the landmark points. 2.4. 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) [8](#B8-medicines-06-00087), [9](#B9-medicines-06-00087), [10](#B10-medicines-06-00087), [11](#B11-medicines-06-00087)] are common for face analysis because the intrinsic properties of 3D faces provide a representation that is immune to intra-personal variations. Given a single facial input image, a 3DMM can recover 3D face via a fitting process. More specifically, a large dataset of 3D face scans is needed to create the morphable face model, which is basically a multidimensional 3D morphing function based on the linear combination of these 3D face scans. By computing the average face and the main modes of variation in the dataset, a parametric face model is created that is able to generate almost any face. [12](#B12-medicines-06-00087)] proposed a fitting method using local image feature that leverages cascaded regression, which is being widely used in pose estimation and 2D face alignment. Paysan et al. [ [13](#B13-medicines-06-00087)] published the Basel Face Model (BFM), which can be obtained under a license agreement. However, they did not provide the fitting framework. On the other hand, Huber et al. [ [14](#B14-medicines-06-00087)] released the Surry Face Model (SFM), which is built from 169 radically diverse scans. SFM is used in the present work, as it provides both the face model and the fitting framework. 2.5. Face Detection (FD) and Tracking [15](#B15-medicines-06-00087)] with Adaboost learning algorithm [ [16](#B16-medicines-06-00087), [17](#B17-medicines-06-00087)] have been commonly used for object detection. However, they tend to have a high false positive rate. Zondag et al. [ [18](#B18-medicines-06-00087)] showed that the histogram-of-oriented-gradient (HOG) [ [19](#B19-medicines-06-00087)] feature consistently achieves lower average false positive rates than the Haar feature for face detection. In the present work, a face detector based on HOG-based features and support vector machine (SVM) were implemented. However, the computation overhead to combine HOG and SVM could be a bit significant when running the face detector on a smartphone. In addition, a low detection rate might occur for a fast-moving subject. For example, during the process of acupuncture or acupressure, some part of the face might be obscured by the hand such that the face is undetected by the face detector. Therefore, a face-tracking mechanism has been implemented to mitigate these problems. [20](#B20-medicines-06-00087)]. Danelljan et al. introduced the discriminative scale space tracker (DSST) [ [21](#B21-medicines-06-00087)] based on the MOSSE tracker. DSST can estimate the target size and multi-dimension feature such as PCA-HOG [ [22](#B22-medicines-06-00087)], which makes the tracker more robust to intensity changes. The Dlib [ [6](#B6-medicines-06-00087)] implementation of DSST [ [21](#B21-medicines-06-00087)] is used in this work. 2.6. Method\u2014Acupuncture Point Localization [Figure 2](#medicines-06-00087-f002). The offline process is shown in dark gray and online process in light gray. The acupoints are labeled in the offline process. During the online process, face detection is performed on the input image, and then landmark detection is applied to the face region to extract facial landmark points. 2.6.1. 3D Morphable Model [14](#B14-medicines-06-00087)] is used to implement our 3DMM model. The generated model is fitted using the landmark points on the 2D image, such that different face shapes can be considered. 2.6.2. Acupoint Annotation [Figure 3](#medicines-06-00087-f003)b. The texture and mean model of the 3DMM are then loaded into the 3D graphics software. For every acupoint, the 3D coordinates of the center point of the blue sticker and its three nearest vertices are marked. The coordinates of the landmark points are marked as well. 2.6.3. 3D Acupuncture Model 2.6.4. Face Detection and Tracking [23](#B23-medicines-06-00087)] is a metric that measures the peak sharpness of the correlation plane, commonly used to evaluate tracking quality. For estimation of the PSR, the peak is located first. Then the mean and standard deviation of the sidelobe region, excluding a central mask centered at the peak, are computed. In this work, a 11x11 pixel area is used as the central mask. 2.6.5. Landmark Detection [4](#B4-medicines-06-00087)]. The difference of pixel intensity between a pair of landmark points are selected as the feature used to train the regression tree. Each tree-based regressor is learned using the gradient boosting tree 2.6.6. Fitting 3DMM 2.6.7. Acupoint Projection Given the input of a set of 2D points and its corresponding 3D points, a pose estimation function estimates the pose by minimizing re-projection errors. The output of such a function contains information that can transform a 3D model from the model space to the camera space. We plan to utilize the pose estimation algorithm included in the SFM fitting framework [ [14](#B14-medicines-06-00087)]. In our case, the 2D points set are obtained from landmark detection, while the 3D points are labeled at the offline stage. 2.6.8. Acupoint Estimation [7](#B7-medicines-06-00087)] is used. The basic image deformation affine transform is defined as lv(x) = Mx + T, where M is a matrix controls scaling, rotation and shear, x is a 2D point, T controls the translation. Let f be a function of image deformation, f(p) = q transform a set of control points p to a new position q. [Figure 4](#medicines-06-00087-f004), since the reference acupoints Aref are only available in the mean model, the actual acupoint location ArefFitted in the fitted model will be estimated using the nearby vertices as the control points (see Equations (1) and (2)). 2.6.9. Acupoint Visualization [Figure 5](#medicines-06-00087-f005)a. The landmark points in the input image are used as the destination control points, while landmark points in the reference model (i.e. the fitted 3DMM model) are used as the control points to deform the reference acupoints. The deformed acupoints are then visualized onto the input image, as shown in [Figure 5](#medicines-06-00087-f005)b. The warping not only visualizes the acupoints, but also takes care of the non-rigid part of the face, such as facial expressions, the mouth opening, etc. 3. Automated Acupoint Stimulation [Figure 6](#medicines-06-00087-f006). 3.1. Hand-Eye Calibration [27](#B27-medicines-06-00087)], which does not have to maintain parallelism compared to other coordinate transformation methods. [Figure 7](#medicines-06-00087-f007)). The camera first reads an image as input, and then moves to the acupoint estimation part (as discussed in the previous acupoint localization section) to get the image coordinates of the acupuncture points. Then, the acupoint image coordinate is passed to the coordinate transformation part to get the robot arm coordinates of the acupoints. 3.2. Transformation Matrix Calculation [Figure 8](#medicines-06-00087-f008). We take the image plane as the original coordinate and the robot arm plane as the destination coordinate, in order to calculate perspective matrix (6,7). [Figure 9](#medicines-06-00087-f009). [Figure 10](#medicines-06-00087-f010). The image plane is taken at the calibration plane height (plane a) as the original coordinate and the image plane at the height higher than the calibration height (plane b) as the destination coordinate to calculate perspective matrix , as shown in [Figure 10](#medicines-06-00087-f010). [Figure 11](#medicines-06-00087-f011). 4. Automated Detection of Deqi Event [28](#B28-medicines-06-00087)]. Deqi can be measured by the sensation of the acupuncturists and the reaction of the patient. [29](#B29-medicines-06-00087), [30](#B30-medicines-06-00087), [31](#B31-medicines-06-00087), [32](#B32-medicines-06-00087)]. In 1989, the Vincent deqi scale was invented based on the McGill pain questionnaire. The Park deqi scale and MacPherson deqi scale followed [ [33](#B33-medicines-06-00087), [34](#B34-medicines-06-00087)]. [35](#B35-medicines-06-00087)] is composed of various needling sensations and has a system that measures the spread of deqi and patient's anxiety levels during needling. These scales mainly focus on the patient's sensations and are pretty subjective. Ren et al. [ [36](#B36-medicines-06-00087)] conducted a survey to determine the perspectives of acupuncturists on deqi. Again, their results are based on subjective questionnaires collected from a small number of acupuncturists [ [36](#B36-medicines-06-00087)]. [37](#B37-medicines-06-00087), [38](#B38-medicines-06-00087), [39](#B39-medicines-06-00087)]. Therefore, the EEG can also be used as an objective indicator of deqi, as its change is significantly associated with autonomic nervous functions. Observing EEG changes in relation to acupuncture is more objective than using a questionnaire. [40](#B40-medicines-06-00087)] observed significant changes in alpha band electroencephalogram powers during deqi periods, while Streitberger et al. [ [41](#B41-medicines-06-00087)] only found significant changes in alpha1 band. Other studies [ [37](#B37-medicines-06-00087), [39](#B39-medicines-06-00087), [42](#B42-medicines-06-00087), [43](#B43-medicines-06-00087)] have shown that EEG power spectrum and occipital lobes when a deqi effect is reported by the subjects. Note that the number of subjects in these studies are generally small (10-20 people) and different acupuncture points are used in different studies. Furthermore, while deqi sensation is commonly believed to be the most important factor in clinical efficacy during acupuncture treatment, the detection of deqi mostly relies on the participant's subjective sensations and sometimes the acupuncturist's perceptions. It has been found that there can be some differences between a patient's real-life experience and the acupuncturist's sensation [ [44](#B44-medicines-06-00087)]. In clinical practice, many acupuncturists can only detect deqi effects based on the patient's report or observation of the reaction of a patient to deqi. 5. Discussion [45](#B45-medicines-06-00087)] show applications in the field of acupuncture. In the humor section for the online publication, Science-based Medicine, Jones [ [46](#B46-medicines-06-00087)] picturizes a patient being treated for fatigue syndrome by an acupuncturist and an acupuncture anesthetist, who use robotic acupuncture. [45](#B45-medicines-06-00087)]. [45](#B45-medicines-06-00087), [46](#B46-medicines-06-00087)]. Jones says that state-of-the-art medical robotic technologies feature high-resolution 3D magnification systems and instruments that can maneuver with far-greater precision than the human wrist and fingers. This allows specially-trained acupuncturists to locate and successfully control hard-to-reach acupuncture points (those next to the eye or in the genital area). This could expand the number of indications suitable for acupuncture [ [45](#B45-medicines-06-00087)]. [45](#B45-medicines-06-00087), [46](#B46-medicines-06-00087)]. 6. Conclusions [47](#B47-medicines-06-00087)]. However, we did not imply that the computer would replace the acupuncturist; rather, we were seeking to highlight the quantification of the measurable effects of acupuncture. This vision of \"robot-controlled acupuncture\" is now a reality [ [47](#B47-medicines-06-00087), [48](#B48-medicines-06-00087), [49](#B49-medicines-06-00087), [50](#B50-medicines-06-00087)]; the research work in this article clearly shows its present status. Further modernization of acupuncture, like automatic artificially-based detection of dynamic pulse reactions for robot-controlled ear acupuncture, is under development.
