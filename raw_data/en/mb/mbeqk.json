It consists of three programs, each with specific program objectives: (1) HIV Prevention, (2) HIV/AIDS Surveillance, and (3) Ryan White CARE Act Title II (RWTII) or North Dakota Comprehensive AIDS/HIV Resources and Emergency Services (ND CARES). More information about the HIV/AIDS Program can be found on the program website at www.ndhiv.com. HIV Prevention Program The NDDoH HIV Prevention Program incorporates the Healthy People 2010 priority areas for HIV infection with goals to (1) reduce and prevent the transmission of HIV by reducing or preventing behaviors or practices that place individuals at risk for HIV infection and (2) reduce associated morbidity and mortality of those who are HIV infected by increasing access to early medical intervention. The program provides HIV prevention services to those most at risk for HIV. The services include HIV counseling, testing and referral; partner counseling and referral; prevention case management for people living with HIV/AIDS; and other health education and risk reduction activities including workshops, outreach and provision of risk reduction supplies, primarily condoms and educational brochures. The program also increases awareness about HIV and the behavioral risk factors associated with the disease through development and/or promotion of multi-media campaigns. Services are provided through contracts with various agencies including local public health units, community-based organizations, and college/university student health centers. HIV/AIDS Surveillance Program The NDDoH HIV/AIDS Surveillance Program monitors the number and demographics of HIV/AIDS cases in North Dakota. The primary activities of the surveillance program are to (1) implement and conduct HIV/AIDS surveillance, (2) evaluate the performance of the HIV/AIDS surveillance systems, and (3) implement projects that supplement the information available through HIV and AIDS case reporting, to enhance and extend the ability to plan for public health programs and resource allocation. North Dakota Department of Health HIV/AIDS Program 1 ND Dept. of Health Surveillance and epidemiologic reports for HIV/AIDS in North Dakota are completed biannually and can be found at www.ndhiv.com under \"Resources.\" Ryan White CARE Act Title II/North Dakota Comprehensive AIDS/HIV Resources and Emergency Services Program The Ryan White CARE Act Title II (RWTII) Program, also known as North Dakota Comprehensive AIDS/HIV Resources and Emergency Services (ND CARES), assists low-income North Dakota residents living with HIV or AIDS to access confidential health and supportive services. North Dakota residents living with HIV or AIDS who meet financial eligibility criteria can receive assistance through the program. RWTII/ND CARES is a payer of last resort, meaning the program covers only those services not covered by other means, including Medicare, Medicaid, insurance or other public sources. Reimbursable services are also subject to limitations. The following services are available through RWTII/ND CARES: Case Management. Provides assessment of client needs and referrals to health care and other necessary support services to improve the client's quality of life. Outpatient Services. Provides assistance with costs associated with accessing and maintaining non-hospital medical care, including HIV specialty care, as well as dental and mental health services. Drug Assistance Program. Assists clients in obtaining HIV/AIDS medications. Drugs covered by the program are listed on the North Dakota Reimbursable Medication List at www.ndhiv.com or are available from a case manager. Emergency Assistance. Provides short-term financial assistance for essential basic living needs. Emergency funds are for limited amounts, limited uses, and limited periods of time. Other Assistance. Continuation of insurance coverage provides payment of health insurance premiums for existing policies for someone at risk of losing coverage due to an inability to pay. 2 ND Dept. of Health 3 Patient Assistance Programs for HIV Medications Pharmaceutical companies that have medication assistance programs for HIV-infected patients who are unable to afford the cost of their medications are listed below.

HIV Prevention Program North Dakota Community Action Partnerships HIV Prevention Program offers education materials and risk-reduction supplies in the form of Safer Sex Kits to at-risk populations in all eight locations. They also provide free counseling and testing at five sites to individuals at risk for or diagnosed with HIV. Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS (HOPWA) / Tri-State HELP Program HOPWA is known as Tri-State HELP (Housing Environments for Living Positively) in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana. The three states partnered together to receive federal funding through Housing and Urban Development. Each state administers their own program and provides access to affordable housing for people with HIV/AIDS and their families by assisting with rental payments, short- or long- term. Applicants must meet income, residency, and diagnosis requirements. All Community Action Agencies provide this service. Case Management Community Action Agencies provide general case management to low- income households but also provide two types of case management directly related to HIV/AIDS. These are HIV Prevention Case Management (PCM) and case management for the RWTII/ND CARES Program. HIV Prevention Case Management (PCM) PCM is a type of risk-reduction case management for people who have HIV/AIDS and for those who are at high risk for contracting HIV. The main components of PCM are risk behavior assessment; medical and psychosocial needs assessment; risk-reduction counseling; and connecting the person with the appropriate services if needed. This North Dakota Community Action HIV/AIDS Program 11 service will be offered through various Community Action Agencies; contact your local agency to see if this service is offered in your area. RWTII/ND CARES Community Action provides case management for those receiving assistance from the North Dakota Department of Health's RWTII/ND CARES Program. Case management provided through the Community Action agencies focuses on social services case management. This case management includes networking with community support services, addressing transportation and housing needs, providing emergency assistance, and other individual needs. Contact the local Community Action Agency for information on the RWTII/ND CARES Program in your area.

Public benefit and income replacement programs are funded by federal, state, and local governments, and may be available to person's living with AIDS. A review of the following list of public benefit programs may be useful regardless of the financial resources. Some public benefits programs are needs-based, which means that one may only be able to get benefits if income and assets are below a certain level. Other public benefits programs, such as Social Security disability, are not needs-based and ability to receive these benefits may depend upon other factors, such as past work history. Often, a person may be entitled to assistance from several programs at the same time. Thus, one should consider the best packages of programs for which a person may be eligible. An individual may need to go to two or three places to apply for the different benefits to which they are entitled. The following is a brief description of the programs that may be available. Please note that eligibility requirements for these public benefit programs vary widely, are often complicated, and change frequently. Application procedures can be confusing and difficult, especially for someone already weakened by illness. An individual who encounters difficulties understanding these programs should seek help from social workers at the hospital or local legal services agencies. Persons expecting to apply for public benefits at some future time should be careful about transferring assets to another person. Many needs-based programs will reject an applicant under certain circumstances if the applicant has given assets away in a certain specified time period before application. There are exceptions to this rule, so it is important that contact be made with an attorney to make sure that assets can be transferred without jeopardizing eligibility of public benefits. Social Security Disability The federal Social Security Administration (SSA) has a Social Security disability insurance program for people who have paid into Social Security throughout their years of employment. The amount of benefits depends upon years worked and past earnings. To qualify, it is necessary to show that a medical condition prevents working in any kind of work for a North Dakota Social Services 18 ND Social Services 19 minimum of twelve months. Persons with HIV should try to get a doctor's statement attesting to their disability, including documentation and testimony about mental disorders, emaciation, diarrhea, fatigue, and pain. There is a five month waiting period, beginning when the disability began, before Social Security Disability Benefits are received. After 24 months of receiving Social Security Disability, a person is entitled to receive Medicare to help pay medical bills. For additional information, call (800) 772-1213. For more information on how Social Security defines and determines disability and how it applies to people with HIV infection, ask for a copy of the pamphlet \"Social Security for People Living with HIV/AIDS,\" or view it online at http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10019.html. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) SSI, like Social Security Disability is administered by the Social Security Administration. It is intended for those with low income. To qualify for SSI an individual must meet the same disability test as for Social Security Disability and have financial need. To meet the financial need criteria, one must have no more than $564 in monthly income, but not all income counts and exclusions may apply. There is an online questionnaire available at http://best.ssa.gov to pre-determine eligibility which takes 5-10 minutes to complete. Generally, if a person or household is eligible for food stamps they would be eligible for SSI benefits. As noted above, the Social Security Administration has determined that persons with AIDS may be entitled to presumptive disability, and thus should be able to get benefits relatively quickly. There is no waiting period for SSI as there is for Social Security Disability. Having SSI is not an automatic allowance for Medicaid in North Dakota but is a good indicator for likely Medicaid approval. If a person has a relatively brief work history, he/she may be eligible for both Social Security Disability and SSI benefits. SSI and Social Security Disability are two very separate programs. A person can apply for both programs. The application process can be initiated by telephone - call (800) 772-1213 or through the local SSA office. Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) TANF is available to individuals whose income and assets fall below a certain level. It is most commonly provided to single parent families, but is also available to two-parent households in which one parent is disabled ND Social Services 20 or incapacitated for 30 days or more. The amount of the TANF benefit depends on the size and composition of the household. The income guidelines for TANF are dependent upon many different factors including earned and unearned income, child care, and medical expenses. Contact the local county Social Services office for more information or to determine eligibility. Food Stamps The Food Stamp Program is funded by the Federal Government and is intended to supplement the nutrition purchasing power of low income households. The amount of food stamp benefits depends upon income, household composition, and disability status. The maximum benefit for a single person with no income is currently $141 per month. A person may be eligible for food stamps even if they have too much income to qualify for SSI or TANF. Income guidelines, like those for TANF, are dependent upon many factors including earned and unearned income, child care, and medical expenses. Expedited food stamps are available within seven days of application for those with little or no income. Contact the local county Social Service office for more information or to determine eligibility. Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program LIHEAP is a program to help meet home heating costs. Funds are available for home heating fuel expenses; crisis intervention (e.g. utility shutoffs, furnace repairs, etc); and weatherization. The benefit amount depends on many factors including the type of fuel used, the number of persons in the household, and number of bedrooms in the house. Income guidelines for LIHEAP count all income including TANF, child support, and Veterans benefits. This is a seasonal program that runs from October 1st to June 30th of each year. Contact the local county Social Service office for more information or to determine eligibility. Unemployment Compensation Initially, in order to receive unemployment compensation, an individual must be \"out of work\" through no fault of his/her own. A disqualification is imposed if the individual quits employment or is discharged for cause connected with the work. An individual who leaves employment due to illness or injury caused or aggravated by employment, may be eligible provided certain conditions are met. They include, leaving upon the written notice of a physician, notifying the employer of the reason for leaving, and having no reasonable alternative but to leave employment. ND Social Services 21 Additionally, the individual must be able to work at the time the claim is initiated to be eligible for unemployment benefits. This means that the individual must be able to perform some type of work that he/she is reasonably suited for based on prior experience and/or training and the individual has a reasonable chance of obtaining such employment. An individual who was able to work when the claim was initiated, and later become unable to work, may continue to receive unemployment benefits. Contact the nearest Job Service office for further information. Medicaid For people living with HIV/AIDS and for those who provide their care, Medicaid provides a safety net. Medicaid pays medical bills for people who do not have enough money or insurance coverage to pay their own. As with SSI, people who have an AIDS diagnosis are presumed to be disabled for purposes of Medicaid. Medicaid will pay 100% of all covered medically necessary services, except they may be charged a small amount, called a co-payment, each time the medical services were received. The co-payments range form $1 to $75. Medicaid is available back to the date of application and three months prior if the applicant has previous medical bills and would have been eligible had he/she applied on the date the medical service was received. Many people who have HIV/AIDS become disabled as a result of their illness. At that point, they become eligible for SSI payments and consequently, may be eligible for Medicaid. Under Medicaid a person may be liable for a portion of their medical bills, this is called recipient liability. Recipient liability is determined each month, based on the countable income a person receives each month, allowable deductions and the income level for one of $520. SSI income is not usually counted. People who have HIV/AIDS may qualify for Medicaid for reasons unrelated to their illness by meeting the usual categorical and financial tests for Medicaid eligibility. The Medicaid program is jointly administered and financed by the federal and state governments. For more information about Medicaid or to learn the location of the nearest Medicaid office, call the North Dakota Department of Human Services, Medicaid Services, at (800) 755-2604 or (701) 328-2321. ND Social Services 22 Medicare Medicare pays some medical bills for Social Security Disability recipients after two years. It is split into two parts, Part A and Part B. Part A pays hospital insurance and Part B is a supplementary medical insurance under Medicare. In addition, people who return to work are able to buy continued Medicare coverage when their premium-free Medicare ends due to work activity. Home Health is a Medicare program for those recipients that are home-bound. Home Health To qualify for Medicare home health benefits, an individual must be home bound, receiving services under a plan of care established and periodically reviewed by a physician, be in need of skilled nursing care on an intermittent basis, physical therapy, speech-language pathology, or have a continuing need for occupational therapy. An individual is considered home bound if he/she has a normal inability to leave home and leaving home requires a considerable and taxing effort. Occasional absences from the home are acceptable if they are infrequent and of short duration.

I understand that a small amount of either blood or oral fluid will be collected for laboratory testing. If a blood specimen is required, the specimen will be collected by placing a needle in a vein - a procedure known medically as venipuncture. I understand this is a test for antibodies to HIV, not a test for AIDS. A positive HIV antibody test means that I have been infected with HIV and my immune system has produced the antibody that attacks the virus. A positive antibody test means the virus is in my system and it could be transmitted to other people. The North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Microbiology, conducts three tests on the specimen to verify positive HIV test results. The Reporting Requirements: I understand that the test results may be disclosed to persons as indicated on the reverse of this form. I understand that persons involved with HIV antibody testing (e.g., private physician, hospital, HIV Counseling and Testing Sites) are required to report cases of HIV infection to the North Dakota Department of Health. If my test is positive for HIV, the following information will be reported: name, address, date of birth and gender. Action must be taken to ensure that a good faith effort be made to notify a spouse of a known HIV-infected patient that such spouse may have been exposed to HIV and should seek testing. A spouse is any individual who is the marriage partner of an HIV-infected patient, or who has been the marriage partner of the patient at any time within the 10-year period prior to the diagnosis of HIV infection. The spouse is informed of only the need for testing, not the source of the potential infection. I also understand that I may be contacted for purposes of obtaining names of individuals whom I may have exposed either through the sharing of intravenous drug needles or through sexual contact. The results of this test will be revealed to me in person only upon my return to the test site. Results will not be delivered by telephone or mail. I understand that all information will remain confidential except as 48 described. My written authorization is required for disclosure of test results beyond those exceptions. I have read and understand the information on this form. I have had the opportunity to ask questions and have received satisfactory explanations. ________________________________ ________________________ Client Date ________________________________ ________________________ Counselor Date DISCLOSURE CONSENT In the event expanded disclosure is requested by the client, this Disclosure Consent section must be completed.
