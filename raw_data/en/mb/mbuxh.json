The practice of veterinary aromatherapy remains unexplored as the sole book on this topic Grosjean's Veterinary Aromatherapy is based entirely on the traditional use of essential oils in humans. Most of the studies concerning the use of essential oils on animals have employed rats or mice; one cannot directly extrapolate results from one species to another. Important issues are olfactory variance and odour interpretation between species as well as the possibility (and toxicity) of accidental ingestion. This paper focuses on the use of distilled essential oils, whole herbs infused in fixed oils and the smaller amount of essential oils found in teas made through infusion and decoction methods as employed in EVM in British Columbia, Canada. Teas and commercial products included plants like compounds from plants have been used as a medicinal source for various diseases. Aromachology is a unique field that studies the olfactory effects after inhaling aromatic compounds. Aromatherapy is a complementary treatment methodology involving the use of essential oils containing phytoncides and other volatile organic compounds for various physical and mental illnesses. Phytoncides possess an inherent medicinal property. Their health benefits range from treating stress, immunosuppression, blood pressure, respiratory diseases, anxiety, and pain to anti-microbial, anti-larvicidal, anti-septic, anti-cancer effects, etc. Recent advancements in aromatherapy include forest bathing or forest therapy. The inhalation of phytoncide-rich forest air has been proven to reduce stress-induced immunosuppression, normalize immune function and neuroendocrine hormone levels, and, thus, restore physiological and psychological health. The intricate mechanisms related to how aroma converts int... International Journal of Plant Sciences Muzaffarnagar 2010 Since ancient times, the traditional system of medicine has become aroused the scientific curiosity of the common people, giving birth to an indian medical system called Ayurveda. Compilations of culinary herbs, Charaka and Susruta gave a detailed description of the plants, their properties, extraction techniques to get the active compound and procedures for ingestion of the medicine for effective treatment of various illness or disorder. The Indian knowledge of medicinal properties of herbs is reported in the charak sanhita, believed to be written 3000 years ago. The medicinal plants could grow in plenty across the country in every where. India has been considered as treasure house of valuable medicinal and aromatic plant species. These plants have been used over the thousands year for human welfare in the promotion of health as drugs and fragrance materials. They play an important role in the health care of about 80% of world population. The rest 20% also dependent substantially o... International Journal of Aromatherapy 2001 2010 Journal of Essential Oil Research 2012 2020 The history of using essential oils is extremely long but the scientific studies at the chemical compound level are still in need. Essential oils have been used in three different ways: using diffusers, which will use the olfactory system primarily; drinking, which will use primarily the digestive system; and topical application, which will enter primarily through the skin. Various effects of essential oils have been reported so far. These diversity in the influences of essential oils could be due to 1) different chemical compounds or combination of different chemical compounds used, or 2) the differences in the routes (olfactory, skin, gut-intestine) the same essential oil activated, which suggest that different routes activate different receptors and thus different chemical signaling pathways. We need to consider these different routes as well as the differences in the chemical compounds in studying the influences of essential oils. It is also very important to conduct studies at ... International Journal of Molecular Sciences Essential oils have been used in multiple ways, i.e., inhaling, topically applying on the skin, and drinking. Thus, there are three major routes of intake or application involved: the olfactory system, the skin, and the gastro-intestinal system. Understanding these routes is important for clarifying the mechanisms of action of essential oils. Here we summarize the three systems involved, and the effects of essential oils and their constituents at the cellular and systems level. Many factors affect the rate of uptake of each chemical constituent included in essential oils. It is important to determine how much of each constituent is included in an essential oil and to use single chemical compounds to precisely test their effects. Studies have shown synergistic influences of the constituents, which affect the mechanisms of action of the essential oil constituents. For the skin and digestive system, the chemical components of essential oils can directly activate gamma aminobutyric acid... IJAPR 2018 Volatile oils are concentrated odorous essences extracted from various plant parts such as flowers, fruits, heart-wood, rhizome and leaves. They are frequently employed in food flavoring, perfume, medicine and aromatherapy. Essential oils are extracted from various processes such as hydro distillation, effleurage and eucelle depending upon the plant part containing the essential oil. Essential oils are inhaled in the form of fine mist of vapour through aromatherapy and some of them are highly beneficial when ingested. These oils have been used traditionally for preservation of foods, spices and condiments. Essential oils or ethereal oils are natural, complex, multi-component, highly concentrated essences of aromatic plant systems composed mainly of terpenes units in addition to some other non-terpene components. These units biosynthesized by mevalonic acid pathway. Isoprenes/hemi-terpenes are five carbon compound having two unsaturated bonds. In this review paper an attempt has been done to emphasize the most valuable essential oils of Indian origin from nature with focus particularly on the chemical constituents, medicinal and pharmacological usage of volatile oils.
