DETAILS: June 29: Vaccines: Autism and Other Myths - Solving today's public health crisis Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D., professor of pediatrics and molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine. COVID-19 has impacted our lives in ways never thought imaginable. Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D., dean of the Baylor School of Medicine National School of Tropical Medicine, will discuss a history of vaccines, COVID-19 vaccine development, the anti-vax movement, and his personal story as the father of a daughter with autism. The progress made by organizations like UNICEF, GAVI and the World Health Organization to eliminate major childhood diseases has stalled due in part to an aggressive anti-vax movement. A campaign based on pseudo-science and misinformation has brought the return of the measles to the U.S. and Europe and prevented many children from receiving HPV vaccines for cervical cancer. In addition, the convergence of wars, political conflicts and climate change are causing a rise in preventable illnesses in developing countries. To understand the anti-vax movement and debunk the myths tied to this potential public health crisis, Hotez will share his concept of a new \"vaccine diplomacy.\" Hotez is an elected member of both the National Academy of Medicine and American Academy of Arts & Sciences, and the author of 500 scientific papers. The lecture is free, however [registration](https://events.r20.constantcontact.com/register/eventReg?oeidk=a07eh399oxy987adb2c&oseq=&c=&ch=) is requested.

All current ticket holders as of March 12 will be provided the opportunity for a refund. Please contact [Portland'5](https://www.portland5.com/newmark-theatre/events/neuroscience-pleasure) for instructions. Larry Sherman, Ph.D., professor in the Division of Neuroscience at OHSU's Oregon National Primate Research Center. Listening to beautiful music, falling in love and eating really good chocolate create intense feelings of pleasure - but why? Sherman, joined by the Portland Chamber Orchestra and singer Naomi LaViolette, presents a fascinating multimedia discussion and concert on how the brain experiences pleasure. Diving into exciting new research - including what happens to the brain when love goes awry - and what we can learn from the monogamous prairie vole, Sherman mixes music, humor and neuroscience. This lecture and performance will include a 15-minute intermission and end at 9 p.m. [Tickets](https://www.portland5.com/newmark-theatre/events/neuroscience-pleasure) are available for purchase. Machines and the Mind: Advances in brain-computer interface---This event has been canceled. All current ticket holders as of March 12 will be provided the opportunity for a refund. Please contact [Portland'5](https://www.portland5.com/newmark-theatre/events/neuroscience-pleasure) for instructions. Leigh Hochberg, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Center for Neurotechnology and Neurorecovery at Massachusetts General Hospital Hochberg shares the latest advancements in brain-computer interface systems. His pioneering BrainGate clinical trials demonstrate how these technologies could provide communication and mobility for people with paralysis. With these groundbreaking tools, Hochberg presents a path to unlocking minds that have been, up until now, trapped by their condition.
