Many pre- and postnatal factors influence the development of the gut-barrier, which is composed of the microbiota, the mucus, the epithelial layer and the mucosal immune system. Even minor disturbances during barrier development can have consequences for health far into adulthood. Here we critically discuss the current knowledge on which pre- and postnatal factors influence development, maturation, and maintenance of the gut immune barrier. Human milk has a unique composition and is the gold standard for adequate development of the intestinal immune barrier. Not only the influence of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) but also that of glycoproteins (HMGPs) is reviewed. We discuss the influence of maternal genetic factors, such as the secretor and Lewis phenotypes on breast milk fucosylation and sialylation of HMOs and HMGPs. This diversity in HMOs and HMPGs influences microbiota composition and also the development of the immune barrier. Cow milk-derived infant formula is often being used as an alternative for human breast milk. The consequences of this for proper development of the intestinal immune barrier and, in particular, the differences in the type of oligosaccharides and glycosylation patterns (sialic and fucose composition) between cow and human milk are critically discussed. Current and prospective strategies to promote proper gut-immune maturation are proposed. These might include more personalized infant formulas when breast milk is not an option. Keywords: functional properties, HMOs, human milk glycoproteins, infant formula, intestinal barrier Introduction The gastrointestinal immune barrier is considered to be the gatekeeper of the human body. The intestinal immune barrier is responsible for the passage and absorption of nutrients but also functions as a barricade for pathogens to enter the human body. In addition, it regulates the crosstalk between the luminal microbiota and macromolecules and maintains tolerance and immune responses (K \u00a8onig et al., 2016; Takiishi, Morales-Fenero, Olsen, & Camara, 2017). Directly after birth this gatekeeper function of the intestinal barrier is not fully developed yet and, therefore, this period after birth is considered to be a vulnerable period for disease development. Any disruption of the neonatal gut barrier function has been found to have long-term effects and may play a role in the development of gastrointestinal infections (Halpern & Denning, 2015) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Also, it can influence the development of other diseases during childhood and adulthood, such as obesity (Argenio & Salvatore, 2015) and allergies (Groschwitz & Hogan, 2011).

Direct inquiries to author Figueroa-Lozano (E-mail: f.s.gueroa.lozano@umcg.nl ).these diseases remains to be fully elucidated, multiple factors, such as nutrition (Jacobi & Odle, 2012), feeding practice (O'Sullivan, Farver, & Smilowitz, 2015), microbial colonization (Houghteling & Walker, 2015), delivery mode (Rutayisire, Huang, Liu, & Tao, 2016), maternal genetic factors and immunity (Ganal-Vonarburg, Fuhrer, & Gomez de Ag \u00a8uero, 2017), and host-genetic factors (Ussar, Fujisaka, & Kahn, 2016) are considered to be crucial to shape the gut microbiota and the gastrointestinal immune response. In the vulnerable period after birth, the mother supports the gas- trointestinal barrier of the newborn by sharing its immune system with the baby by supplying antibodies, cytokines, chemokines, hormones, and even leucocytes in breast milk (Cacho & Lawrence, 2017). However, during recent years it has also been shown that proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates in breast milk can contribute to the nonspecic defense against pathogens (Jakaitis & Denning, 2014). Proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates in breast milk modulate immune responses to self- and nonself-antigens, orchestrate mi- crobial colonization, and drive the morphological and immuno- logical maturation of the gut barrier (Turfkruyer & Verhasselt, 2015). Particularly, milk carbohydrates have emerged recently as essential molecules from human milk that protect the newborn from infections and educate the immune barrier system in early life (Smilowitz, Lebrilla, Millis, German, & Freeman, 2014).

T o this end, we rst review the di- verse barriers that exist in the intestine and the crosstalk between these barrier components that together form the human intesti-nal gatekeeper. Next, we review and critically discuss the current knowledge according to pre- and postnatal factors influence devel- opment, maturation, and maintenance of the gut immune barrier.We focus not only on the role of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which have been reviewed in many papers (Holscher, & Tappenden, \u00a8onnerdal, 2003). Cow milk- derived infant formula is often being used as an alternative for human breast milk. The consequences of this for proper devel- opment of the intestinal immune barrier, and in particular the differences in the type of oligosaccharides and glycosylation pat-terns (sialic and fucose composition) between cow and human milk, are critically discussed. Finally, we discuss the influence of maternal genetic factors that affect the fucosylation and sialylationon HMO and HMGP diversities and the associated differences in microbiota composition and development of the immune barrier. Intestinal Barrier The intestinal barrier has primarily the function to absorb nu- trients while at the same time prevent undesired molecules and organisms to enter the organism. The barrier has evolved intoa complex multilayer system to appropriately fulll this function (Scaldaferri, Pizzoferrato, Gerardi, Lopetuso, & Gasbarrini, 2012). The human intestinal barrier can be seen or categorized as mi-crobial, physical/chemical, and immunological barriers, which are under tight control of the enteric nervous system (Figure 1). The different components interact with each other and have, at thesame time, specic functions which contribute to the homeostasis of the infant gut. Microbial barrier The microbial barrier develops rapidly after birth. It starts with colonization with the maternal microbiota. This microbiota is an indispensable component of the gut intestinal barrier. The micro- biota forms a barrier for pathogens that can adhere to the intestinalwall, but the microbiota can also change the microenvironment making adhesion of undesired intruders impossible (Gritz & Bhandari, 2015). Unlike the adult microbiota, the infant micro-biota is highly susceptible during the rst 1 to 2 years of life to environmental changes (Weng & Walker, 2013). Disturbances may lead to changes in composition and microbiota diversity(Yang et al., 2016). The adult gut can host up to 1000 bacterial species. This is currently the total amount identied worldwide in diverse individuals (Argenio & Salvatore, 2015). The neonate isduring the rst weeks of life only populated by 15% of the adult species (Gritz & Bhandari, 2015). Also, products made by the microbiota are essential for the ad- equacy of the intestinal immune barrier. Fermentation products from gut bacteria, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are im- mune regulating and serve as nutrients for epithelial cells (Irapordaet al., 2015). Fermentation products, such as SCFA also affect other functions of the gut barrier, such as proliferation and differentia- tion of immune cells (Blotti \u00b4ere, Buecher, Galmiche, & Cherbut, 2003), enhance gut motility that can lead to expedited disposal of pathogens via the fecal route (Karaki & Kuwahara, 2010; Vadder, Kovatcheva-Datchary, & B \u00a8ackhed, 2016), and strengthen- ing of the tight junctions between gut epithelium (Ohata, Usami, Ph, & Miyoshi, 2005).Physical and chemical barrier The intestinal epithelial cells create a physical and biochemical barrier that separates the microbiota from the gut epithelium, and at the same time facilitates the crosstalk between the microbes, immune, and nervous system (Y oo & Mazmanian, 2017). The physical barrier refers to the columnar epithelial cells that separate the lumen from the lamina propria (Groschwitz &Hogan, 2011). The layer is mostly composed of enterocytes and secretory intestinal epithelial cells which include Paneth, and enteroendocrine cells (Okumura & Takeda, 2017). Theintegrity of the gut barrier depends on the ability of entero- cytes to maintain the gut permeability and induce oral toler- ance (Snoeck, Goddeeris, & Cox, 2005). The permeability of the epithelium relies on a network of desmosomes, adherens junctions, and tight junctions that regulate the passage of flu-ids, nutrients, and micro/macromolecules from the lumen to the submucosa or vice versa (Arrieta, Bistritz, & Meddings, 2006). The proteins that form the adherens junctions and desmo-somes are formed by cadherin-catenin complexes, whereas tight junctions are formed by occludins, claudins, junctional adhesion molecules, and tricellulin (Anderson, 2001). Alterations in the for-mation of these networks result in epithelial barrier dysfunction (F\u00a8orster, 2008). The expression of the proteins that form the tight junctions is known to be modulated by cytokines, microbiota, and im- mune cells (Groschwitz & Hogan, 2011). Likewise, food com-ponents have been found to increase or reduce gut permeability in vit ro and in vivo (Kosi \u00b4nska & Andlauer, 2013; D. Ulluwishewa et al., 2011). Isolated food components, such as nondigestibleoligosaccharides (Akbari et al., 2017), bovine lactoferrin (J. catechin) (Suzuki & Hara, 2011) have shown to protect the in- testinal barrier from inflammation and oxidative stress associatedto tight junction opening. In contrasts, food components, such as deoxynivalenol, a contaminant of cereals, can cause perme- ability changes by altering the expression of claudins (Pinton etal., 2009). Food additives, such as sucrose monoester (Mine & Zhang, 2003), and synthetic surfactants, such as cremophor EL or sodium taurocholate (Hamid, Katsumi, Sakane, & Yamamoto, 2009), dis-turb the tight junction distribution. The understanding of how food components can modulate the permeability of the gut bar- rier by altering gene expression is relevant because it has given newinsights on the impact of this feature in health and disease (Smyth, 2017). Furthermore, it has open opportunities to use this knowl- edge for therapeutical interventions (Odenwald & Turner, 2016).For instance, capsaicin may improve the paracellular transport of drugs that are poorly absorbed (M. Kaiser, Chalapala, Gorzelanny, Perali, & Goycoolea, 2016), whereas specic prebiotic carbohy-drates have the ability to ameliorate the symptoms of patients with \"leaky gut\" (Akbari et al., 2015). The chemical barrier consists of the mucus layer that separates the epithelium from the microbiota and luminal content. The mucus layer is mostly formed by the secretory products from goblet, Paneth, and enteroendocrine cells (L. W . Peterson & Artis,2014). The most abundant component of the mucus layer are mucins, which are large glycoproteins synthesized at the epithelial level, specically in the goblet cells (Birchenough, Johansson,Gustafsson, & Hansson, 2015). Goblet cells secrete other proteins that maintain the integrity of the mucus barrier (TFF3, CLCA1), 122 Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food SafetyrVol.18,2019 C/circlecopyrt2018 Institute of Food Technologists\u00aeOligosaccharides and glycoconjugates content . . Figure 1-Anatomy of the intestinal barrier. The gastrointestinal tract is composed of different barriers that interact with each other. These components can be categorized as microbial, physical/chemical and immunological barriers, which are under control of the nervous system/ENS. The microbial layer in the proximal colon is composed of two mucus layers. The microbiota and the metabolic products from their digestion interact with all the other components of the gut barrier. The physical barrier is formed by enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth and enteroendocrine cells (EECs), wh ich secrete a broad array of molecules that facilitate the separation between barrier but at the same time facilitate the cross-talk between components. In the lamina propria many immunological cells reside in the Peyer's patches and lymphoid tissue. These immune cells are in close contact with the glia and neurons in the submucosa and myenteric plexus. regulate susceptibility to colonic inflammation (RELM), and maintain the separation between the microbial bed and the epithelial layer (ZG16) (Birchenough et al., 2015). The goblet cells not only produce mucus, they also have an active role in the gate-keeping function by delivering luminal content to dendritic cells (Pelaseyed et al., 2014), and by regulating immune responses (Johansson & Hansson, 2014). The mucus layer separates intestinal compartments but also provides substrate for growth of bacteria. In return, gut microor- ganisms and their fermentation products alter the composition and gel properties of the mucus (Jakobsson et al., 2014). There is a continuous crosstalk between the microbiota, luminal products, and goblet cells. For example, luminal dietary components (Bhatia et al., 2015), or cytokines derived from the epithelium can alter the secretory function of the goblet cells (Johansson et al., 2014). Paneth cells are abundant in the small intestine and can be found in the proximal but not distal colon (Simmonds, Furman, Karanika, Phillips, & Bates, 2014). Their function is to secrete antimicrobial components, such as lysozymes, (Gassler, 2017). These molecules modulate the proliferation of microbial communities along the intestine and act by stimulating pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as T oll-like receptors al., 2017). Such activations elicit immune pathways that maintain the intestinal epithelial integrity (Halpern & Denning, 2015). Food components have been ob- served to alter the secretion of Paneth cells. In experiments with mice, the consumption of a high-fat diet, altered the composition of the microbiota and the expression of antimicrobial peptides by the Paneth cells, stimulating intestinal inflammation (Guo et al., 2017). Finally, the enteroendocrine cells (EECs) contribute to barrier function. EECs comprise only 1% of the epithelial cell layer and its population is generally less diverse in the colon than in the small intestine (Gunawardene, Corfe, & Staton, 2011). There are at least 15 subtypes of EECs that secrete regulatory factors, such as glucagon-like peptide, vasoactive inhibitory peptide, and gastric inhibitory peptides that modulate gut motility, gut transit, and food intake (Hooper, 2015). EECs play a pivotal role in sensing luminal components derived from diet. These intestinal hormones signal for intestinal satiety (Posovszky & Wabitsch, 2015). TLRs reside also on the surface of EECs and because of these, they are considered to operate also as immune sensors (Bogunovic et al., 2007). Many studies suggest that dysfunctional EECs function make the intestine prone to inflammatory disorders (Moran, Leslie, Levison, & Mclaughlin, 2008). C/circlecopyrt2018 Institute of Food Technologists\u00aeVol.18,2019rComprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety 123Oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates content . . . Immunological barrier The immunological barrier consists of cells, such as activated T- cells, mast-, plasma-, dendritic- cells, and macrophages that are in constant communication with the epithelial cells to sense immune status and secrete cytokines that prevent, for instance, invasion ofpathogens (Groschwitz & Hogan, 2011). The crosstalk between the luminal side and the immune barrier counter regulates anti- inflammatory responses in order to maintain the balance betweenimmune defense and tolerance. An altered cytokine environment might translate to a pro-inflammatory response when pathogens are sensed. In intestinal inflammatory diseases a Th1-polarizedactivation has been observed (Strober & Fuss, 2011). In these pa- tients the presence of high levels of TNF and IFN increases gut permeability by inhibiting the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) phosphorylation (Cunningham & Turner, 2012). This process is key to maintain tight junction integrity and thus barrier function.Therefore, such inhibition increases gut permeability (Wang et al., 2005). Role of nervous system in barrier integrity The permeability of the intestinal epithelial lining is regulated by a network of glia and neurons called the enteric nervous sys-tem (ENS) which is located in the submucosa and the myenteric plexus. The ENS regulates many gastrointestinal functions: water, electrolytes), epithelial transport, motil-ity, microvascular circulation, vascular tone, release of hormones, and immunological defense (Rao & Gershon, 2016). The reg- ulation by the ENS is autonomous in certain aspects (Y oo &Mazmanian, 2017). The glia and myobroblasts secrete neuro- transmitters and even cytokines that facilitate the communication with the epithelium, promote epithelial growth, and contribute tothe maintenance of gut-barrier function by regulating the tight-junction-associated proteins (Puzan, Hosic, Ghio, & Koppes, 2018). Alterations in the regulatory mechanism actions of the ENS have been shown to be directly associated to the development ofintestinal and neurological disorders (Cani & Knauf, 2016), illus- trating its essential role in gut barrier development. This process begins at birth. T ogether with the microbial, physical, chemical,and immunological barrier, the ENS (re)wires connections and adapts rapidly to the fast changing microenvironment in the gut during the rst 2 weeks of the postnatal period (Hao et al., 2013).This adaptation process remains active during later life, by continu- ously reshaping the nervous responses upon changes in microbiota composition and changes in dietary habits (Heuckeroth & Sch \u00a8afer, 2016). Glia and enteric neurons can to changes in micro- by TLRs. Enteric glia and neurons express TLR-4 andTLR-7 that recognize LPS from Gram-negative bacteria and viral RNA, respectively (Barajon et al., 2009). Furthermore, microbial metabolism products can increase nerve density in the submucosa(Kabouridis & Pachnis, 2015). Nutrition is important for adequate development of the ENS and it has been shown that cytokines, growth factors in human milk as well as neurotrophic factors shapethe ENS (Fichter et al., 2011). Culturing myenteric plexus from newborn rats with breast milk showed differences in the amounts of neuronal networks and neuronal densities compared to cultureswithout breast milk (Sch \u00a8afer, Ginneken, & Copray, 2009). Diet can also influence the production of the hormone serotonin (5- HT), which is responsible for the modulation of mood, sleep, andcognition at the CNS. Although 5-HT is produced in the brain and accumulate in platelets, 80% of the 5-HT secretion occurs inthe gastrointestinal tract where it regulates the motility and the secretory function of the intestine. Studies in patients with IBD and healthy controls showed that the depletion of the natural pre-cursor for the biosynthesis of 5-HT, tryptophan, had an impact in the ENS, affecting for instance visceral perception, pain and, diarrhea episodes (Kilkens, Honig, Van Nieuwenhoven, Riedel,& Brummer, 2004). Pre- and Postnatal Events Involved in Intestinal Barrier Maturation In order to achieve an operational response in the gut many temporal and spatial factors interact to induce homeostasis of thegut barrier function. Here we cluster these factors in four groups: nutrition, microbial colonization and maternal (genetic and non- genetics) factors, and host genetic factors (Figure 2). Nutrition Nutrition by breast feeding. As the needs of the gastrointesti- nal immune system change rapidly during the rst days of life, the composition, abundance, and diversity of glycans and protein glycosylation in breast milk varies during lactation. Human milkglycans are present as free human milk or as glycoproteins (HMGPs) and glycolipids (HMGLs) (Smilowitz et al., 2014). HMOs are made of linear or branched monosac-charides, such as glucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, fucose, and sialic acid (Lars Bode, 2012). HMOs have a lactose core and are enzymatically elongated by 1-3 and 1-6 linkages to units of lacto-N-biose and N-acetyllactosamine, respectively. The HMOs are further elongated by the addition at the terminal positions of units of fucose and sialic acid (Figure 3). The fucose units arelinked by 1-2,1-3, or 1-4 bonds, whereas sialic acid residues are linked by 2-3 or 2-6 bonds. In term breast milk 35-50% of are 12-14% nonfucosylated neutral HMOs (T otten et al., 2012). These structures are indigestible for the neonate and can reach the colon without being digested and serve as substrate for the im- mature microbiota (Davis et al., 2016). However, HMOs modulate the maturation of the intestinal barrier at more levels. Thanks totheir diverse and complex glycosylation pattern HMOs promote enterocyte differentiation (Holscher, Davis, & Tappenden, 2014), induce indirectly the production of mucus (Cornick, Tawiah, &Chadee, 2015), and serve as decoy for pathogenic microorgan- isms (L Bode, 2015). Some Bidobacteria strains can metabolize HMOs, such as 2-fucosyllactose (2'-FL), whereas other strains ofspecies consume other types of HMOs. The utilization of 2'- FL pathways by Bidobacteria has shown to alter the prole of metabolites produced and to shape the infant intestinal microbiota(Matsuki et al., 2016; Underwood et al., 2015), The posttranslational modication that attaches a glycan to a protein backbone is called glycosylation. Glycans can be covalentlyattached to a ( O-glycosylation) of glycopro- teins is determined genetically, the glycan decoration does notfollow a xed template, which results in a diverse array of possible glycoprotein structures (Froehlich et al., 2011). For instance, a pro- tein with three active glycosylation sites and ten different glycansin each site can display at least 1000 different glycoforms of the protein (Nagae & Yamaguchi, 2012). There is growing evidence that this diversity in milk glycoproteins is functional and essentialfor immune recognition. The structural diversity in glycosylation determines the function of the glycoprotein and type of immune 124 Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food SafetyrVol.18,2019 C/circlecopyrt2018 Institute of Food Technologists\u00aeOligosaccharides and glycoconjugates content . . .

Current insight in the interplay between genetic and nongenetic factors fr om the mother and the infant in the intestinal barrier development. response that is induced (Figure 4A and B) (Molinari, Casadio, Hartmann, Arthur, & Hartmann, 2013). Glycosylation affects many characteristics of the glycoprotein, such as the inter- and intra-cellular signaling (Zhao et al., 2008), proper folding (Kleizen & Braakman, 2004), solubility, protein and biological activity, pharmacokinetic prole, and structure stability (Y u et al., 2011). Glycosylation can limit the access of proteases, thereby improving the overall resis- tance of the molecule to proteolysis. The glycosylation pattern is responsible for which glycopeptides are produced (Nishiyama, Kimura, Uchida, Ochi, & Yamaguchi, 2000). the intestinal bar- rier these glycopeptides can resemble HMOs and serve as growth substrate for gut bacteria (Liepke et al., 2002). Most commen- sal bacteria, such as Bidobacterium and Bacteroides, are equipped with endoglycosidases and able to further cleave the glycans from the glycoproteins and glycopeptides and use them as substrate for fermentation and growth (Marcobal & Sonnenburg, 2012). The HMOs and HMGPs composition and glycosylation varies during lactation. Colostrum typically contains in average 23 g/L of HMOs and it decreases to an average of 7 g/L in mature milk (Gabrielli et al., 2011). Some of the major HMGPs and their average concentrations in human milk are: & Newburg, 2013) (Table 2). During lactation the composition of breast milk and quantity of these molecules change (Froehlich et al., 2010). For instance, the lactoferrin content decreases from 5.8 g/L in colostrum to 2 in mature milk & Faure, 2001). Besides, the prole of glycosylation changes from day 1 to day 15 from less fucosylated to highly fucosylated structures (Barboza et al., 2012). The structures of more than 200 HMOs have been identied, whereas more than 400 HMGPs have been characterized in human milk (Picariello, Ferranti, Mamone, Roepstorff, & Addeo, 2008). The changes in concentration and composition during lactation vary accordingly with the infant developmental needs (Orczyk-Pawiowicz, Berghausen-Mazur, Hirnle, & K atnik- Prastowska, 2015). At the beginning of lactation the highlyfucosylated and sialylated structures of breast milk protect the gut from bacterial and viral infection by inhibiting pathogen adhesion, while promoting the colonization of benecial communities of bacteria (Lis-Kuberka, K atnik-Prastowska, Berghausen-Mazur, & Orczyk-Pawiowicz, 2015). The survival of neonatal gut micro- biota relies highly on the glycans present in human milk. HMOs, HMGPs, and HMGLs facilitate the adhesion of benecial bacteria to the mucus layer and act as decoy for pathogenic bacteria, parasites, or viruses promoting their clearance from the intestine. The type of HMGLs found in human milk are also known as glycosphingolipids (Figure 4C). These molecules consist of a ce- ramide moiety attached via an amide-linked acyl group to a glycan portion. Based on the type of glycan they are attached to, they are categorized as cerebrosides and gangliosides. In cerebrosides, the ceramide moiety is attached to an uncharged glycan, whereas in gangliosides the reducing terminal sialic acid (Hernell, Timby, Domell 2016). hydrophobicity to the molecule, the glycan por- tion confers charge to the glycosphingolipid (Merrill, 2011). They can be bound to macromolecules, such as human milk fat globule membrane (MFGM). While the ceramide portion is inserted in the lipidic layer, the glycans are exposed towards the hydrophilic environment (Lopez & M \u00b4enard, 2011). The total amount of gangliosides in mature human milk ranges from 1.6 to 68.6 mg/L (Ma et al., 2015). While 61-86% (0.9-20.3 mg/L) of the glycolipid composition in colostrum These changes in ganglioside composition during lactation are attributed to changes in the expression of glycosyltransferases in the mammary tissue. They confer protective effects to the intestinal and brain development of the neonate (Palmano, Rowan, Guillermo, Guan, & McJarrow, 2015) HMGLs prevent the adhesion of pathogens and bacterial toxins derived from microorganism, such as E. Coli and Giardia muris. HMGPs have shown antiviral ac- tivity against human respiratory syncytial virus and enterovirus 71 (R.

Lactose can be fucosylated or sialylated to from trisaccharides. (C) Additionally, lactose can be further elongated with Lacto- N-biose (LNB I) and N-acetyllactosamine (LNB para, iso-HMOs. oligosaccharides can undergo fucosylation or sialylation at different linkage positions, which in turn produce different isomeric form s: I with GlycoWorkbench 1.0. Fujii, & Koike, 2014). It has been reported that glycosphingolipids maintain intestinal tolerance by modulating dendritic cell matu- ration (Rueda, 2007). Besides, they support the colonization of the neonatal gut. Some Bidobacteria species can hydrolyze sialic acid from HMGLs and use it as growth substrate, whereas other species consume sialic acid only from HMOs (H. Lee, Garrido, Mills, & Barile, 2014).Cow-derived infant formula. According to UNICEF and the WHO, exclusive breastfeeding is recommend for the rst 6 months of life (WHO, 2006). However, according to their 2017 report not one country complies with this recommendation and considerable variations exist across regions. In Europe it is estimated that only 20 to 40% of infants between 0 to 5 months old are exclusively fed with breast milk. Many medical and social factors are responsible 126 Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food SafetyrVol.18,2019 C/circlecopyrt2018 Institute of Food Technologists\u00aeOligosaccharides and glycoconjugates content . . . Figure 4-Glyconjugates in human milk. (A) Many proteins, such as mucins in human milk are O-glycosylated. Unlike, N-glycans, O-glycans do not share a common core structure. The three cores structures depicted are present in different tissues. However, human milk contains only core 2 type structures (Wilson et al., 2008). (B) HMGPs are very heterogeneous. High mannose glycans contain unsubstituted terminal mannose units whereas on hybrid glycans, some mannose residues are substituted with an N-acetylglucosamine linkage. Complex glycans differ from the high mannose and the hybrid type because they do not contain mannose residues apart from those at the core structure. (C) Although HMGLs constitute a small fraction of the total lipid contained in human milk, they have a great impact on intestinal maturation and immunity. for this (Amaral et al., 2015). In those cases supplementation or substitution of breastfeeding with infant formulas prepared from cow milk is the most common alternative for breast milk (Stevens, Patrick, & Pickler, 2009). These cow milk-based infant formulas should mimic as much as possible, the nutritional and functional prole of human milk (Martin, Ling, & Blackburn, 2016). How- ever, the composition and patterns of oligosaccharides and glyco- sylation of proteins is different between human and bovine milk (Table 1). While the concentration of milk oligosaccharides in human colostrum is approximately 7 g/L, bovine colostrum contains only 1g/L of oligosaccharides, and this concentration decays rapidly af- ter 48 hours (Tao, Depeters, German, Grimm, & Lebrilla, 2009). Also, bovine milk GPs, such as lactoferrin, are found in lower con- centrations (0.02-0.035 g/L) compared with human milk (Cheng et al., 2008). In fact, lactoferrin is one of the most abundant gly- coproteins in human milk (Dallas et al., 2011).Table 1-Differences in human and cow milk composition.

The composition of bovine and human milk glycans varies also in complexity and composition. HMOs can be classied into 13 core groups. These cores are elongated by 1-3 or 1-6 linkages to lactosamine units (Zivkovic C/circlecopyrt2018 Institute of Food Technologists\u00aeVol.18,2019rComprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety 127Oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates content . . .

HMGPs concentration milk oligosaccharides (BMOs) or sialic acid. The composi- tion and variation, but also quantity, is lower compared to human milk. Neu5Gc is found in other mammals but not in humans due to the lack of the hydrolase that converts CMO-Neu5Ac to CMP- in cow but not in human colostrum (Van den Nieuwenhof, Schiphorst, Van Die, & Van den Eijnden, 1999). The reducing terminal sugar of the glycan chains determine its nature. Glycan chains containing fucose are classied as neutral oligosaccharides, whereas glycans with sialic acid as terminal sugar are classied as acidic oligosaccharides. In human milk, neutral oligosaccharides are more abundant than the acidic ones and the ratio of fucose is higher, whereas in cow milk acidic oligosaccha- rides predominate over neutral oligosaccharides and the amount of fucose is very low (Martin-Sosa, Martin, Garc \u00b4a-Pardo, & Hueso, 2003). As a result, the content of sialic acid in cow-derived for- mulas is less than 25% of the amount of sialic acid found in human milk (B. Wang, Brand-Miller, Mcveagh, & Petocz, 2001) and it contains trace amounts of fucose (Choi et al., 2015). These differences in fucose and sialic acid content have a great impact on neonate health. At birth, neonates have a reduced capacity for de novo synthesis of sialic acid and, for this reason, the intake of this compound from breast milk is essential (Sprenger & Duncan, 2012). Sialic acid is involved in the development of the gastrointestinal tract and of the nervous system, in pathogen adhe- and & Lagarda, 2016). Especially gut, sialic acid prevents the adhesion of pathogens and promotes the growth of Bidobacteria (Egan, Motherway, Ventura, & van Sinderen, 2014). From a nutritional point of view, sialic acid is crucial for immune and cognitive development (R \u00a8ohrig, Choi, & Baldwin, 2017). However, the presence of some glycans, such as the Gal (1-3)Gal epitope present in bovine glycoproteins and not in HMGPs, have been linked with undesirable effects, such as allergic reactions (Rispens, Derksen, Commins, Platts-Mills, & Aalberse, 2013). Likewise, fucosylated oligosaccharides have both indirect and di- rect effects on the intestinal barrier. Indirectly, fucose glycans exert defense mechanisms and promote gut maturation by supporting bidogenesis. The release of SCFAs by Bidobacterium stimulates gastrointestinal motility and development of the enteric nervous system (Bienenstock et al., 2013). The low amount of fucose in infant formula has been associated with the development of themicrobiota which then is signicantly different from that of infants fed with breast milk (Zivkovic, German, Lebrilla, & Mills, 2011). The differences in the type of oligosaccharides and glycosy- lation patterns among human milk and other species, such as bovines, have been speculated to be related to the system glycosi- dase/glycosyltransferases or to the enzymatic activity of epithelial cells (Nwosu et al., 2012). The effect of such differences is evi- denced by the maturation of the intestinal barrier in infants fed with human milk or infant formula. Infants fed with cow-derived formula have a risk of having a longer period of enhanced gut permeability and a delayed colonization of benecial bacterial communities (Stuebe, 2009). Because infant formulas differ substantially from human milk, efforts are continuously made to improve their composition (Bourlieu et al., 2017). As described above the addition of nondi- gestible carbohydrates (NDCs) to infant formula increases the pre- biotic value of the formulation. However, in order to mimic the content of fucose and sialic acid other compounds have to be added. Clinical studies have shown that the enrichment of infant formula with 2'-FL and lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) is well tol- erated by infants (Puccio 2017) and might compensate for some of the differences between bovine milk and human milk. T o com- pensate for the lack of sufcient amounts of sialic acid in cow infant formula, bovine whey is added to infant formula aiming to achieve sialic acid levels similar to human milk. However, it has been shown that the levels of sialic acid in infants from 0 to 6 months fed with infant formula supplemented with sialic acid were lower than the levels of sialic acid in infants fed with human milk (Claumarchirant et al., 2016). Short duration or lack of breastfeeding, and the introduction of formula feeding before 6 months of age has been found to increase gut permeability, induce a shift of gut microbial coloniza- tion towards an adult pattern, and allows the translocation of pro- inflammatory bacteria (Houghteling & Walker, 2015). Formula- fed infants are colonized with a more diverse flora that includes Escherichia coli, Clostridium difcile, and Bacteroides fragilis compared to breastfed (Penders et al., 2005). The abundance of Clostridium spp. is associated with the development of atopic dis- orders (Penders, Stobberingh, van den Brandt, & Thijs, 2007). Furthermore, formula-feeding is regarded to be a risk factor for the development of type 1 diabetes (Patelarou et al., 2012) and metabolic disorders (Stuebe, 2009). However, in many instances breastfeeding is not possible and cow milk formula is the only vi- able alternative. Since HMOs cannot be manufactured on a large scale, milk formulas are supplemented with NDCs that mimic the biological activities of HMOs (Chen & Michael, 2017; Nauta & Garssen, 2013). NDCs are fermented by gut microbiota reduc- ing the intestinal pH and favor the growth of Bidobacterium and reduce the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria (Bouhnik et al., 2004). Infant formulas are enriched with NDCs produced by enzymatic synthesis, such as of galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), 2018; Vandenplas, Greef, & Veereman, 2014). The difference among compounds is reflected in their monosaccharide compo- sition, branching, chain length, type of glycosidic linkage, and purity (Mussatto & Mancilha, 2007). Cow milk formulas cannot prevent specic infections in infants that are neutralized by HMOs in breast-fed children. Noroviruses is an example of that. This virus is an important cause of diarrhea in infants (Shang et al., 2013), which is neutralized in breast fed infants by HMOs that resemble histo-blood structure (Hanisch, Hansman, Morozov, Kunz, & Schroten, 2018). These 128 Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food SafetyrVol.18,2019 C/circlecopyrt2018 Institute of Food Technologists\u00aeOligosaccharides and glycoconjugates content . . . complex HMOs are not present in cow milk and, as a conse- quence, it has been found that infants fed with cow formula have a higher incidence of infectious diarrhea before the age of 4 months(Quigley, Kelly, & Sacker, 2007). Also among HMGPs, Lactoferrin is unique and has a broad spectrum of properties. This glycopro- tein interacts directly with the anionic lipid A from Gram-negativebacteria damaging the microorganism membrane (Latorre, Puddu, Valenti, & Gessani, 2010). Using the same mechanism, lactofer- rin clears the presence of parasites, such as Entamoeba histolytica (Le\u00b4on-Sicairos et al., 2006). Although cow milk is life-saving and the best alternative for breastfeeding it still cannot replace the effects of human milk on infant health (Victora et al., 2016). For instance, preterm infants fed exclusively with human milk have signicantly lower intestinalpermeability compared with infants that received a combined diet of breast milk and cow milk formula or only cow milk formula (Taylor, Basile, Ebeling, & Wagner, 2009). This effect is trans-lated to reduced incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, reduced parenteral nutrition duration, and reduced morbidity compared with pre-term infants fed with milk formula (Reisinger et al.,2014). Exclusive breastfeeding for at least the rst 4-6 months of life is considered a protective factor to reduce the incidence of atopic diseases in susceptible individuals (Greer, Sicherer, & Burks,2008), thus illustrating the importance of breast milk ingredients for healthy gut immune development and the need to further improve the alternatives for breast milk. Microbial colonization Infant acquisition of microbiota in utero and via human milk bacteria. An essential part of the development of immunity and barrier function is the healthy development of an individual's mi-crobiota. The neonatal gut colonization has been suggested to oc- cur by different mechanisms: early colonization in utero (Walker, Clemente, Peter, flow back during lactation (Biagi et al., 2017; Ramsay, Kent, Owens, & Hartmann, 2004). The initial colonization of the surfaces of infant respiratory, uri- nary and gut mucosa starts, according to recent Walker et al., 2017). This process occurs mostly in the last stage of pregnancy (Donnet-Hughes et al., 2010; Rodriguez, 2014). . Recent stud-ies have characterized the placenta meconium bacterial Lee, & Mysorekar, 2014). Likewise, the human placenta (Stout et al., 2013), and umbilical cord contain microorganisms, such as al., 2005). Although the translocation mechanism is not clear, it hasbeen suggested that bacteria from the maternal gut and oral cav- ity are transferred to the fetus through the placenta (Dong et al., 2015). Other mechanism is the ingestion of amniotic liquid which,not only contain growth factors, hormones, and immunomodulat- ing proteins, but also microorganisms. During the third semester the fetus swallows 700 to 1000 mL of amniotic liquid per day(Magann, Sandlin, & Ounpraseuth, 2011). Therefore, fetal swal- lowing allows the exposure to these molecules and bacteria into the developing gastrointestinal tract (Chong, Bloomeld, &O'Sullivan, 2018).As a support mechanism, to protect the infant from pathogens, the mother transfers benecial bacteria to the neonate via breast- feeding (Prince et al., 2015). The transmission of intestinal bacteriafrom the maternal gut to the mammary gland has been suggested to occur via dendritic cells and the mesenteric lymph nodes (Murphy et al., 2017). This is known as the entero-mammary pathway. Atleast 200 bacterial species have been isolated from human milk but the great diversity is linked to the variations in the culture meth- ods or geographical differences (Li et al., 2017). Bacteria phylum Proteobacteria, Firmicutes (Pannaraj et al., in human milk (Cabrera-Rubio, Mira-Pascual, Mira, & Collado, 2016). Although it is unknown how the stage of lactation affects the composition of bacteria in human milk, it has been observed that it affects the abundances ofspecic genera (Simpson et al., 2017). Human milk introduces and supports benecial bacteria that protect breastfed infants from diarrhea, respiratory and, metabolicdisorders (Hunt et al., 2011). Furthermore, it stimulates the tran- sitory gut microbiota in the infant and has a great impact on colo- nization of bacteria (T oscano, Grandi, Grossi, & Drago, 2017). Thecomposition of HMOs is a predictor of the composition of human milk microbiota. The abundances of Bidobacteria are positively linked to the presence of HMOs, such as, monofucosyllacto-N-hexaose et al., 2007; M. Wang et al., 2015). In contrast, in human milk containing 2'-FL and lacto-N-fucopentaose (LNFP 1), the prevalence of Bacteroides has been observed to be high given that this genus prefers to consume branched HMOs (Asakuma et al., 2011). Effects of the delivery mode. The microbial colonization in the intestine with vaginal benecial bacteria has long-lasting effects on the infant's health as for example, illustrated by the numerouscomparative studies on differences in microbiota development in infants 2004). The newborn intestine is an aerobic environment which, within a week, ultimately becomes anaerobic (Johnson & Verwsalovic, 2012). In the rst few days of life, after vaginaldelivery, Bidobacteria and Bacteroidetes will be predominantly present. Bidobacterium spp. releases bioactive factors that rapidly reduce intestinal permeability (Ewaschuk et al., 2008). The sameeffect is achieved when Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria colonize the gut. These species can alter and maintain the phosphorylation of the tight junction proteins (Cui et al., 2017). Via these mechanisms the composition of the gut microbiota can shape the immunological barrier, T-cell differentiation and activation (N.Lee & Kim, 2017). Furthermore, bacterial fermentation products can directly influence immunity. For example, butyrate from bacterial metabolism can induce Treg cell differentiation (Zhanget al., 2016). In contrast, infants delivered by C-section have a lower micro- biota diversity during the rst 2 years of life (Jakobsson et al.,2014). Given that infants delivered by C-section miss the vaginal- derived bacteria, they depend for supply of bacteria on the breast skin microbiota of the mother which is composed of species fromthe genera Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium andPropionibacterium spp. and have species from Bacteroides and Bidobac- terium (Dominguez-Bello et al., 2010). C-section delivery is not a risk factor for the development of intestinal bacterial infections in infants (Bager, Simonsen, Ethelberg, & Frisch, 2010), but the differences in microbial transmissions and colonization have beenfound to influence colonization of the microbial barrier and to C/circlecopyrt2018 Institute of Food Technologists\u00aeVol.18,2019rComprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety 129Oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates content . . . negatively affect the chemical, physical, and immunological com- ponents of the intestinal barrier (Chu et al., 2017). Maternal factors Genetic determinants. Secretor status and Lewis blood epi- topes of the mother determine the composition of HMOs, HMGPs, and HMGLs and thereby influence the development of the gastrointestinal immune barrier of the neonate. These blood group variables determine the fucosylation of such molecules. The secretor gene encodes for 1,2 fucosyltransferase (FUT2), whereas the Lewis blood type is determined by the Lewis gene, which encodes for 1,3/1,4 fucosyltransferase (FUT3) (De Vries, Knegtel, Holmes, & Macher, 2001). Due to variations in the ma- ternal fucosyltransferases the quantity and type of carbohydrates are differently expressed in pyloric or duodenal mucus and secretions (Mattos, 2016). Although HMOs and HMGPs fucosy- lation has been extensively studied (Doherty, Lodge, Dharmage, Dai, & Lowe, 2018), HMOs and HMGPs sialylation is not well \u00b4ak, Balogh, & B \u00b4eni, 2017; Yan 2018). Approximately 70-77% of the HMOs are fucosylated, whereas approximately 28% are sialylated (Ninonuevo et al., 2006). The presence or absence of any of the secretor (Se) and Lewis (Le) phenotypes have been used to categorize human milk into four groups according to their Every lactating woman has a unique pattern of oligosaccharides (Blank, Dotz, Geyer, & Kunz, 2012; Thurl et al., 2010). However, data suggest that ultimately the composition of the HMOs relies more on the maternal Se status than on the Le blood type (T otten et al., 2012). The content of Sialylated HMOs is high in colostrum (1500 mg/L) and decreases in mature milk (to 300 mg/L) (T en Bruggencate, Bovee-Oudenhoven, Feitsma, van Hoffen, & Schoterman, 2014). The concentrations of acid oligosaccharides have been found to be not dependent on the Lewis blood group, and sialyltransferases are found broadly distributed in all human cells, including those of the lactating mammary gland (Maksi- movic, Sharp, Nicholas, Cocks, & Savin, 2011). Four families of sialyltransferases have been described to be responsible for the synthesis of acidic glycoconjugates: a) ST6Gal1 and ST6Gal2, b) ST8SIA6 (Weiss & Hennet, 2012). HMOs sialylation is mediated by the ST3GAL and ST6GAL families (Bing, 2009). These sialic and fucose epitopes help to shape the composi- tion of the microbiota as they serve as adhesion receptors for pathogens and as sources of energy for microorganisms that pro- duce blood group antigen-specic alpha-glycosidases, such as Bi- dobacterium and Bacteroides (Hoskins et al., 1985; Wacklin et al., 2011). Both communities reduce gut permeability and produce lactate and short-chain fatty acids that modulate the immune cells and the mucus composition (R \u00b4os-Covi \u00b4an et al., 2016). Infants that are fed with milk from nonsecretor mothers have a delayed colonization with Bidobacterium, and as a result, they are more susceptible to diarrhea and bacterial translocation (Lewis et al., 2015). Infants breastfed with secretor milk are protected against diar- rhea caused Campylobacter, calciviruses, and E. Coli entero- toxins (Morrow, Ruiz-palacios, Jiang, & Newburg, 2005). They are protected as well from protozoan parasites (Jantscher-Krenn et al., 2012). Therefore, the lack of these epitopes on milk glycans has consequences for the function of the intestinal barrier. Giventhat nonsecretor individuals do not express FUT2, they are not able to express ABH antigens in their mucus and other secretions nonsecretor phenotype has been genetically as- increased risk for Crohn's disease and necrotizing enterocolitis (Forni et al., 2014). The reason behind this effect is that without certain glycan epitopes bacterial communities of Bidobacterium cannot proliferate and in exchange opportunistic bacteria can adhere or penetrate the epithelial layer (H. Wu et al., 2017). Sialylated HMOs, such as well as decoy receptors to prevent the adhesion of influenza virus (Stencel-Baerenwald, et al., 2005). Although HMOs, in general, are known to stimulate the growth of benecial bacteria, studies on fucosylated and sialylated HMOs have shown that Bidobacteria have variable strategies for the digestion of individual HMOs (Garrido et al., 2015); some strains survive from the utilization of fucosylated structures but do not metabolize 6'-SL. Among the sialylated d Clostridium spp. in the infant gut have shown preference for 6'-SL HMOs but are unable to digest 3'-SL (Y u, Chen, & Newburg, 2013). In vitro experiments have shown that sialylated HMOs inhibit leukocyte rolling and adhesion to endothelial cells, while neutral HMOs do not exert such effect (Lars Bode et al., 2004). The presence of sialic acid attenuates development of necrotizing ente- rocolitis (NEC) in infants. In rat models it has been shown that the dimeric structure, disialyllactose, and not the sialylated oligosac- charides containing one, three, or four sialic acid groups, was effective in preventing disease progression, indicating that spe- cic structures are required to obtain specic protective effects (Jantscher-Krenn et al., 2012). Maternal environmental factors. Factors, such as maternal diet, body weight and antibiotic use have shown to influence milk com- position (D. Munblit, Boyle, & Warner, 2015). However, there is not enough information about how these factors affect speci- cally the composition of oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates in human milk. The influence of maternal diet on milk composition is not homogeneous over all milk components. For instance, no changes have been observed in proteins, and mineral composition (Innis, 2014). However, diet can affect the content of fatty acids and vitamins, such as vitamin B1 and C composition (Bravi et al., 2016). As a consequence it has been suggested that diet can affect the concentrations of gangliosides, such as GM3 and GD3 in human milk (Giuffrida, Elmelegy, Thakkar, Marmet, & Destaillats, 2014). Although it has not been found that lactose composition changes upon dietary intake, Kunz et al. showed that after oral administration of galactose to lactating mothers, this monosaccharide was incorporated to lactose and acidic and neutral oligosaccharides (Kunz, Rudloff, Baier, Klein, & Strobel, 2000). Also, the supplementation of the maternal diet with probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bidobacterium animalis )w a ss h o w nt o reduce the risk of eczema in breastfed infants (Rautava, Kainonen, Salminen, & Isolauri, 2012). These results suggest that modulating the maternal diet might have therapeutic potential for breast milk to offer secondary prevention towards allergic disorders during childhood (Daniel Munblit et al., 2017). Current guidelines orient practitioners and pregnant women to maintain a healthy intake of micro- and macronutrients in order to protect mother and 130 Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food SafetyrVol.18,2019 C/circlecopyrt2018 Institute of Food Technologists\u00aeOligosaccharides and developing fetus (Kominiarek & Rajan, 2017). However, in the practice no medical guidelines recommend women to avoid or include specic types of food during pregnancy and lactation inorder to improve their milk composition or prevent allergies in their offspring (Best, Gold, Kennedy, Martin, & Makrides, 2016). Maternal obesity has not been observed to influence milk com- position. However, it has been suggested that obese mothers can transfer via breast milk inflammatory cytokines and markers of oxidative stress, which can contribute to weight gain in the infant(Y oung et al., 2017). Although it has been shown that the prole of some fatty acids in the breast milk from obese women is different compared to lean women, their total fat, protein and carbohydrate content does not differ (Panagos et al., 2016). It remains to be determined which factor in mother milk is responsible for thisundesired effect. Host genetic factors The etiology of IBD, obesity, and allergies arise from complex interactions between genes (nature) and the environment (nurture)(Ruiz-N \u00b4unez, Pruimboom, Dijck-Brouwer, & Muskiet, 2013). These interactions Berghe, 2010).Host genetic might for example affect where and how mi- croorganism colonize in the intestine (Knights, Lassen, & Xavier, 2013). Some of these effects can be mitigated by changes in thediet. The gene FUT2 encodes for epitopes that compose glycans that support the proliferation of Bacteroides and prevent the ad- hesion of pathogens. Studies in mice with a nonfunctional FUT2gene have shown that after the animals had been fed with complex oligosaccharides they developed a fecal microbiome prole similar to that of mice with functional FUT2 genes, illustrating that dietmight compensate for genetic differences (Kashyap et al., 2013). Conversely, in some diseases, gene determinants remain the strongest risk factor to develop an intestinal disease (Turpin, Goethel, Bedrani, & Croitoru, 2018). For example, genes respon- for enhanced intestinal permeability are considered importantin the of IBD (McCole, 2014). T wo genetic alter- ations have been found to hinder the maturation of the gut barrier. The rst is a deciency of NOD2, which induces a hyper inflam-matory response to gut microbiota. Mutations in this gene disrupt proper sensing of the immune pathways that respond to host mi- crobiota allowing an overgrowth of pathological bacteria, such asE. coli (Ramanan, Tang, Bowcutt, Loke, & Cadwell, 2014). As a consequence, Enterobacteriaceae is a family of bacteria enriched in patients with IBD (Brantley Hall, T olonen, & Xavier, 2017). Theother genetic alteration interfering with the maturation of the gut immune barrier is polymorphisms in the regions that encode the genes that regulate tight junctions (Membrane Associated Guany-late Kinase-MAGI3). Clinically this genetic defect reduces the ex- pression of tight junctions, increases gut permeability, and future challenges. Different nongenetic and ge- netic factors have been shown to be important for neonatal de-velopment of an adequate gut immune barrier and for preventing inflammatory diseases at a later age. Therefore, modulation of the gastrointestinal immune barrier, to improve health, has become apotent strategy to manage or prevent inflammatory diseases (De Santis, Cavalcanti, Mastronardi, Jirillo, & Chieppa, 2015). From all the nongenetic factors that affect the infant intestinal barrierperhaps the only readily applicable one is nutritional or dietary change.Although no nutraceutical can replace the benets of human milk, the ultimate way to manage proper development of the gastrointestinal barrier via infant formula is the addition of HMOsand/or HMGPs. Not all HMOs and HMGPs that have an impact on gut barrier maturation have been identied yet but this might happen soon as analytical techniques to characterize, isolate, andidentify HMOs, HMGPs, and synthetic oligosaccharides are improving (Cao et Robinson, Colet, Tian, HMOs and HMGPs havebeen more broadly studied because of their abundance in human milk, whereas sialylated proling is challenging since it requires the removal of dominant fucosylated structures and lactose (Yan et al., 2018). Nonetheless, differences in molecular structure among species, or among human individuals, are now betterdocumented (Chaturvedi et al., W . L. Wang et al., 2017) and might lead to more personalized advice on type and variation ofHMOs and HMGPs in infant formulas. However, before HMOs and HMGPs can be produced in a more personalized fashion another challenge has to be overcome.This is to isolate and produce sufcient molecules in a cost- effective manner. In the past 20 years enzymatic in vitro synthesis has been the most widely employed method to produce oligosac-charides (Rufng & Chen, 2006). The major limitation continues to be the development of enzymatic systems that can produce more complex HMOs than 2-FL and LNnT at an industrial scale.Major efforts are oriented towards engineered transferases capable to add fucose or sialic acid into desired locations on the glycan backbone. Additionally, for this large-scale production, more ef-cient methods of purication are needed (Baumg \u00a8artner, Seitz, Sprenger, & Albermann, 2013). Since E.coli is the most com- mon system used, and there is much and good information aboutthe mutants with no virulent capacity, the downstream produc- tion requires controls that guarantee endotoxin-free production (Sprenger, Baumg \u00a8artner, & Albermann, 2017) NDCs should not be abandoned. Many of the carbohydrates used to fortify infant formula have been extensively investigated as food ingredient for their prebiotic properties (Ackerman, Craft,&T ownsend, 2017). Unfortunately, it has not been fully conrmed that they can substitute for other relevant functions of HMOs (Kent, 2006). Studies on diverse in vitro models have shown that NDCs can have a direct role in the regulation of the secretory function of highly differentiated cells from the epithelial barrier or even stimulate barrier function by supporting tight junction pro- duction (Dulantha Ulluwishewa et al., 2011). Therefore, the study of nonprebiotic effects of individual or combinations of NDCsmight further improve efcacy of infant formula compositions. During recent years it has become more accepted that many nutrients are not solely a source of energy or as factors involved inthe development of the organism; nutrients are also able to reg- ulate gene expression (Ferguson, 2015). This new eld is called nutrigenomics (Pavlidis, Nebel, Katsila, & Patrinos, 2016). As inpharmacogenomics, the identication of the positive, negative, or even adverse effects, impacts of a medication on diverse popula- tions (Relling & Evans, 2015), nutrigenomics is a potential tool tounderstand the interactions between genome and dietary compo- nents (Neeha & Kinth, 2013). By this approach food intake can become more effective as nutrigenomics contributes to an un-derstanding of the mechanisms that underlie individual variations in dietary requirements, as well as in the capacity to respond to food-based interventions. This can also apply to milk make-up,opening new venues to improve its composition or to prevent the C/circlecopyrt2018 Institute of Food Technologists\u00aeVol.18,2019rComprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety 131Oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates content . . (Gruber, Lichti, Rath, & Haller, 2012). Important advances have been made in understanding individ- ual efcacy of human milk after the discovery that secretor and Lewis status from an individual determine how the microbiota de- velops and how breast milk protects against disease. Blood geno- type is very important for the composition and health benets of the breast milk. Recently even more specic genotypes have been identied thanks to the improvements in the detection techniques. Such is the case of the Bombay and para-Bombay phenotypes in Asiatic or Indian populations. In these populations adverse reac- tions to NDCs in infant formula have been described (Chiang et al., 2012; Kaneko et al., 2014). It exemplies that more knowl- edge is needed about the role of genetically determined blood variants and food component efcacy in supporting maturation of the intestinal immune barrier.
