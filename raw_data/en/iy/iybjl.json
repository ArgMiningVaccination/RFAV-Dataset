The complaint was filed on behalf of our individual client who wishes to remain anonymous. On 2/13/23, the attorneys of Saltz Mongeluzzi Bendesky filed a civil lawsuit against Delaware County Chiropractor, Ardel Ignacio Cirio, his business, and the staff members believed to have turned a blind eye to the sexually explicit misconduct Cirio was inflicting upon his patient, Jane Doe. \"If you can't trust your chiropractor, who can you trust,\" question the lawyers of SMB's sex abuse team, Kristen Gibbons Feden and Marni S. Berger. Circio was convicted on January 16, 2023 of several counts of Indecent Assault and Aggravated Indecent Assault for sexually abusing several patients over the course of six years. While his sentencing and time in jail does provide some relief to our client, we are here to assist our client in holding Circio accountable civilly as well. We commend our client for coming forward. It is her hope and ours that her voice will enable others in similarly vulnerable positions to do the same. Only then do we believe that there will be a lower likelihood that this type of tragedy will strike again. The attorneys at SMB are available to assist patients subject to abuse at the hands of the providers to whom they have entrusted their care. See the lawsuit complaint "}
