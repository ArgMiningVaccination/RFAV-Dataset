Adapted from the Imm unization Action Coalition \u00b7 Saint Paul, Minnesota \u00b7 651-647-9009 \u00b7 www.immuniz e.org SCPHD 1000 -01 Immunization Screening Form / July 2018 Information about the Screening Checklist for Contrain dications to Vaccines Are you interested in knowing why we included a certain question on the screening checklist ? If so, read the information below. If you want to find out even more, consult the references listed at the end. 1. Have you ever had a severe reaction after receiving a vaccination (e.g., rash, hives, difficulty breathing) ? [all vaccines] History of a naphylactic reaction (see question 2) to a previous dose of vaccine or vaccine component is a contraindication for subsequent doses.1 Under normal circumstances, vaccines are deferred when a precaution is present. However, situations may arise when the ben efit outweighs the risk (e.g., during a community pertussis outbreak). 2. Have you received any vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? [LAIV, MMR, VAR, yellow fever, ZOS] People who were given either LAIV or an injectable live virus vaccine (e.g., MMR, VAR, Z OS, yellow fever) should wait 28 days before receiving another vaccination of this type. Inactivated vaccines may be given at any spacing interval if they are not administered simultaneously. 3. For children: If your child is a baby, have you ever been to ld that he or she has had intussusception? [Rotavirus] Infants who have a history of intussusception (i.e., the telescoping of one portion of the intestine into another) should not be given rotavirus vaccine. 4. For children : If the child to be vaccin ated is 2 through 4 years of age, has a healthcare provider told you that the child had wheezing or asthma in the past 12 months? [LAIV] Children ages 2 through 4 years who have had a wheezing episode within the past 12 months should not be given LAIV. Ins tead, these children should be given IIV. 5. Do you have a long -term health problem with heart disease, lung disease, asthma, kidney disease, metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), anemia, or other blood disorder? [MMR, LAIV] The safety of intranasal live a ttenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in people with these conditions has not been established. These conditions, including asthma in adults, should be considered precautions for the use of LAIV. 6. Are you sick today with a fever or diarrhea ? [all vaccines ] There is no evidence that acute illness reduces vaccine efficacy or increases vaccine adverse events. 1 However, as a precaution with moderate or severe acute illness, all vaccines should be delayed until the illness has improved. Mild illnesses (such as upper respiratory infections or diarrhea) are NOT contraindications to vaccination. Do not withhold vaccination if a person is taking antibiotics. 7. Do you have cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any other immune system problem? [LAIV, MMR, people. However, there are exceptions. For example, MMR vaccine is recommended and varicella vaccine should be consider ed for adults with CD4+ T -lymphocyte counts of greater than or equal to 2 00 cells/L. Immunosuppressed people should not receive LAIV. For details, consult the ACIP recommendations.4,5,6 8. In the past 3 months, have you taken medications that affect your immune system, such as cortisone, prednisone, other steroids, or antica ncer drugs; drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, or psoriasis; or have you had radiation treatments? [LAIV, MMR, VAR, ZOS] Live virus vaccines (e.g., LAIV, MMR, VAR, ZOS) should be postponed until after chemotherapy or long -term high -dose steroid therapy has ended. For details and length of time to postpone, consult the ACIP statement.1,5 Some immune mediator and immune modulator drugs (especially the antitumor -necrosis factor agents adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept) may b e immunosuppressive. The use of live vaccines should be avoided in persons taking these drugs ( MMWR 2011;60 [RR-2]:23). To find specific vaccination schedules for stem cell transplant (bone marrow transplant) patients, see reference 7. LAIV can be given on ly to healthy non-pregnant people ages 2 through 49 years. 9. Do you have allergies to medications, food, a vaccine component, or latex? [all vaccines] An anaphylactic reaction to latex is a contraindication to vaccines that contain latex as a component o r as part of the packaging (e.g., vial stoppers, prefilled syringe plungers, prefilled syringe caps). If a person has anaphylaxis after eating gelatin, do not administer vaccines containing gelatin. A local reaction to a prior vaccine dose or vaccine co mponent, including latex, is not a contraindication to a subsequent dose or vaccine containing that component. For information on vaccines supplied in vials or syringes containing latex, see reference 2; for an extensive list of vaccine compo - nents, see r eference 3. People with egg allergy of any severity can receive any recommended influenza vac - cine (i.e., any IIV or RIV) that is otherwise appropriate for the patient's age. For people with a history of severe allergic reaction to egg involving any sympto m other than hives (e.g., angioedema, respiratory distress), or who required epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention, the vaccine should be administered in a medical setting, such as a clinic, health department, or physician office. Vaccine administration should be supervised by a healthcare provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions. 4 10. During the past year, have you received a transfusion of blood or blood products, or been given immune (gamma) globulin or an antiviral drug? [LAIV, MMR, VAR, ZOS] Certain live virus vaccines (e.g., LAIV, MMR, VAR, ZOS) may need to be deferred, depending on several variables. Consult the most current ACIP recommendations for current information on intervals between antiviral dru gs, immune globulin or blood product administration and live virus vaccines.1 11. For women: Are you pregnant or is there a chance you could become pregnant during the next month? [HPV, IPV, MMR, LAIV, VAR, ZOS] MMR, VAR, ZOS, LAIV) are contraindicated one month before and during pregnancy because of the theoretical risk of virus transmission to the fetus. Sexually active women in their childbearing years who receive live virus vaccines should be instructed to practice careful contraception for one month follow ing receipt of the vaccine. On theoretical grounds, inactivated poliovirus vaccine should not be given during pregnancy; however, it may be given if risk of exposure is imminent and immediate protection is needed (e.g., t ravel to endemic areas). Inacti vated influenza vaccine and Tdap are both recommended during pregnancy. Both vaccines may be given at any time during pregnancy but the preferred time for Tdap administration is at 27 -36 weeks' gestation. HPV vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy.1,4,5,6,8,9 12. Have you had a seizure or a brain or other nervous system problem? [influenza, Td/Tdap] Tdap is contraindicated in people who have a history of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP given before age 7 years. An unstable progressive neuro - logic problem is a pre caution to the use of Tdap. For people with stable neurologic disorders (including seizures) unrelated to vaccination, or for people with a family history of seizure, vaccinate as usual. A histor y of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is a consideration with the following: 1) Td/Tdap: if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a tetanus -containing vaccine and decision is made to continue vaccination, give Tdap instead of Td if no history of prior Tdap; 2) I nfluenza vaccine (IIV/LAIV): if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a prior influenza vaccine, vaccinate with IIV if at increased risk for severe influenza complications.
