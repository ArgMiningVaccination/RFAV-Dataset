The replacement of MMR immunisation with single jabs made no difference to rates of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in more than 30,000 children born before and after the withdrawal of the single injection in Japan in 1993. Tens of thousands of British parents refused to have their children vaccinated with MMR after the publication in 1998 of a study based on only 12 children by Dr Andrew Wakefield, of the Royal Free Hospital, London, suggesting that the vaccine could trigger ASD. A subsequent increase in measles outbreaks was blamed on the scare. The new study, led by Dr Hideo Honda, of Yokohama, in Japan, is the strongest evidence yet that rising levels of autism in the West are nothing to do with the triple jab. Dr Honda said: \"The significance of this finding is that MMR is most unlikely to be a main cause of ASD and that its withdrawal cannot be expected to lead to a reduction in ASD.\" The Japanese vaccination programme involved one-year-olds between 1989 and 1993. It was halted after reports that the anti-mumps part was causing meningitis. Dr Honda, working with Prof Michael Rutter, of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, examined the records of 31,426 children born in Yokohama between 1988 and 1996 and counted those diagnosed with autism by the age of seven in each year. Before replacement of the MMR vaccine with single jabs, annual rates of autism varied from 48 to 86 per 10,000 children, this week's New Scientist magazine reports. After withdrawal, the rate was from 97 to 161. The pattern was the same for the form of autism linked to MMR in a report in the Lancet in 1998 - a form that causes children to regress suddenly after a period of normal development. Michael Fitzpatrick, a GP in Hackney, east London, and the author of the book MMR and autism: what parents need to know, said: \"People have tried to argue that the so-called epidemic of autism is linked to MMR. \"This study shows pretty conclusively that there is no link. It is very reassuring for parents facing decisions about immunisation for their children and for those of children with autism who have been made to carry an unwarranted burden of guilt.\" Scientists do not know why the disorder - marked by deficits in communication, a focus on repetitive acts and excessive attachment to certain objects - are increasing. Some point to environmental factors; others argue that the apparent rise is the result of changing diagnostic criteria and increased awareness of the disorder. The Japanese study is the first to compare autism rates before and after the replacement of an MMR vaccination programme with single jabs. Jackie Fletcher, the founder of Jabs, a support group for children damaged by vaccines, said: \"The time-frame of this study is selective and does not take us any further. It is time the Government paid for a proper clinical study of the children believed to have "}
