Kansas City University conferred a total of 392 Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degrees from its College of Osteopathic Medicine, with 51 earning dual degrees. Thirty-four of the DO graduates earned a Master of Business Administration (MBA) in Health Care Leadership through KCU's partnership with the Rockhurst University Helzberg School of Management, and 17 earned a Master of Arts (MA) in Bioethics. KCU's College of Biosciences conferred six Doctor of Clinical Psychology (PsyD) and 89 Master of Science (MS) in Biomedical Science degrees. Qiana Thomason, MSW, president and chief executive officer of Health Forward Foundation, delivered the keynote address at both ceremonies. \"Graduates, if there was ever a time when the world needed the intellect, tenacity, vision and fortitude of a healer, a comrade, or a co-conspirator in this hard work called health equity, we need it now. You are our very best thing. Now is your time to help heal us, help restore a limping health care field, and a hurting nation,\" Thomason said. \"If you think you're without power and a platform to change the rules, I invite you to reconsider. Whether you're at the bedside or in the boardroom, tap into your personal agency and power.\" Marc B. Hahn, DO, KCU president and CEO commended the graduates for adapting and persevering in the wake of the pandemic, noting that many members of the Class of 2023 were in their first year at KCU when COVID-19 changed the course of their studies. \"Based upon their demonstrated grit and determination, I can honestly say that the future of our health care system is in good hands,\" Hahn said. \"Together they will redefine the future of health care as physicians, scientists, psychologists, ethicists and leaders.\" Graduates of the College of Osteopathic Medicine Class of 2023 will enter residencies that include surgery, dermatology, orthopedics and molecular pathology. However, nearly 60 percent of the class elected to enter the field of primary care, a specialty facing severe shortages throughout the nation. These KCU graduates are part of a record-breaking national class of young doctors who will provide a much-needed shot in the arm for a healthcare system that desperately needs them. A high percentage of KCU's College of Biosciences Master of Science graduates will pursue careers as physicians, with more than 500 COB graduates matriculating at more than 80 medical schools across the country since 2015. Among the KCU College of Osteopathic Medicine's Class of 2023, more than 10 percent earned an MS degree from the College of Biosciences. The College of Biosciences' Doctor of Clinical Psychology (PsyD) program graduated its second-ever class this year. KCU developed the PsyD program to address the nation's growing mental health crisis, as well as create an interprofessional education curriculum to prepare future health care professionals to ensure patients' emotional, as well as physical, health.
