If you want to fight oxidative stress, slow down cellular aging, or maintain optimal energy levels, then you should listen up too! After you've blown out thirty candles on your birthday cake, a gradual shift occurs in your body. The mitochondria (powerhouse) in your cells don't produce energy as efficiently and your antioxidant capacity begins to shrink. Here's what's happening: Once upon a time, your body was happily minding its own business keeping you healthy. You fueled your body with food, which was transported to your cell's mitochondria and converted into energy. Then your mitochondria began to slow down their production and produce more waste. Slowly your body had less energy as it gained extra oxidative stress. Is there a happy ending to this story? Yes! Dr. Mercola Ubiquinol is like a hero who will save your mitochondria and slay the dragon of oxidative stress! You can thank your mitochondria for supplying your body with an endless stream of energy. That's why it's so important to keep them in tip-top shape with a nourishing [antioxidant supplement](https://findyourhealthyplace.com/product-category/supplements/antioxidants/). Ubiquinol, the active form of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), is just the one for the job! The health benefits of this antioxidant-rich supplement range from your cells to your skin and everything in between: - Protects your body from oxidative stress* - Supports optimal energy production* - Promotes the health of brain, nerves, kidneys, and muscles* - Aids heart function and reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases* - Boosts energy levels, stamina, and endurance* - Increases immune function* - Helps maintain already-healthy blood pressure levels* - Encourages a healthy response to stress* - Is not a stimulant* Science suggests that having more CoQ10 in your body equals healthier cells and happier mitochondria. Thankfully ubiquinol is the more bioavailable form on CoQ10! Your body must convert CoQ10 into ubiquinol, so taking ubiquinol is less work for your body. Plus, ubiquinol is better absorbed than CoQ10, especially for individuals over the age of 30.* [Antioxidant supplements](https://findyourhealthyplace.com/product-category/supplements/antioxidants/) aren't one-size-fits-all, so here's why Dr. Joseph Mercola formulated this ubiquinol supplement to be a perfect fit for you: - Each capsule contains a precise dosage of 100 mg of ubiquinol. - This patented form of Ubiquinol is strategically protected from oxidation. - Hard capsules provide an added layer of protection against oxidation. - High-quality ubiquinol is easily absorbed. - Follows superior standards of safety and quality.

Our customers ask our Wellness Consultants all sorts of questions. Here are few of the most commonly asked questions about CoQ10 and ubiquinol: Why do we need more CoQ10/ubiquinol as we age? With each passing year, our bodies produce less and less of this crucial antioxidant. That means more oxidative stress and less energy! Instead, we can nourish our bodies with an antioxidant supplement like Dr. Mercola Ubiquinol to maintain our health and vitality!* Is this supplement only for people over the age of 30? Not at all! If you're under the age of 30, Dr. Mercola Ubiquinol is still a great option for you! However, most younger people are able to take a CoQ10 supplement instead of ubiquinol. Their youthful bodies can easily convert CoQ10 into ubiquinol. We suggest that people over the age of thirty take a ubiquinol supplement because it's more absorbable than CoQ10. Can I take other dietary supplements with Dr. Mercola Ubiquinol? Great question! Yes, this antioxidant supplement is a great addition to your daily supplements. We recommend taking it with a meal for best absorption and checking with your physician before starting a new supplement. Suggested Use: Adults, as a dietary supplement, take one (1) capsule daily with a meal. Cautions: Keep out of the reach of children. Consult a physician before taking this product if you are pregnant, nursing, taking any medications, or have a medical condition. Questions? We've got answers!

After seeing impressive successes, he decided he was ready to commit to this form of medicine.
