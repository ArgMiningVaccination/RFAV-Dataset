While some have been relying on traditional home remedies like kadha and other detox drinks to stay healthy, many have also taken to self-medication- from Vitamin C, Vitamin D, to multivitamins, there has been an exponential rise in people stocking up on 'immunity-boosting' medicines.

COVID-19 infection, the fear of hospitalization, the need for isolation and the stigma has pushed the panic button for a lot many. For many, social media has also turned into an online pharmacy and a way for people to \"borrow\" medical prescriptions and depend on advice from internet pals to self-treat their problems. In order to 'boost and protect' health, people have started taking supplements, herbs and easily available OTC medications, such as aspirin, antihistamine and paracetamol tablets by themselves. The problem of self-medication has been reported so widely, it has actually led people to avoid testing altogether, exposing others to the risk too.

A medicine which may prove useful for one, may not be suitable for another. Self-medication may also, at times, bring on additional health problems. Any medicine or remedy which does not have a doctor's backing is potentially harmful, especially for those living with a co-morbidity. Medicines only work the best when they are used in a certain followed dose, advised by a medical practitioner. If not, it can wreck the body's immune system and leave bad repercussions.

Just because it has immunity-boosting or symptom-relieving benefits, doesn't mean it's all for the best. Overconsumption, or having more than required can pose problems for your body. For example, [a man in America sadly passed away after having too much of mulethi (liquorice)](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/a-man-in-the-us-dies-of-consuming-excessive-mulethi-licorine-know-how-much-is-too-much/articleshow/78313766.cms). An Indian doctor's tweet about a healthy patient shedding 'buckets of blood' after a home remedy thinning his blood supply also went viral recently. Drinking too much kadha can also 'warm' your body and result in blisters, ulcers and burn your tongue since most of the ingredients used in traditional concoctions are hot in nature. In some cases, it could also result in stomach disorders, which could pose additional problems.

Vitamins and minerals are most helpful when absorbed properly, had at the right time of the day. For example, Vitamin C pills available in the market are mostly sold in ascorbic acid form, which is not as effective as the ascorbate form. Excess consumption of another booster, zinc tablets could also induce lethargy. The same risks exist for Vitamin D and other trace minerals. Moreover, excessive consumption of superfoods like haldi or ashwagandha (which is being sold in the form of pills) won't help much.

Prevention, and cutting down on your risk of exposure, along with proper disinfection habits are really the best way to fight and negate the risks of COVID-19. [readmore](javascript://) 07/7Bottomline As for our immunity, our bodies really are the best judge to tell us what we need to do. Proper sleep, a good nutrient-rich diet and exercise are three of the best natural infection fighters and work better than any supplement. Hence, listen to your body before overdosing on medicines and supplements. If you think you might be deficient in any of the vitamins, worried about your diet or have pre-existing medical conditions, a consultation with a medical expert would do you a lot of good. Always follow your doctor's advice before googling your medical conditions on the internet.
