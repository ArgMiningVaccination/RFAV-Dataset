Optimised reaction conditions for efficient ligand transfer leads to well-defined polymers within 2 h with near quantitative conversions (>95%), low dispersities ( 1.16) and high end-group fidelity, as demonstrated by MALDI-ToF-MS. Additionally, in the presence of ppm concentrations of NaBr, similar degree of control could also be attained by facilitating ligand exchange, furnishing narrow dispersed polymers ( < 1.12). "}
