FAQs Q: I haven't been vaccinated in a while, will Vaccine Detox still work? A: Yes. Since heavy metals build up in the body, vaccine detox will bind to and eliminate heavy metals from vaccines (and other forms of exposure) no matter if you were vaccinated in the last week or the last decade. Q: I've never been vaccinated; why should I take Vaccine Detox? A: Vaccine detox focuses on binding and eliminating heavy metals, which surround us everywhere we go. Even if you've never received a vaccine in your life, Vaccine Detox can help cleanse the body of everyday heavy metal exposure and environmental toxins. Q: Why isn't Vaccine Detox recommended for amalgam (silver) fillings? A: Amalgam fillings are a mixture of heavy metals (mercury and a powdered alloy containing silver, tin, and copper). Since Vaccine Detox focuses on eliminating heavy metals, if the metals aren't removed correctly, they could circulate in the body and do more harm than good. Q: How long should I take Vaccine Detox? A: At least six weeks, but you can use it for as long as you feel necessary. Everyone's needs will be different. Some people do a vaccine detox every few months, while some find long-term usage is what they need. Others choose to address active symptoms and discontinue after symptoms have resolved. Q: Will I experience detox symptoms while taking Vaccine Detox? A: You may. Remember to start slowly, with as few as 1 - 3 drops per day (for ages 1 -13) and 5 drops (for 13 and up), increasing slowly to avoid overwhelming detox symptoms.

A: Vaccine Detox is taken orally and can be mixed into juice, tea, or another beverage for easier consumption. Q: Is Vaccine Detox safe while pregnant? A: Vaccine Detox is safe to use while pregnant. We recommend caution and monitoring closely as peppermint may cause contractions. Q: Is Vaccine Detox safe while breastfeeding? A: Vaccine Detox is safe to use while breastfeeding. Caution is warranted as peppermint may affect milk supply. We recommend monitoring closely for undesirable detox symptoms in your baby while breastfeeding. Detox symptoms in a baby include extra fussiness, diarrhea, rash, etc. Q: Can I give Vaccine Detox to my baby? A: We recommend Vaccine Detox for anyone over the age of one. If your baby is younger than that, it's better to try to wait until 11 - 12 months old. If breastfeeding, we recommend mom take it and pass it along through the milk supply. If you're having severe vaccine reactions, research the herbs and decide if you're comfortable using Vaccine Detox. Q:There is sediment at the bottom of my tincture bottle or discoloration of the dropper; what is it? A: Since our products are made from herbs, sometimes herbal sediment isn't completely strained. Chances are, if you notice any sediment at the bottom of the bottle or discoloration at the tip of the dropper, it's from the herbs. As long as the product isn't passed the two-year shelf-life and doesn't smell rancid, it's still safe to use. Q: Will Vaccine Detox undo the damage caused by vaccines? A: No, Vaccine Detox is not going to undo the damage caused by vaccines. It does help remove heavy metals from the body, but any damage done will not be mitigated. We suggest reading our Vaccine Detox Guide for more information. "}
