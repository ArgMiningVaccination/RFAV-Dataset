Not only is she highly knowledgeable about Sedona on historical, geological, and spiritual levels, but she is also uniquely gifted with intuition and creativity to customize your tour for the optimal journey, especially to explore the Land and align with your life path. She is the type of person who will still go on a four-hour tour with you despite cold, rain, and wind - and it will still be the most remarkable part of your trip! You will learn so much about who and where you are in life. Please do yourself a favor and gift yourself a memorable journey with CrystalStarrWeaver! - merryminnow00Grateful for Crystal and this experience!Crystal Starr Weaver gave us an uplifting and enlightening tour. She poured her energy into caring for our spiritual needs. She loves people. She loves sharing her knowledge of the land and the magic within. She taught us the geography, geology, botany, and history of the vortex areas. She is a caring, and a most amazing guide. She gave us positive guidance. We enjoyed being with her very much. - TTTNYC00THAT SEDONA MAGICI did a day trip to Sedona and had a lovely time with Crystal Starr Weaver. She had a calming peaceful energy about her and literally helped part the clouds for us that day. It was snowing really hard and there was such low visibility you couldn't see much, but after positive manifestation and trusting Mother Nature, and simply going with the vortex flow, the skies cleared and we got sunshine for the rest of our time together. A magical trip and we will return to see her again!!! - P1475YPtracyp00incredible experienceUnexpectedly received an uncommon tour-- ecological and informational and spiritual. I highly recommend this to anyone thinking about it. Unforgettable. - Clara G00AwakeningOur tour with Crystal was amazing. She merged her information with both the scientific and spiritual. Most importantly, she addressed our questions. Since this was our first visit we learned about Sedona. - Wanderer3605133493300Where the magic happensMy husband and I came seeking a vortex tour that provided guidance and wisdom! This tour was uplifting and fulfilling. The mediation and connections made will be rooted for us! We left feeling rejuvenated and recharged. Crystal Star Weaver shared her gifts with enlightenment. I can't wait to come back to recharge as needed! Magic happens here - P1475YPtracyp00Complete tour with intuition and information!!Crystal StarWeaver was outstanding. She is incredibly intuitive and took us to the perfect places for our highest best. We learned about the lore, the geology, the ecology, the biodiversity, and the history of Sedona. We visited Thunder Mountain and she talked about the fact that it is the site for the throat chakra. She facilitated a healing of that chakra for me, using words specific to my situation. It was uncanny! I keep wanting to write adjectives like 'amazing' and 'outstanding' and 'incredible' but know that those words are inferior to how I felt. She even gave a ride to a hiker who was 2 miles away from her car because she came out of the trails in the wrong place!! - Christine D00Amazing experience!Amazing experience! Crystal took us to so many places and was extremely knowledgeable. We only had 1 full day in Sedona and so thankful we took this tour. We learned so much. Highly recommend!!! - 751draganak00Amazing experienceI am so glad I did this tour. My guide was amazing. I learned so much that I would never learn if I didn't take Spiritual Vortex tour. Thank you so much Crystal Star River!! - I3627ZQjoycec00Amazing, healing, transformative, beautifulHad the most special day with Chrystal. I could have set on that rock for days more talking and meditating. Was a truly transformative experience. I Wish this for everyone. If you go to Sedona, BOOK WITH CHRYSTAL!! - G1286ZAvalerieb00Incredible tour with an incredible guideOur tour with Crystal was incredible. She gave us insights to the land, the history and the stories of the places she showed us. We learned about the plants and about the damage being done to the earth, we saw ancient trees and we felt like we were connected to the earth in this beautiful place through Crystal. She also nudged us towards our own awareness of what we could be working on in our lives and how we can connect on a more universal level personally. We returned feeling centered, at peace and having learned so much from this wonderful woman. I cannot wait to return to this place I have fallen in love with. (Thank you Crystal, and just so you know, I have not said \"sorry\" much at all lately and it has been easy.) Val and Alise - John M00Great experience in SedonaCrystal was extremely knowledgeable about the area and brought us to places and showed us things we never would have found on our own. It was a great experience! - alissah51900More Than Just A TourCrystal personalized the experience for each of the four members in our group. She asked compelling questions and encouraged each of us to look within ourselves for the answers. The tour was well worth the money. - Danesh3300Amazing Experience ! You will be forever changed.If you are looking for a tour with someone who has a deep understanding of energy, the land, nature, this is the trip for you ! The wealth of knowledge and the ease with which Crystal shared her wisdom made the experience great for the entire family. It will open your mind and your heart ! - Douglasv196300Craig and Doug's Sedona Experience With CrystalCrystal was kind, knowledgeable and accommodating from the moment we placed a phone call to schedule a tour up through and including the tour. She has so much wisdom to share and her knowledge of Sedona is unsurpassed. She really listens carefully to what you want to see and experience while you are in Sedona. She gave us so much information that we feel we can leave Sedona knowing a lot more than when we came. We strongly recommend booking Crystal above all other tour companies. Her private journeys are a once in a lifetime experience!

CSW Written April 20, 2019 This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC. Me and my fianc\u00e9 made it our mission to find Crystal Starr Weaver on a last minute trip and hoped to sneak a medicine wheel ceremony in with her. We stopped by her shop (also amazing) our first night in Sedona and found out she was doing an information session the next morning so we showed up stayed after and she made it happen. We did the ceremony later and it was such an amazing experience. We can't wait to come back and do a tour of the vortexes with her. If you are thinking of booking but unsure follow your heart she is the real deal and truly helped us find what we were looking for and more. She also suggested we both hike thunder mountain because our throat chakras were closed off and it was the best advice we went the next morning and could feel the power and energy of the vortex. Thank you Crystal and I truly hope we meet again. Written January 2, 2019 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I am glad our paths crossed. I bet the thunder mountain trail around the Mountain was fun too. I love doing what I do and excited to always do a sacred journey around the Medicine Wheel. Claim and Own your Voice and always speak your truth!!! Yes cant wait to go back out in Sedona's energy with you. Thanks for the Review! CSW Written January 8, 2019 This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC. Jul 2018 Family Me and my 14 year old daughter decided to go on this tour with Crystal Starr Weaver and it was wonderful. We learned about the history of Sedona, the Native American culture and we got to see more than we expected. I have to say that my favorite part of the journey was Bell Rock and Rachel's Knoll. The sites and the energy were incredible. Crystal has a very calming demeanor and tailored out journey just for us. We did not get to the medicine wheel, but that may have been meant for another time. Thank you so much Crystal!
