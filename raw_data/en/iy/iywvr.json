In total, HBR members lead businesses that account for more than $25 billion in gross revenue in Hawai'i each year, and employ more than 80,000 people on all islands. Since its founding in 1983, education and the economy continue to be the Roundtable's major concern. HBR believes that the University of Hawai'i, through its Hawai'i Innovation Initiative, can play a critical role as a catalyst for economic development and we will work closely with the University toward this end. CONNECT San Diego 1 was engaged to assist the HBR and its partners to research and produce the Hawai'i Innovation Assets Report based on CONNECT's experience with assessing regional innovation ecosystems. San Diego was identified by the Hawai'i Innovation Report task force partners as a potential model for Hawai'i in terms of how to develop the state's innovation economy. tHe GRowtH of sAn D IeGo's Innov AtIon eConomy- A PossIB le m oDel fo R HA wAI'I San Diego's economy in the 1980's was similar to that of Hawai'i today with a reliance on tourism and military sectors to fuel the economy. The end of the Cold War brought a decline in military spending to prime contractors and growth in the uniformed military base personnel. The tourism and convention industry faced increasing competition from other regions and slowing in the growth and thus capacity of the visitor plant in San Diego. In response to these pressures and in conjunction with the development of new technolo-gies in the research universities and institutes in San Diego, a number of clusters formed around innovative new technologies began to coalesce and grow. From research produced at University of California San Diego grew the wireless communications technology and biotechnology clusters. The number of companies in these sectors grew substantially over the next twenty years and the San Diego region saw the emergence of industry trade organizations, business accelerators and capital investment organizations. 1 CONNECT is a regional program that catalyzes the creation of innovative technology and life sciences products in San Diego County by linking inventors and entrepreneurs with the resources they need for success. Since 1985, CONNECT has assisted in the formation and development of more than 3,000 companies. The leadership of CONNECT attributes its success to the unique culture of collaboration between industry, capital sources, strategic partners and research organizations that CONNECT has sought to foster in the region.

The tourism and military sectors represented more than a quarter of the state's total gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013. Historically, tourism has been Hawai'i's largest industry and accounts for about 17 percent of the state's economy. The federal military and civilian sectors represent about 15 percent combined.2 Hawai'i's economy is centered on the tourism industry: transportation, accommodation and food services, and retail trade sectors represent a significant fraction of total jobs. Tourism will always be a mainstay of Hawai'i's economy. The state's climate, natural beauty and its well-developed hotel, recreation and supporting service industries attract billions of dollars to the local economy. About a fifth of the Hawai'i's jobs are in the government sector with both state and federal civilian components, as well as a large military component. Non-tourism service sectors such as health care, business, administrative and professional fields have generally grown faster than the economy overall, contributing to gradual diversification of the state economy3. The tourism sector has shown limited growth over the past decade and volatile visitor spending. The majority of tourists to Hawai'i hail from the U.S. mainland. Visitors from the Western U.S. comprise roughly 40 percent of total arrivals, and visitors from the Eastern U.S. comprise about a fifth of all arrivals. The number of Japanese visitors peaked in the mid-1990s and has declined considerably since then. The share of visitors from markets other than the U.S. and Japan, including China, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, has increased from roughly 12 percent of total visitors a decade ago to close to 20 percent today. Yet prospects for growth in Hawai'i's visitor industry remain muted. \"Despite a pickup over the summer of 2014, visitor arrivals have been soft this year, and the period of robust visitor spending increases is behind us. A mixed global economic environment and limited visitor industry capacity will keep a lid on future gains.\"4 HAwAI'I's vIsIto R Pl Ant unlIkely to sH ow sIGnIfICAnt GRowtH 45 UHERO State Forecast Update, Public Summary October 24, 2014; http://uhero.hawaii.edu/assets/14Q4StateUpdatePublicSummary.pdf, accessed October 26, 2014.military in Hawai'i Future defense spending cuts may negatively impact the state's economy. In 2014, federal government jobs continue to fall, although the pace of decline has slowed somewhat in the summer months. \"Since peaking in late 2012, federal government employ- ment in the state has fallen by nearly 2,000, with most of the losses concentrated in civilian Department of Defense positions.\"5 Hawai'i economic Indicators y ear-over- year Percent Change Real visitor spending Source: UHERO Hawai'i Innovation Assets Report 2014-15 5Hawai'i's emerging Innovation economy 7Hawai'i's emerging Innovation economy This report shows that approximately 200 new companies were established in 2013 in the innovation sectors in Hawai'i. These early stage companies represent an opportunity for rapid economic growth for the state as such companies have been shown to be engines of job creation and high value added economic impact.6 The Hawai'i Innovation Assets Report highlights the richness and diversity of the state's innovation economy. The state has a strong foundation in research through the discoveries and innovation activity of the University of Hawai'i and a broad range of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) related educational programs promoting and supporting the growth of a technically skilled workforce. There is a dynamic in firm birth that is necessary to understanding job creation\u2014specifically, the unique effect of new firms, or startups\u2014without startups, there would be no net job growth in the U.S. economy. This fact is true on average, but also is true for all but seven years for which the United States has data going back to 1977. Notably, data shows that, during recessionary years, job creation at startups remains stable, while net job losses at existing firms are highly sensitive to the business cycle. 6 Tim Kane, Kauffman Foundation Research Series: Firm Formation and Economic Growth the Importance of Startups in Job Creation and Job Destruction, 2010; http://www.kauffman.org/~/media/kauffman_org/research%20reports%20and%20covers/2010/07/firm_formation_importance_of_startups.pdf, accessed October 14, 2014. 8In addition, this report shows that there are almost 4,000 estab- lishments total in the state's innovation economy accounting for more than 40,000 jobs (>64,000 jobs if extended proprietors are included). More than 1,500 of these are what the authors of this report refer to as \"core\" technology companies. These establishments are primarily engaged in research and develop-ment, the manufacture of technology-based products or the provision of scientific or technical services. Establishments in the biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and bio-medical product development, communications technology and information services, computer and electronics manufacturing, software development, aerospace, defense and energy technology are included in the \"core\" category. These establishments provide employment for more than 20,000 highly skilled workers. Another 1,100 are establishments from a broad number of industry sectors that use technologies and facilitate their application to providing goods and services in the economy but do not develop novel or next generation technologies themselves. Examples of these establishments include medical laboratories, wireless communica-tion carriers, broadcasting and publishing, and engineering services. These establishments employ more than 14,000 skilled workers. Hawai'i has a vital creative, artistic and cultural economy that promotes innovation and includes establishments in such sectors as film and television production, music, digital media products such as gaming and mobile applications, animation and workforce development in these areas. In these sectors (and others like them) the creative economy overlaps with what this report calls Hawai'i's innovation economy and accounts for more 9,000 workers.Fostering innovative technology companies is challenging. To grow, these young companies often requires investment capital, access to a skilled and educated workforce and can benefit from mentor -ing programs and business incubators and accelerators that can help these new companies scale their businesses and contribute to the overall productivity of the economy. This report highlights a select number of these emerging com- panies as well as established organizations from diverse industries such as ocean science technologies, biotechnology, material science technology, energy technology, defense/ security and medical devices. The Department of Business Economic Development and Tourism (DBEDT), the University of Hawai'i and other organizations have taken a leadership role in establishing accelerators, incubators and funding sources for these emerging companies as may be seen in the Start Up Activity in Hawai'i section of this report. The following graphic depicts the key elements needed to support a research and innovation ecosystem in Hawai'i. CReA te A CommunIty-sHAReD GRowtH Pl An The innovation economy is made up a number of industry sectors that can provide opportunities for Hawai'i to diversify and strengthen productivity in the face of economic downturns or stagnating growth in the traditional established sectors of the economy. Hawai'i Innovation Assets Report 2014-15 9Innovation - A n ew engine of Growth Annu Al Jo B GRowtH, HA wAI'I veRsus nA tIonAl AveRAGe (2002-2012 A veRAGe)The innovation economy in Hawai'i is currently small relative to the developed industries of tourism, military, construction and manufacturing, however, the innovative sector is poised for growth and can offer diversity for the state's economy. Over the past decade the innovation economy has not performed as well as the rest of the Hawai'i's economy. In their initial report on Hawai'i's innovation economy7, DBEDT defined the innovative sector as being comprised of industries related to both the technology and creative industries (123 industries in all at the six digit level of the North American Industry Classification System or NAICS). The study found that the innova- tion economy lagged the total economy in annual job growth over the period 2002 through 2012. 7 DBEDT, The Innovation Sector in Hawai'i, 2013, pg. 5. 8 Ibid. 9 DBEDT, Hawai'i's Targeted & Emerging Industries, December 2012; accessed October 6, 2014. 10 DBEDT, The Innovation Sector in Hawai'i, 2013, pg. 12.11 Note: The Hawai'i Innovation Assets Report includes a subset of the creative sector industries DBEDT designated as being part of the innovation economy. See appendix for a more detailed explanation of the methodology.Hawai'i National Average The innovation economy outperformed the total economy in the few years prior to the recession, but has shown a slower recovery after the recession. In addition, the pronounced fluctuations in the innovation sector were attributed to ups and downs in sub-sectors such as alternate power generation and film production.8 The technology sector showed an average annual growth of 1.2 percent during the period 2002 through 2012, slightly lower than the civilian economy, whereas the creative sector grew faster than the civilian economy with 1.5 percent growth over the ten year period.9 Annual earnings in Hawai'i's innovation economy averaged just over $50,000 in 2012 or seven percent higher than the average of $47,300 for the overall Hawai'i economy.10 In both the DBEDT study and the current Hawai'i Innovation Assets Report, the innovation economy included both technology and creative industry sectors.11 Technology sector jobs show a higher average annual earnings compared to the average for Hawai'i's economy. 10HAwAI'I's te CHnoloGy se Cto R Jo Bs AnD eARnIn Gs The creative sector jobs show lower average annual earnings compared to the technology sector. The average annual earnings were $45,000 for the creative sector and were the same as the Hawai'i's national average in 2012.14 The earnings level is important for Hawai'i in that significant earnings gaps may fuel \"brain drain\" and make it challenging to retain skilled workers coming out of the state's educational system espe- cially in STEM fields. In addition, skilled workers in the technology sectors who have job experience in their field may be attracted by higher paying jobs in their field outside of the Hawai'i.According to a report by DBEDT12, the average annual wage earnings in Hawai'i's technology sector was $70,500 or 56 percent higher than that of the overall economy. Although the technology sectors annual earnings were higher than the average wage, they were below those of the U.S. average for those industry sectors. Biotechnology shows relatively high annual earnings in other regions such as San Diego and the nation overall, but was slightly more than $50,000 in Hawai'i. The authors of the study suggest this may be due to the number of the field workers employed in the corn seed research industry that makes up part of the state's biotechnology sector.13 12 DBEDT, Hawai'i's Targeted & Emerging Industries. 2012 Update Report; accessed August 10, 2014. 13 Ibid. 14 Ibid.Hawai'i Innovation Assets Report 2014-15 11As an extension and update to the previous data on technology sector jobs, CONNECT worked closely with the University of Hawai'i Economic Research Organization (UHERO) and the Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism (DBEDT) to compile a list of industries defined by NAICS. Previous reports and studies by DBEDT and other organizations were reviewed in consideration of industries classified as technology or creative sectors. CONNECT's experience measuring the innovation economy in San Diego and other regions was the primary subjective determinant in designating industry sectors as \"core tech,\" \"peripheral tech\" and \"creative.\" The industry codes and names come directly from NAICS. The industry sector grouping classification was created by CONNECT to create an \"umbrella designation\" for the various industry NAICS codes based on similar or related general business activities of the sub-industries. The industries included in the tables above were those whose NAICS codes showed more than ten employees. The data shown in the following tables and charts are from EMSI Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. The number of jobs by industry sector is shown (both excluding and including extended proprietors) as are the number of extended proprietors and the number of establishments. Extended proprietors are workers who are counted as proprietors, but classify the income as peripheral to their primary employment. Many industries (primarily oil and gas extraction, finance and insurance, and real estate) include people who are considered sole proprietors or part of a partnership, yet have little or no involvement or income in the venture. And an increasing number of people fall into this category (e.g., those who do freelance work on the side, like writers or musicians and software application (\"apps\") developers).Hawai'i Innovative economy - Industry sectors 12CoRe sCIen Ce/te CHnoloGy se Cto R We define \"core\" industries as those that are primarily engaged in technology research and development of manufactured products as well as professional and technical services. Examples include industries such as biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and biomedical product development, communications technology and information services, commercial physical research/scientific, technical services, computer and electronics manufacturing, software development, aerospace and defense, and energy. Hawai'i Innovation Assets Report 2014-15 13PeRIPHeRAl te CH se Cto R A broader sector includes industries that use technologies and facilitate their application to providing goods and services but whose focus is not developing new or next generation technologically. Examples here include medical laboratories, diagnostic imaging centers, wireless communications carriers, broadcasting and publishing, and engineering services. In their 2012 study \"Hawai'i's Technology Workforce Occupations and Projections\", DBEDT reported that while the core of the technology sector may be technical occupations, the technology sector is also highly dependent on administrative and managerial support occupations. \"For some key occupational groups, the technology sector is a major source of employment. For instance, the technology sector accounted for 44.9 percent of state total jobs in the computer and mathematical occupations, 36 percent total jobs in the architecture and engineering occupations, and 13.5 percent total jobs in the life, physical and social science occupations. This is important informa- tion for planning how the future occupational needs of technology can be met without unduly competing with other industries for key occupations.\" Hawai'i Innovative economy - Industry sectors 14CReA tIve se Cto R Although not the primary focus of this report in terms of highlighting key innovation assets in Hawai'i, the \"creative\" sector is included in terms of jobs and establishments that comprise Hawai'i's innovative economy. The uniqueness of Hawai'i's artistic and cultural sectors helps Hawai'i's creative products compete in worldwide markets, while also supporting visitor spending and developing the foundation of Hawai'i's creative economy. In addition, the creative industries and their workforce represent key sources of ideas, content creation for global export and provide the talent for Hawai'i's emerging technology and knowledge based industry sectors. The creative sector includes artistic and related technical activity resulting in artistic and entertainment products and services. These include not only live performances, but also digital products such as music, film, computer animation and computer gaming. In its most recent update report on the creative economy in Hawai'i, DBEDT notes that the priority focus by the State of Hawai'i on the creative sector is now on a number of key activi- ties for which Hawai'i has an established competitive advantage as well as areas based on emerging technology that can generate valuable exports and high paying jobs; including: Film and TV Music Digital media products (such as games and mobile applications) Animation Workforce development Hawai'i Innovation Assets Report 2014-15 15the Information t echnology and Innovation f oundation (ItIf), a w ashington D.C. based economic think tank, ranked Hawai'i 23rd out the 50 states based on an Innovation Capacity Index. this index is based on various innovation indicators shown in the table below. the state showed marked improvement in 2012 over the 2010 ranking of 41st. Innov AtIon CAPACIty InD ex: HA wAI'I's stRen GtHs AnD weAknesses 17 Most notable improvements were seen in the number of patents issued per 1,000 people in the workforce, which ranked fourth, industry research and development and the movement toward a green economy. Hawai'i's venture capital ranking fell as measured by the amount of venture capital invested as a percentage of worker earnings. Entrepreneurial activity ranking was down relative to 2010. Entrepreneurial activity was measured as the number of individuals starting new business as a percentage of the population. Promoting greater entrepreneurial activity and supporting the startup and early stage sectors of the innova- tion economy should be seen as a goal for the state to ensure greater diversity in the economy and retain both managerial and technical workforce talent. An educated and skilled workforce and a strong research capacity are foundational assets for Hawai'i upon which to build its emerging innovation ecosystem. Hawai'i's strengths and w eaknesses in Innovation 17 DBEDT, \"The Innovation Sector in Hawai'i, 2013, pg. 24. Data from ITIF (2012); accessed October 9, 2014. 16stem eD uCAtIon PRoGRAms The development and growth of STEM education is vital to ensure a skilled workforce for the state's innovation economy. Recognizing this need, the Maui Economic Development Board (MEDB) created the Women in Technology (WIT) initiative in 1999 to build and strengthen Hawai'i's STEM education-to-workforce pipeline by facilitating partnerships between educators and businesses. Following MEDB's groundbreaking statewide effort, many organizations began to increase their support of STEM-related activities. Although there is an abundance of programs and initiatives to encourage students to enter the STEM pipeline, like robotics program-ming for K-12 students, most of these efforts are run independently of one another. The Energy Excelerator at the Pacific International Center for High Technology Research (PICHTR) produced a comprehensive mapping of Hawai'i's STEM program. These findings highlight the wide range of existing programs and gaps that remain for the state to address to strengthen the pipeline of a skilled workforce for Hawai'i's innovation economy. For the report, go to: http://www.energyexcelerator.com/publications/ ReseARCH In addition, many of the state's research and education assets are highlighted in the following sections of this report. The University of Hawai'i is a core research asset for the state and produces world-class research, especially in the areas of astronomy and space sciences, ocean and earth sciences, and health sciences. Research can fuel innovative technologies that can be commercialized by both entrepreneurial ventures and existing industry. Innov AtIve te CHnoloGy ComPAnIes A number of emerging and established innovation companies are featured in this report highlighting a broad range of technological innovation that is being produced in the state. These companies reflect a number of Hawai'i's emerging technology sectors spanning industries ranging from sustainable energy, engineering, defense, medical imaging, biotechnology, medical devices, biofuels from algae, ocean sciences, smart grid, nanotechnology, defense and space technologies (dual technologies), agriculture, information and computer technologies, as well as imaging (photonics) and sensor technologies. In this report these featured companies are grouped under these emerging technology sectors: Aerospace and Space Science Agricultural Biotechnology and Agribusiness Biotechnology and Biomedical Technology Information and Communications Technology and Cybersecurity Ocean Science and Technology Photonics and Sensor Technologies Renewable Technologies The diversity of innovative technologies and their application in providing solutions to a wide array of problems and opportunities is promising. A number of these companies are commercializing research that was developed at the University of Hawai'i. This underscores the importance of continued support for research and discovery in the lab and the creation and development of capital funding, incubator and accelerator program support for early stage innovation companies.Hawai'i Innovation Assets Report 2014-15 1718 Note that the DBEDT study (2012) uses a broader range of sub-sector industries than that used in this Innovation Assets report (2014). 19 DBEDT, The Innovation Sector in Hawai'i, 2013, pg. 17. Data from ITIF (2012); accessed October 9, 2014. 20 Ibid.ImPACt of HA wAI'I's Innov AtIon eConomy The impacts of the innovation economy (as a traded economy) are larger than the direct job and output impact of its activities. Intra- and inter-industry purchases of inputs that are related to the outputs and increased household spending create a larger impact on the overall economy. In their 2012 study on the innovative sector18 in Hawai'i, DBEDT estimated the total impact of the innovation economy on Hawai'i's economic output to be almost $16 million in 2012. This represented 13.7 percent of the state's estimated economic output. The sector generated an estimated $9.4 billion GDP impact accounting for 13.3 percent of total estimated GDP in 2012.19 Including direct, indirect and induced impact the innovation economy accounted for an estimated 13.8 percent of total jobs (118,300), 14.2 percent of labor earnings ($5.4 billion) and 15.1 percent of total tax revenue ($940 million).20Hawai'i's strengths and w eaknesses in Innovation 18Jobs in Hawai'i's Innovation sector 19Jobs in Hawai'i's Innovation sector In the state's innovation economy, the total number of jobs including extended proprietors is nearly 65,000. If extended proprietors are excluded, the total is approximately 44,000 or 6.5 percent of the total number of civilian workers in Hawai'i's economy in 2013. The core tech sector accounted for almost half of Hawai'i's innova- tion economy jobs in 2013 (excluding extended proprietors) and included 1,552 establishments or almost 40 percent of the state's innovation economy establishments. When extended proprietors are included, the core tech sector accounts for one-third of the number of extended proprietors in the innovation economy and just over 42 percent of the jobs. The peripheral tech sector accounted for one-third of Hawai'i's innovation economy jobs in 2013 (excluding extended proprietors) and included 1,156 establishments or almost 30 percent of the state's innovation economy establishments. When extended pro- prietors are included, the peripheral tech sector accounts for 10 percent of the number of extended proprietors in the innovation economy and 25 percent of the jobs.The creative sector accounted for more than 20 percent of Hawai'i's innovation economy jobs in 2013 (excluding extended proprietors) and included 1,284 establishments or almost one-third of the state's innovation economy establishments. The creative sector accounts for almost 60 percent of the number of extended proprietors in the innovation economy and one-third of the jobs, when extended proprietors are included. The breakdown of the \"core technology,\" \"peripheral tech\" and \"creative sectors\" are shown in the table below. The following table shows the number of jobs both excluding and including extended proprietors and the number of establishments by industry sector grouping. If one considers the innovation econ- omy industry groups while excluding the extended proprietors, the industry groups accounting for the greatest number of jobs are communications and IT technology (6,140), engineering services (5,933), U.S. federal (STEM-related jobs, 5,841), software (4,194) and life sciences (biomedical, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and chemicals, 3,987).If extended proprietors are included in the job totals, the performing arts and related creative sectors with their relatively high percentage of extended proprietors come to the fore with 9,345 jobs. The same is true for commercial physical research and scientific and technical/non-technical services sector with 7,221 jobs including extended proprietors. 2021 The employment figures include extender proprietors.Hawai'i's innovation sectors have shown modest growth since 2001, with the total innovation economy expanding from 57,250 jobs in 2001 to 63,300 in 2013. That .84 percent annual growth was less than the 1.26 percent growth of the rest of Hawai'i's economy. The following chart shows the change in jobs21 from 2001 through 2013 for the sectors of the innovation economy. *Note: figures excluded corn farming, which accounted for 1,200 jobs in 2013 bringing the total number of jobs in Hawai'i's innovation economy to 64,448.Hawai'i Innovation Assets Report 2014-15 21JoBs In HA wAI'I's Innov AtIon se Cto R - By InD ustR y se Cto R The creative sector is large in terms of the number of jobs, particularly in the performing arts. The communication technology and IT sector has shown a drop in the number of jobs since 2001. Commercial research and technical services has seen a steady rise in the number of jobs over the period as has business, market and technical consulting services and the software sectors. The energy sector showed a modest increase in the number of jobs up to 2009 before dropping in 2010. The number employed in the energy sector as grown steady between 2010 and 2013. The biomedical products sector showed modest growth as did design services. The remaining sectors showed relatively flat growth over the past decade.Jobs in Hawai'i's Innovation sector Innov AtIon eConomy emPloyment B y County The majority of the jobs in Hawai'i's innovation economy are located in Honolulu County (75 percent). Maui County accounts for more than 6,800 jobs (11 percent), Hawai`i County 6,140 jobs (10 percent) and Kaua'i County 2,662 (four percent). The tables and charts below shows the number of jobs (including extended proprietors), number of establishments and number of extended proprietors for each county. 22Honolulu County As one would expect given the relative size of Honolulu County, it accounts for most of the technology jobs and a large proportion of the creative sector jobs. The 74 percent share of total innovation jobs for Honolulu is the same as its share of the State's total non-farm job count. Communications technology and information services, engineering, and U.S. federal (STEM), performing arts and related creative, and commer - cial physical research and technical services account, software, and consulting services sectors account most of the innovation economy jobs. Marketing services (peripheral tech) account for almost 3,000 jobs. The biomedical products sector is several times larger than the more embryonic biotechnology sectors.

Communications and information services jobs made up the third largest innovation sector in the county. Hawai'i County has several hundred engineering, energy, marketing services, software, and biomedical sector jobs as well. Over one hundred biotech/pharma/chemical sector jobs are found in the county as well as a similar number of sports and active lifestyle sector jobs. 25Innovation economy employment by County kaua'i County KAuA'I CouNty Jobs by INdustry seCtorKaua'i County accounts for more than four percent of the state's innovation economy jobs.

These are companies that can nimbly innovate and commercialize new technologies. They tend to have around two employees at their start, but with sufficient capital infusion and a skillful management team can scale their businesses quickly. This creates both essential job growth as well as increasing the state's tax base. In the innovation economy, establishing a robust pipeline of these companies is important to a regions' competitiveness. As is noted throughout this report a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem requires the collaborative interaction among a number of different parts and constituents. Higher education can provide skilled workers and emerging entrepreneurs. These entrepreneurs can benefit greatly from mentor - ing by local business leaders. Government leaders need to be made aware of the importance and interdependence of the elements of a successful innovation economy, and provide support to grow new companies. Investors are a key element to help startups cross the \"Valley of Death\" as they seek to prove their business models in the marketplace. Sponsors may include organizations that support groups that focus on assisting startups and early stage companies such as incubators, accelerators and industry trade organizations. eNtrepreNeurIAl eCosysteMentrepreneurial Development Programs InItIA tIves AnD Investment funDs Hawai'i Angels Hawai'i Angels was founded by Robert Robinson PhD, a former Harvard Business School professor and nationally recognized expert on angel investing. Through his lead- ership, the Hawai'i Angels network has become highly successful and well recog-nized in the Honolulu business community and beyond. Since its founding in February 2002, the member angels have invested more than $30 million in over 60 companies. The organization provides a forum for its members to review investment presentations and share opinions about these opportunities. This forum also allows for networking with professionals of various backgrounds and exploring new opportunities in Hawai'i.

HI Growth Initiative The HI Growth Initiative is a comprehensive investment program that represents a new approach to re-invigorate state efforts to fuel an innovation economy. The HI Growth Initiative, overseen by the Hawai'i Strategic Development Corporation, engages with the private sector to startup and to grow creative and innovative businesses that can create high-wage jobs for Hawai'i. The objective of the HI Growth Initiative is to develop investment capacity in Hawai'i along the continuum of financing for startups: commercialization, business formation, and early stage growth. This effort will allow Hawai'i to leverage the research funds invested in Hawai'i and the respective Hawai'i Targeted Investment Programs (HiTIP) established by Hawai'i's key institutional investors, the Employees Retirement System and Kamehameha Schools. HSDC was allocated $13.2 million from the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). The State Legislature appropriated $2 million for the Launch Akamai Venture Accelerator Program (LAVA) and $6 million for the HI Growth Initiative. HSDC has combined these funding sources under the HI Growth Initiative to implement a comprehensive investment program that generates a critical mass of startup activity that will attract private capital to invest in Hawai'i. Earlier this year, Hawai'i committed to giving $4.5 million to a startup venture , called Startup Capital Ventures II, between the state and California that will provide investment capital to help Isle technology companies grow in size. The HI Growth Initiative has already invested in Honolulu-based venture accelerator, Blue Startups, which provides pre-seed capital to startups, and Maui-based mbloom Fund I, which provides expansion capital. These funds, together with the University of Hawai'i research commercialization fund, UPSIDE Fund II, create a pipeline of compa-nies for prospective investments by Startup Capital Ventures. The increase in activity in the innovation ecosystem, spurred by HI Growth Initiative investments, has led to the community's adoption of \"Startup Paradise\" to brand Hawai'i as an innovation hub. Grass roots efforts have resulted in Startup Weekend events, pitch events, co-working spaces, and other efforts to increase entrepreneurial capacity. mbloom mbloom is Hawai'i's first dedicated early stage technology investment fund. mbloom was created to fill the gap between seed and follow on financing without leaving the state. It seeks to identify and nurture Hawai'i based entrepreneurs, thereby helping to develop and grow Hawai'i's technology infrastructure. mbloom's first fund, mbloom1, is a $10 million fund that closed at the beginning of 2014. 30The Maui-based mbloom will target early- stage Hawai'i technology companies, including those that are supported by the state's HI Growth Initiative programs such as Blue Startups, Hawai'i's first technology venture accelerator. The fund is being managed by Maui entrepreneur Arben Kryeziu and his partner, Nick Bicanic, in California. Typical mbloom investments range in value from $50,000 to $250,000. mbloom1 funds are supported by participation by the Hawai'i Technology Development Corporation (HTDC) and private investor capital. Working with a unique network of specialized busi-ness consultants and professional services providers, mbloom helps entrepreneurs secure investment, build their products, create customer acquisition and go-to-market strategies, and achieve milestones in their professional journeys. meDB k e Alahele education fund In 2006, the Maui Economic Development Board (MEDB) created the MEDB Ke Alahele Education Fund as a grant-making vehicle which channels community investment that enhance STEM education and broaden career pathways in the Maui County.

Hawai'i Innovation Assets Report 2014-15 43oCeAn sCIen Ce AnD teCHnoloGy Hawai'i oceanic technology, Inc. Hawai'i Oceanic Technology, Inc. offers a new generation deep ocean fish farming (mariculture) technology that can help meet growing demand for seafood in an environ- mentally responsible manner. Aquaculture is a $100 billion industry that now provides half of all seafood consumed in the world. Almost one third of wild caught ocean species are being depleted beyond sustain-ability according to the UN Food Agriculture Association. A substantial amount aquacul-ture production globally is done on land and requires fresh water, quickly becoming scarce and costly. It is time to turn to the ocean to farm seafood in a sustainable manner if we are to meet the world's growing demand for seafood. Hawai'i Oceanic Technology, Inc. has created the Oceansphere . A revolution in open ocean aquaculture technology, the Oceansphere makes farming fish in the open ocean a practical reality. Self-sustaining and untethered to the ocean floor, the Oceansphere is designed to produce large harvests in a very small footprint. For example, twelve Oceanspheres in less than half of a square mile can yield as much as 24,000 tons of seafood. Hawai'i Oceanic Technology's patented design includes innovations that pertain to robotics, geostatic positioning, inertial navigation telemetry and environmentally responsible fish rearing. By leveraging such breadth of expertise and intellectual prop-erty, the Oceansphere is able to support a self-sustaining deep water environment nearly twice as large as any contemporary tethered cage. The massive scale and deep water operation of this technology affords many benefits, all of which combine to provide an economically viable and envi-ronmentally sustainable method to meet society's ever-growing demand for seafood.makai ocean engineering Makai Ocean Engineering was founded in 1973 as a diversified ocean engineering company focused on providing design engi-neering and development services to a broad range of clientele both foreign and domestic.

Their compact, lightweight systems use advanced hyper - spectral imaging (HSI) and optical sensing technologies to provide trace level detection and analysis. For the military and first responders, detect-ing and identifying a potentially hazardous material requires proximal sensors. This means the user must get up close and per - sonal with something that may turn out to be highly dangerous. Since proximal sensors were first used, people have sought a way to enable detection and identification from greater, and safer, distances. By its inherent nature, hyperspectral imaging makes remote and standoff detection and analysis possible. Hyperspectral imaging provides a greater depth of information about a single pixel than is possible with other analysis tech- niques. In consequence, hyperspectral imag-ing is able to differentiate specific materials from a similar background. Since their founding in 2008, Spectrum Pho- tonics has been awarded more than twenty SBIR Phase I, II, and III contracts as well as other DoD sponsored awards. Under these contracts, Spectrum Photonics has developed custom hyperspectral imaging and optical sensors for use in handheld, ter - restrial, aerial, and underwater detection and identification operations. Each system's size, weight, and power (SWaP) trade-offs are optimized for the specific application.

As the largest research enterprise in the state, uH is essential to achieving this. the university of Hawai'i also has the most critical role in educating and training Hawai'i citizens to lead and participate in this sector. Recently, uh has taken on a greater role to help diversity the state's economy through the hawai'i innovation initiative. the university of hawai'i has part- nered with the local business community to help leverage its research to create and attract new companies, cultivate talent for a knowledge based economy and encourage the development of future technologies. the common goal is to build a thriving research enterprise that will be driven by the growth of new industries including a robust advanced manufacturing community in hawai'i, fueled by uh's plans to aggressively commercialize its research and to employ and develop to researchers in several focus areas over the next decade. a key strategy is to emphasize the creation of innovation clusters or hubs capable of linking fundamental scientific discovery with the applied research and develop- ment as well as training necessary for technological innovation and economic development. Consistent with work over many years to identify areas of estab- lished and/or emerging excellence, the hawai'i innovation initiative will focus on the following hubs: astronomy, ocean sciences, health sciences and wellness, data intensive sciences and engineering, agriculture and sustainability sciences\u2014including energy.ReseARCH Aw ARDs B y sou RCe, 2010-14 ($ mIllI ons) Note: Includes both research and training Source: UH Office of Research Services Figure 1, above, shows a break- down of how that $2.32 billion in direct total expenditures is divided among the different UH entities. Non-research spending (mostly instructional expendi-tures) represents nearly half of all UH-related spending (48.8 percent). Spending on research activities and student expen-ditures were at a close second 23.0 percent and 25.8 percent, respectively. All other categories combined comprised less than three percent of the total. Table 1, below, details these expen-ditures. These numbers can also be used to illustrate $376 million in State General Fund expenditures into $1.47 (=1.84 billion - $376 million) billion dollars of related research and educational expenditures.Research, Innovation and entrepreneurship Photo credit: UH Cancer Center vIsItors, 0.6% uH University of Hawai'i generates eco- nomic activity through its purchases from local businesses, its w to its employees, and spending by students and visitors. Total UH related expenditures (including visitor spending) were $2.32 billion in FY 2012, $1.84 billion of which was spent locally. Together with additional indirect and induced benefits from these activities, UH had a total impact of $3.61 billion on Hawai'i's economy. Each UH-related dollar spent generates $1.96 of total business sales, $0.59 of employee earnings, and $0.11 of state revenues in Hawai'i in FY 2012; and each million dollars of spending generates 15 jobs in Hawai'i. The $2.32 billion of education-related expenditures attributable to UH generated $3.61 billion in local business sales, $1.10 billion in employee earnings, $194 million in state tax revenues, and over 28,500 jobs in Hawai'i in FY 2012. Each dollar of State General Fund spending on UH translates into $9.61 of total business sales, $2.91 of employee earnings, and $0.52 of state taxes in Hawai'i. For every dollar of state funds spent on UH, the University was able to leverage an additional $4.90 of spending in the state. 22eConomIC ImPACt of tHe u nIveRsIty of HA wAI'I CReA tIn G Jo Bs AnD GeneRA tIn G In Come One can think of the University of Hawai'i as if it were one of many businesses or industries in Hawai'i. It produces education and research services as its primary out-puts. It produces entertainment and sports services, consulting services, health care, housing, and food services. Its customers include students, visitors, private business- es, governments, and the general public. It attracts customers worldwide, many of whom stay for four or more years, as well as serves the local community.An important difference between the University of Hawai'i and a private business is that UH gets a substantial part of its funding from taxpayers. In FY 2012, the University of Hawai'i and the supporting RCUH (Research Corporation of the University of Hawai'i) spent a total of $1.7 billion in support of its educational mission; the State General Fund paid $376 million of the total. The difference between what the State General Fund paid for and the total amount spent by UH ($1.7 billion - $376 million = $ 1.3 billion) was paid for by government research and training grants, revolving funds (e.g., bookstore revenues), special funds (e.g., tuition and fees), and federal matching grants (e.g., U.S. Department of Agriculture Hatch and Smith-Lever funds). Adding money spent by the privately funded University of Hawai'i Foundation, spending by students on items other than tuition, fees, dorm fees, and books, out-of-town visitor spending related to UH sponsored professional meetings and conferences brings total UH-related expenditures to $2.32 billion locally.

Chaminade university Chaminade University, the only Catholic university in Hawai'i, offers 23 undergraduate degree programs on the main Honolulu campus, seven graduate degree programs and 14 degree opportunities for working adults, through evening and weekend courses in satellite locations and online. Chaminade University offers the distinct advantage of size: small. Students can work closely with excellent faculty, peers, and business mentors, in a highly collaborative environment. The Hogan Entrepreneurial program is another opportunity for those pursuing business knowledge, a close-up look at how to get a new idea off the ground. Alumni have described these programs as \"intimate, yet professional.\" Brigham young university - Hawai'i Brigham Young University\u2014Hawai'i is the preeminent inter - national center of learning in the Pacific. Its small campus is a unique laboratory of intercultural leadership development, where a diverse population of 2,500 students representing over 70 countries live, study, and work together. Small classes taught by expert faculty empower students to master challenging and relevant curriculum, while affordable tuition, financial aid, and online study options make this valuable education more accessible than ever. Operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a total BYU-Hawai'i education involves not only intellectual learning and career preparation, but also moral, ethical, and spiritual enrichment. Hawai'i state Department of education The Hawai'i State Department of Education (DOE) is the ninth-largest U.S. school district and the only statewide educational system in the country. It is comprised of 255 schools and serves more than 183,000 students. Hawai'i Association of Independent schools Established in 1969, the Hawai'i Association of Indepen-dent Schools (HAIS) is comprised of over 100 private and/ or independent schools with a combined enrollment of over 40,000 students statewide. Member schools include several of the largest independent schools in the nation to some of the smallest. the growth of Hawai'i's innovation economy depends on the development of a skilled workforce, especially in the science, technology, engineering and math fields and entrepreneurial training programs. the following institutions train thousands of undergraduate and undergraduate students, as well as primary and secondary students. 52featured Research and Innovation Assets 53scalable Adaptive Graphics environment ( sAGe) Next generation collaboration and visualization software infrastructure Jason Leigh, Laboratory of Advanced Visualization and Applications Photo credit: Jason Leigh, UH/UIC \"A picture is worth a thousand words\" is an old adage. But with the help of technologies developed by visualization experts like University of Hawai'i at Ma \u00afnoa Information and Computer Sciences Professor Jason Leigh, pictures are now worth a whole lot more. As researchers around the world begin to work more closely with each other to solve complex problems, collaborative scientific visualization environments comprised of ultra-resolution tiled display walls interconnected by optical networks, are becoming vital for data sharing and analysis.This virtual environment is provided by SAGE (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment), a software system developed by Leigh, then director of the prestigious Electronic Visualization Lab and Software Technologies Research Center at the University of Illinois at Chicago. It enables users to access, display and share a variety of data-intensive information, in a variety of resolutions and formats, from multiple sources, on tiled display walls. Information displayed can be digital- cinema animations, high-resolution images, high-definition video conferences, presentation slides, documents and spreadsheets. The SAGE software is the National Science Foundation's de facto standard for driving ultra-high resolution display walls and is currently in use by over 100 top research and industrial organizations worldwide, including Monsanto and Japan's NTT. Building on the highly successful CAVE (Computer Assisted Virtual Environment), Leigh's recent CAVE2 is the next generation, large-scale, virtual-reality system that allows researchers to completely immerse themselves in a seamless 2D/3D environment of visual information.\"The CAVE2 technology helps to bring science to the big screen,\" said Leigh. \"It allows the study of worlds too small, too large, too danger - ous or too complex to be viewed otherwise, like the hostile surface of a distant planet or the intricate system of arteries in the human body.\"Leigh's technologies are already being utilized by UH researchers including Karen Meech at the Institute for Astronomy and by world- renowned oceanographer David Karl at the Center for Microbial Oceanography: Research and Education (C-MORE). \"Jason Leigh is a terrific addition to the UH ohana,\" said Karl, the director of C-MORE. \"We already have plans for a meaningful col- laboration between his new visualization team and C-MORE scientists, who will soon be able to display our marine microbial genomics and biogeochemical datasets in vivid 3-D.\" To further assist researchers in applying cyber infrastructure and visualization technologies to improve research and scholarship, construction is underway for the Laboratory for Advanced Visualization and Applications (LAVA). LAVA will research, develop and commercialize visual analysis technologies and train current and future generations of students, faculty and companies in the skill of big data visualization. According to Leigh, the future goal of LAVA is to attract funding to research and develop the next generation of CAVE2 technology for Hawai'i, called CANOE (Collaborative, Analytics, Navigation and Observation Environment).

C-MORE Hale Photo credit: UH \"Marine microorgan- isms sustain planetary survival. They produce most of the oxygen we breathe,\" said David M. Karl, director for the Center for Microbial Oceanography: Research and Education (C-MORE) at the University of Hawai'i at Ma \u00afnoa (UH Ma \u00afnoa). \"They capture solar energy, produce food and sequester carbon dioxide, yet we are largely ignorant about how they live and interact.\" It is this ignorance on the part of science that has led Karl to delve deeper into one of the ocean's last remaining mysteries. Invisible to the naked eye, marine microbes produce nearly half of the Earth's oxygen supply. They consume many pollutants of human activities and serve as the base of the marine food chain. Unlocking the secrets of these infinitesimal sea creatures and their roles in nature, will have a tremen- dous impact on the environment, marine industries and medicine. A microbial biologist and oceanographer in UH Ma \u00afnoa's School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, Karl was instrumental in the establishment of an open ocean time-series station, known as HOT Station ALOHA, in the subtropical North Pacific as a sentinel for observing the effects of climate on the structure and function of microbial communities. He has participated in more than 100 major oceanographic cruises and submersible dives around the world to identify new microbes that live in harsh environments. Since joining UH Ma \u00afnoa in 1978, Karl has been principal investigator on more than 80 grants bringing over $70 million in federal and foun- dation funds to the University. Additionally, he has brought in over $50 million to support various research vessels and submersibles used in his own research. In 2006, Karl was awarded a 10-year $36.8 million National Science Foundation (NSF) grant that led to the establishment of C-MORE, one of only 17 NSF Science and Technology Centers in the nation. C-MORE is an interdisciplinary partnership led by UH Ma \u00afnoa that includes the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), University featured Research and Innovative Assets 54of California at Santa Cruz, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Oregon State University, Columbia University and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. In 2010, the center moved into its 27,000-square-foot permanent home located in UH Ma \u00afnoa's newest research facility, the Daniel K. Inouye C-MORE Hale, named after the late U.S. senator from Hawai'i. \"Senator Inouye was a champion of C-MORE because he was impressed by UH's world-class expertise in microbial oceanography,\" said Vassilis L. Syrmos, vice president for Research and Innovation at the University of Hawai'i. \"He also understood the importance of this research, its significance to the environment and its future potential in healthcare and other industries.\" C-MORE investigators are recognized leaders in the field and their research has appeared in over 600 scientific papers and published in many leading journals. It is also home to four elected members of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), including Karl, C-MORE Co-Director Edward DeLong, and MIT's Sallie Chisholm and Ed Boyle. Karl, Chisholm and Woods Hole's John Waterbury are also recipients of NAS medals of distinction. In 2013, President Barack Obama presented Chisholm with the National Medal of Science, the nation's highest honor in science and engineering, for her research on the ocean phytoplankton Prochlorococcus \u2014 the world's smallest, yet most abundant, photosynthetic organism. In addition to its primary research function, C-MORE has taken an active role in increasing scientific literacy about microbial oceanog- raphy among the general population, as well as training microbial oceanographers. It offers undergraduate internships, a summer graduate training course, a Native Hawaiian outreach program and provides resources for K-12 educators, including training workshops, science kits, and a teacher-at-sea program. \"C-MORE was created to explore the enormous and mostly uncharted biodiversity in the sea,\" added Karl. \"But it is the dedicated efforts and accomplishments of our investigators and staff that garnered us inter - national attention and helped us to establish the University of Hawai'i as the world's leading institution in microbial oceanography.\"In June of last year, the Simons Foundation awarded Drs. Edward DeLong and David Karl, $40 million to lead the Simons Collaboration on Ocean Processes and Ecology (SCOPE), making it the largest private foundation gift UH has ever received. SCOPE is one of the programs of the Simons Foundation's division of Life Sciences, which aims to advance basic research in life sciences. \"We are incredibly grateful to the Simons Foundation for this remark- able investment in Ed's and Dave's work,\" said David Lassner, president of the University of Hawai'i. \"Private funding is increasingly essential to our ability to recruit, retain and support our world-class faculty so that UH can advance research and innovation in Hawai'i.\" Source: Eric R.

Photo credit: UH \"Build it and they will come\" is often attributed to the famous baseball film Field of Dreams, but it also fittingly describes the remarkable story of the Daniel K. Inouye College of Pharmacy (DKICP) at the University of Hawai'i at Hilo. In the movie, its main character set out to build a baseball field in an Iowa cornfield. For UH Hilo, its protagonist was the late U.S. senator from Hawai'i and his dream to establish a pharmacy school in Hilo. \"Building a high-quality college of pharmacy on Hawai'i island was part of Senator Inouye's vision to encourage better health care throughout the Pacific region and throughout the neighbor islands of Hawai'i,\" said Donald Straney, UH Hilo chancellor. \"His vision was that each neighbor island would harbor a center of excellence, that every island should have its own specialty. The specialty for Hawai'i island envisioned by Senator Inouye was our own college of pharmacy.\"Opening doors to its first cohort of 90 students in August 2007, DKICP's humble beginnings were literally and figuratively true. Spread across over five different locations, the administration was housed in a county building a few miles away that was built in 1920, research labs were located seven miles out of town in buildings constructed in the 1960s and temporary classrooms were located on the campus outskirts. Despite these less than ideal arrangements, DKICP flourished to become one of the fastest growing programs in the UH System with enrollment reaching 360 students in its first five years of existence. In 2012, a year after graduating its inaugural class and in its first year of eligibility, the college was ranked as one of the top five new schools of pharmacy by U.S. News & World Report. Much of this success can be attributed to the leadership of John Pezzuto, founding dean of DKICP, who was recently presented with the 2014 Volwiler Research Achieve- ment Award for his outstanding research and contributions to the field of natural product drug discovery. It is the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy's top research award. \"Despite the many challenges and hurdles that Dean Pezzuto and his staff have had to overcome in establishing a college of pharmacy from the ground up, they have successfully met every benchmark set,\" said Matthew Platz, vice chancellor for Academic Affairs at UH Hilo. \"His knowledge, leadership and vision make it very viable for us to set our sights on becoming one of the top 25 pharmacy schools in the nation.\" DKICP has added to its doctor of pharmacy program with a bachelor of arts in pharmacy studies, a master of science in clinical psychophar - macology and a doctor of philosophy in pharmaceutical sciences. Plans are in the works offer a doctorate in physical therapy as well.Hawai'i Innovation Assets Report 2014-15 55As the only college of pharmacy in the Pacific region accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education, DKICP has brought in more than $50 million of economic activity per year in the state, according to an independent study by UH Hilo Economic Professor David Hammes. Also contributing to economic development is the work being done by faculty researchers to expand the state's research capacity. UH Hilo's researchers are working on drug development to fight malaria; ways to reverse the progression of cancerous tumors; understanding diseases of the central nervous system; the cellular process implicated in many diseases; disease tolerance in native Hawaiian bird populations; antitumor drug development; and drugs for use in tuberculosis and malaria. These projects, funded by the National Institutes of Health, allow UH Hilo to collaborate with UH Ma \u00afnoa on biomedical research, strengthening research capacity not only for the DKICP but for the entire state. DKICP is also working to save millions of dollars in Hawai'i health care costs. One its most successful programs is Pharm2Pharm, a pharmacist-care system established in 2012. The $14.3 million federally funded program is designed to reduce medication-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits by establishing teamwork between hospital and community pharmacists in rural counties of Hawai'i Island, Maui and Kauai. The program, developed by Professor Karen Pellegrin, founding director of the Center for Rural Health Sciences, is expected to save over $27 million across the state.For UH Hilo, the holidays arrived early this year courtesy of the state legislature. This past April, lawmakers approved $33 million in funding for the University to proceed with the construction of a permanent building to house the Daniel K. Inouye College Pharmacy. The funds were released by the lieutenant governor's office in October. Build it and they will come. Source: Eric R. Matsunaga, University of Hawai'i Office of the Vice President for Research and Innovation - May 23, 2014 Prospective motion Correction technology for mRI Advanced technology allows MRI scans in children and patients who move Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has revolutionized the practice of medicine by giving physicians the unparalleled capability to evaluate the structure, physiology and function of the living human brain. Despite continuing advances in image quality and acquisition speeds, current MRI examinations can easily be compromised by a patient's movement. It is estimated that one in five MRI scans are repeated due to patient movement, costing the global healthcare industry over $2 billion annually. However, a new prospective motion correction technology for MRI developed by Thomas Ernst, a professor and physicist at the University of Hawai'i at Ma \u00afnoa's John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM), may soon eliminate these staggering industry losses and give physi- cians razor-sharp images for more accurate diagnoses. This state-of-the-art technology involves a marker that is placed on the patient's head and allows the imaging to continuously track and adjust to the patient's movements in real-time, yielding brain images that are unaffected by motion. Its application is extremely useful for patients who are unable to control their movement during a scan, particularly children and the elderly, and those suffering from head trauma, de-mentia, and Parkinson's disease and brain tumors. Ernst's technology will also help reduce the need to sedate patients agitated by anxiety or pain, further decreasing costs and increased risks. \"The corrections are very fast and they are highly accurate,\" said Ernst. \"You can actually see people breathe when they are in the scanner.\"Ernst and the JABSOM Neuroscience and Magnetic Research team developed the motion-correction technology in collaboration with investigators at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, the Medical College of Wisconsin, the University of Freiburg and the University of Magdeburg. The project was made possible with the support of a $3.6 million multi-year grant from the National Institute of Health.To help commercialize the technology, a startup company called KinetiCor, Inc. was created in 2012 through funding from the University of Hawai'i Upside Venture Fund, the Hawai'i Medical Service Association and the Queen's Development Foundation. \"Blurring caused by patient motion remains one of the last unsolved problems in MR imaging and the largest challenge for obtaining qual-ity images,\" said Jeffrey Yu, president and CEO of KenetiCor, Inc. \"We are excited to be the University of Hawai'i's commercialization partner to bring this compelling technology to market.\" KinetiCor currently has its advanced prospective motion correction prototypes installed at a number of leading national and international magnetic resonance research centers, including the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Washington University in St. Louis. It has several world-renowned MR research centers are in its pipeline and has garnered the interests of MRI systems manufacturers looking to incorporate KinetiCor's technology into their MR scanners. It is ultimately aiming to receive clearance of the technology by the Food and Drug Administration for routine clinical MRI use.\"Prospective motion correction will have a huge impact for clinical MRI,\" added Ernst. \"With potential cost savings on the order of $2 billion per year, MRI scans may eventually become less expensive and therefore more affordable, which means more people can benefit from an MRI.\" Source: Eric R.

Unlike other national drug trials based on the mainland, this clinical trial is based in Hawai'i and is among the first to highlight Hawai'i as a growing healthcare center and focal point between Asia and the U.S. in the fight against cancer. The project also highlights the specialty inpatient unit at Queen's, where these early clinical trials can be safely performed.\"The medical community does not yet have an effective means of preventing bladder cancer from recurring with currently available treatments,\" said Professor Charles Rosser, a UH Cancer Center urologist and principal investigator of the trial. \"Finding an effective treatment would go a long way toward preventing more people from suffering from this disease.\"The trial will examine the efficacy of ALT-803, a drug created by Florida-based Altor BioScience Corp. In early studies, the drug showed strong potential to stimulate the body's immune system and create a protective and long-lasting effect against tumors. Altor BioScience has received a $1.2 million Small Business Innovation Research grant from the National Cancer Institute to test ALT-803 against non-muscle invasive bladder cancer for this Phase I/II trial.Patients will be treated at Queen's, in a six-bed unit located on the oncology floor. Queen's has the only inpatient clinical trials unit focusing on translational research in Hawai'i, in particular Phase I/II trials. \"This is the beginning of many future endeavors partnering with the UH Cancer Center to bring new cancer treatments/trials to Hawai'i,\" said Darlena Chadwick, vice president of patient care at Queen's. \"Thanks to the establishment of the Hawai'i Cancer Consortium, we are able to attract and recruit innovative researchers like Dr. Rosser, who will engage and work with our local physicians in order to bring their new treatments to the people of Hawai'i.\" Source: University of Hawai'i System News - August 20, 2014Hawai'i statewide Research and education Partnership JABSOM awarded $18.4 million grant to foster biomedical careers The University of Hawai'i at Ma \u00afnoa John A.

Despite these features making it a prime energy source, Hawai'i is one of the most oil-dependent states in the country, and this is partly due to inherent fluctuation in weather patterns that could leave one section of Hawai'i underpowered. Smart grids can address these issues by making sure power can be auto- matically regulated and redistributed. This capability would not only allow for more efficient maintenance, but it could also allow energy to redistribute itself to other locations, eliminating the wasted energy that is lost during storage. Smart grids are a nascent technology, however, and require much more research to optimize its capabilities and minimize adverse effects. The Hawai'i Natural Energy Institute (HNEI) is focusing on this smart grid solution by leveraging their interdisciplinary access to the best minds in energy solutions, as well as their collaborations with several major electric companies on the Hawaiian Islands. Energy companies and research institutes expect to see a 300 percent rise in renewable energy generation over the next 15 years, and HNEI is working hard to develop an infrastructure to maintain and accommodate Hawai'i's increasing energy independence. One of the projects HNEI is developing is the Smart Grid Inverter to mitigate adverse impacts of high penetrations of photovoltaic (PV) systems onto electric grids. This project is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the SEGIS-AC Program Office. The development and demonstration of the new inverter technology developed under this project will help to significantly reduce the integration and interconnection costs of future distributed PV systems, improve grid reliability for high-penetration PV, and aid commercialization of smart inverters. In collaboration with the Maui Electric Company (MECO), the Maui Smart Grid Project seeks to demonstrate the application of smart technology for helping greater renewable energy utilization and providing a variety of benefits for the MECO grid and its customers. MECO will achieve reduced costs, increased system reliability, improve- ments in power quality, and distribution and transmission system benefits. MECO customers will also have reduced costs and a more reliable utility. Successes in this project will yield similar benefits for utilities on the mainland facing problems with increased levels of renewable sources online. The Hawai'i Natural Energy Institute, located on the campus of the University of Hawai'i at Ma \u00afnoa, was established by the Legislature in 1974, in the aftermath of the world's first oil crisis, to seek new forms of energy that would supplant the nation's tremendous dependence on fossil fuels. HNEI has become an acknowledged international leader in the energy field, and has broadened its expertise to encompass the development of technologies that will enable us to tap our oceans for energy, food, minerals, and other resources.

Understanding how the heart and blood vessels respond to stress is the Center's central goal. Five principal investigators lead research in different aspects of cardiac function. These include the genetic response to low oxygen levels, how inflammation affects the heart and blood vessels, how diabetes damages the cardiovascular system, and how different kinds of cells in the heart \"choose their fate.\" Developing new therapies. Researchers are investigating ways to improve gene therapy to treat diseases. For example, they are de-veloping a new technology that directs genes to the heart and other organs, using microbubbles as a delivery system.

The Center trains graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and young investigators to develop the skills required to become independent investigators. They have also developed an innovative program to teach high school biology teachers about modern techniques in molecular biology. The CCR also provides research training for the new cardiology fellows at Queen's Medical Center, who represent the next generation of cardi-ologists in Hawai'i. Since Shohet's arrival in 2005, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has recognized the CCR's excellence with awards of more than $20 million to support recruitment of new faculty, training of young investigators, core equipment and technologies required for molecu- lar medicine, and ongoing research. Last year, Shohet was awarded an NIH training grant, the first at the JABSOM, to support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the CCR. Exciting research is underway and more advances are on the horizon, as CCR researchers are collaborating with an international network of investigators looking for greater understanding and improved preven-tion and treatment of heart disease. featured Research and Innovative Assets 58\"Every day we improve our understanding of how our heart works, how it goes wrong, and how to prevent and cure problems,\" said Shohet. \"These discoveries, involving what are the leading cause of death and disability in our community, are really what drive us and keeps us tap-dancing into work each morning.\" Source: John A.

Alexander Stokes, an assistant professor of cell and molecular biology at the John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM), developed the science for the drugs. Stokes worked on identifying a new target and set of effective therapeutic compounds for the treatment and prevention of cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, and associated pathologies. Makai Biotech- nology LLC was recently formed by Stokes and David G. Watumull, who serves as senior advisor and is also the CEO of Cardax, Inc., a publicly held life sciences company. Patent rights are pending. Many types of diseases ultimately affect the heart by making it work harder. The heart muscle compensates by getting bigger (cardiac hypertrophy). The heart becomes stiffer and less functional, and eventually starts to fail. \"We have a way of protecting the heart with a completely new therapeutic approach,\" Stokes said. \"This new therapy will allow the heart to compensate for the extra work it needs to perform, without losing function and failing.\"The new treatment method focuses on the regulation of the ion channel TRPV1. This ion channel is best known for being activated by capsaicin, the hot component of chili peppers. Stokes' lab at JABSOM recently published data that reveals that in pre-clinical trials, inhibi- tion of TRPV1 with a small molecule compound can protect the heart from the pathological and functional changes associated with cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure and associated pathologies. Makai Biotechnology LLC is licensing intellectual property from the University of Hawai'i's Office of Technology Transfer & Economic Development (OTTED). Makai Biotechnology LLC plans to establish alliances with major pharmaceutical companies to develop and test compounds from pre-clinical through phase II human clinical trials.Funding for the pre-clinical studies was provided through grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Hawai'i Community Foundation, totaling approximately $1 million over five years, ending 2015. One of the NIH grants was part of the Research Multidisciplinary and Translational Research Infrastructure Expansion (RMATRIX) program designed to aid translational research at JABSOM.\"It is a science researcher's dream to translate their work from the laboratory bench to the patient's bedside.\" said JABSOM Dean Jerris Hedges. \"The research underway by Dr. Stokes exemplifies this opportunity and advances our most important goal\u2014which is to provide results that will make life better for patients in Hawai'i.\"\"The collaboration between Dr. Stokes and Makai Biotechnology in developing and commercializing research that started at the University of Hawai'i could ultimately end up saving many lives,\" said UH Vice President for Research and Innovation Vassilis L.

In the payload bay was a nanosatellite call Ho`oponopono 2, or H2, constructed entirely by graduate and undergraduate engineering students at the UH Ma \u00afnoa Satellite Lab. When it safely reached orbit, H2 became the first UH-built satellite to circle the Earth and joined an elite group of student-designed orbiters to reach space. It was also the culmination of over three years of design and construction by over 30 students in the cutting-edge program established at UH Ma \u00afnoa by Electrical Engineering Professor Wayne Shiroma in 2001.With dimensions comparable to a loaf of bread, H2's experimental mission is to perform radar calibration and performance monitoring for U.S. Department of Defense radar stations that track various objects in space. That task was previously carried out for the past 20 years by RADCAL, a satellite that is 20 times larger and whose mission was 40 times more expensive than the $220,000 cost of H2. Source: Eric R.

Advanced cyberinfrastructure refers to high-performance computing systems, massive data storage systems and visualization environments, all linked together by software and high-performance networks to enable human collaborations that improve education and research productivity and enable breakthroughs not otherwise possible.The National Science Foundation awarded the group $5.3 million over two years to broaden cyberinfrastructure education and outreach through this network. In addition to Clemson and UH, the other col- laborating institutions are the University of Southern California, the University of Utah, the University of Wisconsin and Harvard University. \"Data-intensive science and engineering is a major thrust for the Hawai'i Innovation Initiative, and the advanced cyberinfrastructure facilitator capability that will be supported is exactly what we need to help many of our gifted faculty and students take their scholarship to the next level by leveraging local and national cyberinfrastructure and collaborations,\" said UH President David Lassner. Source: University of Hawai'i System News - March 6, 2014 Intelligent energy management technician t raining Program Preparing the Nation's Workforce for the New Energy Technology Ecosystem Smartphones, smart buildings and other intelligent technologies are quickly shaping today's world and will play a substantial role in future technologies and related industries. Maintaining a highly skilled and trained workforce to maintain these complex systems is crucial, especially in the intelligent or \"smart-grid\" power utilities sector. Responding to this challenge, the Pacific Center for Advanced Technol-ogy Training (PCATT) established the Intelligent Energy Management Technician Training Program, the first national curriculum developed to prepare technicians for careers in smart-grid technology. PCATT, headquartered at Honolulu Community College, is a consortium of the University of Hawai'i Community Colleges that provides leadership and training in advanced technologies to enhance economic and workforce development programs and initiatives in the state of Hawai'i. Development of PCATT's smart-grid curriculum was made possible by an $833,000 U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Smart Grid Workforce Development grant awarded to the consortium in 2010. The program was one of 33 projects selected by DOE to receive $41.6 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds for the development of new training programs, strategies and curricula related to the electric power and smart grid sectors. These select programs chosen to receive funding included projects at universities, community colleges and technical schools that served as models for training or retraining workers across the U.S. The awards also included support for Strategic Training and Education in Power Systems (STEPS) initiatives to develop cross-disciplinary electric power system programs at the university and college level.Creation of the program required the mobilization of utility and power systems experts, program managers, educational specialists and administrators to map out the education and training requirements to develop this innovative curriculum. This huge undertaking involved the development and/or modification of 21 undergraduate courses to address foundations in power engineering technology and the emerg-ing fields in distribution automation. As a result, PCATT offers two associate degrees and three certificates in intelligent energy systems. featured Research and Innovative Assets 60\"This program has positioned us to direct the training trajectory for the next generation workforce in Hawai'i and abroad,\" said Scott Murakami, director of Workforce Development at UH Community Colleges and former director of PCATT. \"It has also contributed significantly to our ability to prepare the local workforce to embrace the future of intelligent energy systems.\" To further enhance program training, an intelligent grid management laboratory was established at Leeward Community College's Office of Continuing Education and Workforce Development. It provides students with experience in managing a distributed power generation system in a realistic, real-time environment to help develop critical problem solving skills and solutions in time-sensitive situations involv- ing brown and black outs. \"Our analysis indicates that the existing smart grid curriculum devel- oped by University of Hawai'i represents content identified by both smart grid experts and broader energy workforce experts,\" said Joselito Lualhati and Christopher Anderson, grant commissioned evaluators from Global Skills X-change. \"In particular, the results indicate that UH Community College system's smart grid curricula address the skill gaps expressed by smart grid workforce experts across the country.\" Options that are being evaluated for next phase of the Intelligent Energy Management Technician Training Program grant include an expanded curriculum in areas of cyber and physical security, alternate power sources (wave, geothermal, nuclear), interoperability of micro grids; and the development of a national repository for smart grid instructional materials.

As a designated Navy-sponsored research laboratory administered by the University of Hawai'i System, ARL/UH conducts strategic research for the Navy, the Department of Defense and other government agencies in the areas of astronomy, ocean science, remote sensing, electro optics, and engineering support to sensors, communications and information technology. It is one of 13 University Affiliated Research Centers (UARC) within the Department of Defense and one of five centers contracted with the Navy. In September, the Office of Naval Research contracted with ARL/UH on $2.5 million energy research project to develop a power grid modernization strategy and action plan to meet the future needs of the Navy in Hawai'i, with a special focus on the reliability and power quality demands of electrical service to Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. The project will be conducted by the Hawai'i Natural Energy Institute's (HNEI) Grid System Technologies Advanced Research Team (GridSTART), which is focused on the integration and analysis of energy technolo-gies and power systems, including smart grid and micro grid applica-tions. Earlier this year, ARL/UH and HNEI received $9 million from the Naval Facilities Engineering Command to support industry testing of wave energy conversion devices at the Wave Energy Test Site located off Marine Corp Base Hawai'i (MCBH). When cabled to shore and connected to MCBH's power grid, the site will become the first grid-connected wave energy test site in the United States. Source: ARL/UH Daniel k . Inouye solar t elescope World's largest solar telescope will provide new answers in solar physics When completed in 2019, Hawai'i will be home to the largest and most powerful solar telescope in the world, with unprecedented abilities to view details of the Sun. The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST*) aptly reflects the late senator's forward-thinking commitment to science and technology. Using adaptive optics technology, DKIST will be able to provide the sharpest views ever taken of the solar surface, which will allow scientists to learn even more about the Sun and solar-terrestrial inter - actions. Astronomers will also be able to discover new information for understanding how our nearest star works, and for protecting the nation's vital space-based assets, the power grid and communication and weather satellites. One of the many barriers of astrophysics is that solar physicists have to cope with \"atmospheric seeing.\" Looking through Earth's atmosphere is similar to looking from the bottom of a swimming pool. Without corrective measures, current ground-based solar telescopes can reveal structures no smaller than a few hundred kilometers across the surface of the Sun. Orbiting telescopes have perfect \"seeing\" environments but are expensive and have limited lives. A larger telescope, like the DKIST, would solve this optical resolution problem and is anticipated to be a powerful tool for U.S. and interna-tional solar physics communities as their main ground-based facilities for several decades. Additionally, a ground-based telescope would mean that upgrades are easily and inexpensively installable as technology updates and progresses in the upcoming years. \"Funding for the construction of the DKIST is being provided by the National Science Foundation. Approximately half of the construction funding was received from the American Recovery and Reinvest-ment Act. Development of the DKIST on Haleakal will employ local construction firms and personnel in the erection of its structure and offer local high tech jobs during construction and the multi-decade operations phase of the facility,\" says Dr. Joseph McMullin, DKIST program director. The DKIST also represents a collaboration of 22 institutions. *The DKIST will also be known as the Advanced Technology Star Telescope (ATST), and is located at the Haleakala \u00af High Altitude Observatory.

There are more than 1,100 square miles of instrumented underwater range and more than 42,000 square miles of controlled airspace. This makes PMRF a premier facility for supporting operations which vary from small, single-unit exercises up to large scale, multiple-unit battle group scenarios. The mission of PMRF is to facilitate training, tactics development, and test and evaluations for air, surface, and sub-surface weapons systems and advanced technology systems. PMRF provides the full spectrum of instrument range support, including; radar, underwater instrumen- tation, telemetry, electronic warfare, target remote command and control, communications, target launching facilities, data display, data processing and target/weapon launching and recovery facilities. The headquarters and primary operation center of PMRF occupies approximately 1800 acres and is located on the western shore of the island of Kaua`i. PMRF features a state-of- the- art instrumentation suite and communication network.The PMRF range includes broad ocean areas to the north, south, and west with varying water depths from 400 to 2,500 fathoms. PMRF's relative isolation, ideal year-round tropical climate, and encroachment- free environment are significant factors in PMRF's excellent record for operation completions. PMRF's proximity to major Department of Defense installations and organizations, and to University of Hawai'i's ocean research facilities on Oahu, presents major cost and operational benefits to the range user. Transportation of project personnel, equipment, and materials is easily accommodated via commercial or military systems.

The state of Hawai'i has invested over $100 million since 1974 to create HOST Park, a unique outdoor demonstration site for emerging renewable and ocean-based technologies. Three sets of pipelines deliver deep sea water from a depth of 3,000 feet, as well as pristine sea surface water. Solar insolation is among the highest for coastal areas in the United States. The innovative green economic develop- ment park is administered by NELHA, a state of Hawai'i agency admin-istratively attached to DBEDT. After three decades, NELHA is well on track to fulfilling its mission as an engine for economic development. NELHA tenants employ over 300 people. Among them, 36 percent (or 117 employees) work for tenants who are either in research or education-related fields. Over a quarter of NELHA's tenants are involved in research activities. For example, larger research-oriented entities at NELHA are Cellana Inc.\u2014a developer of algae-based biofuels and bio-products; Moana Technologies LLC focuses on research and development in biotechnology; and the University of Hawai'i's Infrasound Laboratory, which provides and develops techni- cal expertise in the field of low frequency acoustics and conducts research into acoustic source processes. The estimated impact of NELHA's in-state expenditures in 2010 on the state's output (sales), earnings, and tax revenues was estimated to be $87.7, $24.7, and $4.5 million, respectively. Furthermore, not only do NELHA tenants employ hundreds of people, but their expenditures also contribute to hundreds of other jobs in the larger Hawai'i economy (583 total, including NELHA employees). Finally, NELHA receives on average about $2 million per year from the state. One way to look at the state's return on these expenditures is to consider what the state's investment has provided in terms of the net impact from NELHA. Every dollar the state spends on NELHA generates $42.8 of output in the Hawai'i economy. \"NELHA holds a unique place in the Pacific for energy and distributed energy applied research, demonstration, test and evaluation, and deployment of clean energy technologies. NELHA possesses an extraordinary combination of physical infrastructure and access to natural energy resource. (...)

The definition of high-tech occupations borrows from the list of \"technology-oriented workers\" de-fined by Daniel Hecker (2005). His definition includes the following occupations and occupation groups: Computer and Mathematical Occupations (SOC 15-000) Engineers (SOC 17-2000) Drafters, Engineering, and Mapping Technicians (SOC 17-3000) Life Scientists (SOC 19-1000) Physical Scientists (SOC 19-2000) Life, Physical, and Social Science Technicians (SOC 19-4000) Computer and Information Systems Managers (SOC 11-3020) Architectural and Engineering Managers (SOC 11-9040) Natural Science Managers (SOC 11-9120) The definition of creative workers borrows from the definition of the \"super creative core\" in Florida et. al (2008). Specifically, we include art, design, entertainment, sports, and media occupations (SOC 27-0000). In contrast to Florida, we exclude educa- tion, training and library occupations. data: EMSI Non-QCEW Self-Employed. selection Criteria: Nationally, high-tech jobs account for ~5.1% of total jobs. Creative jobs account for ~1.7% of total jobs. Using data for the U.S. as whole, an industry is identified as an innovation industry if either of the following is true: The share of high-tech workers in the industry as a proportion of total industry employment is more than three times the national average (~15.3%). The share of creative workers in the industry as a proportion of total industry employment is more than three times the national average (~5.1%). The three times threshold used above is the one applied in the HiSciTech Institute 2008 report on Hawai'i's Technology workforce. initial Results: 127 industries meet the criteria for high-tech oc-cupational concentration, 92 industries meet the criteria for creative occupational concentration, and six industries meet both. In total 213 unique industries are selected as innovative. HAwAI'I HAwAI'I INdustrIes Jobs est AblIsHMeNts High-Tech Following the HiSci Tech report, UHERO suggested including seed corn research and excluding civil engineering firms. In addition, UHERO suggested keeping fossil fuel electric power generation in the list of technology industries and excluding all federal, state, and local government agencies from selection. 23,24 This list was compared to a list of innovation indus-tries used by San Diego CONNECT in their study of the San Diego innovation economy. CONNECT worked closely with UHERO to compile a list of industries defined by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Previous reports and studies by DBEDT and other organizations were reviewed in consideration of industries classified as technology or creative sectors. CONNECT's experi- ence measuring and the innovation economy in San Diego and other regions was the primary subjective determinant in designating industry sectors as \"core tech\" or \"peripheral tech.\" What CONNECT defines as \"core\" are those industries that are primarily engaged in technology research and development of manufactured products as well as professional and technical services. Examples include industries such as biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and biomedical product develop-ment, communications technology and information services, commercial physical research/scientific, technical services, computer and electronics manu- facturing, software development, aerospace and defense, and energy. A broader sector includes those industries that utilize technologies and facilitate their application to providing goods and services in the economy but whose focus is not developing new or next genera-tion technologically innovative products. Examples here include medical laboratories, diagnostic imag- ing centers, wireless communications carriers, broad- casting and publishing, and engineering services. In their 2012 study Hawai'i's Technology Workforce Occupations and Projections, DBEDT reported that while the core of the technology sector may be technical occupations, the technology sector is also highly dependent on administrative and managerial support occupations. The creative sector industries included in this report were selected from the list of creative industries identified by both DBEDT and UHERO. The CONNECT team and HBR's Research and In- novation Task Force discussed both lists and agreed upon the following list of 135 industries as being representative of both the technology and creative sectors of Hawai'i's innovation economy. The CON- NECT team then grouped the 135 industries into 18 broader industry groups:Appendix 23 Hecker, Daniel. 2005. \"High-technology employment: a NAICS-based update\", BLS Monthly Labor Review, (July), 57-72. 24 Florida, R, C Mellander, and K Stolarick. 2008. \"Inside the Black Box of Regional Development--Human Capital, the Creative Class and Tolerance.\" Journal of Economic Geog- raphy 8 (5) (July 21): 615-649.NAICS Code Category Industry Name Industry Sector 512190 CREATIVEPostproduction Services and Other Motion Picture and Video Industries Audio & Visual Media Production & Distrbution 512240 CREATIVE Sound Recording Studios Audio & Visual Media Production & Distrbution 334612 CREATIVEPrerecorded Compact Disc (except Software), Tape, and Record Reproducing Audio & Visual Media Production & Distrbution 512110 CREATIVE Motion picture and video production Audio & Visual Media Production & Distrbution 512120 CREATIVE Motion Picture and Video Distribution Audio & Visual Media Production & Distrbution 512210 CREATIVE Record Production Audio & Visual Media Production & Distrbution 512220 CREATIVE Integrated Record Production/Distribution Audio & Visual Media Production & Distrbution 512230 CREATIVE Music Publishers Audio & Visual Media Production & Distrbution 512290 CREATIVE Other Sound Recording Industries Audio & Visual Media Production & Distrbution 64Hawai'i Innovation Assets Report 2014-15 NAICS Code Category Industry Name Industry Sector 111150 CORE Corn farming Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals 311223 CORE Other oilseed processing Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals 325199 CORE All Other Basic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals 325211 CORE Plastics material and resin manufacturing Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals 325221 CORE Cellulose organic fiber manufacturing Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals 325314 CORE Fertilizer, mixing only, manufacturing Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals 325320 CORE Pesticide and other agricultural manufacturing Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals 325411 CORE Medicinal and Botanical Manufacturing Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals 325412 CORE Pharmaceutical Preparation Manufacturing Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals 325413 CORE InVitro Diagnostic Substance Manufacturing Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals 325414 CORE Biological Product (except Diagnostic) Manufacturing Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals 541711 CORE Research and Development in Biotechnology Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals NAICS Code Category Industry Name Industry Sector 813910 PERIPHERAL Business Association s Business and Professional Association s 813920 PERIPHERAL Professional Organizations Business and Professional Association s NAICS Code Category Industry Name Industry Sector 541712 CORE Commrcl Phys RsrchCommercial physical research/Scientific & Technical & NonTechnical Services 541990 CORE All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical ServicesCommercial physical research/Scientific & Technical & NonTechnical Services 541720 PERIPHERAL Research and Development in the Social Sciences and HumanitiesCommercial physical research/Scientific & Technical & NonTechnical ServicesNAICS Code Category Industry Name Industry Sector 333314 CORE Optical Instrument and Lens Manufacturing Biomedical Products 334510 CORE Electromedical and Electrotherapeutic Apparatus Manufacturing Biomedical Products 334516 CORE Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing Biomedical Products 334517 CORE Irradiation Apparatus Manufacturing Biomedical Products 337127 COREInstitutional Furniture Manufacturing (e.g., hospital operating rooms;

Industries with less than 10 employees were also excluded. new Company f ormation In order to determine the number of new companies established in the innovation section, Dun & Brad- street data were analyzed using the NAICS codes selected in the list above for the years 2006 through 2013. The companies were assigned to one of the 15 industry groups and designated as \"core tech\", \"peripheral tech\" or \"creative sector.\" In addition, the D&B data included street address and city/county location information. These data were used to determine the number of new compa- nies created in Hawai'i by county. featured Research and Innovation Companies The research projects that are featured in the Hawai'i Innovation Assets Report were chosen by HBR's Research and Innovation Task Force and CON- NECT to provide an overview of prominent examples of the research excellence and impact in Hawai`i. Similarly, the companies featured in the report were selected to provide several examples of commercial innovation across a range of key emerging and more established technology industry sectors in the state. entrepreneurial Programs The programs included in this section of the report were selected by CONNECT and reviewed by HBR's Research and Innovation Task Force to provide ex- amples of new initiatives being pursued by the state and the private sector to provide both funding and other types of support to entrepreneurs in Hawai'i. Industry and Government Associations The industry and government associations included in this report provide support and other services to startups, small to medium sized businesses and larger business establishments across a wide range of industry sectors. UHERO provided the initial list of organizations and this list was reviewed and final-ized by HBR's Research and Innovation Task Force.emsI employee Data Presented in the Innovation Assets Report25 explanation of employees & Proprietors Two important distinctions that will help better understand the data. EMSI datasets are primarily concerned with those workers who are classified as either \"employees\" or \"proprietors.\" eMployees - Employees are often referred to as simply \"wage and salary workers.\" This includes workers receiving wages and salaries, as well as those working for commission, tips, pay-in-kind, and other similar forms of payment. These workers can be employed by any public or private organization. Government workers, regardless of the industry or agency (federal, state and local) are also considered employees. People who work for all incorporated private organizations (for-profit and non-profit) are also considered employees. proprIetors - Broadly speaking, any worker who does not fall into the \"employee\" category will be considered a proprietor.

These are people who work for their own unincorporated business, practice, or farm. It is important to note that people who work for their own incorporated businesses are considered wage and salary workers for their own companies, and are thus not con- sidered proprietors. In addition, all partners in a business partnership are considered proprietors and counted individually. new Categories These are four new categories that create a bet-ter way to present the data. Deacon James, VP of Data Products at EMSI, said of the changes, \"The four classes provide clearer distinctions between types of workers, allowing our custom- ers to find exactly what they need. I have been looking forward to releasing these additional worker breakouts for some time now.\" 1. QCew This is simply unsuppressed QCEW26. 2. NoN-QCew eMployees This set is other groups who are not captured by QCEW, but who still count as employees. This includes railroad, military, some non-QCEW fed- eral government workers, UI-exempt non-profits, and a few other miscellaneous categories. This is particularly helpful for evaluating those military and government sectors that can dominate regional economies. Advantages of this set: When paired with QCEW, this shows complete picture of employment in the region. 3. selF-eMployed These are self-employed workers who count their self-employed work as their primary source of income. Advantages of this set: A growing number of industries (see below) are composed of the self-employed. If you are just using QCEW to evaluate the industries, you might be missing a lot of jobs. 4. exteNded proprIetors These are workers who are counted as pro-prietors, but classify the income as peripheral to their primary employment. Many industries include people who are considered sole propri-etors or part of a partnership, yet have little or no involvement or income in the venture. And an increasing number of people fall into this category (e.g., those who do freelance work on the side, like writers or musicians) and now you will be able to see who they are more clearly. Advantages of this set: This set is most useful when combined with the other three categories to get a complete picture of all proprietor and employee income.
