Telehealth Webinar Q & A 16 This information has been a ssembled 21 -27 March 2020 from AHANZ, HiNZ, NZ Telehealth Forum and APFSSH -APFSHT, Physiotherapy Board NZ, ACC, experts via webinars, previous experience and resource s, internet of things, and brief search of Scopus and Google Scholar. This is a living document. Any comments, suggestions, updates, additional resources, please email to Miranda.buhler@southerndhb.govt.nz 2 Telehealth Handbo ok Version 4 5/4/2020 1. Introduct ion to telehealth Definitions Allied Health Aotearoa New Zealand (AHANZ) defines 'telehealth' as: \"The delivery of services and exchange of information relating to patient/client care that uses any form of technology including, but not limite d to, video conferencing, internet and telephone, as an alternative to in -person interaction.\" The World Confederation for Physical Therapy ( WCPT ) recommends the term ' Digital Practice ', noting that, \" the 'tele' prefix references older technology and will become less relevant with time \". A key feature is that the clinical interaction occurs remotely (Gloria Paterson, been as a practical guide to conducting telehealth for physiotherapists in New Zealand during the COVID -19 pandemic . The aim is to have key information easily at hand in one place . However, i nformation from governance and funding bodies is changing on an almost daily basis, so links to those organisations should be checked . Professional practice guidelines specific to telehealth along with up-dated ACC telehealth -related contract information is detailed in section 2. Clinical int eraction via telephone, commonly described as 'telephone triage' is outlined in section 3. This mode of telehealth has been widely implemented in the Scottish NHS and also evaluated in the England NHS. In section 4, the more commonly and accepted form of telehealth, 'Video consult', is briefly introduced. Most of this section is given to listing the various platforms and considering privacy and security. Sections 5 and 6 are the more practical sections of what might need special consideration in a telehea lth vs face -to-face consult, and how to practically set up and conduct a telehealth consult effectively, respectively. The latter focuses more on video than telephone. Working from home is the scenario many of us will find ourselves in during this time of pandemic. Section 7 discusses practical principles in terms of policies, procedures, and equipment, privacy and security, staying connected, and managing life at home. A raft of additional resources and sources of information are given in section 8 , including two excellent webinar s 'Telehealth for Physiotherapy' and ' Telehealth Overview', and resources produced by the NHS. In the final section 9 are notes taken from an APA -sponsored Q & A webinar on telehealth , presented by an Australian physiotherapist experienced in telehealth (musculoskeletal) physiotherapy. In addition, consideration will need to be given to how telehealth care can be conduct ed with cultural competence and humility . Plans will be require d for those requiring translation services inclu ding for hearing or vision impaired. Sovereignty of data ownership must be considered before signing up patients to online resources and apps. Networks for clinical and professional mentorship will be essential. Mental health of both patients and clinician s will need to be appreciated and supported. This document will be updated weekly until other resources super sede it. All contributions welcome! 3 Telehealth Handbo ok Version 4 5/4/2020 2. Professional practice guidelines and ACC contracts AHANZ - Allied Health Aotearoa New standard are: (recommend reading the standard in full) In this period of pandemic, the Physiotherapy Board NZ advice at 25/3/2020 is that if facilities to conduct a telehealth consult using a platform with the requisite level of privacy, security, and quality is not available, then an alternative platform , or telephone may be used. 2. Providing care 2.1. Any device, software or service used for tele health must be secure, only allowing the intended recipients to receive and record, and be fit for It must preserve the quality of the information or image being transmitted. The Board expects the treatment provided to a patient in another location meets the same required standards as care provided in an in -person consultation. This includes standards relating to: patient selection, identification, cultural competence, assessment, diagnosis, informed consent, maintaining the patient's privacy and con fidentiality, updating the patient's clinical records and communicating with the patient's relevant primary care provider in a timely manner (unless the patient expressly states that the details of the telehealth consultation are not to be shared with thei r primary care provider), and follow -up. If, because of the limits of technology, the same standard of service cannot be provided as an in -person consultation then the patient must be advised of this limitation. 2.2. It is particularly important that consi deration is given to whether a physical examination would add critical information before providing treatment to a patient or before referring the patient to another health practitioner for services such as diagnostic imaging. If a physical examination is likely to add critical information, then it should not proceed until a physical examination can be arranged. In some circumstances, it may be reasonable to ask another health practitioner in the patient's locality to conduct the physical examination. In th ose instances, it is important that the patient's informed consent be obtained and communicated clearly for that arrangement, and the referring physiotherapist is available to answer any queries. 2.3. When working with or receiving reports from telehealth providers, physiotherapists should ensure that the above standards are followed and must notify that telehealth provider, their management and other appropriate reporting channels if there are concerns about the quality of care being provided. 4 Telehealth Handbo ok Version 4 5/4/2020 Related resources (from Physiotherapy Board NZ) Aotearoa New Zealand Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (2018) Principle 8 The Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers' Rights Royal Australasian College of Physicians' Telehealth Guidelines and practical tips Internet and electronic communication Standard NZ Telehealth Resource Centre (2018) ACC Contracts From ACC information 2 4 March 2020 Telehealth services have been further extended for the duration of the COVID -19 response to enable specified allied health professionals to provide initial and follow -up consultations via Telehealth . The requirement on ACC45 form for health professionals to have 'personally examined the patient' has been waived. The patient will need to provide consent for the ACC45 to be lodged. To lodge a claim either use the electronic ACC45 or submit the claim through your Practice Management System. Read out the following statement to the patient and record their response in the clinical record: - Do you declare that you have provided true and correct inf ormation and you will tell ACC if your situation changes? - Do you authorise me as your (name of health profession: GP, physiotherapist, etc) to lodge your claim with ACC? - Do you authorise your information to be collected or disclosed to ACC to help determin e cover for your claim, determine what you will be entitled to, or for research purposes (like injury prevention, or assessment, and rehabilitation?). \"Did Not Attend\" limits in ACC health service contracts extended by 1 additional DNA during the COVID - 19 response. Clinicians will need to adhere to the standards set out by their professional associations or regulatory body when determining whether Telehealth is an appropriate alternative to an in -person consultation. In the provision of Telehealth, the fol lowing criteria are expected to be met: Clients must consent to the use of Telehealth The service must be provided in alignment with your profession's regulatory authority Where a regulatory authority does not hold a relevant standard, providers will align to Allied Health Aotearoa New Zealand's best practice guideline or the Medical Council of New Zealand's standard Telehealth services must also be provided to a client who is residing in New Zealand at the time of the consultation by a provider who is residing in New Zealand at the time of the consultation The service must be provided using a Telehealth technology interface that meets the requirements outlined by the New Zealand Telehealth Resource Centre. ACC preference is that telehealth services wi ll be via videoconferencing as this type of capability is integrated into many practice management systems and many people have smart phones. However, 5 Telehealth Handbo ok Version 4 5/4/2020 initial and follow -up Telehealth consultations provided by Physiotherapy (including Physiotherapy Special ists), Hand Therapy, Occupational Therapy and Speech and Language Therapy can also occur via telephone consultations from 1 April 2020, for the duration of the response to COVID -19. This change has been made during the response to COVID -19 to improve acces s for clients without access to videoconferencing capable devices; it follows guidance from the Physiotherapy Board and Telehealth Resource Centre that telephone consultations may be used if videoconferencing is not possible. ACC acknowledges that moving t o telephone consultations will reduce the ability to effectively manage clients and therefore we only expect it to be used where other avenues are not available to clients. Providers must clearly document the reason for its use in their patient's clinical record when a telephone consultation is used in place of videoconferencing. Expansion of Telehealth services is only applicable as clinically appropriate and only for the duration of the COVID -19 response. Tech and security requirements are as per Teleheal th Resource Centre above. Service Telehealth code Rate s: Rates are now equal to those for face -to-face consults.

Telephone triage Telephone triage involves people wi th a health problem receiving assessment and advice over the telephone (Lake 2017). Telephone triage, also known as 'telephone consult' or 'telephone triage and advice' is not commonly used by allied health or physiotherapy practitioners in New Zealand , but is widely practiced by GP and Nursing staff with published international literature reporting up to a quarter of all care consults now conducted by telephone (Vaona 2017). Telephone triage has been widely practiced by physiotherapists in the Scottish NHS and also evaluated in the England NHS. From the literature: The 'PhysioDirect' UK workstream was designed to address needs of people referred with musculos keletal conditions in the NHS (Foster 2014). Offers a way of providing early access to physiothera py advice for patients where telephone consult is beneficial while reserving face -to-face contacts for patients where this is an essential service. The approach e mphasises the importance of patient self -management and supports self -care. Key aspects liste d in the box here. Concern about potential 'flooding' of physiotherapy services and increasing waiting times was demonstrated to be unfounded. The ability to diagnose safely and triage for face - to-face assessment where appropriate is are key principles of this type of service. For that reason, there is was preference for experienced senior physiotherapists to provid e telephone -based care. Experie nced physiotherapists were able to manage three straightforward calls per hour. Criteria for excluding telephone triage, includ ed e.g. communication difficulty, under 16 years, severe neurological condition. Further service information given at this exampl e, https://www.southtees.nhs.uk/content/uploads/PhysioDirect.pdf . Small number of audits suggest that of those triaged to telephone consult, up to 60% can be managed by telephon e consult alone (Foster 2014) . Patient and GP satisfaction appears to be good, and in most cases triaging physiotherapists seem to reach the same decisions from telephone consult as they would from face -to-face assessment (Foster 2014) . From wide use in GP and nursing practice , there is concern by some about safety and accuracy in diagnosis with preference for face -to-face for diagnostic assessment and reserving telephone for follow up only. However, broad agreement is that the practice is largely safe. A review of systematic reviews of quality, safety and governance of telephone triage and advice services (TTAS) (primarily GP and Nursing) found that patient satisfaction with TTAS was generally high, some consistency of evidence to reduce clinical workload, and measures of the safety tended to show no Table 1 From Foster et al. 2011 7 Telehealth Handbo ok Version 4 5/4/2020 major difference between TTAS and traditional care (Lake 2017) . However, no definitive answers to questions about the quality of care provided, access and equity of the service, its costs and outcomes. Found that 50 -60% of calls could be handled by telephone consult alone (doctors and nurses). Identified some issues around under -estimation of urgency. Resources for conducting telephone triage and advice Communication skills and clinical interaction Clinical assessment and communication skills learned in undergraduate training do not always translate to good telephone history -taking and case management, impacting on quality (Vaon 2017) . Unfortunately, there is no good evidence about specific training inte rventions that improve this (Vaona 2017). Attributes c onsidered important to the success of telephone consulting are: high level of clinical knowledge and clinical reasoning skills, and excellent communication. Some information about key aspects to revise, reflect on, practice and plan for are outlined in this online GP training website which appears to be based on information drawn from NHS and GP co -op https://www.gp -training.net/training/communication_skills/consultation /telephone_triage2.htm . Summary are given here: A, Pappas Y, Grewal RS, et al. (2017) Training interventions for improving telephone consultation skills in clinician (Reviews) Foster N, Williams B, Grove S, et al. (2011) The evide nce for and against 'PhysioDirect' telephone assessment and advice services. Physiotherapy 97:78 -82. Lake R, Georgiou A, Li J, et al. (2017) The quality, safety, and governance of telephone triage and advice services - an overview of evidence from systemat ic reviews. BMC Health Services Research 17:614. Risks of poor triage technique are patien t misunderstanding and clinician stress Good triage technique requires clinician to be comfortable with themselves, not anxious, and prepared to negotiate. Before looking at the triaging process itself, consider your own personality and communication styl e. o Understand what is: assertiveness vs non -assertiveness, aggressive vs passive speech o Know your rights and the patient's rights The triage process - know the parts: o Introduction o Information gathering o The action plan o Concluding the call Requires good listening and persistent clarification Know when a face -to-face consultation or a consultation with others (e.g. GP) is necessary 8 Telehealth Handbo ok Version 4 5/4/2020 4. Video Consult Many video conference platforms are available. Key attributes are privacy and security, functionality, quality, ease of use, and cost. It may be that a mix of platforms fit individual practice needs. Telephone can be a good option for audio alongside video to improve quality of image (i.e. reduces data use). Regulatory boards and international guidelines require privacy, security, and quality to be ensured. However, in this period of pandemic, the Physiotherapy Board NZ advi ses that if a platform of robust privacy , security , and quality is not available, then an alternative may be used. Platforms Microsoft Teams (Cisco WebEx Meetings) Available through Microsoft 365. Being rolled out to public health sector NZ and internationally e.g. Scot tish NHS .

ACC advice for Zoom users, to ensure clients' privacy is protected and their information is kept secure: Maximising privacy and information security o Zoom's desktop application has greater security features for hosts than the Zoom app. Before the meeting o It's more secure to generate a random meeting ID instead of sharing a link in the invitation o Only send the meeting invitation to required people 9 Telehealth Handbo ok Version 4 5/4/2020 o Send the password for the call via a separate method o Allow only signed -in users to join the meeting o Disable the 'jo in before host' feature o Enable the waiting room feature o Advise participants in advance if the meeting will be recorded. During the meeting o Confirm who is on the call before discussing sensitive information o Only accept or open attachments you're expecting from call participants o Lock the session once everyone you were expecting to join the meeting has joined (at o The bottom of the participants panel in the meeting, click 'More' and then 'Lock Meeting') o Only allow remote control of the screen sharing session from a call participant you know and trust (not good practice for webinars) o Use only the local recording feature in Zoom for video or audio records More information about Zoom host controls can be found on Zoom's website.

Testing connection speed Thoroughly test any connection before introducing a telehealth service. This should be done at different times of day and over several days. Completing a s peed test is simple using a website such as www.speedtest.net 11 Telehealth Handbo ok Version 4 5/4/2020 5. Practice points Challenges and risks (from AHANZ) : Telehealth consultations can pose challenges and risks not present in in -person consultations. This is particularly true when there has been no prior in -person contact between the allied health clinician and the client/patient. Challenges and risks include: Establishing rapport with the client/patient Conducting any physical examinati on Recognition of emotion Cultural responsiveness Client concerns about data safety and security. Most of these challenges and risks can be managed by following the guidelines outlined by AHANZ (see document link above) and Physiotherapy Board NZ , includin g: Comply with local guidelines, such as those imposed by your employer, or specified in any contract for services. Ensure telehealth is covered under your indemnity insurance. Verify the identity of the client before providing care. Health bodies in Austr alia recommend asking the client for three client identifiers, such as: o Client name (family and given names) o Date of birth o Gender (as identified by the client themselves) o Address o Patient record number where it exists. Make sure the client is fully informed with regards to the limitations of a virtual consultation, makes an informed choice and provides their consent before providing a telehealth service. 12 Telehealth Handbo ok Version 4 5/4/2020 6. Tips for an effective consult (From various experts and practice experience ) Look good & be professional Try not to shout However tempting, don't lean in Keep still Wear dark colours - light colours pull the eye away from your face Keep eye contact Lighting - Not too dark/not too light . No light behind you. Best light in front of you . Camera height - Height above eye level Tidy background - Plain background or tidy Head mid -screen Ethernet vs Wifi - Connect via ethernet cord rather than Wifi to avoid lag and mismatch with sound and p eople talk ing over the top . Also impacts on picture quality. Check your connection quality and speed as above. Turn off other programs - Speed up by turning off other programs, no downloads etc Try out the gear - Practice, call a friend, family or colleague to test run Manage users - Mute the listener to reduce feedback Share cell phone numbers - Exchange contact numbers in case telephone option required to make contact or complete consult. 13 Telehealth Handbo ok Version 4 5/4/2020 7. Working from Home Acknowledge sources: 'Practical principles ' advice issued by Southern DHB ; Otago Daily Times 21.3.2020 Policies, procedures, equipment, and support In general, you should assume that your organisations' policies, procedures and practices apply when working from home. In terms of h ealth and safety , consider responsib ility for maintaining a designated workspace that is clean, appropriately set up, and safe. Review ACC's 'HabitatWork' site. Devices and equ ipment required to assist work ing remotely may include a laptop, phone or other equipment relevant to the role / tasks being perform ed. Telehealth practice from home will need appropriate software and a high -speed broadband data plan which includes anti -virus networking. Undertake a t est of the home environment to ensure its ' effectiveness. Consideration will need to be given to the IT requirements to support the arrangement . Security & Privacy The same level of security protection applied to information technology equipment within the office should be applied to equipment used off site. This includes the following: o Do not leave equipment unattended in public places o Appropriate password protection o Information must be stored in such a way that only you can access i t All information technology security breaches must be reported If working from home , you are responsible for ensuring the same level of security protection to all documents / information taken to the remote work site as is applied to documen ts / information within the clinic office. Ideally , work in an office or separate room away from non -staff . Consider obligations under your existing confidentiality arrangements which apply to both yours/colleagues and patient information. These obligations remain in force when you are working from home. You may like a reminder of what's in that agreement - review the relevant policy or contact your HR partner or employer . Equipment liability Consider whether e quipment provided by the organisation will be covered by the organisation 's insurance policies. Usually the organization will take responsibility for the repair or replacement of damaged or stolen equipment in the event of theft or damage where reasonable ste ps have been taken to protect the technology equipment. Expenses Be clear on whether the organization will/will not pay for costs such as heating, lighting, electricity, gas, water, rent or wear and tear at the remote work site. If a work mobile is not provided , then you and the organization will need to agree the most effective way of handling calls whether that is the use of organization -account video/call platform or reimbursement for calls. Stay connected .... These are difficult times and maintaini ng as normal a relationship between staff as possible is really important: 14 Telehealth Handbo ok Version 4 5/4/2020 Set up a regular pattern of frequent check -ins. This could be by phone or video conference. Both will increase the quality of work/social connection and are preferable to sole rel iance on email. Maintain expectations that team members dial into team meetings and other collective conversations. Part of these connections and conversations should have space to include general wellbeing and what is going on. Managers /directors should where possible respond quickly and be available for employee's questions. However, i t's okay to say I'm busy now but will come back to you soon. As a team discuss some of the possible impacts of working from home and plan together how you can support each other with these. Managing life at home Managing work life at home is about using time and energy most effectively , so you can get work done but also have a life outside of work: Create a structure or a schedule - doesn't have to be set in concrete but very useful both for adults and for children. Create a shared agreement about how family members are going to use th eir time, e.g. working around children's needs. Rosters can allow uninterrupted time. Talk with your team about when you can work and/or communicate online given your family commitments. Create a workspace and work routine that suits your own natural patt erns of concentration. Dress for work - may not need to iron everything but do change out of your pyjamas. Watch that you don't overwork - without office distractions, co -workers etc, can end up sitting at your computer for long hours without a break. Hav e proper breaks. Be kind generous, to everyone including yourself. It's not going to be business as usual. And finally - Top Tips for making it work. 1. Get up at your usual time 2. Get dressed!! A day in your PJs feels good .... until it doesn't anymore. 3. Enjoy a longer than usual breakfast because you have a shorter commute to work. 4. Find a quiet spot, away from distractions if you can. Make sure your workstation is set up well. 5. Kick into your workday - start at your usual time, take your usual breaks & stay in touch with your workmates. 6. Finish on time and grab some exercise. Be good to yourself, for your mental & physical wellbeing. 15 Telehealth Handbo ok Version 4 5/4/2020 8.
