Therefore, there is a high patient and provider interest in complementary non-pharmacological therapies, but its evidence base has not yet been clearly pointed out in the context of CIPN. Methods: The results of a scoping review overviewing the published clinical evidence on the application of complementary therapies for improving the complex CIPN symptomatology are synthesized with the recommendations of an expert consensus process aiming to draw attention to supportive strategies for CIPN. The scoping review, registered at PROSPERO 2020 (CRD 42020165851), followed the PRISMA-ScR and JBI guidelines. Relevant studies published in Pubmed/MED- LINE, PsycINFO, PEDro, Cochrane CENTRAL, and CINAHL between 2000 and 2021 were included. CASP was used to evaluate the methodologic quality of the studies. Results: Seventy-five studies with mixed study quality met the inclusion criteria. Manipulative therapies (including massage, reflexology, therapeutic touch), rhythmi- cal embrocations, movement and mind-body therapies, acupuncture/acupressure, and TENS/Scrambler therapy were the most frequently analyzed in research and may be effective treatment options for CIPN. The expert panel approved 17 supportive interventions, most of them were phytotherapeutic interventions including exter- nal applications and cryotherapy, hydrotherapy, and tactile stimulation. More than two-thirds of the consented interventions were rated with moderate to high perceived clinical effectiveness in therapeutic use. Conclusions: The evidence of both the review and the expert panel supports a variety of complementary procedures regarding the supportive treatment of CIPN; however, the application on patients should be individually weighed in each case. Based on this meta-synthesis, interprofessional healthcare teams may open up a dialogue with patients in- terested in non-pharmacological treatment options to tailor complementary counselling and treatments to their needs.

Such treatments attack the cellular and sub cellular l evel and cause altered ion channel activity (sodium, potassium, calcium) as well as changes in the intra- cellular systems, which are responsible for oxidative , to nociceptive pain, w hich occurs when a painful stimulus activates the peripheral nociceptors, neuropathic pain is not the result of dam- aged tissue, but is caused by inner structural deficits in the perip heral neurons and sen- sory nerves [2,3] . Unpleasant CIPN symptoms appear i n a variety of ways. Patients often experience numbness in their feet and palms as well as paresthesia, a croataxia, and the loss of motor functions, which contribute to the fact that patients wi th CIPN have a high risk for falling injuries [4]. For many pa tients, even opening a water bottle is painful or they feel like \"walking on glass\" [4] (a statement of some experts participating in the sym- posium, see phase 2 under 2.2 \"Structured expert consensus process \"). Up to 71% of pa- tients undergoing acute treatm ent (e.g., Oxaliplatin, Docetaxel) experience CIPN [5], and it is one of the major symptoms that affects why patients may decide to cease their treat- ment. Patients who develop CIPN are both at younger and older age, experience re - strictions in their quality -of-life functions, and therefore need effective treatment options [6]. Up to 42% of patients experience CIPN two years after they s tarted their taxane - and platinum -based chemotherapy [7], and they are also in need for effective strategies for improving t heir symptoms and increas ing their quality of life [8]. Currently, there are not enough conventional CIPN treatments availabl e, and the most prescribed medication is Duloxetine, even though its effec t size has been reported to be moderate [9,10] . With the help of a systematic review, Hou et al. 2018 [1] identified 26 other treatment options in 35 included studies that were also on laser therapy and acu- puncture. The results, however, need to be considered with caution, as most st udies had small sample sizes and a variety of outcome measures. Hence , there is a need for pointing out further treatment options to alleviate CIPN symptoms in o rder to relieve the suffering of those affected. This is also shown in the fact that research indicate s that up to 80% of patients with cancer have an interest in so -called natural, non -pharmacological, comple- mentary interventions for self -managing their symptoms and actively take control in their own symptom management [11,12] . Surveys have also identified an increase of canc er patients' use of complementary therapies from the timepoint b efore to after a cancer di- agnosis [13]. In this course of time, for example, the use of biologic products for general symptom management and for coping with the new life situati on has tripled to 52% [13]. Thus, healthcare teams should know how to consult patients suffering from CIPN on com- plementary treatment options when conventional drugs like Duloxetine or G abapentine [14] are not effective enough or when patients' preference is oriented tow ards comple- mentary and integrative health care (CIH). Previous literature reviews have examined key complementary treatments that can be applied to relieve general cancer pain [15] or neuropathic pain resulting from drug - based tumor therapy [16]. The latte r systematic review, however, has not included nurs- ing interventions, like external applications, which are relev ant to consider when aiming Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 3 of 37 to relieve patients' symptoms and treat them in a holistic and natur al way. Even though Brami et al. [16] did sugge st applying complementary therapies to prevent or treat CIPN \u2014 for example , Vitamin E, L -Glutamine, Goshajinkigan, and Omega -3\u2014the authors think that the oral intake of such natural products is not the only option available. In the last years , there have been other studies published reporting that henna applications [17] or cryocompression [18,19] are also beneficial , to name just a few more options, and they can be applied for CIPN symptom management. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to provide interprofess ional healthcare teams with a comprehensive literature review and clinical recommendations o f the best availa- ble evidence on complementary treatments for the prevention of CIPN a nd for the su p- portive management of CIPN during or after conventional treat ment. 2. Materials and Methods The methodology for outlining the clinical recommendations of evidence -based com- plementary prevention and treatment options followed a two -phase guideline [20,21] . In Phase 1, a scoping review to find external evidence by publis hed studies was conducted, and in Phase 2, a structured expert consensus process on complementary int erventions for CIPN was performed. This was followed by a synthetization of bot h phases i n terms of their non -pharmacological treatment options. According to Sackett 's approach of evidence -based medicine, individual clinical de- cisions should be made by considering the best available sci entific evidence, the personal expertise of the health pro fessionals , and the needs and values of the persons to be treated [22]. Ideally, the highest level of evidence is available for the specific c linical decision ques- tion from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews , or meta -analyses. For some questions, however, only evidence from lower levels is available, so t hat the next possible evidence must be sought and considered [22]. In the hierarchy of evidence, as- sessments by experts are assigned to the lowest level of evidence [23]. Based on clini cal experience with naturopathic medicine, especially in German - speaking hospitals, we experienced that many different symptom mana gement methods are used as supportive care for CIPN. Furthermore, due to the different levels of evidence and standardization of these methods, the authors wanted to first clarify these commonly used methods in a consensus meeting and then compare those results with the systematic literature search. The authors also see that approaches based on consensus and literature reviews m ake a significant contribution to the prevention and treatment of various symp- toms in patients with cancer in the field of nursing and integrati ve care practice [21,24]. Therefore, the authors think that this study will contribute to the literature, especi ally in terms of comparing the consensus -based results of the practices used in German -speaking countries by an expert consensus team with the results of a sy stematic literature search. 2.1. Phase 1: Scoping Review 2.1.1. Literature Search A review of the literature was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic R eviews and Meta -Analyses E xtension Checklist S 1) [25]. As recommended, the frameworks by Arksey and O'Malley [26] and Levac et al. [27] were used as a guidance, as presented in the synthesis and enh ance- ment of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) [28]. A primary search on CIPN (or the risk of developing CIPN) as the main outcome was performed using the terms \"(cancer) AND (neuropathies or peripheral neuropathy or CIPN) AND (complementary ther apies or non - pharmacological therapies)\". An additional search was conduct ed on general pain as the main outcome and also including other chronically ill patients, to get further insights for transferability of the results to CIPN. In line with the defin ition by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) [29] and by Witt et al. 2017 [30], the au- thors understand non -pharmacological interventions in the field of integrative oncology Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 4 of 37 to be evidence -based and complementary to conventional therapy, which can help all evi- ate patients' symptoms and enhance their quality of life a nd resilience. A primary search was performed using the terms \"(cancer) AND ( neuropathies or peripheral neuropathy or CIPN) AND (complementary therapies)\". Search strategies were adapted for the data- bases of Pubmed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PEDro, Cochrane Central, an d CINAHL, ending on 31 July 2021. The full search strategy can be found in Supplementary S 2 and was re- ported in the review protocol registered at PROSPERO 2020 ( CRD 42020165851) [31]. 2.1.2. Study Screening and Selection Criteria The inclusion criteria were designed to include all p ossible study types (e.g., RCTs, controlled studies, cohort studies, case studies, pilot studies, e xpert opinions, reviews, qualitative studies, clinical guidelines). Articles were included in t his review if adult pa- tients with cancer (search one) or chron ically ill patients were the focus of interest of the research (extended search two). There were no restrictions by population characteristics (e.g., type of cancer, stage of cancer, adults, gender, comorbiditie s, country, geographic location, ethnicities, cultural groups). Only studies published in English, French, or Ger- man language were included. Study protocols and pre -clinical studies were excluded. Studies with children were also excluded as such patients require specia l pediatric treat- ment. 2.1.3. Data Extraction and Reporting Titles and abstracts were retrieved by two review authors (NK, RS) wo rking inde- Analytics, PA, USA) an d dedu- plicated. Selected records were then uploaded to Rayyan (Qatar C omputing Research In- stitute, Doha, Qatar) [32] and screened for eligibility. Then , a core team of four researchers (RS, BK, JB, NK) screened titles and abstracts, with relevant ar ticles selected for full -text review. This was conducted in duplicate, so tha t there was a mutual review and further coordination if necessary. Disagreements on inclusion or exclus ion were resolved by reg- ularly discussing and solving the \"conflicts\" displayed in Rayyan. In Figure 1 , the search and screening and selection process of the articles are documented according to PRISMA - ScR. A data charting form was developed to capture relevant data from s tudies (see Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary S 3 and S4). Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 5 of 37 Figure 1. Flowchart of article selection process . 2.1.4. Risk of Bias Assessment All included studies were assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) [33], which consists of a set of criteria to proof, and is available for different study types. For instance, the CASP Randomized Controlled Trial s Checklist (2017) entails 11 ques- tions regarding the quality of the study ( Supplementary S 5, Table S3: Critical appraisal of the included studies). Microsoft Excel and FreeHand were used for graphic al display, data cleaning, formatting, and analysis . Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 6 of 37 2.2. Phase 2: Structured Expert Consensus Process The methodology is based on the systematic and structured process of expert con- sensus used by the AWMF (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen Medi zinischen Fachgesellschaften e.V. = Association of the Scientific Medical Societies) to develop scien- tific clinical guidelines [34]. For this second phase, a two-day workshop was planned un- der the theme \"Supportive management for CIPN in patients with cancer \" and took place in September 2018 at the Evang. Klin iken Essen -Mitte in Essen, North Rhine -Westphalia, Germany. Sixteen experts with a naturopathic background and experience in cancer treat- ment and care from nine different clinical settings in German y and Switzerland discussed non-pharmacological treatment options for CIPN. The expert panel consisted of 11 nurses, 4 physicians, and 1 psychologist. The aim of the symposium was to share exp eriences and also to develop clinical and research recommendations for the supporti ve treatment of CIPN. As there is no pr ofessional society for naturopathic care in Germany, renowned experts from clinics with many years of experience in naturopathy were invited to the symposium. In the meantime, the expert group has become a working g roup of the Ger- man Society for Nursing ). Criteria for Consensus Finding On the first day, all supportive adjunct therapies for CIP N were discussed under the question \"What measures do you use to prevent or treat CIPN in clinical practice?\" in the expert panel. Since all measures have already been applied in clinica l use for many years, only safe measures were mentioned. In total, 17 comple mentary treatments were summa- rized on a collecting board. On the second day, all the complementary treatments were further consented. For arranging and classifying the nursing inte rventions, the following criteria were considered as highly relevant: safety , clinical experience, effort of training, and practical feasibility. It was consented to rate all complementary treatments on these criteria as follows: S = safe; CE = clinical experience (rated on a numerical scale 0 to 5 , with 0 = n o effect and 5 = maximum effect) ; ET = effort of training (education requirements in addition to a nurs ing grade; 0 = n o additional instructions or education needed , 1 = instructions needed, 2 = a pplication under guidance, 3 = r epeated practice needed, 4 = b asic training of rhythmical em- brocation (200 h) recommended but partial skills can be acquired with less than 200 h, and 5 = basic training of rhythmical embrocation (200 h) needed); PF = practical feasibility (PFt = feasibili ty limited due to time requirements; PFtt = feasibility strongly limited due to time requirements; PFc = feasibility limited due to high costs (>30 EUR per month) ). The consensus process is based on the AWMF 's systematic and structured process for the deve lopment of scientific clinical guidelines [34]. It was moderated by two physi- cians (DS, PV) and each intervention was evaluated on the above -mentioned criteria. Each clinic had one vote, and when a clinic was represented by more than one participant, the participants had to coordinate their vote with each other. 3. Results 3.1. Search Results A total of 264 potentially relevant articles were identified a nd screened, where in 145 articles were assessed in detail, of which 75 studies (41 quantit ative studies, 3 mixed -meth- ods studies, 26 reviews, 5 clinical guidelines) were included in th e scoping review (Figure 1). Most studies were conducted in North America ( n = 27), Europe ( n = 18), Asia ( n = 16), the Middle East ( n = 8), UK (n = 4), and Australia ( n = 2). Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 7 of 37 3.2. Consensus from the Expert Panel During the two-day expert symposium (08/18), consensus was found for 17 non - pharmacological interventions (see Table 1, and detailed version in Table S4 in Supple- mentary S 6), and some could also/only be applied for preventive use. The experts rated all nursing interventions as safe , and practical feasibility was given for 15 of them. Only for the therapeutic application of rhythmical embrocations (RE) practical feasibility was assessed as limited because RE are more time -consuming and require a high level of qual- ification. All other interventions can be performed by the patients thems elves after in- struction. 3.3. Preventative Options for CIPN The review included 14 studies focused on CIPN (Table 1) that dealt with preventive interventions. Those were phytotherapy (Phy) ( henna application) on hands and feet [17], Phy in Traditional Chinese Medicine [35], and Phy for hand and foot baths or fumigation [36]; sensorimotor training (SM), [16,42] ; and acupuncture/acupressure [42]. Additionally , compression was recommended by one study [43] as well as by the expert panel. This recommended in total six interventions that can be used for prevention, but without an asses sment of their ef- fectiveness (Table 1). 3.4. Complementary Treatment Options for CIPN Key findings of the inc luded studies are presented in Table 1 including a condensed result presentation of the review and the consensus process. T he classification of classical natural therapies according to Kneipp and non-classical natural therapies [44] was applied to further categorize and analyze the complementary therapies that were reported in the studies. In total, 13 distinct categories were identified (F igure 2). Details of the interventions examined in the included studie s can be found in Tables S1-S3; Tables S1 (\"Characteristics of selected studies included in the scoping review (nurs- ing interventions for CIPN)\") and S2 (\"Characteristics of other relevant studies for treating pain with complementary therapies in cancer patients of other patien t populations\") can be found in Appendices 3 and 4). Overall, the study quality ranged from excellent ( n = 29) [15,17,35,37,41,42,45 -66] to satisfactory ( n = 8) [19,67 -73] and poor ( n = 1) [74] , while most studies had good study quality ( n = 37) [16,18,38 -40,43, 75-105] (see Table S3 in Supple- mentary S 5). Figure 2 illustrates the evidence (Tables S1, S2 and S5) by referring to the number of studies/expert recommendation s that the authors included for the 13 categories of non - pharmacological treatment options , which can be administered by doctors, oncology nurses, psycho -oncologists, physiotherapists, and all other members of interprofes sional healthcare teams. Figure 3 visualizes how the different treatmen t options relate to the dif- ferent health profes sionals. In 38 out of 75 of the studies , statements were made on the conceptual therapeutic approach. In the following, the evidence for the top seven most frequently identified complementary procedures are described. Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 8 of 37 Table 1.

Manipulative Therapies This section reports the results on non -classical naturopathic treatments of manipu- lative therapies , which include massage (M), reflexology (R), and R of the fee t. The medi- cal literature on M therapy yielde d 25 results, of which 5 studies were especially related to the therapy of CIPN [16,41,74,76,89] and 19 studies focused on cancer pain [15,45,46,49,51,56,58,63,64,66,77,78,83,87,99,100,102,103,105] and 1 [72] on any medical condition , which may result from the presence of CIPN. Within the 25 studies , there are 10 RCTs case report [74], 1 study [105] and 2 recommendations from guidelines [63,66] . The quality of most studies, includ- ing the two guidelines, were rated excellent ( n = 11) [15,41,45,46,49,51,56,58,63,64,66] ac- cording to the CASP scheme [106] or good ( n = 12) [16,76 -78,83,87,89,99,100,102,103,105] . One study was rated satisfactory ( n = 1) [72] and the case report [74] was rated as poor in terms of quality. More details on the assessment of study quali ty according to CASP can be found in the Supplementary S 5 (Table S3). Massage, Reflexology , and Foot Reflexology During M, mechanical touch techniques are used to act on the muscles and conn ec- tive tissues. The main purpose of classical M is said to be the treatm ent and prevention tension ; the stimulation of blood and lymphatic circulation and metabolism ; and the in- fluence on circulation, blood pressure, respiration , and psyche. R is a form of M in which Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 17 of 37 pressure is applied to the hands and feet [49,107] . Pain reduction through M is explained by desensitization of nociceptors [83]. Of the five studies with focus on CIPN , three assessed classical M. Classical M signif- icantly prevented CIPN and neuropathic pain as well as imp roved nerve conduction and QoL when compared to usual care at week 12 ( n = 1 study; n = 40 participants receiving adjuvant paclitaxel for breast cancer; intervention duration: 12 weeks ) [41]. In one case report, which is also reported in a systematic review [16], classical M is associated with greatly reduced CIPN symptoms from grade 2 to 1 an d markedly improved quality of life [74]. In one RCT , foot M was shown to reduce patients' pain scores and have a positive effect on sleep quality, compared to clinical routine ( n = 40 patients with non -Hodgkin's lymphoma; intervention duration: four weeks ) [76]. A program including M and mobili- zation as well as physical E and WBV had a significantly and clinic ally relevant beneficial impact on symptom relie f, physical fitness , and sensory function ( n = 1 study; n = 131 participants; intervention duration: 15 weeks) [89]. Of the four RCTs that assessed classical M for cancer pain [49,83,87,105] , two found no statistically or clinically improvement in pain ( n = 2 studies; n = 610 participants with cancer pain; intervention duration: two and four weeks) [49,87 ] and one found signifi- cantly higher reduction of physical discomfort in IG compared t o routine health care ( n = 1 study; n = 8 6 participant; intervention duration: five weeks) [83]. Foot massage showed positive effects on pain ( n = 1 study; n = 87; interv three consecutive days) [105] . The four RCTs that assessed R in cancer patients [45,46,77,78] reported heterogene- ous effects regarding pain. R was found to have positive effect on pai n and overall well - being compared to aromatherapy -M (n = 1 study, 115 participants, intervention duration: four treatments) [46]. Reflexology complemented by PMR exercises w as found to decrease pain and fatigue and increase quality of life ( n = 1 study; n = 80 participants, intervention durati on: eight weeks) [41). No statistically significant effect could b e shown for pain in cancer patients treated with foot R (n = 1 study; n = 36 participants; intervention duration: two times, 24 h apart ) [77]. In contrast , an immediate positive effect of fo ot R for patients with metastatic cancer who report ed pain w as found ( n = 1 study; n = 256 participants; intervention duration: four weeks) [78]. Evidence for R as a treatment for any medical condition could not be demonstrated convincingly in a systematic review ( n = 18 RCTs; n = 949 participants) [72]. In the nine reviews and meta -analys es that assessed M or R in cancer patients [15,51,56,58,64,99,100,102,103] , studies with different types of massage and reflexology were included. The results were heterogeneous. Improvement of pain through M was re- ported ( n = 2 studies; n = 30 RCTs; n = 4448 participants) [56,58] as well as t hrough foot reflexology ( n = 1 study; n = 12 RCTs; n = 559 participants) [56]. Weak recommendations are suggested for M, compared to an active comparator, for the treatment of pain, fa tigue, and anxiety. No recommendations were suggested for M therapy compared t o no treat- ment or sham control (n = 1 study; n = 16 RCTs) [51]. Beneficial effects of classical M for pain of any origin are reported in a nursing guideline [66]. Due to the heterogeneous data from RCTs on the effectiveness of classical M in reducing pain in oncology patients, no recomm endation can be made for or against the use of classical M to reduce pa in in an- other guideline [63]. 3.6. Rhythmical Embrocations (Including Healing Touch, Therapeutic Touch, Reiki) RE are a gentle, gliding touch along archetypal forms of the body [108] . It is believed that RE strengthen life forces, enhance warmth, and harmonize rhyt hmic processes in the body. For application , RE utilizes massage oils and plant or metal ointments. Therapeu tic touch (TT) describes a method of laying hands on a person by a therapist. T hereby it is assumed that there are human energy fields, which are in constant interactions with each other and with their environment. The therapist's goal is to bring these en ergy fields back into balance [63,81,104] . Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 18 of 37 The medical literature yielded six results of which five were related to cancer -related symptoms [15,63,81,87,104] and one to low back pain [86]. Among the studies , there was one systematic review [15], three RCTs [81,87,104] one guideline [63], and one tional study [86]. The quality of two studies [15,63] was rated excellent according to the CASP scheme, and four studies were rated good [81,86,87,104] . According to expert consensus , RE increases the effect iveness of two nursing inter- ventions for CIPN (Aconit oil, Arnica comp. Formica oil) by one point on the five -point Likert scale from three to four (Table S4, Supplementary S 6). Three RCTs assessed TT or healing touch (HeTo) in cancer patients. HeTo as wel l as classical M are more effective than presence alone or standard care in reducing pain, mood disturbance, an d fatigue in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy ( n = 1 study, n = 230 participants, intervention duration: 4 weeks) [87]. TT led to significantly higher well -being compared to rest period (n = 1 study; n = 20 participants, intervention duration: 4 consecutive days) [81]. TT signif- icant ly decreased pain and fatigue more than usual care, while the placebo group indi- cated a decreasing trend in pain and fatigue scores compared with the usual ca re group (n = 1 study; n = 9 0 participants; intervention duration: 5 days) [104] . One guideline states that the quality of the included stud ies [109-111] on TT is too low to provide meaningful results [63]. HeTo for cancer patients was assessed in one systematic revi ew. H eTo seems prom- ising, particularly in the short term, but can not be recommended because of a paucity of rigorous trials. Future research should focus on methodologically strong RCTs to deter- mine potential efficacy of these CAM interventions [15]. RE with Solum oil was shown in an observational study to be a promising and useful complement ary method for the treat- ment of chronic low back pain [86]. 3.7. Phytotherapy ( including Herbal Medic ines) Phy is one of the oldest medical therapies and is indigenous to all cont inents and cultures. While Western medicine and traditional Persian medicine tend to use single me- dicinal plants, in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), for example, c ombinations or mix- tures of more than three herbal drugs are common [112] . This category includes most types of external applications (EAP). These are applications from aromatherapy (AT) (e.g., Aconit oil application), topical therapy (ToT) (e.g., Citrullus colocynth is), phytotherapy (Phy) , or herbal medicine (e.g., flaxseed bath, astragalus, henna). Eleven nursing interven- tions recommended by the expert panel can be assigned to this category (s ee Tabl e S4, Supplementary S 6). Some nursing interventions combine the types of EAP, such as RE and AT (Aconit oil \u2014therapeutic application) or hydrotherapy (HTK) and phytotherapy (Phy) ( flaxseed bath). Eight nursing interventions were recommended by the expert pa nel based on Phy (Solum oil application ; flaxseed bath ; Arnica comp/Formica oil ; Arnica \u2014therapeutic application Arnica comp/Formica ointment ; oil application ; Aconit oil \u2014therapeutic application ; alkaline bath for hand/f oot, then Aconit oil application). In anthroposophic medicine and nursing, Aconite oil is considered a sub- stance that can compensate for overstimulation of nerves and se nses in neuropathic pain by its warming and relaxing agents. Solum oil forms a protecti ve thermal mantle that pre- vents overstimulation of nerves and senses. Except for Solum oil, a ll interventions are rated 3 or 4 on the five -point Likert scale. Aconit oil application is used most frequently (five out of six institutions). The literature search yielded seven results related to CIPN [17,35 -37,50,75,101] and five results related to other types of pain [15,46,47,56,86] . Among the studies, there were two meta -analys observational study [86] and a S3 guideline [37], which reports a non - randomized pilot study. The quality of nine studies was rated excell ent according to the CASP scheme [15,35 -37,46,47,50,56,75] , and three studies were rated go od [17,86,101] . Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 19 of 37 More details on the assessment of study quality according to CASP c an be found in the Supplementary S 5 (Table S3). Henna application (HA) on hands and feet for women under Oxaliplatin t reatment showed significant beneficial effect on CIPN. The procedure is considered inexpensive and well tolerated ( n = 1 study; n = 60 participants; intervention duration: three 15 -day treatment courses) [17]. All types of Phy (e.g., hand /foot bath, compress) used in TCM for reducing CIPN were assessed in the meta -analysis. Herbs that activate blood, improve microcirculation, and dilate collaterals (e.g., astragalus, ginger) were found to have po- tential healing effects as well as improvement in sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV ) and motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV ). This was found for all grades of CIPN for preventive and curative treatment, even though more research is needed ( n = 2 0 studies; n = 1481 participants) [35]. In another review , some types of Phy were found to have potentially preventive and/or therapeutic effects for CI PN. Due to the characteristics of CIPN, the direct application would be considered an effectiv e dosage form ( n = 28 stud- ies; n = 2174 participants) [36]. The safety and efficacy of topical Citrullus colocynthis (bitter apple) oil in the man- agement of CIPN was evaluated in a RCT. No significant improvement co uld be shown. The intervention failed to improve the symptoms of CIPN compared with placebo ( n = 1 study; n = 18 participants, intervention duration: two months) [75]. Solum oil adminis- tered as RE was shown in an observational study to be a promising an d useful comple- mentary method for the treatment of chronic low back pain [86]. Aromatherapy, Aromatherapy Massage , and Aromatherap y Reflexology Aromatherapy (AT) is a part of Phy and deals with the application o f essential oils with physical, psychosomatic, psychological , and physiological effects [113] , which are processed in the limbic system [47,114,115] . Aromatherapy massage (AT -M) or reflexology (AT -R) combines two therapeutic ap- proaches. The systematic, controlled application of essential oils through AT with the ap- plication of specific physical manipulations to the soft tissues of the body through M or stimulation o f specific trigger points through reflexology (R). Three nursing in terventions recommended by the expert panel focused on AT ( rosemary ointment, peppermint oil for heat sensations and paresthesia, and eucalyptus oil application for heat sensations and pare sthesia). These are used in one of the six institutions. Rosemar y oil was rated between three and four on the five -point Likert scale, while peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil were rated two. Compared to standard medical care, aromatherapy hand and foot mas sage (AT -M) significantly reduced incidence of neuropathic pain at week six; severi ty of neuropathic pain at weeks two, four, and six; and fatigue at week eight (n = 1 study; n = 46 participants with CIPN and fatigue receiving Oxaliplatin; intervention: 18 sessions of 40 min over six weeks) [101] . AT -R conducted by patients themselves resulted in statistically signi ficant reduction of PNP symptoms in a RCT with pre -post design ( n = 1 study, n = 63 partici- pants, intervention duration: six weeks) [50]. One p roof of concept pilot study (Fallon et al. 2015), discussed in the S3 guid eline supportive therapy [37], showed significant reduction in CIPN pain symptoms plus an improvement in functionality and sensitivity by application of Menthol cr\u00e8me 1%. AT -M was sh own to significantly decrease neuropathic pain severity and quality of life (QoL) in diabetic patients ( n = 1 study; n = 46 participants; intervention duration: four weeks) [47]. Various types of massage were assessed in a meta -analysis [56]. AT -M had sign ificant ef- fects on cancer pain in two studies, but pain relief was short -lived (two weeks) ( n = 12 RCTs; n = 559 participants) [56]. The beneficial effects of AT -M on self -selected problems measured by MYCaW score have been confirmed by a non -blinded, rand omized study for patients with cancer ( n = 1 study; n = 115 participants; intervention duration: four treat- ments) [46]. Bardia et systematic on complementa ry treat- ments (CTs) for cancer -related pain. One study with high quality based on the Jadad score Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 20 of 37 added l avender AT to M and found no difference in effect on pain ( n = 18 RCTs; n = 1499 particip ants) [15]. 3.8. Movement Therapies Movement therapy (MT) applies body movement that can help p ersons to cope with physical or mental illnesses, disabilities, or life challenges. The aim of MT, which can in- clude various physical activities, is to enhance the person's cognitiv e, physical, mental, social , and emotional well -being. There have been multiple studies investigating the effect of different forms of physical activity and MT on CIPN. They are thou ght to attenuate CIPN through its influence on blood irculation, inflammation, pain -inhibiting neuro- transmitters, endogenous opioids , and coping and symptom interaction mechanisms [48,54] . In total, evidence was found for 18 studies with different study des igns and different forms of exercises (E s), i.e., cardiovascular E, coordination training, cycling, closed kine- matic chain E s, passive mobilization, resistance training, sensorimotor traini ng, whole - body -vibration, and walking. Most studies were reviews ( n = 8) [54,57,60,64,96,97,100,102] or were conducted with controlled designs ( n = 6) [38,48,69,84,89,94] , and clinical guide- lines were also considered ( n = 3) [37,66,98] . Study quality ranged from satisfactory ( n = 1) [69] to good ( n = 11) [38,84,89,90,94,96 -98,100,102] to excellent ( n = 7) [37,48,54,57,60,64,66] . Most of the included E studies focused on examining CIPN for patients with cancer ( n = 12) [37,38,48,54,64,66,69,89,94,96,98,102] , while some studies exclusively examined pa- tients with breast cancer ( n = 3) [38,48,64] , patients with colorectal cancer ( n = 1) [94] , or patients with lymphoma ( n = 1) [60] , and two studies specifically focused on cancer survi- vors [84,98] . Some of the included studies ( n = 3) focused on improving general pain in patients with cancer [57,66,100] , while som e studies ( n = 3) mainly included diabetic pa- tients with neuropathies only [60,96,97] . Closed kinematic chain exercises (CKC -Es) are based on the concept of moving spe- cific joints and segments , creating a chain of events that affects the movement of neigh- boring joints of segments. By performing CKC -Es, the hand or foot is in contact with the surface on which one practices (e.g., squats, lunges, deadlifts, power cleans, leg presses, push -ups and derivates ; pull-ups or chin -ups; and dips). CKC -Es significantl y decreased the modified total neuropathy score (mTNS) and significantly incr eased the Berg Balance Score (BBS) in a single -group pre -post prospective study ( n = 1 study; n = 25 individuals with CIPN; intervention duration: 15 sessions over 3 weeks) [69]. Future research might investigate on long -term clinically significant effects and consider larger samp le sizes. An interactive sensor -based balance training (BT) significantly reduced a sway of hip, ankle , and center of mass when compared to a CG ( n = 1 study; n = 22 participants; inter- vention duration: two sessions per week (45 min) for four weeks) [90]. The challenges of postural performance, by coordinating the ankles as well as the dynamic weight shifting , may have contributed to those effects and can be further assessed in larger trials. The ben- eficial effects of BT have been confirmed in a systematic review on exerci se intervention studies for neuropathic patients [60]. The results indicate that BT have a stronger effect on peripheral neuropathies th an exercise intervention focusing on strength or endurance or both. Only one included study (Streckmann, Kneis et al. 2014) in the re view by Streck- mann, Zopf et al. [60] and referred to in one clinical guideline [37] focused specifically on CIPN and indica ted that BT and in particular sensorimotor training (SMT) may have the most beneficial effect for supporting patients with cancer during therap y for improving quality of life outcomes and also for improving their periphera l deep sensitivity. Physical thera py significantly decreased CIPN when compared to a CG after chemo - therapy and three months post -chemotherapy ( n = 1 study; n = 48 breast cancer patients (stage I -III); intervention duration: four visits by a physical ther apist to develop a home E and educat ion program at the beginning of chemotherapy) [38]. Nerve gliding E s (for elongating the nerve) were completed three times daily for five to ten min utes and not Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 21 of 37 only significantly reduced CIPN, but also significantly improv ed pain pressure threshold and gr ip dynamometry. The beneficial effects of exercises have been confirmed by anot her study assessing a multimodal exercise intervention consisting of resistance training (R T), balance training (BT) , and cardiovascular exercises (CardE s) (n = 1 study; n = 29 cancer survivors; interven- tion duration: three times per week for a duration of eight weeks) [84]. CIPN symptoms improved significantly from pre -E to post -E. Such findings are encouraging and could be confirmed by a larger trial. Current clinical guidelines for the supp ortive therapy for pa- tients with cancer [37] and survivors [98] recommend E therapies as well. An exercise program including progressive walking (W) and resis tance training (RT) has an effect on patients' CIPN symptoms [48] (n = 1 study; n = 355 individuals affected with cancer; intervention duration: six weeks). Compared to the CG, sy mptoms of in hands/feet and numbness and tingling were signifi cantly reduced in the IG. This effect may have developed as exercises can reduce chron ic inflammation, and inflammatory processes appear to play a role in the etiology an d treatment of CIPN. Thus, the authors clearly call on interprofessional healthcare teams to pr escribe exercise thera- pies for their patients. A multimodal exercise program including endurance (EN), resistance (RT) , and bal- ance training (BT) on CIPN helped patients to keep their CIPN symptoms s table ( n = 1 study; n = 24 metastasized colorectal cancer patients; intervention duration : two times per week for 60 min) [94]. Compared to the CG , patients in the IG did not experience a wors- ening of their symptoms. Another integrated exercise program including massage (M), passi ve mobilization (PM), and physical exercise (E) evaluated whole -body vibration (WBV) (by applying the vibration platform Galileo -Fitness) ( n = 1 study; n = 131 patients with CIPN; intervention duration: 15 training sessions within 15 weeks) [89]. Patients in the WBV condition plus the integrated E program performed better with regard to the primary outcome, the chair -rising test (CRT) (a test where patients are asked to stand up from a chair and then cross their arms in front of the chest for five t imes as fast as possible). All patients completing the study experienced less symptoms and pain and improved their CRT over time. The authors conclude that this program co uld be well integrated into daily clinical practice, but a standardized assessment of CIPN is needed as well as ade- quate education of nursing staff. One review assessed WBV [97]. Of the five included studies, four studies were on diabetic peripheral neuropathy, an d one study was on HIV - associated distal symmetrical polyneuropathy. Three of the fiv e studies found a beneficial effect of WBV on neuropathic pain as well as for improvements in streng th and balance ; however , this was not confirmed by two others of the included studies. As the methodol- ogy for all included studies was reported to be low, a nd none was focused on patients with cancer or survivors, the authors conclude that there is a high need to further explore the effect of WBV in high -quality trials in cancer populations. Those encouraging results and recommendations, however, have been dimmed b y some reviews including a range of studies investigating if MT contribute to CIPN and pain relief. One current review synthesized evidence for the effects of exerci se on CIPN sympto ms [54], and only clinical trials and meta -analyses have been searched, so that the results yielded in 13 included studies investigating four different types of exercise (E): Yoga (Y), aerobic (Ae) E, strength training (STr), and balance training (BT). I t was con- cluded that none of the studies met 100% of the CONSORT checklist crit eria, and only two of the studies were considered as moderate -quality evidence. Even though all the seven studies demonstrated that AeE led to significant CIPN benefits, the autho rs recommended interpreting the results with caution and suggested that mo re evidence is needed to con- clude that E interventions influence CIPN symptoms. Nevertheless, therapists, physiotherapist, and pharmacists can inform and encourage patients and survivors of practicing physical E to improve their balance, fitness, and bette r manage their sympto- matic burden. The authors of a Cochrane review [57], which alrea dy dates back several Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 22 of 37 years, came to a similar conclusion, a nd due to a large heterogeneity of included E pro- grams (40 trials on STr, resistance training (RT), walking (W), c ycling (Cy), Y, QG, and TC), it was difficult to draw concrete conclusion and reco mmendations. In a systematic review of systematic reviews [64], effects of multiple rehabilitation interventions, includ- ing E and physical activity (PhA), complementary and alter native medicine, Y, lymphoe- dema treatment, and psychosocial interventions , could be demonstrated for general pain and other symptom outcomes. Here again, the effect concepts have not b een differenti- ated. All 37 included studies were evaluated with the AMSTAR 2 to ol, with 21 were hav- ing low, 14 having moderate , and 2 having high meth odological quality. In other reviews, however, the general benefits of non -pharmacological interventions including physical therapy (PT) to reduce CIPN [102] and general pain [100] have been pointed out and are more comprehensible due to the applied catego rization system. One review assessed strength - and balance -training (STr and BT) programs in pa- tients at high risk of falls [96]. Overall, 3 out of 13 studies found that Str and BT were safe and effective at reducing falls and improving strength and bal ance in adult patients with diabetes -related peripheral neuropathy. Future research could use this as a bas is to con- duct further studies with these safe and effective interventions for ca ncer patients with CIPN. One clinical guideline assessed preventative op tions for CIPN [37]. Regular MT, in particular for training the fingers and toes, as well as sensorimo tor training (SMT) with bean baths, or electrotherapy with two - or four -cell baths (here one or two extremities \u2014 feet/lower legs or hands/forearms\u2014 are immersed in a water bath and a larger plate elec- trode\u2014 200 to 300 cm2\u2014is placed lumbar or cervical, respectively) have been presented as non-pharmacological options for preventing CIPN. Tactile stimulation by application of special naturo pathic procedures , such as beeswax kneading, hedgehog ball massage, and quartz sand bath s, has also been recommended by the expert panel based on yearlong experience as options for early prevent ion and/or treat ment of CIPN. 3.9. Mind -Body Therapies Accordi ng to the National Center of Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), mind -body therapies (MBT) or modalities (MBM) are \"practices that focus on the interactions among the brain, mind, body and behavior with the inte nt to use the mind to affect physic al functioning and promote health\" [116] . MBT focus on training the mind - body connection and include modalities as relaxation techniques, meditation , mindful- ness -based therapies, body scan ning , yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, guided im- agery, autogenic training, hypnosis, biofeedback, and cognitive therapies. Exi sting evi- dence shows that mind -body therapies are frequently used in oncology and that they have an effect [117] . Patients use them to improve the quality of life, to strengthen thei r immune sys tem, to reduce stress, and to stimulate hope. Smaller numbers of patients use these therapies to treat specific symptoms such as pain and f atigue [118] . The medical literature on MBT yielded 16 studies, of which 3 studies were on CIPN [16,54,80] . The other studies ( n = 13) were focused on other pain treatment. The most fre- quently described MBM of the studies included was related to yoga (Y) [52,54,57,64,73,80,92] , followed by distraction therapies (DT) [66,70,100,102] and relaxa- tion (Rel) [15,66,70,95,100] . Further studies focused on progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) [45], cognitive behavioral interventions such as problem -solving therapies [79], meditation [80], self -management , and mind -body practices [16]. Within the 21 results, there are 10 systematic reviews [15,16,52,54,57,64,73,95,100,102] , 4 RCTs [45,70,79,92] , 1 study -label, single -arm, mixed -methods design [80], and 1 expert standard for pain management in nursing [66]. The quality of most studies was rated either excellent [15,45,52,54,57,64,66] or good [16,79,80,92,95,100,102] . The quality of two studies was assessed with satisfactory [70,73] . More details on the assessment of study quality according to CASP can be found in the Supplementary S 5 (Table S3). Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 23 of 37 3.9.1. Yoga Yoga (Y) is an ancient Indian system focusing on the physical, menta l, and spiritual practices with the aim to calm one's thoughts and belief concepts. Thus, Y ha s a strong meditative component that also includes pranayamas, or breathing techniques. An intervention consisting o f somatic Yoga (Y) and meditation (Me) improved QoL, flexibility, and balance ( n = 1 study; n = 10 participants with cancer survivors suffering of CIPN; intervention duration: twice a week for eight weeks f or 1.5 h) [80]. Two systematic reviews assessed MBT. Furthermore, 1 of 13 RCTs in one systematic review [16] found MBT including self -management st rategies like Y and Me to reduce CIPN symptoms. An- other systematic review including seven RCTs and six quasi -experiments [54] recom- mended balance training Y intervent ions and treat- ments for CIPN. Additionally, 16 studies ssessed MBT for other pain and patient -re- ported outcomes. Y sessions improved psychological distress as wel l as fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, shortness of breath, insomnia, loss of appetite, and constipation com- pared to a CG at week 6 ( n = 1 study; n = 40 breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy; intervention duration: three Y per week for six weeks ) [92]. Two systematic reviews focused on Y practices. In nine RCTs , Y was compared with a CG and was found to significantly reduce distress, anxiety, depression, and moderately reduce fatigue, a s well as moderately increase general HRQoL, emotional function, and social funct ion in patients with breast cancer [52]. However, studies lacked long intervention durations ; only two studies lasted 12 weeks or longer, all others were shorter and ranged from 6 to 10 weeks. Another systematic review of systematic reviews [64] recommended Y for treat- ing anxiety during active cancer treatment and for improvin g fatigue, sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal s ymptoms , and depression. The practice of Y was recommended for at least 3 months. Another Cochrane review assessed exercise interventions inc luding Y on HRQoL and associated outcomes in cancer survivors [57]. The totality of the movement interventions had an effect on HRQoL at 12 weeks and 6 months follow -up compared to a CG. Exercise interventions also reduced anxiety at 12 weeks follow -up, fatigue at 12 weeks and between 12 weeks and 6 months follow -up, and pain at 12 weeks follow -up compared to a CG. In another review educational article , Y was also recommended for patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) suffering of neuropathic pain (N P) [73]. Even though the pathogenesis of SCI induced NP is different compared to CIPN, the evi dence shows that Y has also the potential to alleviate other pain types. 3.9.2. Distraction Therapies and Relaxation By applying distraction therapy (DT) it is possible to divert one's attention from an unpleasant experience and focus on a positive sensory or cognitive sti mulus inst ead. Com- putational tasks, music, images of nature, and inhaling of aromas can reduce the pain experience by distracting and relaxing oneself [16]. Distraction therapy (DT) has been as- sessed ( n = 4 studies) with mixed results. Pain scores decreased significantly in a single pre-test and post -test group ( n = 1 study; n = 34 female cancer patients with breast or gy- necologic cancer; intervention duration: participants were free to us e it as often as ne eded) after the end of a 48 -hour period [70,100] . Another educational review article [102] recom- mended to apply DT as a non -drug therapy for peripheral neuropathy ; however, a refer- ence specifically relating to CIPN was missing ; thus , no concrete conclusion can be drawn. DT and relaxation (Rel) have also been recommended by a German expert standard for pain management in nursing with reference to one systematic review on non -pharmaco- logical and non -invasive chronic pain interventions (Skelly et al. 2018) [66]. 3.9.3. Additional MBMs Progressive Muscle Relaxation and Relaxation Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and reflexology (R) significantly decreased pain intensity and fatigue and improved QoL compared with PMR alone ( n = 1 study; n = 80 Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 24 of 37 women with gynec ologic cancer, intervention duration: two sessions totaling 60 min were conducted at each of the 16 home visits over 8 weeks) [45]. Two systematic review s as- sessed non -pharmacological treatments for pain [15,95] . Overall, 3 of 18 RCTs in one sys- tematic rev iew found relaxation/imagery and hypnosis to have significant benef its on can- cer pain management [15,95] . Problem- Solving Therapies Problem- solving therapy (PST) significantly reduced symptom limitations including pain when compared to a CG ( n = 1 study; n = 237 individuals affected with cancer; inter- vention duration: 18 -week cognitive behavioral intervention with 10 contacts) from week 10 onwards [79]. 3.10. Acupuncture/ Acupressure (TCM) Acupuncture (A) has been used in all forms of medicinal healing in Chinese me di- cine. A is based on the essential theory of harmonizing imbalances in the body [53]. It is assumed that A triggers pain -inhibiting and regulation -promoting mechanisms at the neuronal, vegetative , and hormonal levels via local and system ic points of action [42,53,63] . The concept of A from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is the regulation of the energy flow of the pathways by the insertion of needles into defined b ody parts. These are supposed to positively influence disturbances of th e organism. Electric current be- tween two A points is used in electro -A. Acupressure (AP) is a variation of A in which the A points are stimulated by finger pressure and is suitable f or self -treatment [63]. The literature search yielded seven results relate d to CIPN [16,42,53,63,68,88,93] and five results related to cancer pain [64,95,98,100,102] . Among the studies were six [16,53,64,95,100,102] reviews, one four -arm RCT [88], one retrospective service evaluation [68], one prospective Phase 2 study [93], and three guidelines [42,63,98] . The quality of four studies was rated excellent [42,53,63,64] according to the CASP scheme, seven studies were rated good [16,88,93,95,98,100,102] , and one was rated satisfactory [68]. Further de- tails on the assessment of stud y quality according to CASP can be found in Supplementary S5 (Table S3). In the studies described in one review, significant effects could be desc ribed in the application of EA in different outcomes. Regarding CIPN , EA was not superior to placebo (n = 13 RCTs; n = 1370 participants) [16]. In another review , it was confirmed that A has been frequently studied for cancer -related pain, but the data regarding alleviation of CIPN have not yet been convincing ( n = 4 meta -analyses, 14 systematic reviews, 16 RCTs) [53]. One RCT investigated the use of electro -A for CIPN, but because the sample was small, no final results could indicate a clear improvement for CIPN ( n = 1 study; n = 60 participants; intervention duration: thre e weeks) [88]. Improvement of CIPN symptoms was reported for EA ( n = 1 study; n = 27; intervention duration: six to eight weeks) [93] and for A ( n = 1 study; n = 18 participants; intervention duration: six weeks) [68]. According to one guideline , A can be considered for CIPN [63]. According to another guideline , there is insufficient evidence that EA help to reduce neuropathy in breast cancer patients [42]. Positive effects for A for joint pain in cancer survivors were descr ibed in one guideline [98]. Anoth er review referred to a study on acupuncture by Lim et al. 2011 ; here, A was tolerated, but little to no effects could be found in terms of pain reduction ( n = 11 studies; n = 1047 participants) [100] . Two further studies have described A for general pain, thus not differen tiating in neuropathic pain [42,70,98] . AP can be used for nausea or tumor pain [63,64] but has not been described for CIPN. Two further reviews related to A state that l ittle data exi st [102] , and evidence on A is sparse on CIPN [95]. In one review , A was found to be beneficial to reduce chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting ( n = 37 systematic reviews) [64]. Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 25 of 37 3.11. TENS/Scrambler Therapy Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) reduces the enha nced central ex- citability of nociceptive neurons and decreases release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in the spinal cord [65]. TENS is usually applied at the site of pain, sti mulating large -diameter (A -) afferent fibers, resulting in decreased transmission cell a ctivity and subsequently decreased pain perception, according to the gate -control theory [119] . Scrambler therapy (ST) is an electro -analgesia therapy for the non -inva sive treatment of chronic neuropathic and cancer pain. The literature search yielded three results related to CIPN [65,67,71] and four to cancer pain [66,98,100,102] . Within these studies, two systematic reviews [100,102] , three four-arm RCTs [65,67,71] and two guidelines [66,98] were included. The quality of two studies was rated as excellent according to the CASP scheme [65,66] , three studies as good [98,100,102] , and two as satisfactory [67,71] . Further details on the assessment of study quality according to the CASP scheme can be found in Supplementary S 5 (Table S3). 3.11.1. TENS A wireless, patient -controlled TENS unit significantly improved CIPN and associ- ated outcomes (numeric rating scale of pain, tingling, numbne ss, and cramping) after pa- tients' completion of chemotherapy ( n = 1 study; n = 26 patients with CIPN symptoms; intervention duration: 2 -6 h per day stimulation for 6 weeks). Two systematic reviews assessed TENS. One of the included studies in an educa- tional review on CIPN descri bes the physical effects resulting of TENS: increase of endor- phin release and block noxious sensory impulses trough distr action, strongly supporting that physical therapists may administer TENS [102] . One of eleven studies in one system- atic review [100] found TENS to have the potential to reduce cancer bone pain. One expert standard discussed TENS for pain management with the conclusion that there is currently not enough evidence of TENS efficacy for adults with neuropathic p ain [66]. One clinical guideline on cancer survivorship recommended TENS as well as ST as non -pharmacolog- ical treatment option s for general cancer pain, pointing out that oncologists might refer to such therapy options when addressing patients' needs in consult ations [98]. 3.11.2. Scram bler Therapy Positive effects with regard to ST have been reported ( n = 2 studies). Standardized ST significantly and clinically importantly reduced pain resulting of CIPN at 14 days as well as 1, 2, and 3 months ( n = 1 study; n = 39 oncology patients; intervention duration: 45 -min daily treatment for days) [67]. Scrambler -treated patients experienced sig- nificantly greater improvement in pain, numbness, and tingling compar ed to TENS - treated patients ( n = 1 study; n = 50 patients with CIPN; intervention duration: 30 min per day for 10 -14 days) [71]. 3.12. Conceptu al Therapeutic Approach In 6 out of the 7 5 studies, statements were made on the conceptual therapeutic ap- proach [17,35,37,41,50,75] . These were as follows : use of analgesic, anti -inflammatory ef- fects [17,75] ; regulation of muscles, joints, tendons and lig aments in the body [41]; pro- mote blood circulation [35]; influence the energy of life [35,50] ; improve or normalize nerve activity through mechanical stimuli [37]; and activation of TRP (transient receptor potential) ion channels [37]. 3.13. Side Effects and/or Interactions All reported therapies have been described as well tolerated if administered by trained healthcare staff ; however , it should be noted that sporadically some side effects may occur. Patients receiving TENS have reported contact dermatitis, worsening or new paresthesia, or pain and cramping or tightness in the lower limp s [65,71,100] . Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 26 of 37 Contraindications to the use of TENS include gestational adhere nce and sensitive skin. In addition, the electrodes should not be placed near or over a pacemaker or implanted de- fibrillator, on the front of the neck and on the front of the chest [66]. Scrambler therapy has been reviewed as a safe and analgesic intervention for CIPN , and its use can be con- sidered in clinical care [120-122]. Few adverse ev ents have been reported for massage (M) : for example , cerebrovascular accidents, hematoma, nerve damage, and various pa in syn- dromes [53,69] . One study also reported respiratory infection and gastrointestinal bleed [51]. Additionally, acupuncture (A) is not entirely risk free, as rare cases of pneumothorax and infections have been reported [53,123] . Regarding Yoga (Y), only one study has re- ported adverse events in patients with back pain [52]. Otherwise, Y can be considered as a safe mind -body intervention a nd can in particular be recommended to patients for im- proving their quality of life as well as their mental healt h status [124] . Adverse events for cupping (C) are rare as well, but there have been three cases of fainting (vaso -vagal syn- cope) reported with wet C [55]. No recommendation can be made for Acetyl -l-carnitine (AlC), as this supplement may worsen CIPN [16,42,63,125] . 4. Discussion This two -phase approach with a systematic scoping review and a structu red consen- sus process aimed to provide interprof essional healthcare teams with a comprehensive review and recommendations for clinical practice of the best avai lable evidence on com- plementary treatments for the supportive management of CIPN . In total, 13 non -pharma- cological interventions were identified . The evidence of the scoping review showed that patients with cancer may benefit from treatments that healthcare provi ders practice or recommend for patients like massage (M), reflexology (R), therapeutic touch (TT), rhyth- mical embrocations (REH), or One advantage of comple- mentary treatments is that patients may practice, after a sho rt briefing and education ses- sion, those therapies by themselves, like movement therapies (MT) ra nging from cardio- vascular exercises (CardE) to walki ng (W), as well as mind -body therapies (MBT) like meditation (Me), Yoga (Y), or relaxation (Rel) techniques. Interprofessional healthca re teams, however, should be aware that each potential intervention shou ld be carefully con- sidered regarding its external study evidence and its study quality, a s well as the individ- ual patients' needs and preferences and their possibly prior experien ces with complemen- tary therapies. The recommendations by the integrative oncology expert panel (Tab les S1, 4 and S5) demonstra ted a highly consistent benefit in preventing or relieving CIPN sympto ms pa- tients with cancer can experience when using complementary treat ments by nursing in- terventions in the form of phytotherapeutic (Phy) interventions , hydro- interve ntions are pre- sented in Table S2 of the scoping review. Here, the authors aimed to match the expert recommendations from practice with external study evidence and wanted t o highlight even more treatment possibilities. In total, we could include 16 stud ies with different study designs to demonstrate that there is incipient nascent evidenc e for different nursing interventions in the context of CIPN symptom management. The e ffects for henna appli- cryother apy mas- (M), foot massage (FM), foot reflexology (FR), r eflexology (R), and herbal medicines (Phy) and sensorimotor training (SM) are encouraging and have been presented as possi- ble further complementary treatment options. Previous reviews [15,18] or clinical guide- lines [42,63] have not been able to clearly point out such recommendations, prob ably due to their publication date or because they only considered RCTs , and non -RCTs were left out for a reason due to quality/risk of bias concerns. Thus, the authors think that the above mentioned non -pharmacological int erventions are priority areas for future rigorous RCTs to confirm efficacy prior to being routinely recommended to pa tients. With the help of a scoping review methodology, the authors were able to also include studies with a non -RCT study design and pilot studies, as well as studies with a quasi -Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 27 of 37 experimental design, case reports, or controlled studies, to point out a c omprehensive map of treatments that are available and might help in indi vidual patients. Of course, the presented therapy options cannot be applied with a \"watering can principle\" or a \"one - size-fits-all\" approach . According to the EbM approach, the choice of intervention is se- lected in consideration of the patient 's perspective and the individual clinical expertise of the health professionals [22]. For all presented complementary treatments, appropriate training is necessary, and a precise understanding of the inter ventions as well as the indi- cations and contraindications is an important precondition before applying those inter- ventions in ever yday care. As a first step into the field of complementary t herapies, inter- ested healthcare professionals can find an overview of effective therapi es here, but the second step needs to be a comprehensive training in such therapies to prec isely get to know which patients can benefit from which complementary therapies in which situa- tions. 4.1. Interprofessional Teamwork Cancer treatment and care involves interprofessional and interdisciplina ry team- work and collaboration around and with the cancer patient (see Figure 3) . Within com- prehensive cancer care , it is even more important that healthcare professionals collabora te with each other to find together the most effective and best treat ment strategy for the can- cer patient and his/her family. Thus, with Table S2, the authors aimed to demonstrate other advances in complementary treatment options that can be conducted by other healthcare professionals like doctors, psychologists, nutr ition therapists, midwives, phar- macists , or physiotherapists. If nurses get to kno w that their patients are interested in other complementary therapies \u2014for instance, acupuncture (A), mind -body therapies (MBT), movement therapies (MT), TENS/scrambler therapy (ST), and nutritional therapy (NT) \u2014to better cope with the CIPN symptoms, they m ight refer their patients to their healthcare professionals' colleagues and vice versa. In total, Ta ble S2 has 59 entries with references to external study evidence. All included studies involved diff erent healthcare professionals (except nurses as they are considered in Table S1) and primarily focused on improving the outcome CIPN. In some cases, however, the authors also included studies if they focused on pain only [15,67,86] , or included study participants other than patients with cancer [47,86,97] . The authors did this additional effort and described the concept of effect to demonstrate which complementary therapies were examined in similar clinical contexts with the according outcomes, so that those results could be used a s basis in future research on CIPN. 4.2. Challenges of Categorizing Non -Pharmacological Therapies In the thriving field of complementary therapies, it is hi ghly relevant to differentiate between therapies that indeed have been studied in research and have demons trated clin- ical effects compared to those therapies that have not been studied in research. The au- thors of the present study wanted to report proven treatment options , which might be considered in some patient cases, so that patient safety and w ell-being can be guaranteed. In addition, the framework of Kneipp has been in use for many years, espec ially in Ger- man -speaking countries, and has also become an established system in academic teaching of complementary therapies [126,127] . For collating and as sembling the results from the expert symposium and the many study references, the authors found this classification system very useful, as every expert recommendation or study referenc e could be assigned to one of the 13 categories. Sometimes, there were o verlaps of categories, for example in the case of Qi Gong (QG) or Tai Chi (TC), as those therapies origina te of a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) context. As these also can be applied detached from TCM, they were considered in two categories: \" mind-body TCM categories\" (non -classical natural therapies). The authors would have done the same with Yoga (Y), and would have made a frequency count in two cate- gories: \"mind -body therapies (MBT)\" AND \" Ayurvedic medicine\", as this technique is a Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 28 of 37 holistic practice system of its own (hence , it would count in the category \"MBT\"), but is also closely connected with Ayurvedic medicine and can be applied in Ayurvedic contexts too (hence , it would further count in the category \" Ayurvedic medicine\"). At this time point, however, there have been no further studies or recommendations publ ished for CIPN management from Ayurvedic medicine, so these are just explanations in the sub- junctive and a call to do further resear ch in this field, as it is highly requested by patients [128,129] . In the current review, the systematic categorization of classi cal natural therapies ac- cording to Kneipp and the non -classical natural therapies were applied to better point out the effect c oncept of the categorized interventions. According to this esta blished categori- zation, for instance, the authors of the current review would n ot have categorized Y, QG , or TC exclusively to MT, but rather to MBT (or non -classical natural therapies and Ayur- vedic medicine in the case of Y or TCM in the case of QG and TC), as the effect concept is different compared to classical MT like AeT or RT. Future research on CI PN interventions might focus more on patient -reported outcomes measures (PROMs) and validated grad- ing systems for neuropathy in the first instance, so that patie nt-oriented outcomes (PROs) can be measured and compared within and between the studies. Such da ta are also rele- vant for clinical consultations in which healthcare professionals can then b etter address the current needs and demands of their patients. 4.3. Further Integration of Non-Pharmacological Therapies in the Healthcare System There is a high demand and interest in complementing conventional ca re by patients [13,130] and by providers [131,132] . It is urgent that the structures in the healthcare sys- tems be adjusted and enhanced to meet patients' needs and to guarant ee patient safety. If patients are not informed and counselled by their healthcare team i n the clinics or by their GPs, they consult other external providers who often do not have adequate educat ion and take a lot of money out of the patient's pocket [133] . Studies indicate that the majority of nurses have a positive attitude towards complementary therapies, but most of them fe el unsure about how to talk about those therapies with their patients [134] . The topic of in- dication -based application of complementary therapies has not been anchor ed enough in medical and healthcare education, but this is highly needed, so th at healthcare profession- als are educated at an early stage on evidence -based complementary therapy options and can communicate this with their patients in an open, self -confident, and competent dia- logue. Within this clinical practice guideline, the authors aim to info rm and educate inter- ested healthcare providers on the treatment possibilities for CIPN symp tom management. We have presented the evidence for the seven most frequently mentioned com plementary therapies: (1) manipulative therapies (2) phytotherapy, (3) movem ent therapies, (4) mind - body therapies, (5) acupuncture/acupressure, (6) rhythmical embr ocations, and (7) TENS/ scrambler therapy. Three of the five Kneipp's pillars have been present ed as the top treatment options, as there has been much evidence identified for th ose pillars. Interested healthcare professionals might start by engaging themselves with a ba sic training in the five pillars of classical natural therapies on which the naturop athic health concept accord- ing to Kneipp is based [126,127] . 4.4. Directions for Future Research The review does not only aim to inform and extend clinical practi ce, but also identi- fies important areas for future research. This includes in particula r the important question if CIPN can be prevented. Currently, the majority of research focuses on treati ng CIPN, and some researchers are of the opinion that there are no effective preventi ve applications available for CIPN [76,132] . The current results, however, show recommendations for 20 prophylactic interventions (see Table 1) that can be investigated fu rther in systematic re- search. There have also been some studies reported on Phy for preventive use [29,44] ; however, such reports need to be considered with caution, as in non -Western countries, there is often a mixture of substances usually tested in s tudies and , thus , transferability is Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 29 of 37 difficult [105] . More research on preventive measures is therefore highly recommended, mainly because the conventional therapies are not sufficient ly satisfactory. The consensus results (the preventive and complementary tr eatment options for CIPN) of the expert panel can be used in clinical practice and can als o be used as a basis for designing future research in this area. The applied classificatio n system of classical and non-classical natural therapies clearly illustrates that, in the contex t of CIPN management, there is much experiential evidence for nursing interventions (aro und EAP/AT/ToT/Phy) and much external evidence for MT or/and MBT. The latter therapy options have been broadly considered in research studies, and it is expected that future research of nursing interventions will follow a similar line , and that suitable research designs and contexts will be encouraged by appropriate requests for research proposals promoted b y healthcare organizations and institutes. As long as there is not much external evidence of nursing studies nor clinical guidelines focusing on recommendations for actio n in this field, it is even more important to make the practical exp erience of the many years of ex- periential knowledge of oncolo gy nurses visible and applicable to other clinics and nurses. Stolz et al. [20] reported on a systematic methodology combining both evidence types wit h which it is possible to generate clinical recommendations. Following this approach, the authors were abl e to comprehensively overview all possible complementary the rapy op- tions for CIPN management, thereby considering the field from an interprofessional per- spective ; thus, the authors could present in detail which therapies can be conducted by which healthcar e professionals (Figure 3). Future research may be especially recom- mended for cryotherapy interventions, ous-flow hypothermia [18,40] . In contrast to the high drop -out rates up to 50% for cryo- therapy with frozen gloves [19], cryocompression and continuous -flow hypothermia [18,40] were safe and well -tolerated interventions to prevent CIPN and should be investi- gated in a larger trial. For future intervention research, the authors strongly recommend including a qua li- tative -quantitative process analysis running parallel to the main outcome study, so that it is possible to (1) include the perspective of the patients and the h ealth professionals and (2) consider context and individual aspects that cannot be measured wi th quantitative data [135] . Another important aspect for future supportive care research, esp ecially in the area of CIPN, is to include more patient -reported outcomes measures (PROMs , which are experienced by patients in everyday life) and patient -reported experience measures (PREMs, like patient satisfaction with conventional and complementary treat ment), so that patient care interventions can be assessed in a validated and reliable way. 4.5. Strengths and Limitations The present study has some limitations. First, this review mainly co nsidered pub- lished English, French, and German language literature about ad ult patients with cancer. The results could have been even more comprehensive if we included opinions a nd ex- pertise from professionals in the languages and databases of other interesting cultures like Asia, the Middle East, South America, and Africa, with a great tradition in na turopathic tradition. However, this review did include studies conducted in non -English - and non - German -speaking countries , such as China, Finland, France, Iran, Italy, Netherlands, Sin- gapore, Republic of Korea, Sweden, Taiwan, and Turkey. Second, even though the authors oriented on the guidelines for conducting a scoping review to be able t o include a wider range and consider a variability of different studies, the review did not include a search of the many written and electronic sources of information for patients or for health pro- fessionals. In total, the authors included 17 expert recommendations, 70 studies , and 5 clinica l guidelines relevant for the treatment of polyneuropathies resultin g from chemo- therapy treatment, which is a considerable data pool, but i t could have been more exten- sive if the authors were able to consider other contexts and sources too. With the help o f a scoping review study design [26,27,136] , the authors aimed to also include studies with a non -randomized study design, pilot studies, and qualitative studies foc using on the Med. Sci. 2023 , 11, 15 30 of 37 patient perspective and their experiences. However, as the results show, the a uthors in- clude d 42 quantitative studies with different designs, but the search only yielded 3 mixed - methods studies (controlled studies with a qualitative component). The authors would have expected more qualitative results, especially in studies reporting about innovative complementary medicine interventions. Furthermore, even though the core research team has many years of experience in academic work as well as in patient care in Western coun- tries, it could have been affected by reporting bias [137] , with the tendency of researchers to submit positive, but not negative results for publication. Despite these limitations, this is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first com- prehensive review with clinical recommendations that reports about supp ortiv e treat- ment options for patients with cancer affected by polyneuropathie s. In addition, by exam- ining not only the nursing interventions, but also the interventi ons conducted by medical doctors, psychologists, physiotherapists, and nutritional thera pists, a stronger invocation for considering applying such complementary therapies in routine care a nd treatment is provided. The authors decided to appraise the quality of the studies, as it is common with systematic reviews and increasingly with scoping reviews, by applying CASP [33] to have a better insight into the quality of the included studies and to know if some studies need to be excluded. The CASP appraisal form was, however, not alway s suitable for the dif- ferent studies considered. As there were no appra isal forms available, for example for case reports or retrospective studies, those were appraised with the CASP -RCT form, even though not all questions (in particular questions 4 -7) were applicable. The rating would therefore have been different with other appraisal tools. 5. Conclusions The best available evidence of non -pharmacological treatments for CIPN manage- ment in patients with cancer are summarized herein . Based on the literature and the long - term practical experience of the involved experts, the in terventions shown here have high potential to be wide ly implemented into routine care. For complementary methods for CIPN to be implemented into safe and evidence -based practice, healthcare providers would need to expand clinical practice with additional t raining. Patients would need more information that empowers them to actively ask their healthcare team for these treatments more often. To support this, future research in symptom care and treat ment would be useful to make the expert knowledge \"tangible \". Future prospective trials are also needed to validate the efficacy and safety of the here presented non -pharmacological interven- tions in individuals affected with cancer, so targeted interv entions can be developed and implemented to treat and prevent the symptom s of complex CIPN.
