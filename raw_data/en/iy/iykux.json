Side effects may include a headache, fatigue, achiness, fever and nausea. They're usually mild and go away on their own within a few days, according to federal health officials. But why would side effects be more intense after the second dose? Health experts say it has to do with how the immune system responds to the virus. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, the two-dose shots that are available, are mRNA vaccines that work by using genetic code to teach the body how to make a protein that sets off an immune response that helps generate antibodies. When people who have never been exposed to COVID-19 before are vaccinated, their immune systems recognize the protein as foreign and mounts a response to it \u2014 but not a very strong one, said Dr. Beth Kassanoff, an internal medicine physician with North Texas Preferred Health Partners and president of the Dallas County Medical Society. With the second dose of the vaccine, a person's immune system \"remembers\" the protein and responds more aggressively. \"When you get the second vaccine, then you have a much more robust immune response because your body already has some of these antibodies,\" she said. \"They're ready to fight off the infection.\" Although that response can cause flu-like symptoms, that's actually a good sign and means the vaccine is doing its job. But at the same time, people who don't have side effects don't need to worry, Kassanoff said. A lack of side effects doesn't mean your body isn't responding to the shot. \"I've seen people of all ages, some of whom got pretty significant achiness, low-grade fever, fatigue,\" she said. \"And then one of my partners, who is 50, had zero side effects from the second one. He was actually a little worried about it at first, but subsequently checked his antibodies and he responded just fine. It was just very interesting, you can't really predict it.\" Health experts are still learning more about why some people experience more intense side effects than others, but they say age and past exposure to COVID-19 are factors. \"One pattern that we're consistently seeing is older people have less side effects than younger people. We don't really know why,\" said Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist at the UTHealth School of Public Health in Dallas. \"The other pattern we're seeing is those that have had COVID before and get the vaccine have more severe side effects. That makes sense because that means they have some level of immunity and the body's recognizing the antibodies in that vaccine and reacting.\" Kassanoff said she's heard reports of COVID-19 \"long haulers,\" or people who have symptoms that linger long after they no longer test positive for the virus, having their symptoms somewhat resolve after they're vaccinated. But health experts say the specifics of those trends aren't known yet. \"I take care of whole families of people, like parents and adult children and all that kind of stuff, and everybody just has a completely different response,\" Kassanoff said. \"Even within the same family, even of roughly the same age, even of roughly the same genetics, sometimes people just respond more.\" That trend is not specific to the COVID-19 shot \u2014 even with other vaccines, some people respond differently than others, she said. As more people get vaccinated, more information about the specifics of vaccine side effects will become known, health experts say. Although Jetelina said second-dose side effects may seem intimidating, people shouldn't let them discourage them from getting vaccinated. \"It's daunting, I will say, to sign up to get sick,\" she said. \"Not everyone gets sick and honestly the majority of people do not get sick, we just hear about these terrible people or cases where people do get sick. What I say is suck it up, take a Tylenol and take the day off and it will clear up. I promise you "}
