With just a few ingredients simmered low and slow on the stovetop, it's also the perfect homemade dish when you or your budget is feeling stretched\u2014no cleaning of the juicer necessary. Advertisement The health benefits of congee. Congee has long been a secret weapon of [Traditional Chinese Medicine](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/herbs-that-help-with-digestion) as a salve for the digestive system. Rice is cooked with a much higher ratio of water to grain and simmered until mush, making it both easy to digest and incredibly nourishing for the GI tract. One particular benefit is [hydration](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/benefits-of-drinking-water), due to the amount of water absorbed by the rice grains throughout the cooking process. Chicken stock or bone broth, which is the second key ingredient for congee, is also hydrating and [provides a rich source of collagen](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/collagen-peptides-gut-healing-and-skin-benefits). This protein is required to repair and heal the lining of the GI tract, which can be damaged due to diet and lifestyle stressors. Plus, the easier your meal is to digest\u2014and in the case of congee, that's very easy\u2014the better equipped you are to reap the rewards of any protein and minerals coming in. If you are struggling with a weakened or inflamed digestive system, try preparing this Chinese porridge for a simple, yet powerful healing tool. Advertisement How to make congee. Traditional congee requires little more than white rice and animal protein\u2014usually starchy sushi rice and some bone-in chicken parts\u2014and a pot. For a smoother congee, go with a 10:1 ratio of liquid to rice. For a thicker gruel-like congee, go with a ratio of 7:1. I've designed the recipe below for a happy medium. You can simply simmer the rice in water with whole chicken legs or thighs to create your own broth as it cooks, or if you keep homemade bone broth on hand, you can omit the chicken altogether and use a flavorful stock as a base. Same goes for vegetarian versions: Just use a veggie stock and throw in a few whole mushrooms for added umami. You'll be shocked by how comforting and delicious your congee is with just these three ingredients (water or stock, rice, chicken). But the fun is really in the toppings. Fresh chopped ginger gives you even more digestive gusto, thinly sliced scallions or chives add an oniony undertone, gluten-free tamari or coconut aminos season it further, and dark sesame oil provides a rich nuttiness. To make it more of a complete meal, you can top your congee with a fried egg, or if your [digestion](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-improve-digestion-naturally) is feeling up to it, add some steamed bok choy or spinach for a little green.
