Ahead of 2022, our skin needs are set to change. Spending more time socializing and easing ourselves back into IRL work environments means we're picking up the pace again \u2014 and it's bound to take a toll on our skin.

Whether you're a skincare obsessive or you consider yourself a bit of a novice, it's likely you may have experienced some irritation. Cue redness, flaky skin and sore patches. That's where skin kindness comes in, according to [Alexia Inge](https://www.instagram.com/alexia.inge/?hl=en), cofounder and co-CEO of [Cult Beauty](https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/). \"The latest of skincare brands are focused less on aggressive, fast-acting results and more on nurturing the [skin's barrier](https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/how-to-get-healthy-skin-protect-skin-barrier), maintaining a healthy, diverse microbiome [the good bacteria that live on your skin and keep it healthy and happy] and aligning more with self-care,\" says Alexia. \"Sensitive skin has become even more prevalent during the pandemic and will likely remain a concern as we step outside after months spent at home,\" adds Alexia, who says that we will be hunting down products and ingredients that support, not strip, the skin's barrier.

Don't let the word 'fermented' put you off, though. According to WGSN, the naturally occurring bacteria found in fermented skincare ingredients prolongs the shelf life of formulas so your skincare goes a long way. Karen Lee-Thompson, founder of [Wo Skincare](https://wearewo.com/), says: \"In Asia, fermented foods have been a key element of everyday diets for hundreds of years; it is also where fermented skincare technology was first developed. As our skin hasn't got the ability to digest ingredients like our gut, the fermented process helps to break down the active ingredients into smaller and simpler molecules, making it easier to be absorbed by our skin.\" In turn, this may result in less irritation. \"These types of skincare work really well for drier skin,\" says Karen. If your skin is on the dry or sensitive side, try the [Daily Base Comfort Balm, \u00a330](https://wearewo.com/products/daily-base-comfort-balm), which features fermented shiunko, a herb oil blend championed in Korean herbal medicine for reducing inflammation and redness.
