At Elk Gove Naturopathic Medicine, we offer the following treatment modalities: Message from Dr. Monique My inspiration to become a Naturopathic Doctor evolved around my interest to learn more about natural therapeutic modalities so that I can assist my patients in their healing process toward wellness. My priority as a health care provider is to look out for my patients' best interest with the goal to provide the best optimal care and educate my patients about their health options. \"My family was referred to Dr. Monique by a coworker. My daughter is 10 yo, has ADHD Combined, anxiety, and anger rages. After consulting with Dr. Monique filling out a questionnaire my daughter was prescribed a constitutional remedy for her anger. Within a couple weeks her anger rages began to lessen. It has now been over 1 year and my daughter is able to talk through her frustration and is no longer suffering from anger rages. It is heart breaking for a parent to feel helpless when your child needs you. Without Dr. Monique's help life would still be unbearable. \" - Dawn (Ione, CA) \"Dr. Chhun-lum has helped me with prostrate, high blood pressure, dry eye, and most recently heart burn. With the prostrate I was able to get a better nights sleep. She lowered my blood pressure to a normal level. I no longer need to take eye drops for dry eye. I no longer have heart burn and can eat normal meals. I highly recommend Dr. Chhun-lum for your health needs.\" - Jim (Sacramento, CA) \"With four young children in tow I have had plenty of visits with Dr. Monique. She has helped each one of them with issues ranging from minor to extreme. One of my daughters had severe eczema since she was a newborn. She was colic, always scratching, and had open sores on her lower cheeks from rubbing. Around 4 months of age I took her Dr. Monique. She worked with our diet and prescribed natural supplements and natural creams. In less than a month she was a completely different baby. She even slept better through the night! Now that she is older and eating solids she can even tolerate some foods that she used to react to. This is just one example, but honestly Dr. Monique has opened my eyes to a completely different world of health I didn't know existed; one where the doctor really does care about the patient and wants to get to the root of the issue. Each time we visit her office I learn something new and she always makes sure to thoroughly answer my questions. I recommend Dr. Monique to my friends that want to care for their health as naturally as possible!\" - Natalie (Stockton, CA) \"Dr. Monique has been a blessing to me. I've been struggling from hypothyroidism for quite some time and she has made a big difference in my life. She has taught me a lot on good nutrition and the right supplements to take and because of that; my thyroid is now at the normal range. I don't need to take thyroid pills. Any other illness that I have, she is always there to help. For me she's the best!\" - Mary (Herald, CA) \"I highly recommend Elk Grove Naturopathic Medicine.
