It is intimately connected with the nervous and respiratory system. Disorder and imbalance of the Vata dosha can lead to insomnia, anxiety, stress-related disorders, asthma, arthritis and other illnesses. Pitta: The Pitta dosha is generally characterized as dynamic, ruddy, fiery-tempered, excessive, well-proportioned, sharp, bold, and hot. It is intimately connected to the circulatory, endocrine and digestive systems. Disorder and imbalance of the Pitta dosha can lead to inflammation, fever, hair loss, diarrhea, high blood pressure, liver problems and other diseases. Kapha: The Kapha dosha is generally characterized as slow, steady, dull, heavy, easy-going, oily, smooth, thick, cold, calm, and grounded. It is intimately connected with the immune and lymphatic systems. Disorder and imbalance of the Kapha dosha can lead to low energy, depression, obesity, gout, diabetes and other illnesses. One or other of these doshas normally predominates in an individual and thus it becomes a science of body types, wherein individuals are said to be either of the Vata body-type or Pitta body-type or Kapha body-type, or sometimes there is one dosha predominant and one subdominant such as in a Vata-Pitta or Vata-Kapha body-type. The predominance of one dosha over another is not necessarily fixed throughout life and can change depending on health and climatic or seasonal factors and can change as one ages. Regardless of one's predominant dosha and body type, the standard of health according to Ayurvedic wisdom is to have a balance and harmony between the doshas in the body, as imbalances between the doshas lead to illness and disease. Too much of one dosha and not enough of another dosha in various tissues or organs or systems of the body will lead to illness of that tissue or body system. Thus it becomes important to stimulate inactive doshas or to pacify overactive ones and harmonize their actions in different contexts to promote overall health and well-being. Aromatherapy Aromatherapy is the therapeutic science of fragrance and aroma, called in Sanskrit gandha cikits. This therapy focuses on the healing power of fragrances to restore balance and harmony on a subtle level to the emotions and nervous system. The healing power of aromas and fragrances is usually harnessed through the diffusion of essential oils, or traditionally in Ayurveda through the burning of incense. Individual fragrances like Lavender, Sandalwood, Citrus, Camphor, Rose, etc., each have specific properties and actions on the subtle nervous system of the body and are useful in different conditions. Certain fragrances can help to calm the nerves and emotions or to stimulate the mind and senses, to aid in sleep and relaxation or to relieve certain kinds of pain or to prepare the mind for meditation and spiritual practice, among other things. Each fragrance also will have an action on one or other of the three Ayurvedic doshas of the body, and thus certain fragrances are better on a general level to support health and well-being for each of the different dosha body-types. Here we mention a few fragrances (not exhaustive) which are generally helpful for each dosha and body-type: Fragrances for balancing Vata and for Vata body-types The following fragrances are helpful for balancing Vata body-types and are known to soothe and have a grounding effect on airy, high-strung Vata natures.
