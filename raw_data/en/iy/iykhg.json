My legs were too short to dangle off a chair, so mum would make me stand in the warm, salt-water-filled tub. As an adult, I use raw sea salt to perform jal neti and Himalayan salt, and coconut oil to exfoliate my armpits. I also regularly take salt baths to cleanse negative energy. Salt is a staple across time and cultures, used for enhancement, preservation, protection and cleansing. The folklore \"It is used in Wiccan practices as protection. In India, it represents goddess Lakshmi. In the Bible, a reference discusses using salt to counteract sins, while salt circles are commonly used in rituals to protect the space,\" says Ajay Kumar Parakkal, intuitive energy healer and founder Moksa Crystals, Gurugram. He explains that though science has not deemed salt to be able to remove any negative ions, salt water can help produce low-level electrical pulses, similar to the experience of those who practice Reiki and other forms of healing. \"Salt is essentially a [crystal](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/can-crystals-help-you-meet-your-skincare-goals), and crystals have this great ability to change wave patterns around us.

The qualities of salt are unctuous, hot, piercing, and kindling to the digestive fire. She gives the example of how salt is used to melt snow in the West to illustrate its sharp, piercing attributes. Interestingly, the other qualities of salt, according to Bhanshali, are that it breaks bonds and penetrates channels, along with a 'scraping' effect that also makes it a popular ingredient in oil enemas as it breaks up the build-up within the colon and intestines. \"Salt can be used to energetically cleanse and draw moisture from healing stones that cannot be washed under water and is also used to cleanse one's space and body by adding it to a base, like water,\" explains Parakkal.
