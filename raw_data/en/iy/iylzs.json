What are the best vitamins for energy? Wouldn't it be great if we could re-energize our bodies as easily as we gas up our cars? Rather than pulling up to the pump every few days, you can maintain your energy levels with a healthy diet that consistently gives your body the energy-producing nutrients it needs. While getting healthy levels of vitamins A, B, C and D is important, B-complex vitamins also encourage energy in our bodies. In fact, vitamins B3 and B12 are both key to healthy energy production at the cellular level. Is caffeine a good energy boost? Many of us love a good cup of morning coffee. But relying on caffeine from coffee or energy drinks to keep your energy levels up throughout the day isn't a good idea. Caffeine can mess with your sleep patterns and can affect your energy levels the next day. Instead, get a good seven to eight hours of rest a night, exercise regularly, and keep your body nurtured with energy-promoting nutrients such as vitamin B3, antioxidants and ginseng. Are energy supplements good for you? Keeping your cells fired up promotes longevity and youthful vitality throughout your body, which means adding healthy energy supplements to your routine can support your heart health, cognitive health, sleep health...and more!
