Unblock or balance these chakras with yoga poses, breathing exercises, or meditation. If you've ever taken a yoga or meditation class, had an energy healing session like reiki, or just watched online videos about those subjects, you've no doubt heard about chakras and the role they play in the flow of energy in your body. You may have also learned that it's important to keep your chakras open, or unblocked. But what exactly are chakras and how do they affect your physical and emotional well-being? In this article, we'll take a closer look at your main [chakras](/health/fitness-exercise/7-chakras). We'll also help explain the impact these energy centers may have on your mind and body, plus how to keep them \"open\" in order to promote physical, mental, and emotional well-being. In Sanskrit, the word \"chakra\" means \"disk\" or \"wheel\" and refers to the energy centers in your body. These wheels or disks of spinning energy each correspond to certain nerve bundles and major organs. To function at their best, your chakras need to stay open, or balanced. If they get blocked, you may experience physical or emotional symptoms related to a particular chakra. There are seven main chakras that run along your spine. They start at the root, or base, of your spine and extend to the crown of your head. That said, some people believe you have at least [114 different chakras](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342562977_A_Brief_History_of_the_Chakras_in_Human_Body) in the body. The chakras most often referred to are the seven main ones that we'll explore in more detail below. The chakra system refers to the energy centers we have in our bodies. There are seven major chakras, each in a specific location along your spine. Let's look at each one more closely. Root chakra The root chakra, or Muladhara, is located at the base of your spine. It provides you with a base or foundation for life, and it helps you feel grounded and able to withstand challenges. Your root chakra is responsible for your sense of security and stability. Sacral chakra The sacral chakra, or Svadhisthana, is located just below your belly button. This chakra is responsible for your sexual and creative energy. It's also linked to how you relate to your emotions as well as the emotions of others. Solar plexus chakra The solar plexus chakra, or Manipura, is located in your stomach area. It's responsible for confidence and self-esteem, as well as helping you feel in control of your life. Heart chakra The heart chakra, or Anahata, is located near your heart, in the center of your chest. It comes as no surprise that the heart chakra is all about our ability to love and show compassion. Throat chakra The throat chakra, or Vishuddha, is located in your throat. This chakra has to do with our ability to communicate verbally. Third eye chakra The third eye chakra, or Ajna, is located between your eyes. You can thank this chakra for a strong gut instinct. That's because the third eye is responsible for intuition. It's also linked to imagination. Crown chakra The crown chakra, or Sahasrara, is located at the top of your head. Your Sahasrara represents your spiritual connection to yourself, others, and the universe. It also plays a role in your life's purpose. [Diane Malaspina,](https://yogamedicine.com/about-yoga-medicine/diane-malaspina/) PhD, a yoga medicine therapeutic specialist, says she prefers to think of chakras as out of balance versus blocked. \"There can be a depletion of energy flow or too much energetic activity in a chakra \u2014 each will manifest into different outcomes,\" she explained. When a chakra is low in energy, she said, you'll have difficulty expressing the particular qualities associated with that chakra. When a chakra is overactive, Malaspina said, the qualities are a dominant force in the person's life. This can have both physical and emotional effects. For example, the first chakra is about security, survival, and the foundation of our life. If it's underactive, Malaspina said, it can show up as depression and insecurity. If there's too much energy, it can show up as fearlessness without precaution or hoarding because you need more to feel secure. In general, the location of the chakra that's out of balance may affect the parts of your body in close proximity to that chakra, according to Malaspina. This includes your organs, bones, joints, and tissues near that area. Psychologically, she says, imbalances in the chakras may cause an emotional imbalance. This may lead to increased anger, sadness, fear, or indecisiveness. \"It's important to pay attention to both the psychological and physiological sensations because they can inform each other and uncover the root cause of the experience,\" said certified yoga teacher and master reiki healer, Guadalupe Terrones. According to Terrones, experiencing too much stress \u2014 physically or mentally \u2014 may cause one or more chakras to be out of balance. \"Personal habits such as poor physical alignment or posture, eating unhealthy food, or self-destructive behavior may cause a chakra to be imbalanced,\" she said. Terrones also said that prolonged imbalance may lead to physical disease and illness, musculoskeletal issues, and mental health challenges like depression or anxiety. According to Malaspina, a great way to promote balance in a chakra is to create alignment in your physical body through: - yoga postures - breathing practices to encourage the flow of energy - meditation to bring about clarity of mind Each chakra has yoga poses that may help fine-tune its energy. Here are some poses that may help unblock each of your seven chakras. Root chakra The root chakra is the base chakra and reflects your foundation. According to Terrones, [Tree Pose](/health/anxiety/yoga-for-anxiety#tree-pose) or any balancing poses, like [Mountain](/health/fitness-exercise/beginner-yoga-poses#mountain-pose) or Warrior, are great for establishing a stronger relationship with your body's foundation. Sacral chakra The sacral chakra is associated with our reproductive area and is responsible for our creativity and sensuality. Terrones says poses that strengthen your pelvic floor, where the sacral chakra resides, such as [Bridge Pose](/health/fitness-exercise/yoga-for-back-pain#bridge-pose) or deep hip openers like [Pigeon Pose](/health/opening-hips#pigeon-pose) or Lizard Pose, are great for strengthening your sacral chakra. Solar plexus chakra The solar plexus chakra is all about your inner fire and resides around your core. That's why Terrones says core strengthening poses, such as [Boat](/health/flat-stomach-workout#boat-pose) or [Triangle](/health/anxiety/yoga-for-anxiety#triangle-pose), are great for firing up your abs and creating more balance in this chakra. Heart chakra Your heart chakra, according to Terrones, is the integration point between the lower chakras and the higher chakras. \"It reflects our ability to open ourselves up to deeper connections with others,\" she said. To unblock this chakra, she recommends heart openers, such as Camel Pose or Wheel. She also recommends [Cow Face Pose](/health/fitness-exercise/arm-stretches#3.-Cow-Face-Pose-arms-(Gomukhasana-arms)) and Humble Warrior, which help open your chest, shoulders, and arms so you can more fully embrace others. Throat chakra The [throat chakra](/health/health-benefits-of-throat-chakra-stones) is your communication center. According to Terrones, [Plow](/health/diabetes/yoga-for-diabetes#plow-pose) and [Fish](/health/neck-pain-from-yoga#fish-pose) are great poses to open up your throat chakra. Both help open up the back and front sides of your neck, where the throat chakra resides. Third eye chakra The third eye chakra rules your ability to invite a new reality into your life by dreaming up different possibilities. Terrones recommends poses that involve getting your upper body intimately connected with your lower body. According to Terrones, poses such as [Forward Fold](/health/fitness-exercise/beginner-yoga-poses#forward-fold) or Folded Eagle are great for the third eye. \"In these poses, our higher self, represented by our upper bodies, establishes a connection with our more rooted parts of our bodies, our legs, so that we can manifest a dream into a physical reality.\" Crown chakra The crown chakra rules your connection to your higher self. That's why Terrones recommends the pose that comes after all yoga poses: [Savasana](/health/benefits-savasana-after-any-workout), or Corpse Pose. This pose, says Terrones, helps strengthen your crown chakra by connecting you with your eternal self \u2014 your soul \u2014 and reminding you where you came from and where you'll go. Chakras refer to various energy centers in your body that correspond to specific nerve bundles and internal organs. The seven major chakras run from the base of your spine to the top of your head. If these energy centers get blocked, you may experience physical or emotional symptoms related to a particular chakra. One way you may be able to unblock or rebalance your chakras is by doing certain yoga poses. Specific [breathing exercises](/health/breathing-exercise) and [meditation practices](/health/mental-health/types-of-meditation) may also help. If you're not sure where to start or just want to know more about your chakras and how they may affect you, consider working with a professional energy healer, such as a reiki practitioner, or a certified yoga instructor.
