Holistic Healer's all-natural and organic products are free of chemicals, artificial colors synthetic, fragrances, and animal products. We care about your health and the planet's health which is why we only use natural ingredients. Why We Use All Natural Ingredients A holistic world view means that we take into account all the different parts that make up the whole. We call ourselves Holistic Healers because our products are created with the intention to be beneficial for you in a multifaceted way. By creating a line of products with only natural ingredients we are reshaping the beauty industry and showing other companies that it is definitely possible to heal and treat ailments without chemicals, dyes or synthetics. By healing through natural ingredients we are also reconnecting people back to the Earth. Before mainstream medicine, our ancestors depended on plants to heal, we aim to do just that and create more meaningful connections between nature and humans. Mainstream medicine and cosmetics typically use harsh chemicals that treat symptoms but never the root of the problem. They are designed this way so that you have to keep purchasing their product because their main interest is not to heal but rather to make an economic profit. At Holistic Healer our mission is to heal through natural methods. We have created this list because we like to be upfront about the ingredients we use- in fact, we're proud of them! You will be able to find a full list of the ingredients used in the making of each of our products on every single one of our product pages.

Harmful Ingredients in Skin and Body Care Products The harsh chemicals in cosmetics and personal care products eventually make it back to the Earth when we dispose of them, or when we wash them off in the shower. These toxins pollute the atmosphere, the land, aquatic life, harm the animal kingdom and cause us to have breathing problems, and poor health. Our relationship with the Earth is reciprocal, this is why you will find that every product with chemicals not only causes us irritations and health problems but also have a negative impact on the planet and its species! The following are common ingredients in commercial products (NOT OURS) and how it affects the human body. We have made this list for your convenience so that you can familiarize yourself with the names of these chemicals in order to avoid them. How Do Chemicals Affect Our Skin? Formaldehyde Formaldehyde is commonly used as a preservative in beauty products. It is often found in baby shampoo, body wash, hair conditioner, leave-in, nail products, and hair gel. Formaldehyde is a known carcinogen, meaning it causes cancer. It also causes allergic, irritant and contact dermatitis, skin irritations, headaches, and chronic fatigue. Parabens Paraben preservatives (specifically methyl, propyl, butyl, and ethyl parabens) are used as inhibitors of microbial growth and to extend shelf life of products. It is commonly found in makeup, moisturizers, shampoos, conditioners, lotions, facial and shower cleansers, shaving products, and scrubs. Parabens are highly toxic hormone disruptors, have caused many allergic reactions and skin rashes. It is harmful to the respiratory tract and symptoms include redness, itching, and pain. Polyethylene Glycol Polyethylene Glycol also known as PEG is used in a wide variety of skin-care and makeup products. PEG is also used in cleansers to dissolve oil and grease. This potentially carcinogenic petroleum ingredient could increase the appearance of aging since it reduces the skin's natural ability to retain moisture. It can also make you more vulnerable to harmful bacteria. 1,4-Dioxane 1,4-Dioxane is a carcinogenic contaminant found in cosmetic products. Almost 50% of cosmetics were found to contain dioxane. Acute exposure causes irritation, headaches, dizziness, and narcosis. Chronic inhalation exposure can produce damage to the liver and kidneys and can cause blood disorders. Isopropyl Alcohol Alcohol is a very drying and irritating solvent and dehydrator that strips your skin's natural acid mantle, making us more vulnerable to bacteria, molds, and viruses. It is made from propylene, a petroleum derivative. It may promote brown spots and premature aging of the skin. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate (ALS) is commonly used in toothpaste, shampoo, hand soap, car washes, garage floor cleaners, and engine degreasers - and in 90% of products that produce foam. Animals exposed to SLS and ALS experience eye damage, central nervous system depression, labored breathing, diarrhea, severe skin irritation, and even death. Young eyes may not develop properly if exposed to SLS and ALS because proteins are dissolved. SLS and ALS may also damage the skin's immune system by causing layers to separate and inflame. It is frequently disguised in semi-natural cosmetics with the explanation \"comes from coconut\". These and many more are the chemicals that are often used in commercial beauty products and personal care products. Before you purchase a cosmetic be sure to check the ingredients in the back for any of the following hazardous contaminants: - Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) - PEGs (polyethylene glycol) - Parabens - Sodium Laureth Sulfate and sodium lauryl sulfate - Siloxane (or any ingredient ending in siloxane) - Triclosan If you see any of the chemicals mentioned above in a product we recommend you do not purchase it and do not put it on your body. The skin is our largest organ and it is highly porous meaning it will absorb anything you put on it, so rather than giving it chemicals, nourish it with Holistic Healer's plant-based products.
