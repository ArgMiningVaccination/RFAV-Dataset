She is a friend and our family doctor, truly going through our family's healing process with us. With expertise in multiple medical specialities, our practitioners offer a unique combination of healing modalities from various disciplines to optimize your care. We view your body as an integrated system, the whole greater than the sum of its parts, and consider the physical, emotional, mental, environmental, and social influences contributing to your overall health and wellness. Making wise use of diagnostic and therapeutic techniques from the following specialties, we're better equipped to identify the underlying source of vulnerability, imbalance, and disorder in your body, mind, and spirit and restore your whole body to health and wellness. Biological Medicine seeks to to \"rebuild the body, cell by cell.\" When the body's internal biological processes are compromised by external factors like stress or a bad diet, the regulatory system can no longer maintain the optimum state of health nature intended, leading to chronic disease. In applying biological medicine, we use state-of-the-art testing and treatment technology as well as natural methods to pinpoint and treat the problem, detoxing the cells and strengthening the microbiome with nutrition and supplementation so the body can self-heal. Brain health is at the core of long-term quality of life. When brain cells are damaged, there may be a noticeable impact, impairing thinking, memory, language, and judgment. The ability to think clearly, remember accurately, and enjoy mental and emotional wellbeing is influenced by environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors that can be analyzed and altered to prevent cognitive decline and improve function. By eliminating the underlying causes of chronic disease and implementing personalized lifestyle and nutrition treatment protocols, you can enjoy a healthy brain at any age. Environmental medicine is a specialty that examines sensitivities or allergies to foods, chemicals, or the environment as the root cause of illness. When the hostility of the external environment overruns the body's ability to self-regulate, the inner environment reflects that hostility with the onset of disease. By identifying and avoiding the things that may cause you to develop unwanted symptoms \u2014 hives, irritability, or abdominal cramping to name a few \u2014 the cause is eliminated and the condition reversed. Mold or fungi, bacteria, volatile organic compounds, and other biological toxins might be to blame for your mysterious symptoms or undiagnosed chronic illness. Biological toxins can cause system-wide, chronic inflammation known as Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome or CIRS, especially in genetically-susceptible people whose bodies can't remove these toxins naturally. Functional medicine is a newer patient-centered specialty that incorporates much of naturopathic, integrative, environmental, and biological medicine. With a specific emphasis on the interplay of individual genetics with the environment, functional medicine looks at the whole person with a systems-based approach that aims to identify and treat the underlying cause of disease to restore optimal function to the body. Integrative medicine stresses the therapeutic importance of the patient-provider relationship. It considers the patient's total health and wellness profile and aims to treat the whole person, not the disease or it's accompanying symptoms. Integrative medicine relies on evidence to inform decision-making and uses a combination of conventional and alternative therapies to revitalize health for the best possible outcome. Mind-body medicine is a modern healthcare specialty with ancient roots, including Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine. Focusing on the interactions between the mind, body, brain, and behavior, it recognizes the impact thoughts, feelings, beliefs, values, and norms play on individual health and wellbeing. Mind-body medicine uses therapeutic interventions such as mindfulness meditation, hypnosis, biofeedback, group therapy, and spirituality to positively impact disease outcomes, increase immunity, reduce pain, and more. Naturopathic medicine is a healthcare specialty founded upon the healing power of nature. It prioritizes care of the whole person \u2014 body, mind, and spirit \u2014 with the least invasive, most natural, non-toxic therapies available to find and reverse the root cause of illness. With an emphasis on self-responsibility and the doctor as teacher, naturopathic medicine empowers the patient to prevent illness, activate the body's inherent self-healing process when imbalance does occur, and maintain life-long optimum wellness in cooperation with modern science and the body's inner wisdom. Restorative medicine addresses the holistic balance of the endocrine system, restoring balance to the system as a whole. By optimizing body chemistry naturally with the use of bioidentical hormones, herbs, and nutrition, the physiology of the body is returned to its proper state so the body can heal endocrine system disorders and chronic diseases on its own. Restorative medicine promotes energy, vitality, and longevity by regenerating health from the core, reducing the need for long-term medical treatment.
