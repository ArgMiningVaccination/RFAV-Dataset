Balance, Harmony & Healing Though it can't be denied that it is a challenge, the fact is, when we embrace a view of optimal wholeness it is possible to live in a Spirit of optimal health in spite of the fact that our bodies may be broken or in a state of dis-ease in some way. We can transcend the limitations of acute or chronic physical illness & live in balance & harmony of Mind, Body & Spirit if we chose to embrace God's view of whole health & live into that view. One of the most vivid & frequently used images from the perspective of faith for what happens when an individual is transformed by an encounter with God is that of when that individual passes from blindness or unawareness into sight. In Biblical & other faith accounts of blind people or persons with distorted views being transformed & healed, the emphasis is always upon the spiritual meaning of the restored vision. The signs always point to the realms of expanded awareness, made possible by the transforming power of God at work in human life. When their view is transformed from one of brokenness into one that embraces whole health, broken people, or dis-eased people are gradually transformed into the God given view of optimal healing, as their Mind, Body & Spirit are brought into balance & harmony. Optimal Healing When we open ourselves to the transforming power of God's Spirit at work in human life, our view shifts & we begin to see things differently. When we see things differently our Spirit grows & the Divine Spirit within us, brings our Mind & Body & Spirit in balance as God intended. It is an awesome Holy moment when we realize that God loves us enough to come into our lives & open the view out of our window of life for optimal healing to enter. God holds the window open for us to own the new view of the harmony & balance of our Mind, Body & Spirit in offering ultimate health. It is up to us whether we dare to look out & believe, receive & live into this new transformed vision of whole health that our Creator offers. Open my eyes that I may see Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me; Place in my hands the wonderful key That shall unclasp and set me free. Silently now I wait for Thee, Ready, my God, Thy will to see; Open my eyes, illumine me, Spirit Divine! Open my ears that I may hear Voices of truth Thou sendest clear; And while the wave notes fall on my ear, Everything false will disappear. Open my mouth and let me bear Tidings of mercy everywhere; Open my heart and let me prepare Love with Thy children thus to share. Open my mind that I may read More of Thy love in word and deed; What shall I fear while yet Thou dost lead? Only for light from Thee I plead. ~Posted by Rev Kathryn Bindig MDiv.
