Are you wanting to change your eating habits and lose weight? We can help! It's the perfect time to do something for your health. How It Works The SP Detox Balance program provides the body with additional nutritional support it may need to metabolize and expel toxins safely during each of the three phases of metabolic detoxification.* Phase I: Unlock The body transforms fat-soluble toxins to an \"unlocked\" state that is more water-soluble, and in many cases, more toxic than its original form. SP Detox Balance delivers key nutrients. Phase II: Neutralize The highly toxic substances produced in Phase I convert to non-toxic molecules and become even more water-soluble. SP Detox Balance delivers key nutrients. Phase III: Eliminate Water-soluble toxins leave cells, and the body eliminates them. SP Detox Balance delivers plant-based fiber to aid toxin elimination. Our Detoxification Program: The SP Detox Balance program includes a tasty, all-in-one shake, supported by sample meals. The SP Detox Balance powder is full of whole food-based nutritional ingredients, and is packed with 17 grams of protein. Toxins can contribute to: - Fatigue or difficulty sleeping - Indigestion and other temporary gastrointestinal upset - Food cravings and weight gain - Reduced mental clarity - Low libido - Skin issues - Joint discomfort We individualize the food recommendations for each of our patients, but in general you are encouraged to EAT (yeah!) vegetables, fruit, organic free-range chicken, and wild fish.
