The goals of traditional chiropractic care are to temporarily reduce pain, decrease muscle spasms, and increase your range of motion. These are excellent goals and there are many chiropractors in the area that do a great job providing these services. However, if you're experiencing a structural shift, it's time to take it a step further and see Dr. Matt at Synergy Chiropractic. Reveal the True Cause of Your Pain Our focus at Synergy Chiropractic is structural correction chiropractic. The majority of cases that make it to our office are often referrals from other chiropractors and medical doctors in the area and are a result of a significant structural shift. These structural shifts are the underlying cause of what your symptoms - or what structural doctors refer to as secondary conditions. Structural correction chiropractic focuses on correcting the underlying cause of your condition - the structural shifts.
