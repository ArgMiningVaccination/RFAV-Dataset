Through Inbodiment healing, Dr. Heidi assists you in clearing blocks in your physical, emotional, chemical, spiritual, mental, astral, and etheric body fields. Releasing the stuck energy contracted patterns brings into light the parts of your energy fields that have been holding onto unintegrated energy which has been creating and influencing dis-ease and distortion in your life and body. Releasing these blocked patterns through psychokinetic connection, Dr. Heidi assists you in moving your energy to create integration, while observing messages through the body fields to assist you in your transformation. Let's get together. Dr. Heidi offers consciously led classes to create a community that empowers people to connect within their physical and spiritual bodies. Each class is designed to educate and enhance your connection to your body in unique ways. Classes are held in a natural setting to activate a deeper connection. We build the class specifically to meet your needs and interests. We offer movement oriented & guided meditation classes, and additional co-lead group healing opportunities.
