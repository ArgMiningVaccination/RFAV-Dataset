Gut health is not only important for the immune system, it plays a vital role in brain health too. Learn about the gut-brain connection and why a healthy gut is essential for mood and wellbeing. How the gut and brain are connected The gut and the brain are connected via a nerve called the vagus nerve. This nerve acts like a big wire, linking the brain and gastrointestinal system together. At one end, the vagus nerve connects into a part of the brain called the amygdala which is responsible for processing and expressing fear and anxiety-related signals. The vagus nerve travels all the way down through the gastrointestinal system and plugs into the adrenal glands. The gut communicates with and sends signals and chemical messages to the brain and vice versa. What is interesting though is that the communication going downwards from the brain to the gut is around 10%, whereas signalling going upwards from the gut to the brain is 90%. This is why a healthy gut is essential for brain health and mood regulation. If your gut bacteria are out of balance, you're experiencing parasites or any kind of gastrointestinal issues such as IBS or constipation, your gut-brain connection will be negatively impacted. The importance of gut bacteria Your gut is home to trillions of microorganisms which comprise of different bacterial species and fungi such as yeasts; these microbes are also known as the gut microbiota or gut flora. Most of the bacteria in your gut are beneficial as they help support your immune system, protect the body against pathogens and assist with food digestion and vitamin production. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that stabilises mood and feelings of wellbeing. Even though serotonin is produced in the brain, 90% of the body's serotonin supply is found in the gut. When your gut is not working optimally, it can lead to a host of issues including low mood and anxiety. Symptoms of an unhealthy gut - Bloating - Flatulence - Constipation - Diarrhoea - Brain fog, poor concentration - Mood disorders, anxiety, depression - Sugar cravings - Fatigue, general sluggishness - Skin conditions including acne, eczema and rosacea How to improve gut health - Cut out foods that compromise gut function including sugar, refined carbohydrates(bread, cakes, pastries, pasta), junk food and trans fats (margarine, rapeseed/canola oil, fried foods). Sugar in particular feeds \"bad\" bacteria in the gut and can lead to uncomfortable symptoms such as bloating and wind. Instead, eat an organic, whole food diet that is rich in fibre (vegetables, fruit, pulses, beans) quality protein (quinoa, nuts, beans, lentils) and healthy fats (avocado, olive oil, seeds).
