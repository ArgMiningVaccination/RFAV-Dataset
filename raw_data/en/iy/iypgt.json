When hope was in shortsupply, a hope was created: that publicbroadcasting was a chance to enrich allour lives.

New programs News and Current Affairs is improving itsbusiness coverage across all media, includinga national business segment producedspecifically for the State-based 7.00pmdaily television news bulletin. Business Breakfast (6.30am to 7am - Monday to Friday) is an innovative blend of generalnews, business and economics. Produced inSydney, the program has a skilled team ofreporters and producers and is providing ahigh level of business analysis. Business Breakfast is partly funded (a little less than half) from the National Interest Initiative. Insiders , a political discussion program produced in Melbourne, which premiered inJuly 2001, has established a solid followingin its Sunday (9am) timeslot.

As a result of the increased production the Gore Hill centre in Sydney has been operating24 hours a day through most of the week,with enormous throughput in editing, studiosand control rooms allowing considerableefficiencies in production. National programs The anniversary of forty years of uninterruptedtransmission of Four Corners , still Australia's premier vehicle for investigative broadcastjournalism, took place in 2001. The eventwas marked by a special 90 minute programshowcasing prominent stories and trackingthe evolution in documentary style through thedecades. Gore Hill's Studio 21 was the venuefor celebrations which attracted hundreds ofthe editorial and technical staff who haveworked for Four Corners over the years, including the first presenter, Michael Charltonand first producer, Robert Raymond. In anadditional tribute the ABC broadcast a specialseries of Four Corners programs compiled from the archives. Australian Story was another television current affairs program which enjoyed considerableeditorial and ratings success. The non-narratorformat provided, among other stories,revealing profiles of Prime Minister JohnHoward and Opposition Leader Kim Beazleyduring the Federal election campaign. Lateline consistently provided breaking news, analysis and interviews on domestic issues,particularly during the election period andoutstanding international coverage. Thetransformation from a predominantlydiscussion program to a news andcurrent affairs hybrid was achieved.Landline , presented by Kirsten Aiken, had another successful year engaging urban aswell as rural and regional audiences on arange of issues - halting rural decline, landdegradation and salinity, cloning and geneticmanipulation of livestock and the outlook forworld commodity markets. Landline receives about 20% of all contacts to the News andCurrent Affairs division - most of them positiveand seeking further information. Landline has been prominent in promoting Year of TheOutback events. The election was comprehensively covered by all of the main daily News and Current Affairsprograms.

All election programs were, in part orwhole, re-broadcast by the pay televisionchannel, Sky News. Other significant domestic news coverage during the year included reporting on thecrisis surrounding the rescue at sea of asylumseekers, bound for Australia, by Norwegiancontainer ship the Tampa, and the subsequentactions by Government to prevent similargroups of people entering Australia; thedemise of Ansett, investigations and judicialinquiries into a number of corporate failures,the question of the full sale of Telstra, andmajor policy debates in the Governmentand Opposition parties. ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002PAGE 67 [NEWS AND CURRENT AFFAIRS ]Radio program AMhas retained its reputation for breaking stories with timely reports andanalysis of events throughout Australia andthe world, obtaining rare interviews with majorparticipants in national and internationalevents in the political, judicial and industrysectors. Regional coverage After a 10 year break a daily news bulletinreturned to serve the residents of the ACT andadjoining regions in NSW. A Canberra-basedStateline program was also introduced intime to provide detailed coverage of the ACTAssembly elections. Both programs have beenwell received, with the news bulletin achievinga household share exceeding 27%. International coverage The September 11 terrorist attack in theUnited States was the most significant andintense news story broadcast by the ABCduring the year. On television News andCurrent Affairs provided two and a half days ofuninterrupted coverage of events in the UnitedStates in the aftermath of the attacks byterrorist controlled planes on the World TradeCentre in New York resulting in the collapse ofthe two buildings, the attack on The Pentagonand the crash of a fourth plane.On radio, news and current affairs staff combined with Local Radio producers toprovide constant updates through the firsthorrific night and thereafter a series of specialprograms. News Online, based in Brisbane,increased its output of pages dramatically andprovided a 24-hour-a-day service through theweek following September 11. A distinguishing feature of the ABC's coverage was the contribution of politicalcorrespondents, who were with the PrimeMinister in Washington at the time of theattack on The Pentagon. They, along withABC resident correspondents in Washingtonand New York provided continuous reportsand analysis of events as they unfolded. Thevalue of having experienced reporters, cameraoperators and editors based internationallywas never better demonstrated. When the international focus swung to Afghanistan and the insurgency against theTaliban regime, the ABC was the onlyAustralian broadcaster to provide frontlinereporting of the advance by the NorthernAlliance across the country and the liberationof the capital, Kabul. Later when internationaltroops, including Australian SAS, weredeployed in the country in the hunt forOsama Bin Laden and leaders of the Al Qaedaterrorist group, the ABC provided reportagethrough many months. ABC News andreporter Geoff Thompson were awarded LogieAwards for coverage of the Afghanistan War. Internationally, attention has also been focused on the worsening crisis between the Israeligovernment and the Palestinian Authority.The ABC's Jerusalem bureau, supplementedby ABC correspondents from Brussels andMoscow, has provided detailed accounts ofthe conflict including, where possible, thehistoric and political context, to help Australian ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002PAGE 68 [NEWS AND CURRENT AFFAIRS ] Cameraman Louie Eroglu at Maslach Refuge Camp in Afghanistan.audiences develop a broader understanding of this intractable dispute. The dangers faced byABC staff were so significant that an armouredvehicle was purchased to help protect themon journeys through the Occupied Territories. Foreign Correspondent celebrated 10 years of international reporting, during which ithas produced in excess of 1 000 stories. Theformer President of Indonesia, AbdurrahmanWahid, who still leads one of the world'slargest Islamic organisations, was a guest ofhonour at a ceremony in Sydney, marking theanniversary. Mr Wahid praised the ABC for itsinternational reporting and attributed hisfluency in English to having listened, as achild, to broadcasts by Radio Australia.Foreign Correspondent's reporters have won Walkley awards and five New York FilmFestival awards for their outstanding stories.The program achieves the highest internationalprogram sales and video tape sales in theNews and Current Affairs Division. Resources and efficiency International reporters have been at theforefront of using new technology to delivertheir stories. 'Store and Forward' devices,which allow the transmission of video, down enhanced telephone lines, were installed inmost of the ABC's overseas offices. Their usecut the cost of international satellites. The ABC was the first Australian organisation to use a videophone, in conjunction with aportable satellite phone, to deliver reportagefrom Afghanistan and subsequently from thePalestinian territories during Israeli militaryincursions. All correspondents are beingtrained in the use of lightweight cameras andthe one-person production model has beensuccessful in some circumstances. Cooperating with other broadcasters News and Current Affairs is planning to build on its excellent relations with otherinternational broadcasters, in particular theBBC, CBC and Television New Zealand.Television New Zealand (TVNZ) journalists arebeing accommodated in the ABC's Londonand Sydney News bureaus and the ABC'sNew Zealand correspondent is based atTVNZ in Auckland.

In addition to broadcast use, these programs provided opportunities for internationalprogram sales and additional productsand services for ABC Enterprises. Television production within the ABC operated during the year on a user-pays basis.The Production Resources Division met theproduction requirements of the TelevisionDivision and the News and Current AffairsDivision by providing workforce resourcescharged at hourly rates. In some cases production requirements exceeded the basecapacity of the production centres, requiringadditions to the workforce or facilities. Wherethis occurred the Division either engagedadditional employees or hired facilities fromthe external television production industry. Genre Diversity and Australian Content In total the Production Resources Division workforce provided over 1.6 million productionworkforce hours to the production orco-production of television content, therebysupporting Australian content levels. About 60per cent of those hours were used in theproduction of programs in four genres -News, Drama, Current Affairs and FactualProgramming. Transmission The Division operates television presentationfacilities for the transmission of ABCTelevision's national network, localprogramming for individual states andterritories and the ABC multichannelsABC Kids and Fly. The presentation-operating environment has become more complex overthe last year with digital and analog simulcastof the ABC's primary channel as well as themultichannels. ABC Production Production Resources hires television facilitiesto external clients through ABC Productionsin a very competitive commercial environment.ABC Productions complies with therequirements of the Governments' competitiveneutrality policy, which aims to promoteefficient competition between public andprivate businesses and seeks to ensurethat government businesses do not enjoycompetitive advantages by virtue of theirpublic ownership.Production Resources ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002PAGE 72 [PRODUCTION RESOURCES ] Sale of old props at ABC Gore Hill.ABC Television, along with ABC News and Current Affairs, utilise about 95 per cent of thecosted workforce resources each year -while ABC Productions use surplus marginalcapacity of about 4% to generate externalrevenue.

Nielsen MediaResearch provided data from their peoplemeter panels in the aggregated regionaltelevision markets covering most of theregional coastal areas of Queensland,Northern and Southern New South Wales,regional Victoria and Tasmania. Generally this information was reported as the share of viewing achieved and the percentageof the population reached. In areas of Australia where people meter panels are not established, televisionaudiences are measured by the completion ofviewing diaries. Using weekly diaries membersof households record their daily televisionviewing, captured on a quarter-hour basis inthe diary. Diary surveys of television are usuallyconducted over a four-week period. This yearthe ABC participated in diary surveys inDarwin and regional Western Australia(March/April 2002). RadioNielsen Media Research carries out radio research for the major metropolitan marketseight times per calendar year, with listeningcaptured on a quarter-hour basis for eightfour-week tranches across the year. Lessfrequent data is collected for other majortowns and regional surveys are carriedout on an ad-hoc basis.In 2001-02, the ABC participated in a number of ad hoc surveys, including regional radiosurveys at Wangaratta (September 2001),Darwin and Rockhampton/Gladstone (October2001) and Wollongong (March 2002). As with Television, the ABC commissions qualitative studies to aid programdevelopment for Radio. During 2001-02the ABC undertook extensive focus groupresearch on Local Radio in all capitalcities as well as 11 regional centres - Cairns,Mackay, Mt Isa, Lismore, Tamworth, Bendigo,Wodonga, Renmark, Alice Springs, Geraldtonand Research was alsocommissioned for other radio networks ina number of regional and metropolitancentres. This included qualitative researchcommissioned for Triple J, with researchconducted in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne,Perth and Albury-Wodonga.

During the year six new Indigenous trainees were appointed to the ABC in Darwin andSydney. Performance Management The first full 12 months operation of the ABC'sperformance management system for staffhas concluded. For a number of reasons,including the size and complexity of the task,implementation has not been as smooth ortimely as anticipated. When fully effective, performance management will assist the ABC to developa more multi-skilled 'best fit' workforce bybetter articulating job roles and responsibilities,providing feedback about performance, andidentifying skill gaps and training needs. Guidelines, support materials and a website have been developed and introduced, andcontinually updated and improved. A national review of the performance management scheme is underway and resultswill be factored into development of the newenterprise agreement where appropriate. Enterprise Bargaining The ABC Employment Agreement 2000-2002 ushered in wide-ranging changes to structuresand conditions for the majority of the ABC's4 000 program-making, technical andadministrative staff. This agreement with theCPSU and MEAA expires on 6 October 2002. Ongoing implementation and support for the current agreement has continued and theHR Division has developed an agenda inconsultation with line management for thenext bargaining round to start in August 2002.Consolidation of proposals and strategies aligned to the Corporation's goals is beingcoordinated through wider consultation. The HR Division has also been involved in developing, negotiating and communicatingproposals for a new Senior EmploymentAgreement (expired 31 December 2001)and a new ABC Retail Agreement(expires 31 July 2002). Workplace Reform New broad banded classifications andflexible hours provisions in the currentABC Employment Agreement have enabledintroduction of improved practices andtechnologies in a number of areas. Thesepractices include new multi-skilled roles inTelevision and new cross media productiontogether with more efficient rostering invarious output divisions. An example of a major work practice change has been the introduction of single personcrewing (SPC) in News that has beensuccessfully implemented in all States. These and other reforms have enabled the ABC to streamline production processes andachieve efficiencies and savings in theworkplace. They have been undertaken by theHR Division in partnership with other divisionsand in consultation with staff and the unions.ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002PAGE 89 [HUMAN RESOURCES ]HR Operations Implementation of the SAP HR/Payroll system has now been completed. The systemprovides a greater degree of automation andreduces much of the manual processing of theABC's previous rostering and payroll systems.Under the new arrangement, the ABC haspartly outsourced its payroll functions to SAPAustralia and Allegiance Systems (anapplication service provider). As a result of the complexity of the various rostering, award and salary packagingarrangements, implementation of this systemhas been time consuming and difficult. TheHR Division introduced extensive trainingprograms covering system functionality forall users. Senior representatives from HRcontinue to liaise with SAP Australia to rectifysystem faults that hinder the full operation ofthe new system. Unfortunately rectification ofthese faults by the application service providerhas taken longer than expected, althoughsome improvement has occurred.Recruitment A substantial improvement in the ABC'srecruitment processes was introduced withthe move to a more centralised, nationalmodel. The result has been an increase inefficiency through economies of scale,consistency in standards of advertising,access to specialist recruitment advice, andthe centralised collection and reporting ofrecruitment statistics. Recruitment activity inthe ABC remains high with the HR Divisionrecruiting to over 700 vacancies for the12 months ending 30 June 2002.

During 2001-02 the ABC continued to install digital production and transmission equipmentand infrastructure to further support digitalbroadcasting. The first digital television outside broadcast van was delivered in May 2002 ready foracceptance testing by ABC staff. The vanis fully equipped for digital televisionbroadcasting and is the first of eight vansbeing built for the ABC to replace the existingfleet which was acquired with the introductionof colour broadcasting during 1974-75.It was first used, during the testing period,on 1 June 2002 to provide local ABC TV andinternational coverage of the internationalrugby match between Australia 'A' andCanada. Extensive planning and technical work by Systems Engineering and Technical Servicesprepared new production and broadcastfacilities for the relocation of televisionnews to Southbank in Melbourne and thereintroduction of week night local televisionnews bulletins in Canberra. Production andtransmission facilities were also provided tosupport the commencement of digitaltelevision channels, ABC Kids and Fly TV . Installation of Netia digital audio workstations continued at seven regional stations and onecapital city to replace tape recorders andendless loop cartridge machines withcomputer based workstations. A range ofadditional technical equipment includingworkstations, digital video cameras andmultimedia computers, minidisk and audiofield recorders was provided to 33 regionalradio stations as part of the regional radioexpansion.A digital production-mixing console was commissioned in March 2002 in theFederation Concert Hall in Hobart for useparticularly in fine music recording. Greaterflexibility in the location of radio outsidebroadcasts, particularly outside capital cities,has been facilitated with the delivery of fourPlain Old Telephone Service (POTS) Codecsfor use across New South Wales, Victoria,South Australia and the Northern Territory.These units allow broadcast quality audio tobe sent back to ABC studios from ordinarytelephone connections without the need forISDN facilities. Radio production facilities were also completed for the opening of radio studios inKatherine in the Northern Territory. The ABC's Broadcast and New Media Research and Development group hasprovided specialist graphical and statistical ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002PAGE 95 [TECHNOLOGY AND DISTRIBUTION ]Technology and Distribution Gold Coast Mayor Alan Rickard at launch of ABC News Radio service on Gold Coast (AC Photography).systems to support television coverage of Parliamentary elections and sports eventsfor many years. More recently, this supporthas been extended to ABC Online coverageof these events. Significant softwareenhancements and hardware upgradeswere completed in order to support coverageof the Federal, Northern Territory and ACTgeneral Parliamentary elections held in thesecond half of 2001. The election computersystem also provided a data feed forABC Online and the ABC's Intranet for useby ABC Radio producers in their coverage.For the first time post-election updates weremade on ABC Online. Coverage by ABC TV and ABC Online of the 2002 Hopman Cup featured use of the ABCenhanced Live Web Publishing computerapplication which published live scores andstatistics. The associated web pagesdisplayed game statistics alongside anembedded video player displaying a videostream of the television coverage. During 2001-02, the ABC also installed a number of technology systems that ensuredmaximum benefits were gained from newequipment. A video syndication system wasdeveloped and introduced which provides anautomated process for sending video to ABCtelevision production centres located in eachcapital city, replacing a manual process.Video store and forward technology has beeninstalled at the Corporation's overseas newsbureaus. This technology allows video materialto be transferred to Sydney using ISDN lines,rather than the more expensive broadbandsatellite technology. The Profile Play-listsystem, also developed by the ABC, is aneasy to use touch-screen application used togenerate, modify, and execute play-lists ofvideo items in multiple production areas. Thissystem was integrated with the new digitalvideo servers purchased by the Corporation.Technical Training Ninety-three technical training courses weredelivered to ABC staff during the year. Thesecourses were conducted to introduce andfamiliarise ABC staff in the use of a wide rangeof digital television and radio production andtransmission equipment. Anticipating thenew television outside broadcast vans,manufacturer training was delivered for bothtechnical and operational staff. Nationaltechnical and operational training for theNetia digital audio workstations usedthroughout radio continued. Re-certificationprograms were also implemented for staffmaintaining the AVID digital video editingequipment, along with cabling and towerrescue training across all ABC sites. Information Technology Over the last three years, over 60 projectsplanned as part of the 1999-2002 InformationTechnology Strategy have been completed.The strategy is currently being updated. The Avstar computer system implementation was completed with its introduction in Sydney,Melbourne and the London ABC bureau. ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002PAGE 96 [TECHNOLOGY AND DISTRIBUTION ] Digital Presentation Centre Ultimo 2001.ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002PAGE 97 [TECHNOLOGY AND DISTRIBUTION ]Avstar (Avid iNEWS) is a newsroom computer system that manages the production oftelevision, radio and online newscasts for theABC replacing an older system, which hadreached end of life. It allows ABC staff to writeand manage their news stories throughout theprogram production process. The year also saw significant enhancements to the ABC's web services. Installation of apowerful search engine product improvedindexing of the 400 000 pages of contenton ABC Online and provided a unifiedpresentation to audiences. Additionalfunctionality has been added to theforums function. The ABC Online Shopwas in-sourced and integrated with a newEnterprises Mail Order Centre applicationto manage both online and mail orders. A new booking system was introduced initially for television resources and then extended toradio. This system enables more effectiveusage of a range of resources employedduring the production process. A range of enhancements to existing television production and scheduling systems werenecessary to aid the introduction of the ABC'snew digital television channels. In line withmost organisations, the ABC kept a closeeye on security around its Corporate-widecomputer network and in particular protectionfrom debilitating computer viruses. There wassignificant effort in upgrading virus protectionon every desktop computer as well as anupgrade to the 'firewall' that protects theABC from the Internet. As a result, the ABCremained relatively clean during a number ofinternational virus scares. Industry issues The ABC's technical interests are representedat national bodies such as the InternationalRadio Advisory Committee (IRAC) andtechnology experts are actively involved inthe formulation of decisions by international bodies such as the Asia-Pacific BroadcastingUnion (ABU) and the InternationalTelecommunications Union (ITU). During the past 12 months, the ABC has been actively involved in industry consultations withFACTS (Federation of Australia CommercialTelevision Stations), ACA (AustralianCommunications Authority), ACIF (AustralianCommunications Industry Forum), and WTF(Wireless Technology Forum). The ABC wasrepresented at a number of domestic andinternational industry conferences with T&Dstaff presenting papers dealing with technicaland regulatory issues. The ABC has workedwith other broadcasters on a range ofcommon technical issues, including thepossible migration of Electronic NewsGathering (ENG) services, of particularimportance for local and regional televisionnews, to digital within industry-wide budgetconstraints. Industry Recognition of ABC technology staff During the last year, two senior ABC technology staff have been recognised fortheir contributions to national and internationalbroadcasting forums. Spencer which is responsible for productionand post-production broadcasting standards.Spencer is the first Australian chairman of thegroup in its 75 years of existence. This peerappointment to such a prestigious postreflects the high regard of the internationaltechnology community. Dilip Jadeja is currentlychairing the Australian Broadcasting IndustryTechnical Advisory Group (BITAG) and is oneof the two industry nominees to work onStatutory Advisory Committees underSection 51 of the Radiocommunications Act.ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002PAGE 98 [OUTCOME 2 ]Maintain the scale and quality of analog terrestrial transmission of national andregional networks, and Radio Australiaprogramming which existed immediatelyprior to the privatisation of the NationalTransmission Network (NTN). The ABC plans the rollout of television and radio transmission services and managestransmission service contracts in excess of$85 million per annum with transmissionservice providers Broadcast Australia PtyLimited, recent purchaser of the nationaltransmission network from NTL. The recentownership change has no impact on currentcontracts the ABC has in place. Transmission Fault Restoration For the period July 2001 - June 2002 theaverage time of restoration for a transmissionfault was: A Class transmitter (state capital works) 14.04 minutes (16 minutes 2000-01) B Class transmitter (major regional centres) 43.95 minutes (19 minutes 2000-01) The Reception Advice Line The ABC works with the audience to ensuretransmission defects are identified andrepaired as soon as possible. The ReceptionAdvice Line (RAL) responds to telephone calls,emails and letters from the audience about thereception of all ABC TV (digital and analog)and Radio services. The advice line has playeda vital part in responding to audience enquiriesrelated to the rollout of the ABC's digitaltelevision services. The total number oftelephone enquiries received has increasedover the past 12 months, possibly due to thegrowing interest in digital television andawareness of the Reception Advice Lineservice.This year, the unit handled television and radio services enquiries as follows: Total number of emails and letters received 1 213 Total number of telephone enquiries received 17 246 Total enquiries resolved 18 459Total number of hits to the Reception Advice Line website: 354 994 Less than half of the enquiries received to the Reception Advice Line were due totransmission faults. About 60 per cent ofreception problems are caused by electricalinterference or a deficiency in receivingequipment. The unit works closely withBroadcast Australia to ensure that localtechnical transmission or equipment issuesare repaired as soon as possible. TheReception Advice Line can expect to receivemore enquiries throughout 2002-03 as therollout, awareness and interest in digitaltelevision becomes more widespread. The advice line can be contacted on 1300 13 9994 (at local call cost),by email: reception.advice@abc.net.au or theself-help website http://abc.net.au/reception/. Extensions and enhancements The final analog television service plannedbefore the sale of the national transmissionnetwork in 1999 commenced broadcastingin Lilyfield, Tasmania in August 2001. The ABC's minor extensions and enhancement program has established sevennew services: Radio National at Cobar (NSW);Classic FM and Roma(Queensland); Triple Bathurst (NSW),NewsRadio at Gold Coast (Queensland) andGosford (NSW); and analog at PortSorell (Tasmania). 2 ]Under the self-help subsidy scheme for communities located in cyclone incidentareas in northern Australia, new self-help ABCLocal Radio services commenced in Carmila,Clairview, and Saint Lawrence (Queensland)and Channel Point (Northern Territory).Funding has also been awarded to Milikapitiand Ramingining (Northern Territory) andBloomfield/Ayton (Queensland), with theseservices expected to commence shortly. In order to deliver services to under-served remote and regional communities, the ABCcommenced a new Local Radio satelliteservice for Regional Victoria in December2001, with programming derived fromMelbourne and several regional studios.This benefits ABC listeners in remoteVictorian areas where no terrestrial servicewas previously received. International Broadcasting Technical and commercial arrangementswere completed by Distribution andCommunications to establish the ABCAsia Pacific television service by the on-airdate of 31 December 2001. New SkiesNetworks and PamAmSat are providingpresentation and distribution services. On 31 December 2001, ABC Asia Pacificcommenced broadcasting the followingservices: ABC Asia Pacific digital television Asia Pacific television Channel 2 (same content as the first channel buttime-shifted two hours later to allow fortime differences across the region) Radio Australia English Language Program Service (ELP) Radio Australia Foreign Language Service (FLP)During the year, Radio Australia's radio coverage was extended to a wider Asia-Pacific audience, by the addition of the PalapaPanAmSat PAS 8 to its satellite deliveryplatform. This change saw an increase inthe area in which signals could be received.As a result, Radio Australia is available tohigh power, high frequency relay stationsthroughout Asia and the South Pacific. Transmission Re-mapping Over the past 12 months the ABC has beenworking on a project to re-map the coverageof all radio and television transmissionservices. This project was initiated due to thepaucity of accurate information for networkoperations and management. The maps havebeen produced using the coverage contoursgenerated direct from the planning tools ofthe ABC's transmission services supplierBroadcast Australia. Consequently theyrepresent the best available informationregarding the network coverage. The mapswill be delivered to each network electronicallyover the coming months and will also bemade available on the ABC Intranet, as partof the redevelopment of the transmitterdatabase. The ABC is one of the firstorganisations to have comprehensivelymapped its services in this manner.The project will be completed duringthe latter part of 2002.ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002PAGE 100 [OUTCOME 2 ]ABC Distribution and Transmission Network Aggregated 2001-02 Performance as Reported by Broadcast Australia ABC Service No. of ABC Broadcast Transmitters Distribution Australia Network Transmission (See Note 1) Network (See Note 2) Target Actual Previous Target Actual Previous % % Year % % % Year % Classic FM 65 99.83 99.97 99.92 Distribution Network (included contracted service providers): The ABC distribution network ensures that programs are delivered from the studio to local transmitters throughout Australia. The network includes outsourcedsatellite and terrestrial broadcast distribution services from telecommunications carriers such as Optus and Telstra.The target is an aggregate estimate, sourced from more than 60 agreements the ABC has in place with serviceproviders to distribute programs. Note: Local Radio, serving remote and regional Australia, is reliant on non-redundant Telstra broadcast lines. These performed well above expectation in the financial year 2001/2002. 2.Broadcast Australia Transmission Network (ABC Transmission Contractor): The reported transmission network performance, provided by Broadcast Australia, was above expectations, given the continuing establishment periodallowed within the Transmission Services Agreement. New digital services continued to be introduced throughout theyear. However, these works compared to the previous year have not impacted adversely on the audience. The moderateweather conditions have contributed significantly to this improved performance.ABC Service Total Total Network 'On-Air' Availability Availability (See Note 3) (See Note 4) Target Actual Previous Target Actual Previous % % Year % % % Year % Classic FM 99.48 Availability: The total network availability, shows the direct impact of all outages experienced by the audience, ie this measure reflects the delivered service availability to the audience, regardless of the source of fault orinterruption. During the majority of reported outages, a reduced level of service continued to be provided throughout theincident period. This accounts for the difference between the contracted and overall network performance. The ABC andtheir service providers have initiated service reviews that examine improvements to the monitoring and reporting of thenetwork's performance. Broadcast Australia, with the ABC's permission, operated a number of services below minimum performance levels (with moderate quality) for sustained periods throughout the year. This is reflected in the total actual availability for Local Radioand Radio National services, particularly in Queensland where performance overall was below target. Similarly, BroadcastAustralia operated a range of Classic FM, Triple J and analog television services below the minimum performance level,but maintained a reasonable level of service to the audience to enable Broadcast Australia to undertake additionalconstruction and maintenance activities outside the targeted performance. Note: Overall there has been a modest improvement over the previous year's operating performance. 4.Total 'On-Air' Availability: The total 'On-Air' availability, shows the direct impact of all outages experienced by the audience, where some level of service continued to be provided throughout faults and maintenance. That is, where therewas no total loss or denial of service to the majority of the audience. This measure shows that Broadcast Australia havedelivered consistent overall service and they have marginally improved on the total period in which services were 'off',in comparison to the previous year. ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002PAGE 101 [OUTCOME 2 ]ABC Distribution and Transmission Network Aggregated 2001-02 Performance as Reported by Broadcast AustraliaThe Australian community has access to ABC digital television services inaccordance with agreed timetablesand funding.

The ABC commenced distribution of digital television signals on satellite from 1 July 2001.The satellite signals provide digital televisionto Queensland and NSW regional centres.The ABC in association with service providerOptus Communications has implemented aworld first system that carries the full ABCdigital television signal including combinationsof Standard Definition and High DefinitionProgram material. On 1 August 2001, the ABC launched Australia's first two digital television channelsABC Kids and Fly TV . The ABC digital television service was reconfigured toaccommodate the introduction of theseadditional channels and deliver them nationallyto all operating digital transmitters. Technicalarrangements were also made for theretransmission of both services by certainsubscription television carriers.The ABC implemented the first Single Frequency Network (SFN) in Australia, withdigital television services at the SunshineCoast, Gympie, Gympie Town, and Nambourall transmitting on UHF Channel 62. Staffworked closely with and provided guidanceto service contractors, Tandberg, Optus andBroadcast Australia, to ensure the systemoperated correctly. More SFN's are plannedthroughout late 2002 as additional transmittersfor Illawarra, Melbourne, Newcastle andSydney are constructed. The ABC's Broadcast and New Media Research and Development Department isinvestigating interactive digital televisionapplications using the Multimedia HomePlatform (MHP), which is the proposedstandard platform to be used for interactiveservices by Australia's terrestrial free-to-airand public television broadcasters.

Statement of Significant Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies adopted in preparing the financial statements of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (the 'Corporation' or 'ABC') and the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation, itscontrolled entities and the entities it controlled from time to time during the period, are stated to assist in ageneral understanding of these financial statements. These policies have been applied consistently by allentities in the economic entity. 1.1 Basis of Accounting The financial statements are required by clause 1 (b) of Schedule 1 to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 and are a general purpose financial report. The statements have been prepared in accordance with: Schedule 1 of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies (Financial Statements 2001-2002) Orders made by the Finance Minister for the preparation of Financial Statements in relation to financial years endingon or after 30 June 2002; Australian Accounting Standards and Accounting Interpretations issued by Australian Accounting Standards Board; other authoritative pronouncements of the Board; and Consensus Views of the Urgent Issues Group. The statements have been prepared having regard to: Statements of Accounting Concepts; and the Explanatory Notes to Schedule 1 of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies (Financial Statements 2001-2002) Orders issued by the Department of Finance and Administration; and Finance Briefs issued by that Department. The Corporation and Consolidated Statements of Financial Performance and Financial Position have been prepared on an accrual basis and are in accordance with historical cost convention, except for certain assetswhich, as noted, are at valuation. Except where stated, no allowance is made for the effect of changing priceson the results or on the financial position. Assets and liabilities are recognized in the Corporation and Consolidated Statements of Financial Position when and only when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow and the amounts of the assets or liabilitiescan be reliably measured. Assets and liabilities arising under agreements equally proportionately unperformedare however not recognized unless required by an Accounting Standard. Liabilities and assets which areunrecognized are reported in the Schedule of Commitments and the Schedule of Contingencies. Revenues and expenses are recognized in the Corporation and Consolidated Statements of Financial Performance when and only when the flow or consumption or loss of economic benefits has occurred and canbe reliably measured. 1.2 Rounding Amounts are rounded to the nearest $1 000 except in relation to : remuneration of directors remuneration of officers (other than directors) remuneration of auditors trust fundsNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2002 ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002PAGE 114 [FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ]1. Statement of Significant Accounting Policies (cont.) 1.3 Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements are those of the economic entity, comprising the financial statements of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, its controlled entities from the date control commences until the datecontrol ceases. Investment in controlled entities are carried in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's financial statements at the lower of cost or recoverable amount. Controlled entities have annual reporting periods ending 31 December. Accounts of the controlled entities are prepared for the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 for consolidation using accounting policies which areconsistent with those of the Corporation. Control exists where the Australian Broadcasting Corporation has the capacity to dominate the decision making in relation to the financial and operating policies of another entity so the controlled entity operates to achievethe objectives of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The controlled entities of the Corporation include seven independent orchestral companies as detailed in note 22. The companies have been incorporated under the Corporation Act 2001 and are each governedby an independent Board of Directors. Each company is audited annually by the Auditor General. The effects of all transactions and balances between the entities are eliminated in full. Details of controlled entities are contained in note 22. Financial statements of subsidiaries not considered to be a going concern have been prepared on a liquidation basis. No adjustments were necessary in relation to the recoverability and classification of the recorded assetsof those subsidiaries. 1.4 Taxation The Australian Broadcasting Corporation and its primary controlled entities are not subject to income taxpursuant to Section 71 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983. Music Choice Australia Pty Ltd and The News Channel Pty Limited, whilst subject to income tax, have been inactive for the year ended 30 June 2000, 30 June 2001 and 30 June 2002. The Corporation and controlled entities are subject to fringe benefits tax, payroll tax and goods and services tax. Goods and Services Tax Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST) exceptwhere the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the taxation authority. In these circumstances, theGST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense. Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included.The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), is included as a current asset in the Statement of Financial Position. Cashflows are included in the Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis. The GST components arising from investing and financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the ATO are classified as operatingcashflows.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2002 (cont.) ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002PAGE 115 [FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ]1. Statement of Significant Accounting Policies (cont.) 1.5 Foreign Currency Transactions Revenues and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies are converted to Australian currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction, or at the hedged rate. Exchange gains and losses and hedging costs arising on contracts entered into as hedges of specific revenue or expense transactions are deferred until the date of such transactions at which time they are included in thedetermination of such revenues or expenses. Open hedge contracts relating to all other revenue and expenditure transactions are converted at the applicable exchange rate at balance date with exchange gains or losses being included in the Statement of FinancialPerformance. All foreign currency balances are converted to Australian currency at the exchange rate prevailing at balance date, except for liabilities brought to account at contract rates, which are subject to currency swap contractsfor which an Australian dollar currency repayment schedule has been adopted. Monetary assets and liabilities ofoverseas branches and amounts payable to or by the Corporation in foreign currencies are translated intoAustralian currency at the applicable exchange rate at balance date. Non-monetary items of overseas branchesare translated at exchange rates current at the transaction date. 1.6 Derivatives Derivative financial instruments are used by the Corporation to manage financial risks and are not entered intofor trading purposes. The classes of derivative financial contracts used are interest rate swaps, forward foreignexchange contracts and foreign exchange. Derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are accounted for on the same basis as the underlying exposure. A. Interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements Interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements are entered into for the purpose of managing theCorporation's interest rate position. Gains or losses on interest rate swaps are included in the measurement ofinterest payments on the transactions to which they relate. Premiums or discounts are amortised through theStatement of Financial Performance each year over the life of the swap. B. Forward exchange contracts Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge specific and regular occurring foreign exchange payments.Contracts are revalued at year end and the gain or loss is included in the Statement of Financial Performance. C. Foreign exchange options Foreign exchange options are used to hedge specific foreign currency payments. Premiums paid on foreignexchange options are amortised to the Statement of Financial Performance over the life of the contract. 1.7 Borrowings Borrowings are recorded at the amount of the net proceeds received and carried at amortised cost until theliabilities are fully settled. Interest on the instruments is recognised as an expense on an effective yield basis.Borrowings are Commonwealth Government guaranteed. All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred except to the extent that they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised. The amount capitalised in a reporting period does not exceed thecosts incurred in that period.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2002 (cont.) ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002PAGE 116 [FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ]1. Statement of Significant Accounting Policies (cont.) 1.8 Cash Cash includes notes and coins held, and any deposits held at call with a bank or financial institution. 1.9 Receivables Receivables are carried at nominal amounts due less provision for doubtful debts. Trade debtors are normally settled within 30 days unless otherwise agreed and are carried at amounts due.The Corporation makes a specific provision for doubtful debts by conducting a detailed review of material debtors, making an assessment of the probability of recovery of those debts and taking into account past baddebts experience. 1.10 Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes Premiums or discounts are amortised through the Statement of Financial Performance each year from the dateof purchase so that investments attain their redemption value by maturity date and income is recognised on aneffective yield basis. Any profits or losses arising from the disposal prior to maturity are taken to the Statement of Financial Performance in the period in which they are realised. These assets are intended to be held to maturity and arecarried at cost or cost adjusted for discounts and premiums. 1.11 Trade Creditors Creditors are recognised at their nominal amounts, being the amounts at which the liabilities will be settled.Liabilities are recognised to the extent that the goods and services have been received (and irrespective ofhaving been invoiced). Settlement is on normal commercial terms. 1.12 Reporting by Outcomes and Segments A comparison of Budget and Actual figures by outcomes specified in the Appropriation Acts relevant to the Corporation is presented in note 23. Any intra-government costs included in the figure 'net cost to Budgetoutcomes' are eliminated in calculating the actual budget outcome for the Government overall. The Corporation principally provides a national television and radio service within the broadcasting industry. It is therefore considered for segmental reporting to operate predominantly in one industry and in one geographicalarea, Australia. 1.13 Revenue Recognition The revenues described in this note are revenues relating to the core operating activities of the Corporation. Revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of the amount of the goods and services tax upon the delivery of goods and services to customers. Interest revenue is recognised on a proportional basis taking into account the interest rates applicable to the financial assets. Credit sales are on normal commercial terms.Revenue from disposal of non-current assets is recognised when control of the asset has passed to the buyer.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2002 (cont.) ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002PAGE 117 [FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ]1. Statement of Significant Accounting Policies (cont.) 1.13 Revenue Recognition (cont.) External contributions earned in respect of the production of television programs are reflected in the Statement of Financial Performance once the program has been broadcast (refer note 1.19). Subsidies, grants, sponsorships and donations are recognised on receipt unless paid to the Corporation for specific purpose where recognition of revenue will be recognised in accordance with the agreement. Recognition of appropriations from the Government is discussed in note 1.22. Core Operations All material revenue described in this note are revenues relating to the core operating activities of theCorporation and controlled entities. Details of revenue amounts are given in notes 4 and 5. 1.14 Employee Entitlements LeaveThe liability for employee entitlements includes provision for annual leave and long service leave. No provisionhas been made for sick leave as all sick leave is non-vesting and the average sick leave taken in future yearsby employees of the Corporation and the economic entity is estimated to be less than the annual entitlementfor sick leave. The liability for annual leave reflects the value of total annual leave entitlements of all employees at 30 June 2002 and is recognised at its nominal amount. The non-current portion of the liability for long service leave is recognised and measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be made in respect of all employees at 30 June 2002. In determining thepresent value of the liability, attrition rates and pay increases through promotion and inflation have been takeninto account. On-costs relating to annual and long service leave have been included in the provision. Separation and Redundancies Provision is made for separation and redundancy payments in cases where positions have been formallyidentified as excess to requirements, the existence of an excess has been publicly communicated, and areliable estimate of the amount payable can be determined. Superannuation Employees contribute to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector SuperannuationScheme. Employer contributions amounting to $15 902 071 (2000/2001: $28 080 557) for $18 420 445 (2000/2001: $31 595 741) for the economic entity in relation to these schemes have been expensed in these financial statements. No liability is shown for superannuation in the Statement of Financial Position as the employer contributions fully extinguish the accruing liability which is assumed by the Commonwealth. Employer Superannuation Productivity Benefit contributions totalled $7 954 690 (2000/2001: $7 381 108) for the Corporation and $8 858 496 (2000/2001: $8 383 419) for the economic entity. 1.15 Repairs and Maintenance Maintenance, repair expenses and minor renewals which do not constitute an upgrading or enhancement of equipment are expensed as incurred.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2002 (cont.) ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002PAGE 118 [FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ]1. Statement of Significant Accounting Policies (cont.) 1.16 Acquisition of Assets Assets are recorded at cost on acquisition except as stated below. The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of assets transferred in exchange and liabilities undertaken. Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are initially recognised as assets and revenues at their fair value at the date of acquisition. 1.17 Property (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment Asset Recognition ThresholdPurchases of property, plant and equipment costing $2 000 or more are recognised initially at cost in theStatement of Financial Position. Purchases costing less than $2 000 are expensed in the year of acquisition(except where they form part of a project or group of similar items which are significant in total). Revaluations Land, buildings, infrastructure, plant and equipment are revalued progressively in accordance with the 'deprival'method of valuation in successive three-year cycles, so that no asset has a value greater than three years old. Freehold land, buildings on freehold land and leasehold improvements were independently valued during the 2000/2001 financial year. All plant and equipment, furniture and fittings and information technology assets on hand (not under operating leases), and any assets under finance leases, were independently valued during the 2000/2001financial year. All libraries and archives were independently valued during the 2000/2001 financial year. Assets in each class acquired after the commencement of a progressive revaluation cycle are not captured by the progressive revaluation then in progress. In accordance with the deprival methodology, land is measured at its current market buying price. Property other than land, plant and equipment are measured at their depreciated replacement cost. Where assets areheld which would not be replaced or are surplus to requirements, measurement is at net realisable value.At 30 June 2002, the Corporation and the economic entity had no assets in this situation. All valuations are independent or at director's valuations. Capital Works in Progress The cost of assets constructed or internally generated by the consolidated entity, other than goodwill, includethe cost of materials and direct labour. Directly attribute overheads and other incident costs are also capitalisedto the asset. Borrowing costs are capitalised to quantifying assets. In respect of internally contracted assets, depreciation to charge, from the time the asset is completed and held ready for use. Recoverable Amount Test Schedule 1 requires the application of the recoverable amount test to the Corporation's non-current assets inaccordance with AAS 10 Recoverable Amount of Non-Current Assets. The carrying amounts of these non- current assets have been reviewed to determine whether they are in excess of their recoverable amounts.

Depreciation and Amortisation Depreciable property, plant and equipment assets are written off to their estimated residual values over theirestimated useful lives to the Corporation using, in all cases, the straight line method of depreciation. Leaseholdimprovements are amortised on a straight line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of theimprovements or the unexpired period of the lease. Depreciation/amortisation rates (useful lives) and methods are reviewed at each balance date and necessary adjustments are recognised in the current, or current and future reporting periods, as appropriate. Residualvalues are re-estimated for a change in prices only when assets are revalued. Depreciation and amortisation rates applying to each class of depreciable asset are based on the following useful lives: 2002 2001 Buildings on freehold land 50 years 50 years Leasehold land, buildings and improvements Lease term Lease term Plant and equipment 6 - 15 years 6 - 15 years The aggregate amount of depreciation allocated for each class of asset during the reporting period is disclosed in note 6C. 1.18 Intangibles The carrying amount of each non-current intangible asset is reviewed to determine whether it is in excess of theasset's recoverable amount. If an excess exists as at the reporting date, the asset is written down to itsrecoverable amount immediately. In assessing recoverable amounts, the relevant cash flows, including theexpected cash inflows from future appropriations by the Parliament, have been discounted to their presentvalue. No write-down to recoverable amount has been made in 2001-2002.Software is stated at deemed cost from 1 July 2001 as required by Finance Minister's Orders. The cost has been deemed to be the amounts which assets carried at 30 June 2001, in compliance with AASB 1041. A director's valuation of the Bananas in Pyjamas intellectual property rights has been done on a discounted cash flow basis during the 2001-2002 financial year. Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their anticipated useful lives. Useful lives are: 2002 2001 Copyright 5 years 5 years Software 3 - 5 years 3 - 5 years The aggregate amount of amortisation allocated for intangible assets during the reporting period is disclosed in note 6C. 1.19 Inventories Inventories held for resale are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Inventories not held for resaleare valued at cost, unless they are no longer required, in which case they are valued at net realisable value.Television programs are produced for domestic transmission and include direct salaries and expenses. Fixedproduction overheads are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2002 (cont.) ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002PAGE 120 [FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ]1. Statement of Significant Accounting Policies (cont.) 1.19 Inventories (cont.) Produced Programs The cost of produced television program inventory is amortised as follows: News, Current Affairs and Live Programs - 100% on first screening. Children's, Education and Movies - Straight line over three years. All other programs not covered above - 90% first screening and 10% second screening or in third year. Programs not shown within three years of completion or purchase to be amortised 100% in year three. Alternative Amortisation Schedule - Management may determine an alternative amortisation schedule for exceptional programs in any of the above categories for which the stated policy is considered inappropriate. The costs of programs produced for news, current affairs and radio are expensed as incurred. Such programs are normally broadcast soon after production, stock on hand at any time being minimal. Purchased Programs Purchase program inventory is amortised in accordance with policy noted above or over the rights period ofthe contract (whichever is lesser). Subsequent sales of residual rights are recognised in the period in which they occur. Merchandise Inventory The provision for obsolete retail stock is based on stock on hand over twelve months old and which mayrequire discounting or disposal. Items in engineering and general stores which have not been issued for threeyears are provided for as obsolete. 1.20 Capital Usage Charge A capital usage charge of 11% (2000/2001 12%) is imposed by the Commonwealth on the net assets of the Corporation. The charge is adjusted to take account of asset gifts and revaluation increments during thefinancial year. 1.21 Leases A distinction is made between finance leases which effectively transfer from the lessor to the lesseesubstantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of leased non-current assets and operatingleases under which the lessor effectively retains substantially all such risks and benefits. Operating lease payments are expensed on a basis which is representative of the pattern of benefits derived from the leased assets. The net present value of future net outlays in respect of surplus space under non-cancellable lease agreements is expensed in the period in which the space becomes surplus. Lease incentives taking the form of 'free' leasehold improvements and rent holidays are recognised as liabilities. These liabilities are reduced by allocating lease payments between rental expense and reduction of the liability. 1.22 Appropriations From 1 July 1999, the Commonwealth Budget has been prepared under an accruals framework. Under thisframework, Parliament appropriates monies to the Corporation as revenue appropriations, as loanappropriations and as equity injections.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2002 (cont.)

Most grant agreements require the Corporation to perform services or provide facilities, or to meet eligibility criteria. A liability in respect of unearned revenues is recognised to the extent the services or facilities have notbeen provided or eligibility criteria have not been met. 1.24 Insurance The Corporation has insured for risk through the governments insurable risk managed fund called Comcover.Workers compensation is insured through Comcare. 1.25 Changes in Accounting Policy Changes in accounting policy have been identified in this note under their appropriate headings. 1.26 Comparative Figures Where applicable, prior year comparative figures have been restated to reflect the current year's presentation inthe financial statements.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2002 (cont.)

Financial Instruments (Consolidated) (cont.) B. Net Fair Values of Financial Assets and Liabilities The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the net fair values. Cash, receivables, payables and short term borrowings The carrying amount approximates the net fair value because of the short term maturity. Investments The carrying amount for non traded investments has been assessed by the directors based on the underlyingnet assets, expected cash flows and any particular special circumstances of the investee as approximating netfair values. Long term borrowings The net fair values of long term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based oncurrent interest rates for liabilities with similar risk profiles. Interest rate swaps and cross currency swap agreements The net fair values of unrecognised financial instruments reflect the estimated amounts the economic entityexpects to pay or receive to terminate the contracts (net of transaction costs) or to replace the contracts attheir current market rates as at reporting date. This is based on independent market quotations and usingstandard valuation techniques. Forward exchange contracts The net fair values of forward exchange contracts is taken to be the unrealised gain or loss at balance datecalculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.

Credit Risk Exposures Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognised if counterparties to financial instruments fail to perform as contracted. The economic entity has no significant exposures to any concentrations of credit risk. Financial Assets The economic entity's maximum exposures to credit risk at reporting date in relation to each class ofrecognised financial assets is the carrying amount, net of provision for doubtful debts, of those assets asindicated in the Statement of Financial Position.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2002 (cont.) ANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002PAGE 135 [FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ]16. Financial Instruments (Consolidated) (cont.) Items not recognised in the Statement of Financial Position The credit risk arising from dealings in financial instruments is controlled by a strict policy of credit approvals,limits and monitoring procedures. The economic entity has no material concentration of credit risk with anysingle counterparty and, as a matter of policy, only transacts with financial institutions that have a high creditrating. Credit exposure of foreign currency and interest rate derivatives is represented by the net fair value of thecontracts, as disclosed. D. Hedging Instruments Specific HedgesThe net unrecognised loss of $266 710 (2001 unrecognised gain $224 061) on specific hedges of anticipated foreign currency purchases will be recognised at the date of the underlying transactions. General Hedges At balance date, the Corporation held forward exchange contracts to buy United States Dollars (USD), GreatBritish Pounds (GBP) and the Euro (EUR).

Appendix 9 - Report on Particular MattersANNUAL REPORT 2001-2002PAGE 153 [APPENDICES ]ABC Policy Summary Occupational health and safety (OH&S) is the responsibility of allemployers; from the Board andExecutive Directors through to everyABC employee and manager as wellas contractors to all ABC Divisions.It extends to all visitors on all ABCsites Australia-wide. It requires theABC to manage its workplace riskseffectively and systematically. To operate effectively it requires accurate data and professionalinformation to guide choices toestablish safe sites and safe systemsof work. It also requires supervisionand adequate training. It must beand is supported by pro-activemanagement activity, ongoingaccountability, and the voluntarywork of elected Health and SafetyRepresentatives (HSRs) as well asstate-based Health and SafetyCommittees to monitor and drivepositive OH&S outcomes. A vital component is consultation with ABC employees. In addition tothe roles and structures above,consultation also occurs throughvarious enterprise agreements. Developments The primary aim of OH&S is theprevention of workplace injury anddisease. It must take into accountthe 10 primary elements of theSafetyMAP system that Comcare,the ABC's insurer and regulator,recently used to theCorporation's OH&S ManagementSystems in three Divisions in Qld, NSW and Victoria. The 10 elementsare: Building and Review Materials; Collecting and UsingData; and Developing Skills andCompetencies. The Human Resources Division is involved in a Risk and AssetManagement initiative to develop anon-line 'Incident Reporting System'and database. This will enable betterdata collection, analysis anddissemination to relevant parties. Thesystem will significantly contribute tothe creation of a safer workplaceand, over time, lower the cost ofworkers compensation and publicliability claims and premiums. A recent risk management assessment of new furniturepurchases for the combined Ultimosite has led to the purchase ofworkstations that exceed theAustralian Standard, i.e., heightadjustable. Good workstationfurniture, coupled with theergonomic workstation assessmentsprogram and a proposedergonomics awareness program isan active attempt to eliminateOccupational Overuse Syndrome(OOS) presently making up 69% ofthe ABC's workers compensationclaims costs. Various other initiatives completed in conjunction with other Divisionsinclude: Development of a nationalLegionella communicationprocedure, and the Promotion andapplication of the risk assessmentprocess to a variety of activitiescarried out by ABC staff, includingthose where the ABC physicallyinteracts with the public. In the unfortunate circumstances where injuries do occur, the ABC'sCompensation and RehabilitationManagement is seeking to: expediteaccess of employees to necessaryservices and support; promoteappropriate management of claims;promote early and durable Return toWork outcomes through theimplementation of rehabilitationprograms; collect and analyseincident data to identify trends withinthe workplace; control claims coststhrough the implementation of returnto work programs to reduce 'losttime'. Statistics 2001-02 There were 197 OH&S relatedincidents reported during the year.There were 99 accepted claims forworkers' compensation that had adate of injury falling into the 2001-02period. The total cost to date ofthese claims is approximately $212 701. During the yearapproximately 170 individualergonomic workstation assessmentswere conducted within NSW, VICand QLD.Appendix 11 - Occupational Health and SafetyExpenditure on market research and advertising forthe year 2001-02 was $7 551 850, an increase of$2 596 342 on the previous year.

Reviews 2001-02 The Independent Complaints Review Panel investigated two requests forreview on the same program as onecomplaint. The complaints were fromMr Mike Nahan, Executive DirectorIPA, Melbourne, and Mr Peter Priest ofSouth Australia and alleged bias on the Littlemore program of 9 April 2001 concerning the Institute of PublicAffairs (IPA). The ICRP upheld the complaint in part, finding five errors of fact in the programbut did not uphold the complaint ofserious unfairness. The Panel notedthat Littlemore was a program of comment and opinion in which StuartLittlemore's opinions were at the coreof the program's basis for existence. Ittherefore concluded the threshold of'serious unfairness' was not crossed inregard to a high proportion of theprogram's content. Appendix 17 - Independent Complaints Review Panel The Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI) gives the public the right toaccess documents held by the ABC.Schedule 2 Part 11 of the Act givesthe ABC an exemption in relation tomaterial which is program related. During the past year the ABC dealt with eight requests for access todocuments under the FOI Act. One request was granted in full and one in part. One was denied as thedocuments requested did not exist,and another did not proceed becauseno application fee was received. In two requests exemptions were claimed, one of these proceeded tointernal review in which exemptions claimed were upheld. One matterlapsed when no respondence wasreceived to notification of charges toretrieve documents. One request forreview by the Administrative AppealsTribunal was settled before beingheard by the Tribunal.
