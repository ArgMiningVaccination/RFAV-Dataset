{"title": "Rapamycin Augmentation of Chronic Ketamine as a Novel Treatment for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome", "author": "Ayush Sharma; Maral Tajerian; Jon Berner", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "This case report describes the dramatic clinical response of refractory chronic complex regional pain syndrome to combined immunomodulatory treatment. Ketamine and rapamycin markedly minimized pain historically associated with suicidal behavior, increased baseline activity, and allowed for a reduction in palliative polypharmacy. The piecewise mechanism of action is unclear given multiple postulated targets, such as microglia, astroglia, T-regulatory cells, B-regulatory cells, or neurons. Relevant laboratory and genetic information may allow the application of this treatment to other affected individuals.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-08-18", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
