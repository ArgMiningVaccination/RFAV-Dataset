Born in Israel, he moved to Los Angeles at the age of four. His degrees include a Bachelor of Arts degree with honors from UC Berkeley and a Doctorate in Medicine (M.D.) with honors from the University of Tel Aviv, Sackler School of Medicine. Dr. Roy completed a Pediatric Residency at the Schneider's Children Hospital in New York. Since residency he has worked as a Pediatric inpatient doctor, in a newborn nursery and neonatal intensive care unit, in several Pediatric emergency rooms including Rose Medical Center and North Suburban hospital in Colorado, and in a large pediatrics private practice in Denver. After 7-years of practicing Pediatrics in \"traditional\" Western Medical settings, Dr. Roy opened Mindful Pediatrics in 2006. He had been seeing 20 to 40 patients per day (for 5 to 10 minutes per visit) and realized that he couldn't incorporate his additional skills in nutrition, lifestyle, and natural medicine in that type of setting. He decided that he had two choices: to quit practicing medicine or to create his own practice where he could offer the quality of care that he believed patients deserved. For well over a decade now, he has been doing just that\u2014practicing evidence based Western Medicine with a holistic and mindful approach. Outside of medicine, Dr. Roy enjoys playing and building guitars, mountain biking, hiking, yoga, meditation and most of all, spending time with his family: his wife, Debbie, and children Layla, Leo, and Mia. It is his own nutritional, medical, spiritual, and emotional lifestyle choices that complement his Pediatric practice, and continue to influence his approach as a physician and parent. Debbie Steinbock HHC After years of being told that she had an \"incurable\" chronic health condition, Debbie turned to her diet to help her understand her disease, restore her body, and regain control of her health. Her own life experience motivated her to become a nutrition counselor and natural foods cooking instructor who now educates and inspires others. Debbie's passion is working with individuals with challenging and chronic health conditions. Having navigated that road, she understands the importance of being supported along the journey. Her own personal experience with [Crohn's Disease](https://mindfulfamilymedicine.com/conquering-crohns-disease/) and [Hashimoto's Thyroiditis](https://mindfulfamilymedicine.com/debbies-journey-with-thyroid-disease/) has given her the knowledge and compassion necessary to help her clients take an active role in their own healing process. Debbie has been in [private practice for 20-years](https://mindfulfamilymedicine.com/20-things-ive-learned-from-20-years-in-practice/) and has successfully helped hundreds of people across the country to improve their diet, enhance their current state of health, and eliminate a variety of health conditions. Debbie's approach to nutrition combines education, guidance, feedback, and support. She does not believe in a one-size-fits-all approach to diet and health. She believes in making gradual dietary and lifestyle changes that take into account each person's individuality\u2014health concerns, lifestyle, background, metabolism, cravings, and the foods that they enjoy eating. She helps her clients learn to listen to what their bodies are asking for, and how to respond appropriately. Debbie received a Bachelor of Arts degree with honors in psychology (December 1998) from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. She earned certification (May 2001) as a Holistic Health Counselor at the Institute for Integrative Nutrition in New York City.
