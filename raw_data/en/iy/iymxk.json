The most central concept in Chinese traditional medicine, Qi, is the central force that binds life itself. It is the universal energy that runs through us all. This flow of energy must be in balance to experience good health. The symptoms of various illnesses that manifest in us are the product of blocked or unbalanced Qi movement through the meridians in our bodies. Traditional Chinese medicine seeks to relieve these imbalances and restore good health to our bodies and our minds. A style of Eastern medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine includes the following practices: Acupuncture, Tuina Massage, Herbal & Dietary Therapies, Moxibustion, and Cupping amongst others. While in the West TCM has been more greatly accepted as an \"alternative medicine\", in China and eastern cultures, it is the standard system of medicine and has been for thousands of years. TCM focuses on how each person's body interacts with everything around us: time, weather, our environment, diet, and even emotional states. The key to optimum health is by achieving balance, and is also dependent on the flow Qi, or the \"life energy\", through meridians in our body. Traditional Chinese Medicine understands disease to stem from disrupted Qi or imbalances in the body. At your first visit to Brookfield Acupuncture Center, we will ask a series of questions in order to paint a global picture of your health. Asking questions about pain, sleep habits, thirst levels, appetite, digestion, sensations, amongst other things, will allow us to identify imbalances or disruptions in Qi in your body. Your physical appearance and nature will also be looked at. Things like taking your pulse, analyzing your complexion, and studying your tongue, will allow us to develop a comprehensive \u2014 and unique \u2014 treatment plan to better balance your body and support the flow of Qi. This treatment plan can involve acupuncture, cupping, herbal or dietary suggestions, or a combination of treatment types. "}
