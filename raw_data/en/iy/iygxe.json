If not, maybe you're craft-curious. Crafting can be a frustrating and mysterious skill that takes a lot of dedication and practice. But maybe...you can get a little mystical something-something to help you along. I don't see my crafting crystals and herbs as a shortcut, they're crafting aids that help me stay focused and do my best! If you're at all interested in a little magical pick-me-up for your creative needs, try some of the crystals and herbs below! Herbs For Crafting Lavender Lavender is one of my go-to herbs when I'm crafting. The light and soothing scent is used all across the world in soaps, oils, and candles to help promote rest and relaxation.

This crystal also helps you focus and stimulates your mind. It can also help encourage open and honest communication, which all crafters need to have with themselves when they're working on their art. Citrine Glowing like a little sun, citrine is known as a stone of abundance and clarity. It can also help elevate your feelings of self-esteem and self-worth. Let's be honest, all artists hit a low sometimes and citrine will help give you the clarity and strength to get back up to create! Labradorite My favorite crystal of all time, labradorite is known as the stone of transformation. This stone helps calm the overactive mind, relieves stress, and promotes confidence within yourself! There have been tons of times where I'm in the middle of a project and I can feel my confidence hit rock bottom. That's when it's nice to push through and have a little bit of "}
